Full text: The announcement that President Trump's top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, plans to resign after apparently losing a battle over raising tariffs ratchets up concern that the White House is turning sharply toward protectionism. The deepest fear is that the planned steel and aluminum tariffs will echo the mistake of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which provoked a global trade war and helped fuel the Great Depression.
The alarmists are getting a bit ahead of the story, however. Periods of deglobalization -- when nations begin shuttering their borders to flows of trade, money and people -- tended to be slow processes, not sudden events. They started with tectonic shifts -- global wars and crises -- not minor import levies. And they unfolded over decades, not years. The last era of deglobalization actually began when countries turned inward after World War I, more than a decade before Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression.
It is important to view Mr. Trump's latest trade actions in that historical context. The suggested higher tariffs on steel and aluminum are too narrowly targeted to trigger a trade war but represent another chapter in the evolving era of deglobalization.
This era began long before Mr. Trump took office, but he is now capitalizing on the popular backlash against globalization. The mood turned decisively after the Great Recession of 2008. Trade collapsed as a share of the world economy, and despite some pickup in the past two years, trade has yet to recover to its pre-crisis level. One big reason: the barriers that countries like India and Russia have been raising to block the flow of trade, money and people at their borders.
In every year since 2010, the leading economies have instituted more discriminatory trade measures than liberalizing ones, according to data from Global Trade Alert. The difference with Mr. Trump is that he is reviving the old-school and easily detected weapon of the tariff. Many other countries have been using a wide array of non-tariff barriers. Some are stealthy, like hidden subsidies for export industries. Others are blatant, like barring foreign competitors outright.
Though the world is now a decade into this age of deglobalization -- with flows of money and migrants also running well below the peaks reached before 2008 -- it's an exaggeration to compare Trump's tariffs to a tipping point like Smoot-Hawley.
Steel and aluminum represent only 2 percent of United States imports, and so far Mr. Trump's proposal bears less resemblance to the sweeping Smoot-Hawley tariffs than to the more narrowly targeted Fordney-McCumber tariffs that preceded it.
In the early 1920s, European farms were recovering from World War I and emerging as a competitive threat to American farmers, who began lobbying for protection. Fordney-McCumber began as an attempt to answer the farmer's demands, but once tariff rates were opened up for discussion, other industries like pharmaceuticals demanded and received protection as well. We are at a similar point now: The deglobalization process is underway, in which pressure from other industries, voters and politicians to enact additional tariffs may grow.
The outcry for higher tariffs could really intensify if the economy takes a serious turn for the worse, as it did after the stock market crash of 1929. Then, factories shut down and unemployment spiked. That led to the passage of Smoot-Hawley, which triggered a sharp reaction from foreign governments. Global trade slowed sharply and did not fully recover until the 1970s.
Today, however, the world economy looks much more like it did in the 1920s than in the depressed '30s. Unemployment and inflation are low, growth is reasonably strong, inequality is back to levels last hit in the 1920s, and the mood is shifting against globalization. Still, the clamor for protection could grow significantly in intensity.
The obvious concern: If Mr. Trump is pushing tariffs during good times, just imagine what he might do if the times turn bad. That's when governments normally become even more protectionist, and this administration is already moving in that direction. The decision by Mr. Cohn, the head the National Economic Council and a staunch defender of free trade, to leave the administration is clear evidence of the trend.
The next chapter in this period of deglobalization may revolve around how Mr. Trump deals with China. If the world's two largest economies fall into a spiral of tit-for-tat retaliation, the global trend toward trade protection could pick up pace. China is a minor supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States but a major supplier of much else.
In the global financial markets, many observers are thus less concerned about the steel tariffs than about the Section 301 investigation launched by the Trump administration against China, which goes well beyond earlier investigations into illegal subsidies for export manufacturers and other stealth trade protection. Instead, the 301 investigation -- named after the section of the Trade Act of 1974 that gives the president great leeway to address trade issues -- is a broad look at Chinese practices such as investing in American companies to steal technology, penetrating American data networks and lifting technology from American companies that invest in China.
In short, the current controversy over steel and aluminum tariffs involves old industries that are shrinking as a share of the global economy and affect about 2 percent of global trade. Even if Mr. Trump's suggested new tariffs provoke Chinese retaliation in these industries, it would have a manageable impact. A broader trade conflict involving newer sectors such as technology, or that leads to restrictions on foreign investment, could be much more damaging.
Of course, this is not the first time in the postwar era that an American president has resorted to trade protectionism. Richard Nixon fought his 1968 election campaign on a mercantilist platform. Both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush imposed trade tariffs. The difference then was that America exercised more dominance over the global economy and had greater reason to believe it could squeeze concessions from trading partners. Rising powers such as China are not likely to be as compliant now, and even allies in Europe seem to feel less obliged to placate America.
Regardless of how far Mr. Trump goes in pressing tariffs against both rivals and allies, it is important to remember that this is not the beginning of the story, or the end. We are somewhere in the middle. The seeds of discontent against globalization were sown following a period of intensive trade and migration that culminated in the financial crisis of 2008. The age of deglobalization is now a worldwide phenomenon that is larger than Mr. Trump. It was coming whether he won election or not. And it is unlikely to end until long after he is gone.

Full text: U.S. stocks meandered but finished mostly higher Tuesday as retailers and industrial companies rose. A jump in metals prices helped mining and materials companies. Asian markets jumped after the North Korean government said it was open to talks with the U.S. about ending its nuclear program.
Stocks have edged higher over the last three days, but they've frequently bounced up and down as investors grappled with the Trump administration's stance on trade and whether the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will push inflation higher in the U.S. and lead to retaliation by other countries that would hurt economic growth and corporate profits.
Kristina Hooper, chief global markets strategist for Invesco, said Wall Street is having trouble deciding if the tariffs are more of a bargaining chip in trade negotiations, as President Donald Trump has suggested at times in the last few days, or if they are a goal on their own.
"When it seemed as though it was just rhetoric (Monday), markets relaxed," she said. "Today, I think concerns have grown that maybe this isn't just a bargaining tactic." She said Republicans in Congress don't seem to be treating the tariffs as a bargaining move: House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke up against the proposed tariffs Tuesday and called for a "more surgical approach" that might cause less backlash.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 7.18 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,728.12. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 9.36 points to 24,884.12. It rose as much as 120 points early on and later fell as much as 166 points before recovering. The Nasdaq composite jumped 41.30 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,372.01. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks climbed 16.16 points, or 1 percent, to 1,562.20.
Stocks fell 3.7 percent during a three-day losing streak last week after Trump announced his tariff plans. Other countries objected and the European Union announced plans to put tariffs on some U.S.-made goods including bourbon and motorcycles. Companies that make most of their sales overseas have fared the worst while U.S.-focused companies have regained their losses from that three-day stretch.
Asian markets climbed after North Korea said it is willing to start talks with the U.S. on denuclearization. It also said it would stop nuclear and missile tests during those discussions. The Kospi in Seoul jumped 1.5 percent while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 1.8 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 2.1 percent.
While retailers including Amazon, Best Buy and Lowe's gained ground, Target lost $3.35, or 4.5 percent, to $71.79 after it reported that costs associated with overhauling its stores and investing in its website affected its earnings and forecasts for the current year. Target also said it is raising minimum starting pay for workers for the second time in less than a year.
Qualcomm fell and Broadcom rose after Bloomberg News reported that Broadcom is on track to get more leverage in its effort to buy Qualcomm, which wants Broadcom to make a richer offer. Bloomberg reported that so far, directors backed by Broadcom are on pace to win six seats on Qualcomm's board. Qualcomm's current board opposes Broadcom's $117 billion bid for the company and says the price is too low, while a board supported by Broadcom would likely accept the offer instead.
Qualcomm gave up $1.87, or 2.9 percent, to $62.14 and Broadcom added $3.98, or 1.6 percent, to $250.96. Both stocks fell Monday after The Committee for Foreign Investment in the U.S. said it will look into the deal.
After an early loss, Nordstrom rose 59 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $52.49 after the department store rejected an offer from the Nordstrom family to take it private, saying the price of $50 a share was too low. The family group includes co-presidents Blake, Peter and Erik Nordstrom. They and other family members own 30 percent of Nordstrom's stock.
Metals prices ended higher, boosting mining stocks. Gold rose $15.30, or 1.2 percent, to $1,335.20 an ounce. Silver climbed 37 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $16.78 an ounce. Copper added 3 cents to $3.16 a pound. Gold and copper mining company Freeport-McMoRan rose 51 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $18.70.
Benchmark U.S. crude added 3 cents to $62.60 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 25 cents to $65.79 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.93 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.90 a gallon. Natural gas gained 5 cents to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.87 percent from 2.88 percent.
Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent and London's FTSE 100 gained 0.4 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.1 percent.
The dollar inched up to 106.21 yen from 106.20 yen. The euro rose to $1.2405 from $1.2327.

Full text: Stocks shook off morning losses on Monday and surged in the afternoon to send the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its best day in a week. It is the latest turn for a market suddenly prone to quick shifts not only day to day but also hour to hour, as investors question whether President Donald Trump will really risk a trade war.
The S.&P. 500 lost as much as 0.6 percent shortly after trading began, only to finish the day 1.1 percent higher after rising 29.69 points to 2,720.94. It's reminiscent of what happened Friday, when stocks reversed course on speculation that Trump was only making an opening bid when he promised to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, rather than a final offer.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 336.70, or 1.4 percent, to 24,874.76, and the Nasdaq composite gained 72.84, or 1 percent, to 7,330.70. Both came back from early-morning losses.
Trump took to Twitter again on Monday to defend the tariffs, which have riled trading partners around the world and already sparked talk of retaliation.
Later in the day, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that he is "extremely worried" about the consequences of a global trade war and urged the White House "to not advance with this plan," according to a statement issued by his office.
"It's incredibly difficult to try to understand the whims of this current administration and to try to make forecasts," said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research for John Hancock Investments.
"But right now, we think the impact should continue to be modest, as long as it's all talk and no action," she said.
Boeing offered a good example of how quickly the market shifted. The aerospace giant got the majority of its revenue from outside the United States last year, so it would be hurt if countries put up more barriers to global trade. Boeing was down as much as 2.3 percent in the morning before ending the day up 2.3 percent.
From its low point of the day to its high, the S.&P. 500 carried investors through a swing of 1.9 percentage points. It is the fifth straight day with a gap of more than 1.5 percentage points, as trading has become much more wild since the market's placid, record-setting run from 2017 into January. During that period, the typical day saw the S.&P. 500 drift just 0.5 percentage points from its low point to high.
The biggest gain in the S.&P. 500 came from XL Group, which surged after AXA said that it will acquire the insurance and reinsurance company for $15.3 billion. Investors will get $57.60 per XL Group share, and XL Group stock surged $12.62, or 29.1 percent, to $55.92.
Besides tariffs, investors are also keying in on the upcoming jobs report that's looming at the end of the week.
It was last month's jobs report that raised the specter of higher inflation and jolted the stock market from its peaceful rise.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.88 percent on Monday from 2.87 percent late Friday.
In the commodities markets, benchmark Unitd States crude rose $1.32 to settle at $62.57 per barrel.
Gold fell $3.00 to settle at $1,318.10 per ounce.
The dollar rose to 106.20 Japanese yen from 105.54 yen late Friday. The euro dipped to $1.2338 from $1.2329, and the British pound climbed to $1.3833 from $1.3790.

Full text: The New York Times and ProPublica, the independent, nonprofit investigative journalism organization, collaborated on this article.
The burden of high drug costs weighs most heavily on the sickest Americans.
Drug makers have raised prices on treatments for life-threatening or chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis, diabetes and cancer. In turn, insurers have shifted more of those costs onto consumers. Saddled with high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that expose them to a drug's rising list price, many people are paying thousands of dollars a month merely to survive.
For more than a year, President Trump and Democrats in Congress have promised to take action on high drug prices, but despite a flurry of proposals, little has changed.
These are the stories of Americans living daily with the reality of high-cost drugs. And there are millions of others just like them.
Skipping drugs she can't afford
Saundra Johnson, 57, Minneapolis
With an annual income of less than $20,000, Ms. Johnson doesn't come close to being able to afford the 12 medications her doctors have prescribed for congestive heart failure, diabetes and related complications.
She is one of the many who finds herself "in between," as one of her doctors described it, narrowly missing the requirements for assistance but making too little to afford her prescriptions.
Here's a rundown of the math: Ms. Johnson's Social Security disability income of $19,560 in 2017 placed her above the cutoff for receiving additional government assistance for her prescriptions, called Extra Help, even though nearly every dollar of her income is already spoken for, from paying Medicare premiums to food and other household expenses.
Medicare rules prohibit her from using drug co-pay coupons, which are commonly used by those with private insurance. And Novo Nordisk, the company that sells her fast-acting insulin, Novolog, and her diabetes medication, Victoza, requires low-income Medicare beneficiaries to first spend $1,000 on drugs in each calendar year before they can qualify for free drugs through its program. In a cruel twist, Ms. Johnson doesn't have that $1,000 to spend, so she resorts to not taking some drugs for months until she reaches the company's threshold.
These are tough choices. Sometimes she stops taking the short-acting Novolog, staying on the longer-acting insulin, Tresiba, as well as her heart medications, like bumetanide and digoxin. "I prioritize the heart stuff over the insulin because the heart stuff is more immediate," she said.
Ms. Johnson understands the risks; she was a health educator for people with H.I.V. and AIDS, helping patients enroll in programs that lowered their drug costs.
Her blood sugar has risen dangerously high, and a little over a year ago, she was hospitalized for three weeks because she said she wasn't on the right diuretic to reduce excess fluid.
Last June, she was approved for the Novo Nordisk assistance program, allowing her to begin taking the Novolog insulin again. As of mid-November, Ms. Johnson had spent $2,782 on prescription drugs, not counting the cost of the free insulin, according to a report provided by her pharmacy.
For another drug, Entresto, an expensive treatment for heart failure, Ms. Johnson participates in a clinical trial that provides the drug for free. Once that ends, she faces another hurdle: "There's going to be a discount or I'm not going to be on Entresto anymore."
In January, she started all over again. "I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I'm sure a lot of other people are as well."
THE BACKGROUND:
Medicare's prescription drug program, known as Part D, has been a lifeline for seniors and disabled people. Those with the lowest incomes can qualify for federally subsidized Extra Help to reduce their costs. But to be eligible, an individual must earn less than $18,210 and a married couple living together cannot earn more than $24,690.
In a statement, Novo Nordisk said it provided some forms of insulin at reduced costs to help patients who are struggling. "This patient is an exceptional example, reminding us that we need to continuously evaluate how we keep our support programs sustainable while covering as many of those in need as possible."
'We always seem to fall through the cracks'
Abigail Bostwick, 37, of Tomahawk, Wis.
Ms. Bostwick was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2013. Insurance covered the first drug she took, Tecfidera, but required her to contribute $1,000 a month.
"I didn't cry when I was handed the diagnosis of M.S.," Ms. Bostwick said. But after learning how much prescriptions would cost, "That was when I felt truly helpless."
Ms. Bostwick, a former journalist, has coverage through her husband's employer because she can no longer work. They hit their $4,500 annual deductible in the very first month of every year because Gilenya, the drug she had been taking until last fall, carried a list price of about $5,500 a month. The couple put aside $375 every month to make sure they could cover that deductible.
The Bostwicks, who recently decided to divorce, have drained their savings, given up family vacations, and sold a motorcycle, a car, furniture and other belongings. Changes to her husband's employee benefits this year means another $1,000 out of pocket annually. Ms. Bostwick, who is disabled, said she plans to sign up for Medicare coverage after she loses access to her husband's insurance.
Ms. Bostwick suffered severe side effects that led her to stop taking Gilenya, and she's recently been approved to begin a new drug, Ocrevus.
"This is such a huge bill and it's not really something that we can forgo," she said. "We're your basic middle-class couple. We don't have an extravagant lifestyle or anything like that. But we always seem to fall through the cracks."
THE BACKGROUND:
The prices of several multiple sclerosis drugs have shot up in recent years. The cost of Gilenya, the drug that Ms. Bostwick took, has nearly doubled to almost $92,000 a year since Novartis got approval for it in 2010.
In a statement, Novartis pointed to its patient assistance program that eliminates monthly out-of-pocket costs for most commercially insured patients (Ms. Bostwick said her family income is too high to qualify for most assistance programs).
There are also signs that companies may be getting the message. Ocrevus, the drug Ms. Bostwick will soon begin taking, was approved in 2017 and Genentech, its manufacturer, announced it would price the new drug at 25 percent below the list price of Rebif, the older drug that it beat in clinical trials.
A shell game of debt
Matthew Botts, 34, Oakland, Calif.
In 2007, Mr. Botts was 24 and three weeks into his first year at the University of San Francisco School of Law when he was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a blood cancer. His doctor prescribed Gleevec, an effective but expensive medication that until recently cost more than $140,000 per year. The price recently began to go down in the face of generic competition.
Mr. Botts had no money to spare. For the first months of his treatment, he was able to take another patient's unused medications that were no longer needed (she was dying and his oncologist had connected them). Then, after receiving coverage through a former employer, Mr. Botts moved up his wedding date so he could switch to his wife's policy. But between his deductible and out-of-pocket costs, his expenses added up. Mr. Botts applied for assistance through a program run by Gleevec's maker, Novartis, but said he was rejected because his wife made slightly too much.
Without options, Mr. Botts tapped into his law school loans. "At 24, when you're really not making any money, you don't really have any options other than that," he said.
Mr. Botts dropped out of law school. "When everyone else is 24, 25 and going out and partying," he was worried about ensuring he had money "so I could make sure I paid for my chemotherapy meds and still go to class."
Today, he owes more than $73,000. He works at a debt collection company in the Bay Area, managing corporate relationships for banks. The irony is not lost on him. "We have a huge pile of medical debt that resulted from all of this. It just hasn't been paid," he said. "I will be paying those up until the day I die."
THE BACKGROUND:
There's no dispute that Gleevec is a breakthrough cancer drug. It is also a very expensive one whose cost has increased sharply over the years. When it was launched in 2001, Gleevec cost $26,000 a year. That price increased significantly, to about $146,000 in 2016, before the drug lost its patent protection and began facing generic competition. The drug's price has been falling since then, though not as quickly as some hoped.
In a statement, Novartis, the maker of Gleevec, said it was not familiar with Mr. Botts' situation, but that it "offers one of the most significant patient assistance programs (PAPs) in the industry." The company suggests that patients contact its assistance program, Patient Assistance Now Oncology.
Overall, cancer drug prices are increasing at a rate much faster than inflation.
Stockpiling insulin
Amanda Walker, 34, of Memphis, Tenn.
Diabetes has driven nearly all of Ms. Walker's adult life.
Ms. Walker, who was diagnosed with diabetes at age 9, dropped out of college, forgoing her aspirations to be an artist, in part because she needed health insurance. She sought out retail jobs with coverage, selling suits at Men's Warehouse and Jos. A. Bank. She got an insulin pump, helping keep her stable. Even then, she struggled to pay her out-of-pocket costs, spending $300 a month for insulin and other supplies.
Last fall, she became unemployed after taking a new job that didn't work out. Without coverage, Ms. Walker stockpiled empty vials of insulin in her refrigerator, using a syringe to suck out whatever drops were left. She once turned to Facebook, pleading for help, and within 45 minutes a nearby resident offered her two insulin pens.
By December, Ms. Walker obtained subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. She pays a premium of $3.95 a month and $25 a month for insulin.
But even though her health coverage is more secure, she still worries that she could wind up rationing her insulin again if the health care law were repealed.
"I think in an alternate universe, there's a me that's not diabetic," she said. "And I wonder what she's doing. What life is she living? I'm stuck."
THE BACKGROUND:
In the United States, three manufacturers dominate the insulin market -- Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi -- and a recent study found that prices nearly tripled from 2002 to 2013.
The drug makers have been accused of price-fixing in several patient lawsuits, and several states are investigating.
In response, the companies have rolled out programs, such as one through CVS Health, that reduce costs for the uninsured or those with high-deductible coverage.
Despite the uproar, all three manufacturers raised their list prices again in 2017, according to the Gold Standard Drug Database from Elsevier, an information analytics company.
A common childhood ailment carries a big price tag
Aviva Williams, 42, Los Angeles
Last year, Ms. Williams's four-year-old daughter, Amy, began complaining about an itchy bottom -- a classic sign, her doctor later informed her, of pinworms. Ms. Williams gave Amy an over-the-counter medicine and her daughter's symptoms seemed to improve.
When the pinworms returned a while later, the doctor prescribed albendazole, a prescription treatment that has been around for decades. Ms. Williams thought little of it, until she checked the price with her pharmacist. The drug cost $724 for a four-tablet treatment, and according to her drug plan, she had to pay about $250. Because her doctor recommended that all four family members be treated, she was suddenly facing a $1,000 bill.
To save money, Ms. Williams decided to fill prescriptions for her daughter and herself, but to buy the over-the-counter treatment for her husband and younger daughter, who did not have symptoms.
A few weeks later, Ms. Williams found pinworms in her younger daughter's diaper, and had to pay $250 for another round of albendazole.
She said she is furious that she was forced to pay $750 for an old drug. "They price it because they can," said Ms. Williams said. "Wall Street decided they could make money off prescription drugs, which is just scary and depressing."
THE BACKGROUND:
Although albendazole lost its patent protection years ago, just one company, Impax Laboratories, sells the drug. Its high price dates to 2010, when a company called Amedra Pharmaceuticals -- later acquired by Impax -- bought the right to sell it from GlaxoSmithKline, and raised the price to about $120 a pill from roughly $6.
A spokesman for Impax Laboratories declined to say why Amedra raised the price.
Ms. Williams saved her bottle of albendazole as a bitter reminder of how she once had to pay hundreds of dollars for a handful of pills. The other day she noticed a detail she had not seen before: Impax does not even make the drug. It is still manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.
Two battlefields: the illness and the bills
Carter Knutson, 68, Bloomington, Ill.
At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., Mr. Knutson had begun a two-pronged treatment aimed at attacking a large tumor threatening his pulmonary artery. As chemotherapy dripped into his bloodstream, he learned that his insurance company wouldn't cover the second phase, a pill called Xeloda that he could take at home.
Doctors at Mayo wrote to the Knutsons' prescription benefits manager, CVS Caremark, to explain that Mr. Knutson's kidney disease made him a bad candidate for the usual treatment, with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin.
After a denial and failing two appeals, Mr. Knutson, a retired farm equipment salesman, and his wife Julie, decided to pay for the drug themselves. "We felt like we didn't have a choice," Mrs. Knutson said. After using a coupon they found online, the pill cost $1,000 per prescription. After three courses of the drug, Mr. Knutson's tumor shrank enough to enable surgery. He is now in remission.
After the operation, the Knutsons appealed again -- this time through the state's insurance commissioner. Within 24 hours, the reviewer ordered CVS to cover the pills.
The Knutsons received a check in July 2016 for $2,790.81; they turned around and donated $3,000 to the Mayo Clinic.
The fighting took its toll, Mr. Knutson said. "When you are in that situation, you are really fragile, not as capable as you are when you are healthy in an everyday situation," he said. "It's like they're trying to make it so difficult that you just give up."
THE BACKGROUND:
Mr. Knutson's situation is a good reminder that even if your insurer rejects a treatment or drug, you have the right to appeal -- often more than once. He only won when he appealed to an outside reviewer through the Illinois insurance department, an external process required by the Affordable Care Act.
While CVS Caremark said in a statement that it respected the care provided by the Mayo Clinic's oncologists, it added: "This case illustrates that medical experts can disagree on whether experimental therapy may work for a patient, and we certainly hope it has for Mr. Knutson."
A father crosses the border for his son
Jonathan Yeagley, 61, Berwyn, Pa.
Every three months, Mr. Yeagley, a stock trader, hops into his car and drives seven hours -- 390 miles -- from his home outside Philadelphia to a Walmart half a mile across the Canadian border. There, he buys Xeljanz to treat his son Jonathan's alopecia areata, a type of hair loss caused by an immune disorder. He drives back the same day.
In 2016, Independence Blue Cross, Mr. Yeagley's insurer at the time, rejected coverage of the drug because Xeljanz is approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, not alopecia. Mr. Yeagley appealed and lost his case; an outside reviewer wrote that there's not enough evidence that the drug is effective against alopecia. In 2017, Mr. Yeagley switched to another insurer that does not cover prescription drugs.
There are no approved drug treatments for the condition, and Mr. Yeagley's son's doctor at Yale University, Brett King, has found Xeljanz effective at regrowing hair for some patients. (Dr. King is a consultant for the drug's maker, Pfizer.) Once a year, Mr. Yeagley uses a coupon from Pfizer that covers about three months of the drug, but for the rest of the year he is on his own.
In the United States, Xeljanz costs about $50,000 a year (through a drug discount website). That's after Pfizer raised the price of Xeljanz by nearly 8 percent in January. In Canada, the price tag is $15,000.
"I don't have that kind of money to throw away," said Mr. Yeagley, who has made five trips so far. Mr. Yeagley's son spoke on FaceTime with a Canadian doctor who asked for pictures and reviewed laboratory results before writing a prescription so the Yeagleys could legally obtain the drug in Canada.
Jonathan, who is 20, worries about shouldering the costs in the future. "I don't tell him that I think about it a lot but I do think about it a lot," he said. "I'm so grateful for what he does for me but I don't know how long it can go on."
THE BACKGROUND:
Drug prices are cheaper in Canada, where an independent quasi-judicial body is supposed to ensure that pharmaceutical companies do not charge excessive prices.
In another twist, the price of Xeljanz has come under scrutiny because it was developed in part based on research by the National Institutes of Health, a federal agency. Some consumer groups and lawmakers have questioned whether drugs developed with taxpayer money should carry lower price tags.
In a statement, Pfizer said it is studying medications to treat alopecia. It has said it spent more than a $1 billion on "the discovery, development and commercialization of Xeljanz."

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
ECONOMY
The current round of Nafta talks concludes.
A seventh round of talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement are scheduled to wrap up on Monday in Mexico City. Negotiators from the United States, Canada and Mexico have made headway on some of the less controversial parts of the pact, such as regulatory practices. But they remain divided on more difficult issues, including rules for the auto industry. Given that impasse, the talks appear likely to drag on. The countries have discussed reconvening in early April in Washington D.C., meaning they probably will not reach a deal before March 31, as they previously discussed. Ana Swanson
MARKETS
Stocks were down on proposed tariffs. What's next?
Anxieties in the stock market re-emerged last week, after President Trump's promise on Thursday that he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But at the same time, the slip in the stock market boosted prices for safe bonds, keeping a lid on yields. Those rising yields had spooked the stock market in early February, when data showed wages rising at a faster-than-expected pace. Another jobs report is coming out this week, and it may show whether those wage pressures continued to build in February. That could reignite fears of inflation and a quickening pace of rate increases by the Federal Reserve, providing another reason for stocks to fall. Matt Phillips
OIL INDUSTRY
Two big oil companies go on trial in Italy.
On Monday, two of the world's largest oil companies, Royal Dutch Shell and Eni of Italy, are expected to go on trial in Milan on corruption charges over a $1.3 billion oil deal in Nigeria. The defendants include current and former oil executives, among them Claudio Descalzi, Eni's chief executive. The case stems from a long-running investigation by Italian prosecutors into a payment the companies made to the Nigerian government in 2011 to settle a legal dispute over a potentially lucrative tract in the Atlantic Ocean known as OPL 245. Both companies deny wrongdoing, but having such senior or former top executives facing trial is unusual. The trial is expected to take months. Stanley Reed
GOVERNMENT
China's National People's Congress holds session.
China's National People's Congress, the country's legislature, will begin meeting on Monday for its annual session to review and approve a long list of government initiatives. Premier Li Keqiang, the country's second-highest official after President Xi Jinping, is expected to open the gathering by giving his annual work report. The meeting is expected to last at least through March 15 and possibly longer.
Economists expect that Mr. Li will call for continued economic growth of about 6.5 percent. Considerable uncertainty surrounds when and how the government may restructure financial regulation, and the latest hints have been that the issue may be delayed.
Under President Xi, who has been in office for five years and has consolidated enormous personal power, the nearly 3,000 members of the body have become increasingly cautious about expressing their own views. Keith Bradsher
OIL INDUSTRY
A gathering of global energy figures is held in Houston.
Global energy ministers and energy company chief executives will gather in Houston all week at IHS Markit's annual Ceraweek conference to take the pulse of an industry that has hit rocky times of low oil and gas prices in recent years. Subjects will range from the future of liquefied natural gas to the economics of renewable energy and coal. Many industry leaders are expected to meet behind closed doors to negotiate deals around the world. Clifford Krauss
ECONOMY
European Central Bank will announce monetary policy.
The European Central Bank will release its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday, to be followed by a news conference by Mario Draghi, the central bank's president. The bank's Governing Council is widely expected to keep its key interest rate steady at zero percent, where it has been since March 2016.
Inflation in the eurozone declined to 1.2 percent in February, from 1.3 percent in January, according to the latest data from Eurostat, the European Union's official statistics bureau. That is the lowest level in more than a year. But the European Central Bank is expected to remain cautious about whether it would extend a bond-buying program, known as "quantitative easing," beyond September. The bank has indicated it would extend the program if necessary and could update its guidance for the future as soon as next week. Chad Bray
February's jobs report is expected to be strong.
On Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department is scheduled to release its report on the nation's hiring and unemployment for February. Wall Street analysts are looking for another strong month of growth with payrolls expanding by 200,000. After sitting on the 4.1 percent line for four months, the unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 4 percent, a level last reached in 2000. The consensus forecast estimates the average hourly wage will climb by 0.2 percent, which would knock down the annual year-over-year increase to 2.8 percent from 2.9 percent in January. The combination of a low jobless rate and low inflation prompted the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, Jerome H. Powell, to tell Congress last week that the Fed's approach to raising interest rates would continue to be "gradual." The first increase is expected to come at the central bank's March policy meeting.

Full text: A FIVE-BEDROOM HOUSE ON THE BRAZILIAN COAST
$554,000 (1.8 MILLION BRAZILIAN REAL)
This five-bedroom house is a short walk from a white-sand beach on the northeastern coast of Brazil, about 30 miles from the popular tourist destination of Natal. Built in 2006, it is part of a small gated development of 16 homes called Quintas do Coqueiral.
The 4,300-square-foot house sits on about 1.2 acres covered in palm trees and grass. Visitors enter through two large wood doors, framed by pillars. The double-height foyer opens to a living room and covered patio. There is a pool and Jacuzzi in the back yard, with a wooden deck.
The floors on the ground level are white marble concrete, a form of concrete with sand and marble grains mixed in, said Mike Smith, owner of Brazil Beach House, the company marketing the property. The doors and windows are trimmed in Brazilian hardwood, and the exposed beams and pillars are eucalyptus, Mr. Smith said.
From the foyer, stairs lead to a mezzanine level currently being used as an office. There is an open-air deck off the mezzanine.
All the bedrooms are on the ground floor. In one wing, there are two large bedrooms, each with a walk-in closet; the master has sliding glass doors that open to the pool deck. Two smaller bedrooms are in the other wing. All the bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms with marble counters.
A dining room, television room and another bathroom are also on the ground floor. The kitchen is off the dining room, overlooking the pool area, and has two refrigerators, an electric drinking fountain and a six-burner stove.
The maid's quarters, adjacent to the kitchen, include a bedroom, a bathroom and a small attached garage, large enough for a single car. There is also a detached two-car garage on the property.
The furniture is not included in the asking price, but is available for an additional 100,000 Brazilian real (or about $31,000), Mr. Smith said.
The property is about a half mile from the village of Maracajaú, a popular spot for diving. Natal, about a 45-minute drive from the house, is the capital of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, with a population of about 850,000. The closest airport is the Governador Aluízio Alves International Airport in São Gonçalo do Amarante, about 25 miles away, but most international flights are routed through Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo.
MARKET OVERVIEW
Brazil is coming out of a lengthy recession following years of political turmoil. Home prices fell 3.23 percent in 2017 and 5.38 percent in 2016, when inflation is factored in, according to the FipeZap Index, which tracks sales in 20 Brazilian cities.
In recent years, "supply exceeded demand considerably," said Andreas Hahn, a senior partner with Hahn Consulting, in São Paulo. But lower prices and an improving economy are bringing buyers back to the market, he said. And Brazil's economy is expected to grow 1.9 percent in 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund.
"For the first time in several years, the Brazilian real estate economy is returning to an equilibrium state," with supply and demand in better balance, Mr. Hahn said.
Sales in the middle-price range were hardest hit by the downturn, said Marcello Romero, chief executive of Bossa Nova Sotheby's International Realty, in São Paulo. The lower end of the market was boosted by government subsidies, he added, while the high end was less affected.
In São Paulo, where he is based, the volume of sales was up 46.1 percent in 2017 compared with a year earlier, according to data from Secovi, a property industry association.
"We think that the worst moment is over," Mr. Romero said. "Especially in the major cities, most of the developers are preparing their launches soon."
Although there is no official data available on sales in the Natal area, agents said prices have fallen between 10 and 20 percent in the last three years.
"The northeast is more of a holiday marketplace," said Steve Gallagher, owner of Brazil Overseas Property, and was therefore more vulnerable when the economy slowed. "Political uncertainty," he said, also plays a major role in the market, as potential buyers await the results of the presidential elections later this year.
"I expect confidence to grow within the market at the beginning of 2019," Mr. Gallagher said. "And we should see property prices increasing steadily from then on."
There are already signs the market is picking up, Mr. Smith said. "The last quarter of 2017 saw the first signs of growth."
In the last five years, the value of the Brazilian real has dropped by almost 40 percent against the American dollar, he said, making Brazilian real estate more affordable for buyers from the United States.
In the Natal area, he added, homes in gated communities priced between $150,000 and $600,000 are the most popular with foreign buyers.
WHO BUYS IN NATAL
The northeastern coast primarily attracts "new buyers, mover-uppers and second-home buyers," Mr. Gallagher said.
And foreigners make up about 25 to 30 percent of the buyers on the coast, said Mr. Smith, who primarily works with foreign prospects. Of his clientele, about 20 percent are from Portugal, he said, with buyers from Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada each making up about 10 percent of his business.
International buyers represent about 10 percent of the Brazilian real estate market over all, Mr. Hahn said.
BUYING BASICS
There are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Brazil, except in rural or border areas, said Juliano Ribeiro Lomonte, a real estate lawyer based in Natal. But foreigners do need to obtain a tax registration number, known as a CPF, to buy property.
Buyers typically make a 20 percent down payment, and the final deed is signed in front of a notary. "The whole process normally takes between 30 to 60 days," Mr. Smith said.
The transaction is straightforward, but buyers should hire a lawyer to oversee the process, agents said. "A lot of times sellers don't know about the taxes or restrictions on the land," Mr. Lomonte said.

TAXES AND FEES
There is local transfer tax of 3 percent on this property, and notary fees are usually about 2.5 to 3 percent of the sale price, Mr. Smith said. A lawyer might charge $2,000 to $5,000, he said, depending on the property and the lawyer.
Agents' fees are usually about 6 percent of the sale price, Mr. Gallagher said, but they are paid by the seller.
The annual property taxes on this home are 2,000 Brazilian real (or about $615), and there is a homeowners' association fee of 1,300 real (or $400) a month, Mr. Smith said.

Full text: Here are two things most economists can agree upon: They want an economy where everyone who seeks a job can get one. Yet for the economy to be dynamic, some people will always be unemployed, at least temporarily as they move between jobs.
There exists, in theory at least, some magic number for the unemployment rate that keeps those priorities in perfect balance, a bare minimum level of joblessness that makes room for people to move around yet ensures that nearly everyone who wants to can find work without inflation bubbling up. Economists, as they are prone to do, have created an acronym for it: Nairu, or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.
The problem is, it is looking more and more as if we have no idea what this magic number is -- an uncertainty that has huge economic consequences.
Does the 4.1 percent jobless rate in January represent something lower than this "natural rate" of unemployment and presage damaging inflation, as mainstream estimates have long suggested? Or could it fall more -- maybe a lot more -- putting more people to work without negative side effects?
The new Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, showed the level of uncertainty facing top policymakers in congressional testimony on Tuesday when he said that he believes the economy is at full employment when the jobless rate is in the "low 4's" -- that is, at current levels, "but what that really means is it could be 5 and it could be 3.5."
It might not seem like a huge range, but at 3.5 percent joblessness, 2.4 million more people would be working rather than looking for a job unsuccessfully. And that's before accounting for some of the other benefits that a very low jobless rate might bring, like higher wages and more opportunities for those who have the hardest time finding jobs, like former prisoners and those who have recovered from drug addiction.
The stakes are huge. Just five years ago, as discussion swirled about whether there had been a rise of "structural unemployment" caused by a mismatch between the skills workers had and those the job market needed, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Nairu was 5.5 percent, and Fed leaders' forecasts were in the same ballpark.
At the time, February 2013, the jobless rate was 7.7 percent. If the Fed had stuck to those higher estimates of Nairu and raised interest rates to try to head off inflation, millions of Americans who are now working would have been consigned to unemployment for no good reason.
Indeed, lately, some of the very scholars and policymakers who once put Nairu at the center of their economic analysis have lost faith that they have a good handle on it at all. The number is shaped by such factors as the technology people use to match up with new employers and people's willingness to relocate to find work. But like many concepts in economics, it can't be calculated directly. Rather, it must be inferred based on what is happening to other variables, which inevitably involves guesswork, assumptions and the use of historical data in a changing world.
"It's not a terribly useful tool right now," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. "For it to be useful you have to have at least a little confidence you know the number. You don't need to know it to two decimal places, but within a reasonable range. If your range is 2.5 to 7, that doesn't tell you anything."
In the mid-1990s, when Mr. Blinder was at the Fed, he and Janet Yellen, then a Fed governor, tried to persuade the chairman Alan Greenspan that interest rate increases were needed because the unemployment rate was quickly falling below estimates of Nairu in the 6 percent and higher range.
Mr. Greenspan won the argument, as he almost always did at the Fed in that era. And with hindsight it seems he was correct. Unemployment kept falling through the late 1990s, and reached as low as 3.8 percent in the spring of 2000, without evident flares of inflation pressure.
Indeed, the jobless rate in the United States has now fallen below 4.5 percent just three times since 1970 -- the late 1990s, 2006-2007, and in the last year. In none of those times did inflation flare up (and in the current expansion, it hasn't flared up yet).
Looking abroad is instructive, too. Each country has a distinct labor market that probably implies a different natural rate of unemployment. But it is striking that in Germany and Japan, joblessness levels have fallen in the last couple of years below estimates that officials in those countries have generally considered their Nairu -- without inflation taking hold.
That tells some officials here, charged with making policy in 2018, that the sensible strategy is to see just how low joblessness can go without causing problems.
"We have to have humility" about where the natural rate of unemployment really is, said Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. "Ultimately we're trying to assess supply and demand in the market for labor, and we can start by looking at the price. The price of labor has not been growing very quickly, and we've been seeing job creation far in excess of what we need to keep up with labor force growth."
In other words, the fact that the United States keeps adding jobs at a healthy clip, and that wages are rising only gradually, is itself evidence that unemployment can be allowed to drift lower than historical data might suggest. One reason, Mr. Kashkari theorizes, may be greater credibility that the Fed and other central banks won't allow inflation to take off as it did back in the 1970s.
Meanwhile, if the unemployment rate continues drifting down and testing the lower limits of Nairu further, 2018 may turn out to be the first time in nearly two decades to test just what good things might result from a Lycra-tight labor market.
As employers find good workers to be more and more scarce, might they be willing to hire less qualified employees and train them, enhancing those workers' long-term earning potential? Will they be more willing to take a chance on people who have been unemployed for years or have a checkered past?
Could they be more willing to invest in some of the cities that have been left behind by the expansion for the last nine years? After all, 33 metropolitan areas in the United States still have a jobless rate over 6 percent, and four, including Ocean City, N.J., and El Centro, Calif., have double-digit rates.
"No social program can substitute for a full-employment economy," said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies issues around poverty and inequality. "If a job is the best anti-poverty strategy and we're not producing enough jobs because of a misunderstanding of the macroeconomy and a failure to manage it in the best way, we are missing a huge opportunity."
In the 1960s and 1970s, central bankers' reluctance to tolerate any unemployment really did fuel a spiral of wages and prices that created years of high inflation and economic weakness. That was a long time ago, though, and in that time there have been huge changes in everything from how people find a job to the power of unions.
As Mr. Powell begins his term as Fed chairman, the question is how much he is willing to test the lower limits of unemployment. Is this more like the 1970s, or more like the 1990s?
Nobody said guiding a $19 trillion economy would be easy. Yet the fate of millions depends on Mr. Powell and his Fed colleagues to get the right answer.

Full text: Stocks in the United States dove in another dizzying day of trading after President Trump promised on Thursday to deliver stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which raised the threat of escalating retaliation by other countries and higher inflation. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index erased nearly all of its gains for the year.
Indexes had been bouncing between modest gains and losses earlier in the day, until Mr. Trump told industry executives around midday that they'll "have protection for the first time in a long while" and that he is planning to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports next week.
"I don't know if this will cause a trade war, and obviously that's the fear," said Lamar Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co. "But this is exactly what candidate Trump said he would do: He said he would be very protectionist and 'America First."'
The S.&P. 500 tumbled 36.16 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,677.67. The index is now up just 0.2 percent for the year after having its best January in 20 years. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 420.22 points, or 1.7 percent, to 24,608.98, and the Nasdaq fell 92.45, or 1.3 percent, to 7,180.56.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the European Union warned of retaliatory action. He vowed that "the E.U. will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests."
Shares of American steelmakers surged on the tariff news. U.S. Steel rose $2.50, or 5.7 percent, to $46.01. But shares of companies that use lots of steel fell, as did exporters.
Industrial companies in the S.&P. 500 fell 1.9 percent for the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the index. Aerospace giant Boeing lost $12.52, or 3.5 percent, to $349.69.
Bond prices rose as demand jumped for safer investments, which pushed yields lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note sank to 2.81 percent from 2.86 percent late Wednesday.
Oil prices continue to drop following a report on Wednesday that showed more crude supplies in inventories last week than analysts expected. Benchmark United States crude fell 65 cents to settle at $60.99 per barrel.
Gold dropped $12.60 to $1,302.90 an ounce.
The dollar dipped to 106.24 from 106.66 yen late Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.2261 from $1.2199, and the British pound slipped to $1.3768 from $1.3771.

Record Run Snapped, S.&amp;P. Says Good Riddance to February

Full text: U.S. stocks sank again on Wednesday and cemented February as the worst month for the market in two years.
Not only was the month's loss sharp, at 3.9 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index, it was also the first in a long time. S&P 500 index funds snapped a record-setting run where they had made money for 15 straight months, including dividends.
Some of Wednesday's drop was due to a slide in the price of oil, which sent energy stocks to the market's sharpest losses. The S&P 500 fell 30.45 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,713.83, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 380.83, or 1.5 percent, to 25,029.20 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 57.35, or 0.8 percent, to 7,273.01.
The dominant fear for the month was the threat of higher inflation and interest rates. Concerns got so high that the S&P 500 spiraled down 10 percent in just nine days at one point, before trimming some of its losses. The index had five losses of 1 percent or more in February, more than it did in all of last year.
Expect even more swings in coming weeks and months, said Brian Peery, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds. Investors are trying to figure out how many times the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year in the face of a growing economy. Uncertainty is high given that markets are waiting to see how much Washington's recently passed tax cuts will push companies to spend on equipment and wages.
"We were without volatility for so long, but what's in motion tends to stay in motion," Peery said. "It's been a pretty tumultuous month."
The tumult started just as the month began, when a government report showed a jump in workers' wages that surprised economists. That triggered worries that higher inflation may be on the way and that the Federal Reserve would need to get more aggressive about raising rates as a result. Higher rates make bonds more attractive as investments and can divert buyers away from stocks.
The dizzying result marked a sharp turnaround from the market's blistering start to the year, when stocks jumped on expectations that corporate profits would keep rising and the global economy would keep strengthening. It was a continuation of the remarkably smooth rise that investors enjoyed in 2017.
On Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.86 percent from 2.90 percent late Tuesday.
The benchmark yield relinquished roughly all of its increase from the prior day, when comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell once again raised speculation of a more aggressive Fed. He told Congress that he's more optimistic about the economy, which led some investors to anticipate four rate increases for 2018, up from three last year.
Among the biggest losers on Wednesday in the S&P 500 was Lowe's, which reported weaker profit for the last quarter than analysts expected. The home-improvement retailer's stock dropped $6.20, or 6.5 percent, to $89.59.
Energy stocks in the S&P 500 lost 2.3 percent for the sharpest drop among the 11 sectors that make up the index. They were hurt by a sharp drop in the price of oil after a government report showed that the amount of oil in U.S. inventories rose more than analysts expected last week.
Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.37 to settle at $61.64 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 85 cents to $65.78 per barrel.
On the winning side was Booking Holdings, the company formerly known as Priceline. It jumped $129.03, or 6.8 percent, to $2,034.04 after it reported a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, aided by stronger travel bookings.
Overseas stock markets were subdued. In Europe, France's CAC 40 fell 0.4 percent, and Germany's DAX lost 0.4 percent. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.7 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 tumbled 1.4 percent, South Korea's Kospi lost 1.2 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 1.4 percent.
The dollar dipped to 106.66 Japanese yen from 107.42 yen late Tuesday. The euro fell to $1.2203 from $1.2236, and the British pound slipped to $1.3771 from $1.3916.
In the commodities markets, natural gas sank 2 cents to $2.67 per 1,000 cubic feet, heating oil lost 5 cents to $1.92 per gallon and wholesale gasoline fell 5 cents to $1.76 per gallon.
Gold slipped 70 cents to $1,317.90 per ounce, silver lost 3 cents to $16.41 per ounce and copper dropped 5 cents to $3.13 per pound.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Yes, Raises Are Back, But Are They Here to Stay?

Full text: How low must unemployment go for workers to get a raise?
A couple of decades ago, it was normal for workers to get regular pay increases. After declining mercilessly since the early 1970s, the hourly pay of private-sector production and nonsupervisory workers -- nurses, cashiers, manufacturing workers on the shop floor and such -- hit bottom in 1995 and rose by more than a tenth in real terms over the following eight years.
Wages improved up and down the scale as the economy hit full employment. The hourly wage of workers at the bottom tenth of the income distribution rose 11 percent from 1995 to 2000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. It rose almost 8 percent for workers in the middle.
Raises are again in the cards. After a long stretch of headlines about stubbornly low wage growth, pay has perked up as the unemployment rate has dipped to levels not seen since the dot-com boom. The median weekly earnings of full-time workers in the middle of the pay ladder ended last year up 4.5 percent from their nadir in the spring of 2014, after accounting for inflation. Target and even Walmart have granted their workers raises.
It is high time: Median weekly earnings are only 3 percent higher in real terms than at the millennium. And yet for all the enthusiasm over the economy's return to full employment, the pay increases of the halcyon 1990s are probably not coming back anytime soon. For one thing, the economic pie is growing more slowly -- held in check by lackluster investment, stunted business dynamism and low productivity growth.
What's more, changes in the American economy that stretch back decades -- from globalization and automation to the outsourcing of low-paid work and the rise of dominant companies -- have deprived workers of leverage.
This suggests a double challenge for the nation's workers. For starters, the American economy needs to recover some of its lost dynamism. For workers to reap a larger share of the spoils of growth, they must claw back the bargaining power they lost. While the goal doesn't seem impossible, it requires pushing back against a view that has dominated economic policy over the last half century: that government should not stand in the way of corporate America's forward march, and definitely not mess with its efforts to lower labor costs.
On Tuesday, the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution released a series of studies by some of the nation's top economic thinkers on policies to revitalize wage growth. The good news is that plausible reforms could start tipping the labor market to benefit workers. But bringing the labor market back into balance will require a lot of them.
Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggests that to begin with, policymakers could do more to keep labor markets tight. He argues that the Federal Reserve has worried too much about inflation and not enough about the lid it puts on workers' well-being when it raises interest rates to slow growth.
Since 1980, he estimates, the job market has suffered from slack 70 percent of the time -- periods when workers, rather than employers, are scrambling. That compares with only a third of the time from 1949 to 1980. To keep it closer to full employment, he proposes a set of policies, including raising the Fed's inflation target from its current 2 percent, creating a fund to bolster job creation in moments of slack and engaging the government in job creation.
And yet, as Mr. Bernstein acknowledges, tight labor markets are only part of the solution. For starters, they eventually end when the cycle turns -- and wages can get stuck for a long time. And tight labor markets don't carry the power they used to.
A 1999 study by the economists Lawrence Katz of Harvard University and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University estimated how far the unemployment rate needed to decline to prevent wages from falling. From the mid-1970s to the late '80s, they found, an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent or lower would keep wages at the bottom tenth of the pay scale from declining. By the 1990s, however, unemployment had to dip to 5.7 percent to prevent wage losses at the bottom.
Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute replicated the exercise for the economic expansion that ended with the demise of the housing bubble in 2007: Unemployment, he found, had to fall below 4.6 percent to keep workers in the bottom 10 percent from losing ground.
At this pace, unemployment will soon have to hit zero for workers at the bottom to get a raise.
So what else can be done? There is obviously a role for training and education to help workers meet employers' rising demand for skills, especially at the beginning of their career. Fatih Guvenen of the University of Minnesota notes that the income of 25-year-old men starting their careers has declined sharply since the early 1970s and is now about where it was in the late '50s.
But a strategy focused on education will not tip the balance. As Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute points out, the list of remedies is long. It includes raising the minimum wage, increasing unionization, banning mandatory arbitration for employment claims, ending arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling, and ensuring that companies that subcontract their low-wage work remain in some way accountable for the workers.
Or how about restoring competition to labor markets? Mr. Krueger and Eric Posner of the University of Chicago write that the government could stop companies from forcing low-pay workers to sign noncompete covenants, which bar them from better-paid jobs elsewhere. It should also ban no-poaching arrangements of dubious legality among franchisees of the same company, which also close off workers' options.
Over the last 50 years, employers have been allowed to exercise ever more sway over their workers. The share of private-sector workers covered by unions has dwindled to a sliver. Businesses have grown to imposing heft. All along, executives and policymakers have sold this rebalancing of power as a boon for competitiveness, efficiency and economic growth.
And yet unbalanced labor markets not only hold back wages but also stymie the American economy as a whole. As Mr. Krueger pointed out to me, a rigged labor market is not efficient. Barring anti-competitive hiring practices will increase economic efficiency and encourage both higher wages and more employment. Better training will improve workers' productivity, but so will helping them relocate to better operations.
Rebalancing the labor relationship might not only improve the way the pie is shared but also make it bigger.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in his public debut on Tuesday that his expectations for domestic economic growth have increased since the beginning of the year, citing the passage of the $1.5 trillion tax cut and stronger global growth.
In testimony before Congress, Mr. Powell said that the Fed planned to continue increasing its benchmark interest rate only gradually, as it did under his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. But investors responded to his optimism as an indication the Fed may be compelled to move more quickly. As Mr. Powell testified, stocks fell, the dollar strengthened and bond yields rose.
Mr. Powell told the House Financial Services Committee that headwinds once holding back the American economy had now turned into tailwinds.
"My personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December," Mr. Powell said.
Yet he struck a careful tone. Inflation has remained sluggish for nearly a decade, and Mr. Powell said the Fed "will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy" and allowing inflation to tick up toward the Fed's target of a 2 percent annual pace.
Most Fed officials forecast in December that the Fed would raise rates at least three times in 2018, as it did last year. Mr. Powell said he "wouldn't want to prejudge" the new set of projections that officials will issue in March, but said they would take a recent run of strong economic data, including continued job growth and increased business investment, into account.
Investors widely expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate in March, into a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent, and most expect another quarter point increase in June.
Some Wall Street analysts said that Mr. Powell's testimony increased the chances that the Fed would continue with quarterly rate hikes in the second half of the year.
"We are naturally more confident in our standing call for four hikes this year and another four next year," said Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.
But the Fed has emphasized that stronger growth is necessary to justify three rate hikes this year. Fed officials have also said growth will not prompt the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate more quickly unless it increases inflationary pressures.
Randal K. Quarles, the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, said Monday that the tax cuts could increase the country's economic capacity, allowing faster growth without faster inflation. His remarks suggested the Fed is willing to wait and see what happens.
"I will be carefully watching indicators of economic activity and inflation and assessing the degree to which activity appears to be pushing up against the constraints of the economy, as opposed to being a reflection of the expansion of those constraints and the growth of the potential output of the economy," Mr. Quarles said.
Lawmakers grilled Mr. Powell on Tuesday on many subjects. House Republicans, who pressed for Mr. Trump to put a Republican in charge of the central bank, asked Mr. Powell how he would respond to changes made after the 2008 financial crisis, including stronger financial regulations and a new approach to managing interest rates.
Democrats, nervous about the new leadership, pressed Mr. Powell for assurances that the Fed would remain committed to supporting job growth and that it would enforce laws aimed at reducing discrimination by financial institutions.
Both sides sought Mr. Powell's affirmation for their views about the economic effect of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that took effect in January.
Mr. Powell began his remarks by commending Ms. Yellen on her tenure and calling for continuity with her policies. But the differences between Mr. Powell, a former investment banker, and his predecessor, a labor economist, showed through. Unlike Ms. Yellen, Mr. Powell shied away from questions about economic inequality, and he spoke more freely about financial regulation.
Mr. Powell reaffirmed to House members that the Fed intends to loosen some limits on banks. One change could reduce capital requirements for some large banks, allowing them to rely more heavily on borrowed money.
The goal of the changes is to reduce the burden of regulation "without losing any safety and soundness," Mr. Powell said. He also said the Fed plans to reduce regulation of smaller banks.
He added the Fed must be alert to both the buildup of financial imbalances and inflation, but that neither risk appeared high at the moment.
"There's always a risk of a recession at any point in time, but I don't see it as at all high at the moment," Mr. Powell added. "I would expect the next two years on the current path to be good years for the economy."
Stocks took a tumble this month as investors began to chew on the possibility of faster rate hikes. Mr. Powell dismissed the turbulence, saying the Fed saw no evidence that it was "weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market and inflation."
The losses on Tuesday were more modest. The Standard & Poor's 500 lost 1.27 percent, closing at 2,744.28.
Mr. Powell has taken the helm of the central bank as the economy is nearing the end of its ninth year of expansion. The Fed has been steadily raising its benchmark rate back to a more normal level after cutting it nearly to zero to stimulate lending in response to the financial crisis.
Those rate hikes are intended to keep the economy from running too hot, while also giving the Fed the capacity to fight a future recession by once again cutting interest rates.
Although a strong economy and low unemployment typically drive up inflation, it has remained puzzlingly low in recent years. Mr. Powell acknowledged the trend, but said that he believed sluggish price increases were due in part to temporary factors and that inflation would gradually rise this year.
He noted, however, that some indicators suggest the labor market still has room for improvement, including the modest pace of wage growth. The share of working-age adults who are not working also remains significantly higher than before the recession; most of those people are not counted in the unemployment rate because they are not actively seeking work.
Investors are watching carefully for any indication that inflation could lift off faster than they expected -- a sign that the Fed might have to raise rates more quickly than it planned and risk choking off economic growth.
On Monday, Mr. Quarles was cautiously optimistic that faster economic growth is likely. "There are indications that we have a sustainably stronger economy," Mr. Quarles said. "It's a little too early to call that as happening, but there are clear indications that it could be happening."
Mr. Powell, a member of the Fed's board of governors who was sworn in as chairman this month, will testify again on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.

Full text: Treasury yields rose Tuesday, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index slid to its first loss in four days after the head of the Federal Reserve said that he's feeling more optimistic about the economy.
The testimony by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell before Congress was highly anticipated, and he gave encouraging words about the economic data that have arrived in recent weeks. But some investors speculated they could mean the central bank will get more aggressive in raising interest rates than the market has prepared for.
"My personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December," Powell said in response to a question about whether the recently passed tax cut and other moves by Congress have changed his outlook for how quickly the Fed will raise interest rates.
The immediate reaction in the bond market was to send Treasury yields higher, and the yield on the 10-year note climbed to 2.90 percent from 2.86 percent late Monday. It had been down earlier in the morning.
Higher interest rates can hurt stock prices by making bonds more attractive. Generally, when interest rates are rising, companies need to produce bigger profits just for their stock prices to stay flat.
The S&P 500 fell 35.32 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,744.28. It had been bouncing between modest gains and losses early in the morning, but the losses accelerated after Powell began answering questions on Capitol Hill.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 299.24, or 1.2 percent, to 25,410.03, and the Nasdaq composite fell 91.11, or 1.2 percent, to 7,330.35.
The Fed raised its key policy interest rate three times last year and has signaled that another three increases may be coming in 2018. Powell reaffirmed to the House Financial Services Committee that the central bank plans to raise interest rates gradually as the economy improves.
The market got spooked earlier this month when potential signs of inflation strengthened, which raised speculation that the Fed may speed up its timetable. Stocks around the world fell sharply as a result, with the S&P 500 losing 10 percent from its record high at one point.
If the Fed does raise rates four times this year, it could upset markets when many investors have been preparing for only three increases, said Rich Weiss, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at American Century Investments.
What may make things even more muddled is how long it's been since investors have had to contend with a market where inflation is a threat and interest rates are rising, Weiss said. The last time was before the 2008 financial crisis.
"You have a generation of brokers and advisers who have not experienced this side of the economic cycle," he said.
The rise in Treasury yields sent stocks that pay big dividends to some of the market's steepest losses. When bonds are paying more in interest, they can lure income investors away from dividend-paying stocks.
Real-estate investment trusts in the S&P 500, which are among the biggest dividend payers, lost 2.1 percent for the biggest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the index. Utilities fell 1.7 percent.
Comcast had one of the biggest losses in the S&P 500 after it launched a bid for European pay TV broadcaster Sky. The buyout offer is for 22.1 billion pounds ($29.5 billion), and Comcast's Class A shares lost $2.92, or 7.4 percent, to $36.66.
Shares of Walt Disney also fell because the Comcast bid could disrupt its takeover offer for 21st Century Fox. Disney lost $4.94, or 4.5 percent, to $104.87.
On the winning end was Macy's, which jumped to one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 after reporting sales and profits that were comfortably ahead of expectations. The retail giant also gave a forecast for 2018 earnings that was higher than analysts expected.
Macy's rose 95 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $28.40.
In Europe, stock indexes were mixed with France's CAC 40 close to flat and Germany's DAX down 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.1 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.1 percent, South Korea's Kospi dipped 0.1 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.7 percent.
In the commodities markets, benchmark U.S. crude fell 90 cents to settle at $63.01 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 87 cents to $66.63 per barrel.
Natural gas was nearly flat at $2.68 per 1,000 cubic feet, heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.96 per gallon and wholesale gasoline lost 2 cents to $1.80 per gallon.
Gold dropped $14.20 to $1,318.60 per ounce, silver lost 19 cents to $16.43 per ounce and copper fell 4 cents to $3.19 per pound.
The dollar rose to 107.42 Japanese yen from 106.91 yen late Monday. The euro dipped to $1.2236 from $1.2312, and the British pound fell to $1.3916 from $1.3968.

Unexpected Rally Stretches Into Third Day of Gains

Full text: Stocks jumped on Monday, with gains again accelerating in the last hour of trading, as markets around the world continue to claw back from a sharp tumble this month.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index powered to a third straight gain, and the index has erased about two-thirds of its 10 percent loss since setting a record a month ago.
Analysts said a main reason for Monday's gain was a drop in Treasury yields, which have been at the center of worries for stock investors in recent weeks, but some were still surprised by how much the market climbed.
The S.&P. 500 gained 32.30 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,779.60, with telecoms and technology stocks leading the way. For the second straight day, the market turned higher as the day wore on.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 399.28, or 1.6 percent, to 25,709.27, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 84.07, or 1.1 percent, to 7,421.46. All three measures are back within 3.4 percent of their record highs.
"I think you can very confidently say the worst is over for now," said Randy Frederick, vice president for trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. "The concern I have is that it's recovering too quickly. Today's rally has been very surprising."
Mr. Frederick said he saw few reasons for a big move higher in stocks on Monday, with no big-ticket earnings or economic reports on the calendar. If the market continues rising at this rate, it could hit record heights again in the next couple of weeks. "And then we'd be vulnerable to another correction, so I'd prefer it to slow down a bit here," Mr. Frederick said.
What set off the first correction, which is what traders call a 10 percent drop in stock prices, was fear that interest rates were set to march much higher, and quickly. Treasury yields have been climbing over the last month for a number of reasons, including higher expectations for inflation, a strengthening American economy and the federal government's increased need to borrow.
Higher interest rates can hurt stock prices by making bonds look more attractive as investments, and Wall Street is split on how high they can climb. Most of Wall Street is anticipating a gradual increase, as the Federal Reserve moves short-term rates higher.
That is why an appearance this week by the Fed's new chairman is so widely anticipated. Jerome H. Powell is scheduled to deliver his first testimony as chairman to Congress, and he will speak about monetary policy before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday morning. Ahead of the testimony, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.86 percent from 2.87 percent late Friday.
One driver for stocks in recent weeks was how impressive corporate profit reports have been.
Roughly 90 percent of S.&P. 500 companies have said how much they earned during the last three months of 2017, and three-quarters of them made more than analysts expected, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. More important to investors is that 75 percent of companies reported more revenue than expected. Revenue growth is on pace to be the best since the summer of 2011, according to FactSet.
In the commodities markets, benchmark United States crude oil rose 36 cents to settle at $63.91 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 19 cents to $67.50 a barrel.
Gold added $2.10 to settle at $1,330.30 an ounce. Silver rose 7 cents to $16.55 an ounce, and copper fell 1 cent to $3.22 a pound.
The dollar inched up to 106.91 Japanese yen from 106.87 yen late Friday. The euro rose to $1.2311 from $1.2294, and the British pound edged down to $1.3964 from $1.3965.

As Economy Grows, Fed Arms Itself for the Next Downturn

Full text: The Federal Reserve on Friday described recent volatility in financial markets as a brief blip and affirmed its plans to raise its benchmark interest rate in the coming months.
The Fed painted economic conditions in bright and happy colors in its biannual report to Congress on the conduct of monetary policy. It said the labor market was "near or a little beyond full employment," an important milestone in the recovery from the 2008 crisis.
"The U.S. economy appears to be performing very well and, certainly, is in the best shape that it has been in since the crisis and, by many metrics, since well before the crisis," Randal K. Quarles, the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, said Thursday in Tokyo.
The immediate problem confronting the Fed is how quickly to raise interest rates. The Fed forecast in December that it would raise rates three times in 2018, just as it did in 2017. Fed officials say stronger growth is fortifying those intentions, and the next rate increase is expected in March. A growing number of Wall Street analysts predict the improving economic forecast will persuade the Fed to raise rates four times this year.
The hot topic on Friday, however, at a conference attended by several Fed officials in New York, was whether the Fed would be ready for the next economic downturn.
The Fed's benchmark rate is in a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent, and the Fed does not expect it to rise much higher than 3 percent in the current economic expansion. That's a problem given that, in the last four downturns, the Fed has cut rates by an average of 5.5 percentage points to stimulate renewed growth.
During the last downturn, the Fed reduced the benchmark rate to nearly zero in 2008, and then supplemented its efforts by pledging to keep interest rates at a low level and by purchasing large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds.
Fed officials have said that those policies benefited the economy, and could be used again during a future downturn. Other central banks have relied on similar policies in recent years, and have reached similar conclusions. Benoît Cœuré, a board member of the European Central Bank, said economic research was "fairly clear" that such asset purchases helped to hold down interest rates.
But the main paper presented at the conference on Friday, which is hosted by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, asserted that bond-buying had little economic benefit.
"Our conclusion is that the most important and reliable instrument of monetary policy is the short term interest rate," wrote the authors, a team of two academics and two bank economists-
The danger of a rapid return to near-zero interest rates seemed particularly acute in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, as the Fed repeatedly delayed any increase in rates. Now, the economy has gained strength and the Fed has raised rates five times. Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said the progress showed the Fed's policies had helped, and that the Fed might be able to raise interest rates above current expectations.
"My own view about what is possible at the zero lower bound is quite a bit more optimistic than it was back then," Mr. Hatzius said.
An account of the Fed's most recent policymaking meeting, in January, reported that some officials had shared that optimism, expressing the view that the Fed might be able to increase its benchmark rate somewhat closer to its precrisis level.
Nonetheless, there is growing support among Fed officials for a review of the Fed's approach to policy, and of alternatives that might allow it to respond more forcefully to future downturns.
Loretta Mester, the relatively conservative president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told the conference she favored starting such a study "later this year."
The Fed aims to keep inflation at an annual pace of 2 percent a year, by raising and lower interest rates and by training the public to expect a certain level of inflation, disciplining the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage demands of workers.
Alternative approaches fall into two broad categories: Permanently replace the Fed's 2 percent target, or set it aside in the aftermath of downturns.
Raising the target is a simple way of creating more room to respond to crises. Interest rates include expected inflation, so higher inflation would raise rates.
Embracing higher inflation, however, could cause political problems for the Fed.
Alternatively, the Fed could tolerate higher inflation on a temporary basis. For example, the Fed could aim to maintain average inflation at 2 percent over some specified period, meaning that it would compensate for periods of lower inflation, as during the last six years, by allowing periods of higher inflation, thus maintaining a 2 percent average.
Last year, the Fed began to include a comparison between its actual management of interest rates, and the results produced by alternative approaches to monetary policy.
The report on Friday included an inflation-averaging approach among those alternatives for the first time.

Full text: To understand why global financial markets have been so volatile the last few weeks, imagine a town full of farmers who have been living through a decade-long drought.
The first few years of the drought, they probably adapted by shifting to crops that could grow without much water, but at the same time they probably kept renewing their flood insurance. After all, the drought could end at any time, and losses caused by too much water are every bit as painful as those caused by too little.
But after years and years of writing checks for flood insurance, our farmers might get a little tired of throwing money away to protect against a risk that never seems to materialize. By the seventh or eighth year of the drought, they might just say "forget it" and let flood insurance lapse.
Then, with the 10-year mark approaching, it rains. Not very hard: Imagine a perfectly normal rainstorm by pre-drought standards, not enough to cause a flood, but enough to make the farmers think flooding just might be a possibility again.
What would the farmers do? There's a good chance that they would call their insurance broker and very quickly, even desperately, sign up for flood insurance once again.
And that helps explain why the markets have been so topsy-turvy of late.
Rain, in this metaphor, is inflation -- and the decade-long drought is the near-decade that global inflation and interest rates have been persistently low.
In the last few months, there have been the earliest stirrings that this situation could -- emphasis on could -- be on track to change. A tax bill was passed in December that is expected to act as an economic stimulus in the short run. The January employment report reflected fairly strong growth in average hourly earnings. The Consumer Price Index came in a little higher than forecasters had been expecting.
When you pick apart the shifts in the financial markets, they are consistent with the idea that investors are not yet betting on an inflationary flood but are opening their minds to the idea that it could happen.
For example, by comparing the prices of regular Treasury bonds with inflation-protected bonds, you can get a sense of how worried investors are about inflation. On Dec. 1, those prices were such that an investor would break even if from five to 10 years in the future -- December 2022 through December 2027 -- consumer prices rose 1.78 percent a year.
That has now risen to 2.21 percent, which is quite a large swing by the standards of the generally staid bond market.
Here's an important wrinkle: While economists often talk about those numbers as a measure of investors' inflation expectations, they can just as easily be a measure of investors' level of worry about inflation risk. What's the difference? One is about what seems likely to happen, while the other is about an increase in the chances of an unlikely -- but costly -- outcome.
Back to the drought metaphor: The farmers might still think that another dry year is the most likely result, but if recent showers make them worry more about the risk of flooding, and they all try to buy insurance at the same time, this drives up the price. That seems to be what has happened in the last two months in the market for inflation-protected bonds, which essentially function as insurance against future rises in prices.
This framework also helps explain why there have been such big swings in financial markets lately.
Analysts at Deutsche Asset Management noted recently that government bonds from the United States and Germany -- generally considered some of the world's bedrock safe assets -- have been more volatile lately than bonds issued by emerging market countries like Indonesia and Mexico.
And the Standard & Poor's 500 has moved more than 1 percent on eight of 16 trading days in February thus far, which doesn't make much sense if you're looking for fundamentals-based reasons for such big moves in stock prices. It makes more sense if you believe that investors are trying to extrapolate from tiny fragments of information the potential risk of a radically different economic and financial market environment in the years ahead.
The swings in stock prices appear to be intimately linked to movement in long-term interest rates, which in turn hinges on those expectations of inflation and how the Federal Reserve will respond if inflation does rise.
On Wednesday, for example, the stock market had been on track for a sharply positive day until the Fed released minutes of its last policy meeting at 2 p.m. Soon after, the stock market plunged and bond yields rose, as investors evidently concluded that the Fed was inclined toward a somewhat faster rate of interest rate increases than had been assumed.
But you can also interpret swings like that one as a result of investors trying to draw big conclusions about the economic future from incremental pieces of information.
In December, Fed officials projected that the main interest rate the central bank targets would be 2.8 percent in the longer run. But when it first started publishing its consensus of that number, in June 2015, it was 3.8 percent. If the economy evolves in a direction that causes the earlier estimate to prove more accurate, it implies that a wide range of assets are priced incorrectly (in particular, it would mean that prices for long-term bonds should be a lot lower and their yields higher).
So as long as this pattern continues, you can interpret every day's economic news and market swings as a referendum on which state of the world is more likely. Are we still in the world of 2009 to 2017, in which inflation and interest rates stayed low and asset prices continued their steady rise? Or are we returning to the pre-2008 levels of each, a possibility that is perhaps less probable but would be hugely consequential if it happens?
If that world does arrive, the people who re-upped their flood insurance at the first sign of rain will be glad they did.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
TRADE
Nafta negotiations resume in Mexico City.
The seventh round of negotiations over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement will kick off this week in Mexico City, as negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States once again meet to try to hammer out their differences over the trade pact. President Trump's recent statements suggest that the threat of the United States imminently withdrawing from the agreement has receded in recent months. But the countries are still at odds over issues like rules on automobile manufacturing and investment. The countries will face a challenging task as they try to move toward consensus on these issues before the end of the negotiating round on March 5. Ana Swanson
ECONOMY
Jerome Powell to give his first testimony as Fed chairman.
Jerome H. Powell, the new Federal Reserve chairman, who arrived in that role as a relative unknown, will make his public debut on Tuesday morning when he testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. On Thursday, he will reprise the performance before the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Powell has said that he plans to continue the Fed's gradual retreat from its economic stimulus campaign, slowly raising interest rates and slowly reducing the Fed's bond portfolio. While the economy is gaining strength, Mr. Powell is likely to emphasize that so far, stronger growth is increasing the Fed's confidence in its plans, rather than giving it a reason to move more quickly. Binyamin Appelbaum
Bernanke and Yellen to talk about her career and the economy.
Some events sell themselves: On Tuesday afternoon at the Brookings Institution, Janet L. Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chairwoman, will be interviewed by Ben S. Bernanke, her predecessor at the Fed. It will be Ms. Yellen's first public appearance since she completed her four-year term as Fed chairwoman this month. Both Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke are now fellows at Brookings and so free to speak candidly about their experience leading the Fed through the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Brookings says they'll address Ms. Yellen's career, "her time at the Fed, her observations about the current state of the economy and the challenges that confront us." Binyamin Appelbaum
Data on income and spending may show impact of bonuses.
After passage of the Republican tax overhaul in December, big companies including Apple and Walmart said they would share their tax savings with employees in the form of raises and bonuses. Economists are skeptical of the cause and effect, noting that the low unemployment rate is also putting pressure on companies to raise pay. But whatever the reason, the bonuses are real -- and could show up in data that the Commerce Department will release on Thursday. The report, which covers Americans' income and spending in January, won't capture the direct effects of the tax cuts, which mostly didn't show up in workers' paychecks until February. But it could show the impact of bonuses and pay increases, as well as any extra spending they might have generated. Don't expect a big bump, however: Economists surveyed by Bloomberg said both income and spending probably grew more slowly in January. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, will be watching the report for any signs that inflation is picking up. Ben Casselman
GOVERNMENT
Chinese business and political leaders gather for annual meeting.
More than 3,000 officials from across China will gather in Beijing at the end of the week for the annual twin sessions of the country's top advisory body and the country's Legislature. The advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, includes many tycoons and other business leaders and will start meeting on Saturday. The Legislature, the National People's Congress, will start meeting the next Monday and is expected to stay in session for nearly two weeks.
The congress typically starts with the annual work report of the premier, Li Keqiang. That is followed by the rubber-stamp approval of a long list of government initiatives -- a couple of constitutional amendments are expected this year to cement the primacy of President Xi Jinping. Perhaps most important is that the congress will confirm a new slate of government ministers after the twice-a-decade Communist Party national gathering in Beijing last October. Most of the new lineup is already known, but considerable uncertainty surrounds who might succeed Zhou Xiaochuan, who turns 70 this year and is expected to retire after serving as governor of the central bank since 2002.

Heirs Inherit Uncertainty With New Estate Tax

Full text: Critics of the estate tax like to call the federal levy on assets passed on by the wealthy to their heirs the "death tax." But the better nickname might be the "zombie tax."
Despite repeated attempts by conservative lawmakers to kill it -- and a 2016 campaign-trail vow by Donald J. Trump that "no family will have to pay the death tax" because "we will repeal it" -- the estate tax remains a surprisingly resilient part of the United States tax code.
The tax law passed by Congress in December certainly keeps it alive -- on more generous terms. Instead of taxing any amount above $5.49 million per person at a rate of 40 percent, the new law raises that exemption to $10 million, which, when indexed for inflation, allows individuals to pass on $11.2 million and couples to transfer twice that amount without paying a penny of tax.
But leaving the estate tax in place means America's richest families now face the prospect of scurrying to tax lawyers to revise older estate plans, and may need to do so again before the end of 2025. The new exemption is on the books for only eight years, and if Congress doesn't change the law again, estates could face tax bills after 2026 for moves made under the new, temporary limits.
"Some of the wealthier clients are happy" with the changes, said Brian Jenney, a partner with Kemp Klein in Troy, Mich. "But when you tell them it ends in 2025, they're frustrated because they're still going to be alive."
Despite these complications, what's clear is that even though Congress didn't kill the estate tax, the new limits come close.
"The estate tax used to cover a lot more people even in recent decades, up to 2 percent of all estates. Now we're down to less than one-tenth of 1 percent," said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. "The estate tax is hanging on by a thread."
According to IRS figures, 12,411 estates filed Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, for 2016. Of those filers, fewer than half -- 5,219 estates -- owed anything, paying $18.3 billion on assets of $108 billion, for an effective tax rate of 17 percent. Even among estates valued at more than $50 million, 133 managed to avoid paying any estate tax.
If the new exemption had been in place that year, it would have trimmed those estate-tax bills by an amount between $2.3 billion and $6.2 billion. No more than 2,204 estates would have exceeded the individual $10 million baseline exemption in 2016. And under the new $20 million baseline exclusion for married filers, the tax would have hit just 911 estates.
Besides the generous exemption, the estate tax always has provided another big benefit to inheritors: Those assets are passed on at their market value at the time of death. This allows stocks, real estate and other holdings that may have appreciated to be sold with no tax ever paid on those gains.
That's the prime reason that anyone with an estate valued between the old and new exemption limits needs to consider rewriting his or her plans to bring the maximum amount of assets back into the estate. The problem is that one vehicle that's often used is an irrevocable trust, which, as the name implies, isn't easily reversed.
"Every estate planner has a handful of files where we now want to bring those assets back into the estate to get that step-up in basis, but it's not that easy," Mr. Jenney said. "We've got to petition the probate court, show that circumstances have changed, go to court and terminate the trust."
Another time bomb in older estate plans could lurk in trusts that move assets out of the estate to future generations, called generation-skipping transfers. These transfers are taxed in coordination with the estate tax and gift tax and count toward the estate tax exemption amount. Often, those trusts use a formula that automatically removes the maximum exemption amount from the estate and places that money in the trust, said Melissa Langa, managing partner of Bove & Langa in Boston.
"If you had an $11 million estate before the new act, $5 million would go to the trust for future generations, $6 million would be held for the spouse, and that would have been a great plan," Ms. Langa said. "Now it might be that all $11 million is held for the benefit of the children and grandchildren and the spouse is left with nothing."
An added sting for families forced to rewrite their estate plans (a process that can cost between $2,000 and $10,000) is that unless the work is a business expense, they can't deduct that cost. The new tax law eliminated the allowance for tax preparation fees.
But it's the sunset provision of the new law that creates the most potential problems, according to estate planners, many of whom are unimpressed with the hasty, late-December tax-law rewrite.
"We're lucky it's as tame as it is, because the legislation is just idiotic," said James Spica, an estate tax specialist with Dickinson Wright in Detroit. "I don't think there even was a handful of people working on it who understand how it works."
Mr. Spica pointed out that the estate of a spouse who died under the older, lower exemption would benefit if the surviving spouse died between now and the end of 2025. Estates of any amount pass untaxed to a spouse and are taxed only after the surviving spouse dies. So even if the first spouse died when the estate exemption was $11 million for a couple, that estate enjoys a $22 million exemption -- but only if the surviving spouse dies before Dec. 31, 2025.
Meanwhile, someone who dies today under the $22 million exemption could see that allowance cut in half if the surviving spouse passes away in 2026, when the exemption drops back to the earlier limit.
"You'll get half the benefit if the second spouse dies outside this new regime," Mr. Spica said.
Another issue Congress left hanging concerns how to handle gift taxes after the higher exemption expires. Because the tax on large gifts works in concert with the estate tax, the estate of someone who gives away more than the lower exemption could be hit with a "claw back" tax bill for several million dollars when the law reverts to the lower limit, said James Blase of Blase & Associates in St. Louis.
"If you make a very large gift before 2026 and die afterward, there's absolutely no law," Mr. Blase said. "Congress left it totally up to the I.R.S. to issue regulations, and that's a big deal. There's a lot of uncertainty."
The one place where estate-tax certainty does exist is within the very wealthiest families, who continue to face a 40 percent maximum tax rate on their estates.
"For the uber-wealthy, a $5 million change in the exemption doesn't really make a difference," Ms. Langa said, adding: "It's a huge thing for people in the $10 million to $20 million range, but if you're in the $200 million range, it's a drop in the bucket."

Full text: A two-day walkout by thousands of West Virginia public schoolteachers and employees to protest low pay will continue on Monday, organizers said on Friday afternoon.
The American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, the West Virginia Education Association and the West Virginia School Service Personnel Association organized the statewide action, which left more than a quarter of a million students out of school on Thursday and Friday in the state's 55 counties.
Christine Campbell, the president of the American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia, said the strike could last beyond Monday if necessary. Teachers across the state, she added, "have made their voice clear."
"They believe that not enough has been done," she said.
Organizers say teachers are so poorly paid in the state that some must take second jobs to make ends meet. In 2016, the average salary for a teacher in West Virginia was $45,622, ranking it 48th in the country, according to the National Education Association.
"Our state is not providing the resources for our students," Cindy Nester, 44, a kindergarten teacher at Augusta Elementary School, said in an interview. "Generally, in a year, I probably pay anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 out of my own paycheck, and those are just for miscellaneous supplies."
Schools across the state have a deficit of educators, and experienced teachers have left in search of adequate pay and benefits, the union said.
Ms. Nester, who lives in the city of Romney, agreed. "I live 40 miles from Virginia, 40 miles form Maryland," she said. "All we have to do is cross those lines and we can make $12,000 or $15,000 more, plus those benefits."
An estimated 5,000 teachers, parents and supporters protested at the Capitol building in Charleston on Friday, said Kym Randolph, the communications director for the West Virginia Education Association. There were slightly fewer demonstrators than on Thursday, when lines were so long it took up to three hours to get in.
"They are packing the chambers," Ms. Randolph said in an interview. "The ones that got there early talked to legislators."
West Virginia's 680 public schools employ 19,488 classroom teachers, said Alyssa Keedy, a spokeswoman for the state's education department. There are 277,137 students enrolled.
During the two-day shutdown, state food banks helped feed students who depend on school meals, and supplemental child care centers were set up, according to local news reports.
The strike took place after Gov. James C. Justice, a Republican, signed legislation on Wednesday that would provide teachers and school service personnel a 2 percent raise starting in July, part of an increase in salaries for some state employees.
Teachers and service personnel are scheduled to get an additional 1 percent raise in the 2020 fiscal year, and teachers will get another 1 percent raise in 2021.
"We need to keep our kids and teachers in the classroom," Governor Justice said in a statement on Wednesday. "We certainly recognize our teachers are underpaid, and this is a step in the right direction to addressing their pay issue."
Teachers' unions say the raises will not cover cost-of-living increases. Ms. Randolph said that teachers' salaries had stagnated for years and that the lack of state contributions to the health care plan had meant that inflation costs have been borne by the employees, who are struggling under higher deductibles, premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.
While the board of the Public Employees Insurance Agency, which administers the health care plan for state employees, has agreed to freeze rates in 2019, the teachers want a more permanent funding fix.
Governor Justice said the agency's board would work on long-term solutions to address the teachers' concerns. "Now we need to turn our focus back to continuing public education reforms and making our state educational system the best in the country," he said.
Ms. Nester said the walkout seemed to have a lot of support from members of her community, adding that she was demonstrating in support of all state workers, not just educators.
"I think it's very possible it could go on for a while," she said. "I think we need to fight for this."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Since last week's deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., a pitched national conversation about gun policy has dominated town hall meetings, a White House summit meeting, the annual Conservative Political Action Conference and the never-ending stream of social media feeds.
Below is a brief review of several laws governing guns in the United States and how effective those policies have been in curbing violence.
High-profile shootings prompted several major federal gun laws .
Some of the toughest laws that regulate the production, distribution and use of firearms in the United States were passed after major acts of violence.
■ The National Firearms Act of 1934 was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt after high-profile gangland crimes, including the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929 that killed seven in Chicago. The law imposed a $200 tax on transfers of machine guns, short-barrel rifles and shotguns, and it required gun owners to register those weapons.
At the time, the tax was "considered quite severe and adequate" to discourage or eliminate sales of those guns, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It still stands at $200 -- even though its current value, after adjusting for inflation, would come to about $3,700.
■ The Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. It banned interstate mail orders of all firearms, interstate handgun sales and weapons with no "sporting purpose." It prohibited the sale of firearms to minors, felons, fugitives, drug addicts and those committed to a mental institution. And it required gun manufacturers and dealers to be licensed and maintain records of sales.
■ After an intense lobbying effort by gun advocates, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986 lifted some of those restrictions. The 1986 law allowed dealers to sell rifles and shotguns through the mail, and it limited federal inspections of gun dealers. It also prohibited the sale of machine guns manufactured after May 19, 1986.
■ The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 further amended the 1968 law: It required gun purchasers not already licensed to possess a firearm to undergo background checks when buying from sellers licensed by the federal government. However, private transactions were exempted, creating the so-called gun-show loophole.
■ The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned the possession, transfer or domestic manufacturing of some semiautomatic assault weapons for 10 years. Known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, it expired in 2004, despite efforts by gun control advocates to extend it.
■ In 2008, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act after a shooting at Virginia Tech a year earlier had killed 33. The law created a series of incentives and systems -- but not requirements -- for states to share information with the federal government about people who have been disqualified from obtaining guns.
Here's what states have done.
Eight states have enacted some kind of ban on assault weapons. Two other states regulate military-grade firearms. State gun laws are tracked, in detail, by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which lobbies for gun control.
According to the law center, states with the strictest gun control measures have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths. Those states include California, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. Conversely, states that do not aggressively regulate guns -- like Alabama, Alaska and Louisiana -- have the highest.
Still, as Lisa Foderaro and Kristin Hussey have reported for The New York Times, "Cities like Chicago and Baltimore, with rigorous gun laws, also have two of the highest murder rates in the country. The black market for illegal guns has thrived in those cities, with gang members and criminals turning to the streets to get firearms."

Some state gun control laws have come under court review. In one prominent case, the Supreme Court limited gun control efforts in its 2009 ruling District of Columbia v. Heller.
Since then, however, the United States' highest court has opted to not consider other Second Amendment cases, including in 2016, when it declined to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons in Connecticut and New York. Those state laws were passed after 20 first graders and six adults were killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
In choosing to not hear those cases, "the justices have given at least tacit approval to broad gun control laws in states and localities that choose to enact them," wrote Adam Liptak, the legal affairs correspondent for The Times.
But to what effect?
It's difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to experts and research.
The National Rifle Association has "successfully built in ineffectiveness" to gun control legislation, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of "Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America."
"Part of the story is that the N.R.A. fights tooth and nail against any policy," Mr. Winkler said. "The laws that result are much less ambitious in their goals."
The gun control laws had some effect. The 1934 restrictions curbed access to machine guns; crimes with those types of fully automatic firearms have essentially dried up since the era of Al Capone. The 1968 prohibitions on who can own a weapon, and requirements for licensing dealers, are still in place.
The 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the "ban could not be credited with any reduction in crime."
On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that "the number of gun massacres fell by 37%" while the ban was in place.
Christopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident.
"My work is often cited in misleading ways that don't give the full picture," Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. "These laws can modestly reduce shootings overall" and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.
Ms. Feinstein's claim that the ban drastically reduced gun massacres comes from analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston. But Mr. Winkler noted that most mass shootings are committed with a handgun, not a military-grade assault weapon.
"There's no anti-mass shooting law to test," said Charles Branas, the chairman of the epidemiology department at the School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York. "In terms of all of these instances, not just mass shootings, we need the politicians to create more laws to test."

Full text: Stocks in the United States closed mostly higher Thursday after a late-afternoon wave of selling erased much of a midday rally.
Gains in industrial companies and other sectors outweighed losses in banks and health care stocks. Energy companies also rose after crude oil prices recovered from an early slide.
Bond yields declined after spiking to four-year highs a day earlier amid rekindled fears of higher inflation and interest rates.
"The yields easing back a little bit is probably reassuring people on a very short-term kind of basis," said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "That big, nasty intraday reversal yesterday was probably a little bit excessive."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.63 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,703.96. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 164.70 points, or 0.7 percent, to 24,962.48. The 30-company average was up briefly by more than 350 points. The Dow and the S.&P. 500 snapped a two-day losing streak.
The Nasdaq had been up much of the day, but closed lower. It fell 8.14 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,210.09.
The stock indexes are on track to close lower for the week.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.92 percent from a day earlier, when it climbed to 2.95 percent, the highest level since January 2014. Wednesday's spike in bond yields came after the Federal Reserve's minutes from its January policy meeting showed bullish sentiment among policymakers, confirming their intention to raise interest rates this year.
Higher yields generally hurt stock prices by making bonds more appealing to investors. They also make it more expensive for people and companies to borrow money. Earlier this month, global stock markets, particularly those in the U.S., suffered big losses amid mounting concerns over the pace of inflation and Fed policy tightening.
"Volatility is back, and I actually would argue that it's a healthier state of affairs," Mr. Wytenus said. "The constant melt-up that we saw in 2017 is actually quite historically abnormal."
Shares in industrials companies posted solid gains. United Technologies rose after its chief executive said management is looking into the possibility of splitting up the industrial conglomerate into three separate businesses. The stock rose $4.32, or 3.3 percent, to $133.58. Caterpillar also notched gains, climbing $3.63, or 2.3 percent, to $158.86.
Investors bid up shares in several companies that reported encouraging results or outlooks.
Chesapeake Energy was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500, vaulting 57 cents, or 21.7 percent, to $3.20. The company led an energy sector rally.
Avis Budget Group shares also got an earnings boost. The car rental company added $5.24, or 13.4 percent, to $44.20.
Roku slumped 17.7 percent after the video streaming device company's latest guidance disappointed analysts. The stock lost $9.05 to $42.05.
Banks and other financial stocks lagged the most. Brighthouse Financial slid $2.27, or 4 percent, to $55.17.
Benchmark United States crude recovered from an early slide, adding $1.09, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $62.77 a barrel in New York.
The dollar slid to 106.75 yen from 107.65 yen on Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.2324 from $1.2288.
Gold rose 60 cents to $1,330.60 an ounce.

A Scare From Bond Yields Keeps the Market in Check

Full text: U.S. stocks closed broadly lower Wednesday, erasing an early gain, as investors reacted to a late-afternoon surge in bond yields.
Bond yields climbed to their highest level in four years after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest policy meeting. The minutes showed bullish sentiment among policymakers, confirming their intention to raise interest rates this year.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose sharply after the minutes came out, touching 2.95 percent, its highest level since January 2014. Higher bond yields indicate investors expect more risk of inflation. They also can threaten stock prices by making bonds more appealing versus stocks.
"We're moving back to normal volatility, we're moving back toward normal interest rates, normal inflation," said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. "This is what normal looks like."
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 14.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,701.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166.97 points, or 0.7 percent, to 24,797.78. The blue chip average had been 300 points higher before the late-afternoon slide.
The Nasdaq gave up 16.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,218.23. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks shed most of its gains from earlier in the day. It inched up 1.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,531.84.
The major stock indexes started the day on pace to recoup some of the market's losses from a day earlier as investors sized up the latest crop of company earnings.
Technology companies, retailers and industrial stocks led the way for much of the day. The rally kicked into a higher gear shortly after the Fed minutes release.
Traders appeared to initially welcome the details in the meeting minutes, which show that a majority of Fed officials at the meeting believed that improving global economic prospects and the effects of recently passed tax cuts had raised the prospect for solid economic growth and for continued interest rate increases in 2018.
The Fed did not raise rates at the January meeting, which occurred before the February stock market plunge and turbulence.
Then bond yields began to climb, and the stock market rally began to evaporate. For a while, bank shares jumped in response to the rise in bond yields, which can benefit banks by allowing them to charge higher interest rates on loans. But soon banks stocks also slid into the red.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is used as a benchmark for mortgages and other loans, has been rising in recent months from a recent low of 2.04 percent in September.
The pickup in yields has begun to make bonds more attractive as an alternative to stocks, which makes some investors uneasy.
Despite the broader market slide, investors bid up shares in some companies that reported better-than-expected earnings or outlooks Wednesday.
Advance Auto Parts vaulted 8.2 percent after reporting better earnings than analysts were expecting. The stock was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $8.65 to $114. Shares in rival auto parts retailer AutoZone also rose, climbing $6.26, or 0.9 percent, to $719.49.
La-Z-Boy also got a lift from its latest quarterly report card, rising $2.85, or 9.9 percent, to $31.75.
Walmart shares continued to slide Wednesday, a day after posting its biggest single-day drop in 30 years. The stock lost $2.59, or 2.8 percent, to $91.52.
Devon Energy slid 11.8 percent after the energy company disclosed a smaller-than-expected profit and 2018 forecast that raised concerns with analysts. The stock gave up $4.08 to $30.57.
Benchmark U.S. crude fell 11 cents to settle at $61.68 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 17 cents to close at $65.42 per barrel in London.
In other energy futures trading, heating oil was little changed at $1.93 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline added a penny to $1.76 a gallon. Natural gas rose 4 cents to $2.66 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The dollar rose to 107.78 yen from 107.30 yen on Tuesday. The euro weakened to $1.2300 from $1.2336.
Gold rose 90 cents to $1,332.10 an ounce. Silver added 18 cents to $16.62 an ounce. Copper gained 3 cents to $3.22 a pound.
Major indexes in Europe ended mostly higher. Germany's DAX slipped 0.1 percent, while France's CAC 40 rose 0.2 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.5 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.8 percent. Australia's S&P ASX 200 edged 0.1 percent higher. The Kospi in South Korea added 0.6 percent. India's Sensex gained 0.3 percent. Shares in Southeast Asia were mixed.

Full text: What will President Trump's first recession look like?
The question is not that far-fetched. The current economic expansion is already the third longest since the middle of the 19th century, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. If it makes it past June of next year it will be the longest on record.
While the economy is hardly booming, trundling along at an annual growth rate of about 2.5 percent, investors are getting jittery.
The stock market tumble after the government reported an uptick in wages last month suggests just how worried investors on Wall Street are that the Federal Reserve might start increasing interest rates more aggressively to forestall inflation. And the tax cuts and spending increases pumped into an expanding economy since December shorten the odds that the Fed will step in forcefully in the not-too-distant future to bring an overheated expansion to an end.
It is hardly premature to ask, in this light, how the Trump administration might manage the fallout from the economic downturn that everybody knows will happen. Unfortunately, the United States could hardly be less prepared.
Not only does the government have precious few tools at its disposal to combat a downturn. By slashing taxes while increasing spending, President Trump and his allies in Congress have further boxed the economy into a corner, reducing the space for emergency government action were it to be needed.
The federal debt burden is now the heaviest it has been in 70 years. And it is expected to get progressively heavier, as the budget deficit swells.
To top it off, a Republican president and a Republican Congress seem set on completing the longstanding Republican project to gut the safety net built by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson, which they blame for encouraging sloth, and replace it with a leaner welfare regime that closely ties government benefits to hard work.
As noted in a new set of proposals by leading academics to combat poverty, published Tuesday by the Russell Sage Foundation, anti-poverty policies and related social-welfare benefits over the last quarter-century "have largely shifted from a system of guaranteed income support to a work-based safety net."
The economists Hilary Hoynes of the University of California, Berkeley, and Marianne Bitler of the University of California, Davis, pointed out in a recent paper that "the safety net for low-income families with children has transformed from one subsidizing out-of-work families into one subsidizing in-work families."
And yet, as many unemployed Americans discovered the last time recession hit, government benefits that require recipients to hold a job become worthless when there is no work to be had.
Consider what happened the last time around, when the bursting of the housing bubble pushed millions of workers out of their jobs. The Fed quickly slashed interest rates to zero. Months later it started buying billions of dollars' worth of bonds from financial institutions to lower long-term interest rates and encourage borrowing.
The Obama administration hurried to cobble together an economic stimulus package of more than $1 trillion to get money to families that needed it most. It expanded the eligibility for unemployment insurance to its longest duration ever, 99 weeks. It raised the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers. It more than doubled the budget for food stamps -- the poor's last line of defense.
The economy failed to snap back as the administration hoped. Unemployment remained at 9 percent or more for over two years. But the administration's intervention to bolster the nation's welfare programs made a decisive difference for millions who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks of the nation's threadbare safety net.
Using a broad definition of income and poverty that includes the effects of the complete array of government tools to support low-income families, Professors Hoynes and Bitler concluded that food stamps were critical to stem poverty.
Had food stamps not been available, they estimated, the share of Americans under 65 living below the poverty line would have exceeded 11 percent in 2010, almost 1.5 percentage points more than was the case. The share of Americans in extreme poverty -- with less than half the resources of the simply poor -- would have exceeded 4 percent, about a third more than it turned out to be. Unemployment insurance had a roughly similar impact on poverty levels.
What is critical to note is that each of the two programs did more to relieve extreme poverty during the depths of the Great Recession than even the earned-income tax credit, the main source of government support for low-income Americans.
Indeed, expenditures per capita from the earned-income tax credit increased only modestly after the recession hit. And spending by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the patchwork of state-run programs that emerged from welfare reform in 1996 to replace the poor's entitlement to federal cash assistance, did not respond to the recession at all.
This is a problem for vulnerable Americans bracing for the next economic shock, because if Mr. Trump and his colleagues in Congress have their way, the only surviving bit of the social safety net when the next recession hits will probably require beneficiaries to work. The earned-income tax credit is likely to survive unscathed. Food stamps are not.
Assiduously looking for places to cut spending to temper a growing budget deficit, the White House seems more than willing to pare the safety net. The budget it unveiled this month called for a 27 percent cut to the food stamp budget and a 20 percent cut to Section 8 housing assistance by 2028.
The administration already allows states to impose work requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries to shave the program's costs. And the latest White House budget requested a 22.5 percent cut to Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies by 2028 by repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.
While the Trump administration is unlikely to end unemployment insurance, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program expired at the end of 2013. In some states, benefits expire in as little as 12 weeks.
Policy could change in the face of a new economic downturn, to be sure. There are plenty of places where the social safety net could be improved. The Russell Sage proposals include everything from a universal child allowance to a renter's tax credit; from subsidizing employment to a public works program paying a living wage.
Yet somehow I can't see Mr. Trump and Republican allies like the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, allowing able-bodied Americans off the hook. They may not quite endorse the infamous words attributed by President Herbert Hoover to his Treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon, as the Great Depression bore down on the economy -- "Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate" -- but I wouldn't be surprised if all they have to say when the next recession liquidates work is "Get a job."

Full text: MEXICO CITY -- With Venezuela suffering one of the most severe economic collapses of modern times, the beleaguered administration of President Nicolás Maduro announced on Tuesday that it had begun a presale of virtual currency backed by the nation's vast petroleum reserves.
The government, which had announced plans for the new digital currency late last year, said the initiative was a response to a financial crisis marked by a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation.
The country is suffering desperate scarcities of food and medicine, soaring crime rates and the collapse of public services and the health system. The crisis has driven hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee the country seeking a better life.
The Maduro administration hopes that sales of the digital currency, known as the petro, will help its treasury pay off debt and increase imports of vitally needed goods, as well as raw materials for manufacturing.
Venezuelan officials also asserted that the new digital currency -- the first to be issued by a nation -- would allow investors to do an end run around sanctions imposed against their country by the Trump administration. These sanctions ban the purchase in American markets of new securities issued by the Venezuelan government, and outlaw business dealings with Mr. Maduro and several top administration officials.
"For big problems, big solutions," Mr. Maduro said Tuesday night at a ceremony in Caracas. "We Venezuelans are indomitable."
He called it a "cryptocurrency to take on Superman."
But many analysts and critics of the government did not give the digital currency much hope of success.
"I just think it's a desperate move by a regime that is increasingly isolated and has an economy that has spiraled out of its control," said Cynthia J. Arnson, director of the Latin American Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
The Venezuelan government has said the value of the petro will be tied in some way to the value of a barrel of Venezuelan oil. But the Maduro administration has not given many details on how this pricing would work, and many investors have said they would not trust the government to faithfully maintain the link between the petro and the price of oil.
"The petro will most likely suffer all of the same ills as Venezuelan debt," predicted David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has researched Venezuela for more than two decades.
A spokesman for the United States Treasury Department warned American investors last month that the petro might still run afoul of the sanctions, telling Reuters that the currency "would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government" and could "expose U.S. persons to legal risk."
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democratic, wrote to the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, in January, asking him to monitor the situation closely.
"We have serious doubts about whether Venezuela has the capacity to launch a cryptocurrency," the letter said. "But regardless, it is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular."
Critics of the Maduro administration, including many in the international community, attribute the nation's economic problems to government mismanagement. Mr. Maduro blames a conspiracy involving the political opposition working in concert with foreign governments, especially the United States.
On Monday, Mr. Maduro made an overture to President Trump, inviting him for bilateral talks through a Twitter post.
"@RealDonaldTrump campaigned promoting noninterference in other countries' domestic affairs, " he said. "The time has come to fulfill it and change your agenda of aggression for one of dialogue."
Mr. Maduro added: "Dialogue in Caracas or in Washington, D.C.?"
The Trump administration has sought to justify its sanctions against Venezuelan officials by accusing them of political repression and public corruption.
Last month, while adding four more names to the growing list of Venezuelan officials placed in the sanctions list, the Treasury Department criticized the nation's all-powerful Constituent Assembly for prohibiting three major opposition parties from participating in the presidential election.
Mr. Maduro will be running for re-election in the April race, and with his government in control of the electoral machinery and the highest court, he is expected to win. But the United States, Colombia and other countries have already declared that they will not recognize the results.
Ms. Arnson said the introduction of the currency could provide a political lift to Mr. Maduro's re-election ambitions.
"Looking like you're doing something to save the economy, that goes beyond paying off your foreign creditors, is an important part of the electoral strategy," she said. "But I think this is fantasy-land in terms of being an economic life jacket."
The Venezuelan government's petro initiative is one of the wildest outgrowths of an explosion in activity around virtual currencies over the last year. Inspired by the skyrocketing price of Bitcoin in 2017, many entrepreneurs raised money by creating and selling their own virtual currencies in so-called initial coin offerings.
Many governments around the world have also been examining whether it would make sense to issue their own electronic currencies on something similar to the network that Bitcoin runs on, with the Bank of England and the People's Bank of China announcing experiments.
Russian government officials have also discussed issuing some sort of crypto-ruble, to evade American sanctions.
But no government has moved ahead more swiftly, and with more abandon, than Venezuela.
The documents that have been put out by the Venezuelan government suggest that the petro's release will be similar to the offerings done by private companies.
The petro white paper said the process would begin with a presale of digital tokens, to gauge demand, and then be followed by an "Initial Coin Offer," with 82 million petros released to the public. The petros are then supposed to be tradable on virtual currency exchanges around the world, the white paper says.
A petro website says the Venezuelan government will accept the petro for tax payments and fees. Mr. Maduro directed the state oil company, PDVSA, and other public companies to handle a percentage of their sales and purchases in petros.
Coin offerings have been attractive to entrepreneurs because investors can send their money using Bitcoin or other existing virtual currencies, which do not go through banks or other institutions that could decline the transactions.
The movement of money outside of the traditional banking system has allowed coin offerings to go ahead even though American regulators have said that most of them are probably violating the law.
The same structure could be beneficial to Venezuela, given that it is facing American sanctions that have made it hard to raise money through established channels.
For investors, though, the petro may be a hard sell, given that the system will be designed and controlled by the Venezuelan government, which has not been the most reliable financial player.
The Venezuelan government has said the value of the petro will be tied in some way to the value of a barrel of Venezuelan oil. But the Maduro administration has not given many details on how this pricing would work, and many investors have said they would not trust the government to faithfully maintain the link between the petro and the price of oil.
The design of the petro, while clearly inspired by Bitcoin, would, in some ways, be the opposite of most virtual currencies like Bitcoin, which are designed to operate without any central government or authority in charge.
Bitcoin has largely won over investors because there is no central authority that could suddenly change the number of Bitcoins to be released, or the rules of the network.
With the petro, on the other hand, the confidence of investors is likely to be only as strong as their confidence in the Maduro government.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: The tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law now has more supporters than opponents, buoying Republican hopes for this year's congressional elections.
The growing public support for the law coincides with an eroding Democratic lead when voters are asked which party they would like to see control Congress. And it follows an aggressive effort by Republicans, backed by millions of dollars of advertising from conservative groups, to persuade voters of the law's benefits.
That campaign has rallied support from Republicans, in particular. But in contrast with many other issues -- including Mr. Trump's job approval rating -- it also appears to be winning over some Democrats. Support for the law remains low among Democrats, but it has doubled over the past two months and is twice as strong as their approval of Mr. Trump today.
Erin Parker, a high school history teacher in San Antonio, said she did not like many elements of the law, particularly its big reduction of the estate tax, and said she was skeptical that it would provide much of an economic lift. But Ms. Parker, who described herself as an independent who tends to support Democrats, said the bill would probably help the technology start-up where her husband works.
"Hearing about the implications for my husband's business improved my view of it a bit," she said.
Over all, 51 percent of Americans approve of the tax law, while 46 percent disapprove, according to a poll for The New York Times conducted between Feb. 5 and Feb. 11 by SurveyMonkey. Approval has risen from 46 percent in January and 37 percent in December, when the law was passed.
"Public opinion is moving in the direction of this bill," said Jon Cohen, chief research officer for SurveyMonkey. "Considering where it was, it is dramatically different."
Mr. Cohen cautioned that the bill still was not particularly popular, and opposition among Democrats remained strong. Still, support has grown even among Democrats, from 8 percent just before the bill passed in December to 19 percent this month. For Democrats, Mr. Cohen said, running on opposition to the bill has become more of a political gamble.
"It's less of a sure bet than it seemed in December," he said. "This isn't a problem yet for Democrats, but the movement isn't a positive one."
Other recent polls have shown similar upswings for the law, including a Monmouth University Poll in late January that found support for it had risen to 44 percent nationally, from 26 percent in December.
"I think we are essentially seeing Republicans 'come home' on the tax plan in our data," said Lori Weigel, a partner with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm. "That is certainly in part due to consistent communications about the tax plan and the news coverage of prominent companies investing in workers."
Democrats have done little to counter the Republican messaging and concede it has had an effect, along with a series of high-profile company announcements of bonuses, raises or other benefits attributed to tax savings.
But they are ramping up efforts to rebrand the law as disproportionately helping shareholders and the wealthy, and they contend the boost from bonus announcements will fade.
"There's only so long you can push a one-time bonus," said Nicole Gill, executive director of Tax March, a liberal group that has organized rallies and protests against the new law. "The fundamentals of the bill remain the same. The bill that passed is the bill that polled at 35 percent in December, and Democrats should keep talking about that."
The Times polling suggests that Americans are overestimating the degree to which the benefits of the law's corporate tax cuts are flowing straight to workers -- while underestimating the likelihood that the law will reduce their individual taxes.
Just under one in five respondents expect to see either a raise or a bonus thanks to the law's business tax cuts. Early returns from public companies indicate that's an overshot. Just Capital, a nonprofit research organization, analyzed the 90 largest public companies that have announced how they will spend the combined $45 billion in savings they stand to receive from the tax bill this year. It found that those companies planned to pass 6 percent of those savings directly on to workers, with more than half of that spending in one-time bonuses.
"That does not really track to how the public thinks the companies should be spending that money," said Martin Whittaker, Just Capital's chief executive.
Only one in three respondents expects to receive a tax cut from the law. The independent Tax Policy Center in Washington estimates that four in five Americans will actually see a tax cut from the law this year, though that number is projected to shrink sharply in 2027 if individual tax cuts expire as scheduled in the law.
Republicans are confident that support will continue to grow as more Americans see lower taxes reflected in their paychecks. Their confidence was reflected last week by Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who cited Senator Heidi Heitkamp's vote against the tax bill when announcing he would run for her seat.
"There is no question the tax bill has fundamentally improved the overall political environment for Republicans," said Josh Holmes, a former campaign manager and chief of staff for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who is now president of the public affairs firm Cavalry in Washington.
Close to half of Americans now expect some direct benefit from the law -- either a tax cut or a salary increase or bonus. Support for the bill is far stronger among that group: More than three-quarters of Americans approve of the law, compared with fewer than a third who don't expect a benefit or aren't sure.
Gina Coats, a project manager for a plumbing company in Springfield, Mo., said she didn't follow the tax debate closely last fall. But in January, when she began preparing the company's payroll systems to handle the new law's provisions, she realized almost every employee would take home an extra $20 to $40 per week.
"Everyone seems to be a little more upbeat," Ms. Coats said. "It's causing people to let go of their money a little more easily."
Ms. Coats puts herself in that category. A few days ago, she called a contractor to move forward with a long-delayed plan to replace the roof on her house. That decision reflected her tax savings, she said, but also the strength of the local economy, which has meant lots of projects for her company, and stability for its employees.
"If we have more work in the bag, then I feel more comfortable," Ms. Coats said.
Republicans have long promoted tax cuts as a way to encourage economic growth. Many economists are skeptical of that approach when unemployment is low and the Federal Reserve is moving to tamp down inflation. Rising support for the bill has coincided with an uptick in consumer confidence, although there aren't yet clear signs that Americans are spending more.
Colleen Doering, who runs a small facilities maintenance business outside Orlando, Fla., said she and her husband were paying several hundred dollars a month less in taxes because of the new law. As a result, they recently decided to spend $10,000 on a landscaping project and started to plan a vacation.
"My paycheck has increased, and if I see it in my paycheck, then I know my employees are seeing it in theirs," Ms. Doering said.
And the law's corporate tax cuts are giving the Doerings more money to spend on marketing, which they hope will allow them to expand their three-year-old business and hire more people. That may not be easy, however. Ms. Doering said it was already hard to find good workers, and the stimulus provided by the tax cuts could make it even harder.
"It was becoming more challenging to find good, solid employees with the right skill sets," Ms. Doering said. "It's even more challenging because some of these larger companies are grabbing up even more employees."
About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 10,255 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Feb. 5 to Feb. 11. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.

Full text: The biggest drop in Walmart's stock in 30 years and losses in other sectors pulled U.S. indexes lower Tuesday, snapping a six-day winning streak.
The losses deepened in the last hour of trading into a broad sell-off that erased early gains led by technology companies.
Walmart plunged 10 percent after reporting weak online sales and disappointing earnings. Grocery store operators, retailers, health care companies and industrial stocks accounted for much of the market's slide.
"Investors have been lulled into a false sense that stock markets are not volatile," said Doug Cote, chief market strategist for Voya Investment Management. "Last week was one of the best weeks in years, and as we go back to normal volatility, you're going to see what you would expect: normal ups and downs."
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 15.96 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,716.26. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 254.63 points, or 1 percent, to 24,964.75. The Nasdaq lost 5.16 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,234.31. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 13.56 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,529.99.
The S&P 500, a benchmark for many index funds, capped its strongest week in five years on Friday, recovering more than half of the losses it suffered in a plunge at the beginning of this month. Stocks began giving back some of those gains early Tuesday as trading reopened after a long holiday weekend and investors began sizing up company earnings while keeping an eye on the bond market.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which is used as a benchmark for mortgages and other loans, has been rising in recent months from a low of 2.04 percent in September. Higher bond yields indicate investors expect more risk of inflation, and they also can threaten stock prices by making bonds more appealing versus stocks.
"Some of the broader concerns on investors' minds right now are looking across to the bond market and seeing the 10-year Treasury starting to approach that 3 percent level," said Bill Northey, vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
Bond prices, which had been declining early Tuesday, ended up little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 2.88.
Walmart posted the biggest loss in the Dow and S&P 500. The tumble represents the stock's worst single-day drop since January 1988. Investors were disappointed with the retail giant's fourth-quarter results, which missed Wall Street's expectations as the company wrestled with slower e-commerce sales during the busiest time of the year.
The stock shed $10.67, or 10.2 percent, to $94.11.
Several big retailers also fell, including Target, which slid $2.22, or 3 percent, to $72.86. Ross Stores dropped $2.19, or 2.7 percent, to $77.98.
Gap declined 5 percent after the clothing chain said the head of the Gap brand will leave the company. Jeff Kirwan, who has been with the company since 2004, had led the namesake brand since the end of 2014. The Gap said Kirwan had failed to achieve "the operational excellence and accelerated profit growth" that the company expected for the Gap brand. The stock lost $1.66 to $31.61.
Genuine Parts gave up 5.2 percent after the auto and industrial parts company gave a disappointing profit forecast for 2018. The stock fell $5.16 to $94.67.
Company deals offset some of the market slide.
NXP Semiconductor jumped 6 percent after Qualcomm raised its offer for the company to $127.50 a share, or $43.22 billion, from $110 a share. The move comes as Broadcom is trying to buy Qualcomm. Shares in NXP added $7.06 to $125.56. Qualcomm lost 86 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $63.99.
Traders also welcomed news that grocery store operator Albertsons agreed to buy more than 2,500 Rite Aid stores. Albertsons owns brands including Safeway. The deal will double the amount of drugstores it owns.
Last year, Rite Aid had agreed to sell almost 2,000 locations to Walgreens after a larger deal fell apart. Rite Aid's stock, which has shed more than half its value over the past year, rose 7 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $2.20.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose 22 cents to settle at $61.90 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 42 cents to close at $65.25 a barrel.
In other energy futures trading, heating oil added 2 cents to $1.93 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.75 a gallon. Natural gas rose 6 cents to $2.62 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell $25, or 1.8 percent, to $1,331.20 an ounce. Silver dropped 27 cents to $16.44 an ounce. Copper slid 6 cents to $3.19 a pound.
The dollar rose to 107.30 yen from 106.55 yen on Friday. The euro weakened to $1.2336 from $1.2408.
Major indexes in Europe ended mostly higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.8 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 was flat.
Earlier in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 inched lower. South Korea's Kospi lost 1.1 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8 percent. Stocks were mixed in Southeast Asia, while markets in mainland China were still closed for lunar new year holidays.

Full text: Even those who have long since accepted the premise that Donald Trump is corrupt, self-centered and dishonest seem a bit shocked by his tirades over the Presidents' Day weekend. Using the Parkland, Fla., massacre as an excuse to attack the F.B.I. for investigating Russian election intervention on his behalf -- while lying about his own past denials that such intervention took place -- took vileness to a new level, which is truly impressive given Trump's previous record.
Yet if you step back a bit and think about it, Trump's latest outbursts were very much in character -- and I don't just mean his personal character. When did you last see a member of the Trump administration, or for that matter any prominent Republican, admit error or accept responsibility for problems?
Don't say that it has always been that way, that it's just the way people are. On the contrary, taking responsibility for your actions -- what my parents called being a mensch -- used to be considered an essential virtue in politicians and adults in general. And in this as in so many things, there's a huge asymmetry between the parties. Of course not all Democrats are honest and upstanding; but as far as I can tell, there's almost nobody left in the G.O.P. willing to take responsibility for, well, anything.
And I don't think this is an accident. The sad content of modern Republican character is a symptom of the corruption and hypocrisy that has afflicted half of our body politic -- a sickness of the soul that manifests itself in personal behavior as well as policy.
Before I talk about that sickness, consider a few non-Trump examples of the lack of character that pervades this administration.
At the trivial but still telling end of the scale, we have the tale of Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who keeps flying first class at taxpayers' expense. The money isn't the important issue here, although his spending violates federal guidelines. The revealing thing, instead, is the supposed reason he needs to fly premium -- you see, ordinary coach passengers have been known to say critical things to his face.
Remember this story the next time someone talks about liberal "snowflakes."
More seriously, consider the behavior of John Kelly, Trump's chief of staff, whose record of slandering critics and refusing to admit error is starting to rival his boss's. Remember when Kelly made false accusations about Representative Frederica Wilson and refused to retract those accusations even after video showed they were false?
More recently, Kelly insisted that he didn't know the full details about domestic abuse allegations against Rob Porter until, a White House staff member said, "40 minutes before he threw him out" -- a claim that seems at odds with everything we know about this story. Even if this claim were true, an apology for his obliviousness seems in order. But these guys don't apologize.
Oh, and by the way: Roy Moore still hasn't conceded.
So it's not just Trump. And it didn't start with Trump. In fact, way back in 2006 I wrote about the "mensch gap" in the Bush administration -- the unwillingness of top officials to accept responsibility for the botched occupation of Iraq, the botched response to Hurricane Katrina, and more.
Nor, by the way, are we only talking about politicians. In my neck of the woods, I remain amazed by the unwillingness of right-leaning economists to admit that they were wrong in predicting that the Fed's efforts to rescue the economy would cause runaway inflation. Being wrong is one thing -- it happens to everyone, myself very much included. Refusing to admit and learn from error is something different.
And let's be clear: Personal responsibility isn't dead everywhere. You can ask, for example, whether Hillary Clinton apologized sufficiently for her initial support of the Iraq war or her missteps in 2016 -- but she did admit to making mistakes, which nobody on the other side ever seems to do.
So what happened to the character of the G.O.P.? I'm pretty sure that in this case the personal is, ultimately, political. The modern G.O.P. is, to an extent never before seen in American history, a party built around bad faith, around pretending that its concerns and goals are very different from what they really are. Flag-waving claims of patriotism, pious invocations of morality, stern warnings about fiscal probity are all cover stories for an underlying agenda mainly concerned with making plutocrats even richer.
And the character flaws of the party end up being echoed by the character flaws of its most prominent members. Are they bad people who chose their political affiliation because it fits their proclivities, or potentially good people corrupted by the company they keep? Probably some of both.
In any case, let's be clear: America in 2018 is not a place where we can disagree without being disagreeable, where there are good people and good ideas on both sides, or whatever other bipartisan homily you want to recite. We are, instead, living in a kakistocracy, a nation ruled by the worst, and we need to face up to that unpleasant reality.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
MARKETS
Markets will be closed for Presidents' Day.
In observance of Presidents' Day, financial markets and most banks in the United States will be closed on Monday. The holiday, established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington, is now generally viewed as a day to celebrate all United States presidents. For most Americans, though, the day has become an occasion to hit the stores for sales over the long weekend. Mathew Brownstein
ECONOMY
The European Central Bank picks a new vice president.
Finance ministers from the eurozone, meeting in Brussels, are expected on Monday to recommend a replacement for Vítor Constâncio, the vice president of the European Central Bank, whose term expires at the end of May. The only two candidates are Luis de Guindos, the economics minister of Spain, who is the favorite; and Philip Lane, the governor of Ireland's central bank. The selection of a new vice president is the first in a series of major personnel decisions that could alter the character of the central bank. The culmination will be the choice of a successor to Mario Draghi, the president, whose term expires in October 2019. Jack Ewing
RETAIL
Walmart's earnings may show the strength of e-commerce.
Walmart reports its fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday. Analysts will bee looking for signs that the nation's largest retailer can continue to build out its e-commerce business without greatly eroding profits. Walmart is also expected to release details on its sales from the holidays, which were strong for many retailers. Michael Corkery
BANKING
Big British banks will report earnings.
Investors will be focused on British banks as that nation's largest lenders are scheduled report their fourth-quarter results, including HSBC on Tuesday, Lloyds Banking Group on Wednesday, Barclays on Thursday and Royal Bank of Scotland on Friday.
Several of Europe's biggest banks have taken large charges in the fourth quarter as they have been hit by changing tax laws, particularly in the United States. Last week, Credit Suisse reported a fourth-quarter loss of 2.13 billion francs, or about $2.3 billion, driven primarily by 2.23 billion francs in income tax expenses as a result of tax changes in the United States. Chad Bray
ECONOMY
The Fed will release details about its January meeting.
The Federal Reserve spent much of last year debating whether inflation was rising too slowly. New year, new problem: A federal tax cut took effect in January, the unemployment rate is just 4.1 percent and investors are now worried that inflation might start rising too quickly. That, in turn, could prompt the Fed to accelerate the upward drift of its benchmark interest rate. So far, there's no sign that the Fed has adjusted its plans. The central bank, as expected, left the benchmark rate unchanged at its first meeting of the year, in late January. It will publish an account of that meeting on Wednesday, providing at least a little more information about its outlook and its plans for the coming year. Binyamin Appelbaum
The E.C.B. sheds light on the eurozone economy.
The European Central Bank will publish on Thursday an account of the discussion that took place last month when its Governing Council met to decide monetary policy. Investors and analysts will dissect the minutes for clues about how fast the central bank will wind down its stimulus to the eurozone economy. Interest in the European Central Bank's intentions is particularly acute. One of the main things causing turmoil in global stock markets recently is uncertainty about how soon central banks will bring an end to the easy credit that has prevailed for the decade since the financial crisis. Jack Ewing
AUTO INDUSTRY
Diesel may have a day of reckoning in Germany.
Germany's highest administrative court, based in Leipzig, will hear arguments on Thursday -- and may issue a ruling -- on whether cities should be forced to take stronger action to address auto emissions. That could include bans on diesel cars. An environmental group filed the suit arguing that measures taken so far by Düsseldorf and Stuttgart are inadequate, exposing citizens to nitrogen oxide emissions that regularly exceed legal limits. A ruling against the cities would have far-reaching effects in Germany, where many urban areas suffer from excess pollution that comes mainly from diesels. Jack Ewing
INSURANCE
Warren Buffett sends his annual letter.
Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders has become one of corporate America's most combed-over dispatches. For more than 50 years, Mr. Buffett's letter has not just expounded on the conglomerate's performance but also dispensed investment advice, folksy wisdom and a few corny jokes. The latest missive arrives on Saturday. Last year, Berkshire Hathaway's insurance business was hit by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and an earthquake in Mexico. The company also made another bet on the United States economy with its purchase of a nearly 40 percent stake in Pilot Travel Centers, a truck stop operator. But investors will also be looking for any further discussion of succession after Berkshire Hathaway promoted Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain to oversee the company's many and varied businesses.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Hail, King T'Challa.
The Disney-Marvel movie "Black Panther," which finds the superheroic T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returning to his remote African kingdom to assume the throne, roared into theaters over the weekend as a full-blown cultural event, breaking box office records and shattering a myth about the overseas viability of movies rooted in black culture. Global ticket sales by Monday will total an estimated $387 million, according to comScore.
"Black Panther" instantly became the top-grossing film in history by a black director (Ryan Coogler) and featuring a largely black cast. The previous record-holder was "Straight Outta Compton," which collected $214 million worldwide in 2015 -- over its entire run -- after adjusting for inflation.
[ Did you see "Black Panther" this weekend? Talk about spoilers here. ]
Disney, which supported "Black Panther" with a lavish nine-month marketing campaign, said on Sunday that ticket sales for the film in North America will total roughly $218 million between Friday and Monday. Theaters scrambled to add show times to accommodate crowds; AMC Southlake 24 in suburban Atlanta squeezed in 84 show times on Friday alone. In many cities, moviegoers arrived in outfits inspired by the film.
Analysts had expected "Black Panther" to arrive to about $165 million in North American ticket sales, which would itself have been an astounding result for a release outside the holiday and summer corridors. The previous domestic record-holder for a February release was "Deadpool," which collected an adjusted $159 million over Presidents' Day weekend in 2016.
North American audiences appeared to love "Black Panther" as much as critics, signaling a strong run ahead. The euphorically reviewed film received a rare A-plus grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls. Black viewers made up about 37 percent of the domestic turnout, according to PostTrak, fueled by large numbers of church and school groups, not to mention pent-up demand for a superhero film led by black actors.
There was never any doubt that "Black Panther" would rock the North American box office. Kevin Feige, the prodigy who runs Marvel, and Alan F. Horn, Disney's movie chairman, have delivered one juggernaut after another. Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, took a personal interest in "Black Panther," approving its $200 million production budget (at least 30 percent more than budgets for other Marvel nonsequels like "Doctor Strange" and "Ant-Man") despite concern by some at Disney about sales of "Black Panther" toys.
"The concept of an African story, with actors of African descent at the forefront, combined with the scale of modern franchise filmmaking, is something that hasn't really been seen before," Mr. Coogler, the director, told The Hollywood Reporter. "You feel like you're getting the opportunity of seeing something fresh, being a part of something new, which I think all audiences want to experience regardless of whether they are of African descent or not."

But no one quite knew how "Black Panther" would perform overseas.
Big-budget films that focus on black characters have long been held back by the Hollywood argument -- a ridiculous one, in the eyes of many critics -- that foreign audiences have little interest in films with largely black casts. It has been a self-fulfilling attitude; studios, ever fixated on what kinds of movies have succeeded in the past, never challenged the assumption with a big-budget fantasy because they were always too afraid to take the risk.
"Black Panther" arrived to very strong results in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ukraine, South Korea, Mexico and Brazil, in many cases beating initial ticket sales for Marvel nonsequels based on lesser-known characters, including "Guardians of the Galaxy" in 2014.
"Black Panther" was softer in Germany, an important market, where the sadomasochistic "Fifty Shades Freed" outsold it.
"We're extremely pleased with the reaction around the world, even more so because we face nothing competitively for a month," said Dave Hollis, Disney's president of distribution.
Disney will release "Black Panther" in Russia, China and Japan in the weeks ahead. Success in China, the world's fastest-growing movie market, would be particularly sweet. If audiences there do not respond, however, it could have little to do with race. Hollywood imports are losing their luster in China as local studios become more skilled at making blockbuster-style movies. (Over the weekend in China, the locally produced "Monster Hunt 2" arrived to more than $130 million in ticket sales. Lionsgate gave it a 69-screen release in the United States, collecting $390,000.)
[ALSO READ: Black Panther Cosplayers: 'We're Helping People See Us as Heroes']
The frenzy surrounding "Black Panther" has been puzzling to some.
"It's an important chipping away at this Hollywood notion that somehow studios are taking a bigger risk if they cast nonwhite actors, but I don't see it as a profound change," said Todd Boyd, a cinema and media studies professor at the University of Southern California who focuses on popular culture and race. "I ultimately see it as exploiting a profitable niche."
"To me, there is real change afoot when diverse actors are cast in roles that are not inherently diverse," Mr. Boyd added.
But many people stood in line to praise Disney for pushing toward more diverse filmmaking. Richard Gelfond, chief executive of Imax, the large-format movie exhibitor, which played "Black Panther" in more than 60 countries, championed Disney for delivering "content that is compelling on its face but also bridges the gap between different cultures, and ultimately is a reflection of the shared values of moviegoers all over the world."
Phil Contrino, director of media and research for the National Association of Theater Owners, noted the power of seeing "Black Panther" in a communal setting on a big screen. "Hopefully someday we'll look back at the release of 'Black Panther' as the turning point when diversity and positive representation in blockbusters switched from being an anomaly to being normal," Mr. Contrino said.
And Stacy L. Smith, an author of blistering studies about Hollywood's lack of diversity, wrote on Twitter in a message to Mr. Iger, who has made inclusion a priority across Disney: "We have been watching; lead & supporting roles have been changing as well as behind the camera. There is more to be done but this weekend is a giant leap forward."

Full text: The stock market has been shaken by turbulence in the last few weeks, something it hasn't experienced in a few years.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index plunged more than 10 percent from Jan. 26 to Feb. 8, a sell-off that pushed the market into a correction. The S.&P. has since rebounded, regaining much of those losses. That type of volatility is a normal occurrence, but theories abound to explain what caused it.
Adam I. Taback, deputy chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank, said the volatility was the result of the economic expansion's being in the seventh or eighth inning of a baseball game.
"We may have extra innings in this cycle," he said. "But people are more cognizant that the equity markets have more risk in them. They're happy that their portfolios are diversified but worried where they are in the economic cycle."
Some try to take a more historical view. Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, said volatility typically arose for three reasons: a technical correction where stocks pause but continue rising because company fundamentals are sound; a correction that reflects a change in the business cycle; or a systemic correction, like the 1929 stock market crash or 2008 financial crisis.
"The one we experienced last week was the mildest," Mr. Ablin said. In other words, just a technical correction.
Others think it was a return to the normal function of a stock market: Some days, investors sell more stock than they buy.
"When the Dow drops 1,000 points, that's more a testament to the growth of the Dow," said Francis M. Kinniry, head of portfolio construction at Vanguard. "That's still just a 4 percent move, because the Dow is at 25,000. Dropping 100 points on the S.&P. 500 doesn't get people upset, but it's the same thing."
Who is correct won't be known for months, or years, when market historians look back. That's cold comfort for investors who are worried now. A report on Wednesday showed that inflation pressures appeared to be building, heightening the anxiety among investors.
Don't fret. Here are five tips from professionals that could help ensure that a volatile ride doesn't derail your financial planning.
Pick individual winners. With wild swings in the markets, active investment managers -- those who buy and sell individual stocks instead of allocating money to an investment fund that tracks an index -- say their skills are more in need now.
They argue that stocks are going to begin to show differences and that their skills at stock selection will keep investors' portfolios from being dragged down with an entire index. In other words, in a market where everything isn't going up, selecting the best individual companies makes more sense.
Francisco Bido, the head of quantitative research and a portfolio manager at Cognios Capital, said he had reduced the number of stocks he invested in after the recent volatility. The move came out of conviction, not fear, he said.
"A lot of those big passive vehicles out there buy so many stocks because they have a mandate to track an index," he said. "I think it helps to be a bit more concentrated. It allows investors to find a different avenue."
His strategy is also an argument to know what you own. That's good advice in any market.
But an indexing behemoth like Vanguard says that is an overused argument. Nearly 90 percent of active managers have underperformed the indexes they track, Mr. Kinniry said.
"It's not an active versus index story," he said. "It's high cost versus low cost. They underperform because they're charging too much for the 'alpha' they generate," he added, referring to the return in excess of the market return.
Mr. Kinniry is correct that fees eat into any return, regardless of how volatile the market is.
Consider bonds carefully. Years of low interest rates have had the same lulling effect on investors as the steadily climbing stock market. But bonds, which remained low for years, are now returning a higher yield, adding pressure to the shaky stock market.
But rising interest rates could eat away returns for individual investors. Driving this worry is a new chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, who took charge on Feb. 5, as the stock market dipped.
An alternative to bonds for affluent investors is private debt, which provides loans to small and medium-size companies. The loans are generally just a few years in duration and pay an annual yield of about 10 percent. The risk is in the credit quality of the borrower.
Mr. Taback of Wells Fargo Private Bank said that although there was credit risk in the loans, private debt does not feel the same impact that bond portfolios do when interest rates rise. "Now that you're seeing losses in bond portfolios, clients are more receptive to this," he said.
Find alternative strategies. Alternative investments are the province of investors who are willing to sacrifice access to their money for higher returns. But when markets were posting double-digit gains, they became less attractive.
Hedge funds, in particular, earned a bad reputation for the high fees they charge to manage money on top of taking a share of any profits. Some sophisticated institutional managers, like the California Public Employees' Retirement System, announced in 2014 that it was getting out of hedge funds because they were too expense and complex.
But financial advisers and money managers are arguing that in a volatile investing environment, investors should reconsider hedge funds and other alternative assets like private equity, private debt and real estate. Their returns, they say, are less correlated to the fluctuations of the stock and bond markets and thus provide a steadying force.
"Last year, you could ignore risk and focus on return," said Jae Yoon, chief investment officer of New York Life Investment Management. "This year, we're getting more normal volatility, and most clients will find they don't have enough alternative strategies."
Go global. In Europe and Japan, the economic recovery started later and, the thinking goes, still has years to run. In some cases, the recoveries in Europe and Japan started in 2014, as opposed to 2009 in the United States, said Darrell L. Cronk, president of the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
He said the strong rally in the United States markets had many investors with overweight investments in American stocks, a phenomenon known as home-country bias.
But since last year, many developed and emerging markets have begun to perform strongly. "The more explosive growth is happening in the younger economies around the world," said Rick Pitcairn, chief investment officer of Pitcairn, an investment adviser to wealthy families.
Enjoy the ride. Once markets become volatile, they tend to stay that way for a while. It's a shift in investor sentiment.
"There's persistence in volatility," Mr. Kinniry said.
But volatility is not necessary a bad thing when you have a plan. Mr. Cronk pointed out that even big corrections were a normal part of an economic cycle.
The last two economic recovery cycles, in the 1990s and the 2000s, had three corrections apiece toward the end, he said. Investors who bailed after the first correction in each recovery missed out because the markets rose 20 percent afterward.
"Corrections are normal and healthy," Mr. Cronk said. "Investors should look at them opportunistically more so than be afraid of them."

Jitters Rising, With Stocks And Inflation

Full text: Two weeks ago, fears of higher-than-expected inflation and interest rates sent stocks into a historic and nerve-rattling plunge. This week, those fears were borne out: Consumer prices rose more than expected in January, and interest rates jumped.
The stock market rallied.
It's long been a truism that higher inflation and its close cousin, higher interest rates, are deadly for stock prices. But in the wake of this month's correction, and the ensuing recovery in stock prices, some market experts are saying that stocks can continue to rally even if interest rates and inflation rise, as they did Wednesday.
The bulls are backed by data showing that, during the six periods of rising 10-year Treasury rates since 1988, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained an average of 23 percent. Stocks declined in only one of those periods, and then only modestly.
"For the past 20 years, we've had a period of strong correlation between stocks and interest rates," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist for Nuveen, a TIAA subsidiary.
But "that wasn't the case for the 30 years before that," he added. And looking only at the start and end points of periods of rising rates masks considerable volatility in between, not to mention what lies just outside those periods. As rates were rising from 1998 into 2000, for instance, stocks were in one of the biggest bull markets ever, only to plunge after the technology bubble burst.
Nearly all mainstream economists agree that at some point, higher interest rates and inflation hurt stock prices. "Investors are right to be concerned," said Alan Blinder, professor of economics at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Nuveen's Mr. Nick said it's important for investors to look beyond the headlines about rising interest rates to ask why they're going up. Rising rates can be a sign of a healthy, growing economy, and if the Fed can keep it from overheating, it may well be good for stocks. But if the Fed is forced to raise rates to ward off inflation, the risks of a recession -- and lower earnings and stock prices -- are much greater.
Mr. Nick said the current situation "looks like a little bit of both," which leaves him cautiously optimistic, but in no rush to add to stock positions. He hasn't made any changes to Nuveen's model portfolio allocations.
"Unlike the last few corrections, we don't see this as a V-shape recovery, where investors might blink and miss it," he said. "I think stocks can rise by the end of the year, but it will be a slower grind back."
Others are less sanguine. The Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, who has long studied the complex relationship among interest rates, inflation and stock prices, has been warning for months that markets are highly vulnerable to rate increases and inflation. Markets face "a fragile financial situation, and potentially a steep drop somewhere up ahead," he wrote in an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal just weeks before the recent correction.
Even after the recent pullback, he expects more declines. "When interest rates rise back to normal levels, share prices are also likely to revert to previous norms," Mr. Feldstein told me this week.
That could be a long decline. Even after the recent 10 percent correction, stocks remain richly valued by historical norms. James Stack, a market historian and president of InvesTech Research, pointed out that a common valuation measure -- the price-to-earnings multiple for the S.&P. 500 -- recently went from 26 times earnings to 23.4 after the correction, which is a level reached less than 10 percent of the time since 1928. (The long-term average price-to-earnings ratio for the stock market, excluding extreme periods, is about 14.) "This is a very richly priced market no matter how you slice it," he said.
Mr. Stack recently lowered the stock portion of his model portfolio to 72 percent from 82 percent out of concern over high valuations and rising rates. He noted that during 11 periods since 1955 when the Federal Reserve was tightening credit, a so-called soft landing was achieved only twice -- in the mid-1960s and mid-1990s -- and that a recession followed in every other instance.
"Once the Fed starts a tightening cycle, it is very difficult to avoid a recession before it is over," he said. He hasn't increased the allocation since the sell-off.
Mr. Blinder told me that stock valuations reached such extreme levels that he started reducing his equity holdings several months ago. "I sold too early," he said with the benefit of hindsight. "I missed the last 15 percent gain, and I missed the 7 percent drop." He hasn't resumed buying at current levels.
The Fed is now two full years into its current cycle of rate increases, which is already longer than most tightening periods. But the benchmark interest rate for 10-year Treasuries, which has recently risen to just over 2.9 percent, still has a long way to go before reaching its long-term average of 6.24 percent. The Fed has forecast three more quarter-point rate increases this year, but that would bring the Federal funds rate only to 2.25 percent.
"Historically it's impossible to name any threshold at which rising rates might trigger a rush for the exit or a bear market," Mr. Stack said. "In most cases, stock prices can weather rising interest rates until they reach 5 to 6 percent, which was the case in 2000 and 2007."
But after years of such low interest rates, and with stock valuations extremely high, he said, "we're dealing with what might be the most interest rate-sensitive stock market in our lifetime."
If this is, indeed, the last stage of the long-running bull market, and interest rates continue to rise, as the Fed has suggested, some sectors typically perform better than others. According to InvesTech, the best performing sectors during periods of rising rates since 1972 have been health care, energy, consumer staples and telecommunications. During the last year of a bull market, the best performing sectors have been energy, health care and technology. Health care and energy show up in both categories.
Of course no one knows for sure when the bull market will end -- or whether it already has. But investors are clearly on edge, and the last few weeks may be a preview of what the end looks like.
"There are a lot of very bright people on Wall Street who are all counting on being the first out the door when the party ends," Mr. Stack said. The recent plunge, added, "showed just how small that door may get."

Full text: Technology companies climbed Thursday as stocks rose for the fifth day in a row. They have now recovered about half their losses during the market's dramatic plunge earlier this month.
Tech bellwether Cisco Systems jumped after it posted strong quarterly results and announced a big stock repurchase, while Apple rose after an analyst said sales of the iPhone X in China are improving. Most other parts of the market climbed as well, with notable gains for industrial companies and household goods makers. Energy companies continued to struggle.
It took stocks just nine days to skid from record highs into a 10 percent drop, known on Wall Street as a "correction." Concerns about rising inflation contributed to the fall, but even though investors have seen more signs of inflation in the last few days, major indexes are on a five-day winning streak and have recouped about half of their recent losses.
"The market should never have gone down 10.5 percent," said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income. Rieder noted that inflation remains low, and the newly passed government budget will push interest rates higher because it creates so much new debt.
After a brief dip late in the morning, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rallied and rose 32.57 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,731.20. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 306.88 points, or 1.2 percent, to 25,200.37. The Nasdaq composite climbed 112.81 points, or 1.6 percent, to 7,256.43.
Cisco reported a bigger profit and better sales than analysts expected, and said it will buy back another $25 billion of its own stock. It climbed $1.99, or 4.7 percent, to $44.08. Apple rose $5.62, or 3.4 percent, to $172.99 after an analyst for Morgan Stanley said the iPhone X is gaining market share in China, a critical market for Apple's products. Microsoft jumped $1.85, or 2 percent, to $92.66.
Among industrial companies, Boeing jumped $11.61, or 3.4 percent, to $356.46, and elevator and jet engine maker United Technologies gained $4, or 3.2 percent, to $130.
The market's recent moves might look familiar because investors have been "buying on the dips" for years. The last significant drop in the market prior to this month came in June 2016, after the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. The S.&P. 500 fell more than 5 percent in just two days, and gained it back almost as quickly.
Trading volumes have returned to more typical levels this week. They spiked in the first two weeks of February as stock indexes took some wild swings.
In economic news, the Labor Department said United States wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in January, the biggest increase since November. The main reason for the increase was a big jump in energy prices, and those have dropped recently.
Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.91 percent, its highest level in four years.
United States crude oil, which peaked of around $66 in late January, slumped in the morning then turned higher in afternoon trading. It rose 74 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.34 a barrel in New York.
Still, energy companies mostly fell. They have done far worse than any other part of the market lately: Of the 32 energy companies in the S.&P. 500, only six are currently higher than they were at the start of the year.
Gold lost $2.70 to $1,355.30 an ounce.
The dollar slid to 106.27 yen from 107.09 yen. The euro rose to $1.2506 from $1.2435.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Ticket buyers around the world are poised to smash another one of Hollywood's most entrenched beliefs.
Movies rooted in black culture cannot become global blockbusters? Guess again. The euphorically reviewed Disney-Marvel superhero movie "Black Panther," with an almost entirely black cast and a powerful Afrocentric story line, is expected to take in at least $250 million worldwide between Friday and Monday, according to analyst projections. Fandango, the online ticketing site, said on Thursday that "Black Panther" was its No. 4 pre-seller of all time, behind only the last three "Star Wars" movies.
An opening total in that range would put "Black Panther" on a course to become one of the year's biggest hits -- perhaps even approaching the blockbuster status attained last summer by another Hollywood myth-buster, "Wonder Woman." That Warner Bros. film ultimately collected $821.8 million worldwide, ridding the movie business of the long-held notion that female superheroes don't sell.
"One by one, these unwritten Hollywood rules about what audiences supposedly will and will not support are falling by the wayside," said Jeff Bock, a senior analyst at Exhibitor Relations, an entertainment research firm. "I think about it like a wall crumbling. In terms of 'Black Panther,' no studio can say again, 'Oh, black movies don't travel, overseas interest will be minimal."'
Disney, which has been on a box office tear, decided several years ago to make a concerted effort to promote diversity and equality on screen. But "Black Panther" also arrives at a time when studios have started to respond to growing pressure to make their big-budget movies more inclusive, driven in part by the recent #OscarsSoWhite movement. And with audiences increasingly inclined to stay home and watch Netflix, producing movies featuring lead characters with different skin colors, genders and sexualities is proving to be good business.
Attendance at theaters in North America, the world's largest movie market, dropped 6 percent in 2017, hitting a 22-year low. At the same time, studios are more reliant than ever on ticket sales. Their home-entertainment businesses -- negatively impacted by the rise of streaming services -- are collapsing to an alarming degree. The major studios reported an 18 percent drop in holiday home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, compared to a year earlier.
"Hollywood can no longer afford to take any moviegoer for granted," Mr. Bock said. "That is causing them to look at underserved groups where there is pent-up demand, and the black audience is one."
Disney, which spent roughly $350 million to make and market "Black Panther," remains cautious about declaring global victory, noting that the film will not arrive in crucial markets like China and Japan until next month. The movie, focused on one of Marvel's lesser-known superheroes and set in the fictional country of Wakanda, will be playing in 70 percent of the world by Friday, with its rollout having started on Tuesday in the United Kingdom.
But even if "Black Panther" stumbles in some countries, it will easily become the top-grossing film by a black director and with a largely black cast in Hollywood history, surpassing "Straight Outta Compton," which took in $214 million worldwide in 2015, after adjusting for inflation. "Black Panther," directed by Ryan Coogler, will also break box office records in North America, where ticket sales between Friday and Monday are expected to total about $165 million, an astounding start for a film released outside the holiday and summer corridors.
The record-holder for a February release is "Deadpool," which arrived to an adjusted $159 million in 2016 and itself challenged conventional wisdom, proving that an R-rated superhero movie could strike a broad chord. "Deadpool" went on to collect an adjusted $819 million for 20th Century Fox, which will release a sequel in May.
Another test will come on March 16, when 20th Century Fox releases "Love, Simon," a $17 million romantic comedy centered on a gay teenager. Studios have long insisted that multiplex crowds will not support same-sex love stories, dismissing "Brokeback Mountain," which took in $231 million in 2005 for Focus Features, after adjusting for inflation, as an Oscar-boosted exception to the rule. Fox is the first major studio to take a chance on a movie anchored by a gay character in memory.
"I'm done living in a world where I don't get to be who I am," Nick Robinson, playing the lead role, says in the "Love, Simon" trailer. "I deserve a great love story."
Studio chiefs keep their jobs by delivering hits, and they try to do that by avoiding constructs that have fizzled in the past. For years, female superheroes were held back by the argument -- a ridiculous one in the eyes of many critics -- that male ticket buyers would stay home if a woman led the action. The failures of the critically derided films "Catwoman" in 2004 and "Elektra" in 2005 were used as proof. As studios have become more reliant on overseas ticket sales, they have shunned movies that focus on black characters by citing lackluster foreign interest in films like "Dreamgirls" in 2007 and Tyler Perry's "Madea" series.
Some film executives even cite "Get Out" as a cautionary example. That Oscar-nominated horror movie, about racism in the liberal white suburbs, collected a robust $176 million in North America but a comparatively slight $79 million overseas.
As studios embrace a wider variety of stories with more diverse casts, they have had to confront pockets of racism, sexism and homophobia. Internet trolls tried to use Facebook to organize a campaign to falsely drag down scores for "Black Panther" on the influential review site Rotten Tomatoes. Some men had a conniption when a Texas theater organized all-women screenings for "Wonder Woman." An Alabama theater banned Disney's live-action "Beauty and the Beast" over a gay sidekick character, creating a media frenzy.
Disney's willingness to withstand that kind of resistance reflects the emphasis that Robert A. Iger, the company's chief executive, has put on diverse casting and storytelling across the Magic Kingdom. As he said at Disney's most recent shareholder meeting, referring to inclusion and equality: "We can take those values, which we deem important societally, and actually change peoples' behavior -- get people to be more accepting of the multiple differences and cultures and races and all other facets of our lives and our people."
Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, and Alan F. Horn, Disney's movie chairman, were eager to make "Black Panther." But it was ultimately Mr. Iger who pushed the movie ahead, overruling those who worried that it would not generate adequate sales of related toys.
"It became a company initiative as led by Bob," Mr. Feige said. "He holds a lot of sway, as you might imagine." ("Black Panther," for the record, ended up with the largest merchandise line ever for a Marvel nonsequel.)
Asked how Mr. Iger has communicated that message about diversity -- in meetings? by royal decree? -- Mr. Feige responded, "It's a combination."
Whatever the route, the directive has been received. Disney recently released Pixar's "Coco," centered on the festive Mexican holiday honoring the dead and with characters voiced by an all-Latino cast. Before that came "Moana," which gave Disney a Pacific Islander princess.
The new "Star Wars" movies have been paragons of diverse casting. Coming up are live-action versions of "Mulan," with a mostly Asian cast, and "The Lion King," with a largely black cast. Disney's big-budget "A Wrinkle in Time," directed by Ava DuVernay and starring Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Michael Peña and Mindy Kaling, arrives on March 9.
"We wanted to make a film with a cast that looks like you," Ms. DuVernay said at a Disney fan event last year, "that looks like the real world."

Full text: It's the worrisome byproduct of a healthy economy: inflation.
Just about every nation on earth is now growing. Europe and Japan finally pulled out of their doldrums. And the United States economy, which continues to chug along, could get some extra juice from the tax cuts and other deficit-increasing moves by the government.
To economists, executives and investors, there can be too much of a good thing. The fear now is that inflation will start to rise more quickly, potentially crimping global growth or forcing borrowing costs higher. That prospect spooked the markets earlier this month, briefly sending stocks down more than 10 percent before investors recovered their nerve.
While still low, prices are starting to rise, in what would amount to a major shift if it persists. Higher prices for rents, gasoline, medical care and food helped drive prices up 2.1 percent in the 12 months that ended in January.
The Root of Inflation Is a Strong Economy
After the global financial crisis, the world sank into one of the deepest recessions since the Great Depression. And for most of the last decade, it has been in an economic funk, characterized by low levels of growth and piddling price increases.
To get their economies out of that rut, central banks helped push interest rates sharply lower. The goal was to bolster investment and growth. And now it appears that the world economy is finally starting to generate real momentum.
The United States has been ahead of the pack, having started its somewhat sluggish recovery in the second quarter of 2009.
Last year, the American economy ended up growing at a better-than-expected 2.3 percent rate -- and it is gathering strength. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates that the economy will expand at 3.2 percent this quarter.
A Growing Economy Increases Demand
As the economy gains momentum, companies and business buy more. Metal tubes. Industrial hose. Accounting and legal services. Steel. Wireless internet. Tires. Printer toner.
And amid the Amazonification of American retail, cardboard boxes. Lots of cardboard boxes.
"Clearly demand is strong," Thomas A. Hassfurther, head of the corrugated products division at the Packaging Corporation of America, said on a conference call with analysts. "We're in a phase now where the box business is tracking the G.D.P. a lot closer than it had been."
To make more boxes, his company needs more of the material that goes into them, like raw cardboard fiber and chemicals. And it is paying higher prices for both. "We're competing with everybody for that same shortage of labor and equipment," Mr. Hassfurther said.
To Get Raw Materials In And Deliveries Out, Companies Need Trucks
Trucks deliver the raw ingredients and trucks deliver the final goods. But there is a limited supply of trucks.
Basic economic theory then kicks in. When demand goes up and supply holds steady, prices should rise. Essentially, companies that need things shipped are willing to pay more to get them delivered.
Sure enough, so-called spot rates for freight -- the price for deliveries not covered by longer-term contracts -- rose by more than 20 percent last year.
Those rates aren't likely to fall anytime soon. While trucking companies are ordering more vehicles for their fleets, it will take time for those rigs to be ready. And even when they are, an acute shortage of drivers could limit the number of vehicles deployed.
"If you buy more trucks, the challenge is finding enough drivers to put in those trucks," said Bob Costello, the chief economist of the American Trucking Associations.
A Shortage of Truckers Means Wages Will Rise
When trucking companies need more employees, they simply offer more money. In recent months, hourly wages for truckers moved steadily higher. In the fall, their annual growth rate exceeded 4 percent, the fastest pace seen since late 2013.
When Eduardo Andrade looked at one of his pay stubs in the fall, the trucker thought his boss might have made a mistake. His check from Baylor Trucking, a family business based in rural Indiana, showed that he was earning 52 cents per mile, up from the 48 cents he had been making. He often drives for three straight weeks, moving food and garments from the East Coast to the Midwest and then hauling insulation materials back. The raise will fatten his paycheck by $6,000 per year, if he maintains his regular mileage.
"This is the biggest increase I have ever had with the company," said Mr. Andrade, who has driven for Baylor for a decade. The 60-year-old has seven grandchildren and plans to spend his extra cash to buy them more movie tickets, clothes and pizza dinners.
Surging Transport Costs Eat Into Profits
Those higher wages have to be paid for -- and it's usually trucking customers that end up footing the bill.
For example, during the third quarter, packaged food companies, which need lots of trucks to ship their products, saw their margins shrink by 0.8 percentage points. They attributed the trend, in part, to rising freight costs.
"All my companies are talking about it," said Robert B. Moskow, an analyst who researches companies in the food industry for Credit Suisse.
Companies Pass On Costs to Consumers
Corporations are in the business of making as much money as possible, and they generally aren't inclined to simply accept thinner profit margins.
They have a couple of options. They can try to reduce costs in other parts of their businesses. Or they can try to charge more for their products.
Tyson Foods, the giant meat and chicken company, recently told analysts that it planned to increase prices to offset rising freight costs. Tom Hayes, Tyson's chief executive, estimated that rising freight prices would cost the company more than $200 million this year. "Ultimately, the consumer is going to pay for it at some point," Mr. Hayes said.
Tyson would be able to offset $200 million in freight costs by charging roughly 1 percent more for its products, according to Mr. Moskow, the Credit Suisse analyst. For a pound of boneless chicken breast -- an average price of about $3.07 -- that would be a price increase of 3 cents.
By itself, a 3-cent price increase for a pound of chicken isn't significant. But recent signs suggest that prices are edging higher for a range of products, like oil and gasoline, clothing, car insurance and medical care.
And if other industries follow suit, it would mean that the United States -- and likely the world -- is finally shifting into a higher economic gear after over a decade of sputtering.

Market Chugs On as Investors Wave Off Inflation Worries

Full text: Investors saw some new hints that inflation is increasing on Wednesday, but they still sent banks, technology firms, and consumer-focused companies climbing. That was a big change after the market's inflation-inspired plunge earlier this month.
After a shaky start, stocks rose for the fourth straight day, and banks made some of the largest gains as bond yields reached new four-year highs. The move in yields came after the government said consumer prices climbed in January a slightly faster pace than economists had expected. A different government report showed retail sales were unchanged in December and slipped last month.
"I think the fears of the economy overheating have been a little bit balanced out with the combination of these two numbers," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management. "The bond market is not suggesting that runaway inflation is a deep concern."
Stocks began plunging Feb. 1 after the Labor Department said wages grew at a rapid clip in January. Investors worried that that meant inflation was rising and that it would push the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates more quickly, making it more expensive for people and businesses to borrow money. That would slow down economic growth as well growth in as corporate profits. Nixon said that Wednesday's reports show inflation probably isn't rising that fast.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 35.69 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,698.63. The Dow Jones industrial average added 253.04 points, or 1 percent, to 24,893.49. The Nasdaq composite climbed 130.10 points, or 1.9 percent, to 7,143.62. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 27.15 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,522.10.
After a 10 percent plunge in just nine days, the S&P 500 has risen 4.5 percent in the last four days.
The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers rose 0.3 percent in January, excluding volatile items like food and energy. That's the most in a year, and it sent bond yields and gold prices higher.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.91 percent, its highest mark in four years, from 2.84 percent a day earlier. That helped banks, as the higher interest rates make lending more profitable. But it hurt high-dividend companies like utility and phone companies. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of their big dividend payments and relatively steady prices, but investors find them less appealing when bond yields are rising.
Americans cut back on purchases of cars, furniture and a variety of other products in January. The Commerce Department also lowered its estimate for spending in December. That came after a three-month stretch that included the strongest holiday sales in a decade.
Retailers traded higher despite the tepid numbers in the report. Amazon rose $36.54, or 2.6 percent, to a record high of $1,451.05 and Tiffany added $2.15, or 2.1 percent, to $103.11. Nike picked up $2.09, or 3.2 percent, to $67.96.
Nixon, of Northern Trust, said she doesn't expect inflation to increase very much, but it can be unpredictable from month to month. She noted that it could go higher as people who received tax cuts or bonuses spend their extra pay.
Netflix climbed after the streaming video company said it signed another big-name TV writer and producer to a production deal. According to reports, "Glee" and "American Horror Story" producer Ryan Murphy received a $300 million deal that will span five years. In August Netflix announced a deal with "Scandal" and "Gray's Anatomy" creator and producer Shonda Rhimes.
Netflix climbed $7.73, or 3 percent, to $266.
Chipotle Mexican Grill soared after naming Taco Bell CEO Brian Niccol to lead the company. Chipotle has been hit hard by food safety scares over the last few years and has had trouble winning back customers. Niccol launched breakfast at Taco Bell and also introduced mobile ordering from its restaurants, and investors felt he might improve the company's fortunes. Founder Steve Ells resigned as CEO in November.
The stock rose $38.58, or 15.4 percent, to $289.91. It traded above $700 in mid-2015.
After years of declines, watchmaker Fossil soared $7.93, or 87.7 percent, to $16.97 after it did far better than Wall Street expected in the fourth quarter. The stock was worth more than $100 at the end of 2014, but plunged as competition from smart watches and fitness trackers eroded its sales.
Gold jumped $27.60, or 2.1 percent, to $1,358 an ounce. Silver rose 35 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $16.88 an ounce. Copper picked up 7 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $3.24 a pound.
U.S. crude rose $1.41, or 2.4 percent, to $60.60 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.64, or 2.6 percent, to $64.36 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline added 3 cents to $1.71 a gallon. Heating oil rose 5 cents to $1.88 a gallon. Natural gas lost 1 cent to $2.59 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The dollar fell to 107.09 yen from 107.69 yen. The euro dipped to $1.2435 from $1.2355.
The DAX in Germany rose 1.2 percent and the French CAC 40 added 1.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain picked up 0.6 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4 percent after its economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter. South Korea's Kospi gained 1.1 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 2.3 percent.

Full text: NEW YORK -- Stocks in the United States rose for the third day in a row on Tuesday, led by banks, retailers and technology companies. The rebound over the last few days follows a harrowing drop of more than 10 percent over the previous two weeks.
After a wobbly start, stocks started climbing in the early afternoon and wound up with their most placid day in the last few weeks.
Amazon climbed once again, and athletic apparel companies rose following solid fourth-quarter results from Under Armour.
Apple continued to recoup some of its recent losses. Energy companies slipped again, and companies that distribute prescription drugs and medical supplies slumped.
Stocks have been making big swerves higher and lower recently. Last week the Dow Jones industrial average twice fell 1,000 points in a day, sometimes gaining or losing hundreds of points in a few minutes. But on Tuesday, the gap between the Dow's highest mark and its lowest was a more modest 284 points.
Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Investment Management, said investors who have steered clear of the stock market started to pile in over the last few months, but that round of buying ended abruptly.
"The pattern that we saw over the last month and a half is not by any stretch of the imagination unusual," he said, "But it is compressed. It normally doesn't happen over a six-week period."
Hackett said he feels stocks have fallen to more reasonable prices, partly because of the market slump and partly because corporate earnings grew at a strong clip in the fourth quarter.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 6.94 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,662.94. The Dow added 39.18 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,640.45. The Nasdaq composite gained 31.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,013.51. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks finished up 3.97 points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,494.95.
On Wednesday the Labor Department will issue its monthly report on consumer prices. Investors will be watching carefully because the recent bout of market volatility was touched off by worries that inflation might be increasing.
Under Armour climbed after it reported better-than-expected sales as shoe and accessory revenue picked up. The stock had plunged 50 percent in 2017 on top of a 30 percent decline in 2016. It rose $2.47, or 17.2 percent, to $16.70. Athletic apparel retailer Foot Locker also gained ground.
Amazon climbed $28.28, or 2 percent, to $1,414.51, and dollar stores, department stores and clothing companies made gains as well.
Prescription drug distributor AmerisourceBergen jumped $8.32, or 9.3 percent, to $97.77 after The Wall Street Journal reported that Walgreens Boots Alliance wants to buy the rest of the company. It already owns 26 percent of AmerisourceBergen, one of the largest prescription drug distributors in the U.S. It also distributes products to hospitals and other health systems. The Wall Street Journal said Walgreens made an approach several weeks ago that no offer has been made. Walgreens lost 17 cents to $68.29.
Separately, the Journal reported that Amazon is looking to win over hospitals and clinics to distribute a variety of medical products. Two other distributors of prescription drugs also fell. Cardinal Health lost $2.34, or 3.4 percent, to $65.69 and McKesson fell $2.84, or 1.9 percent, to $146.18.
In January Amazon announced a partnership with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway aimed at reducing health care costs. It's widely believed to have designs on a larger role in the health care system.
The Federal Trade Commission said it is suing three large dental product suppliers for conspiring to deny discounts to groups that buy products for small practices. Henry Schein, Patterson, and privately-held Benco control 85 percent of the $10 billion market for products like gloves, sterilization products, lights and dentists' chairs.
The companies rejected the allegations and said they will defend themselves in court. Henry Schein fell $4.79, or 6.6 percent, to $67.39 and Patterson sank $1.71, or 5.2 percent, to $31.21.
Nutrition supplement company GNC Holdings soared 18 percent after it formed a joint venture with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group of China. Harbin is investing $300 million in GNC, which will make it the company's largest shareholder. The stock rose 76 cents to $4.96.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.83 percent from 2.86 percent.
Energy companies declined, and benchmark U.S. crude fell 10 cents to $59.19 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 13 cents to $62.72 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline add 1 cent to $1.69 a gallon. Heating oil stayed at $1.84 a gallon. Natural gas rose 4 cents to $2.59 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold rose $4 to $1,330.40 an ounce. Silver slipped 4 cents to $16.53 an ounce. Copper climbed 8 cents to $3.16 a pound.
The dollar fell to 107.69 yen from 108.67 yen. The euro rose to $1.2355 from $1.2284.
Germany's DAX shed 0.7 percent and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.7 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 1.4 percent. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.1 percent.

Full text: Stocks powered higher on Monday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 410.37 points, as the market clawed back more of its losses from the past two weeks.
Apple jumped 4 percent and led a rally in technology companies, while industrial companies, banks, and consumer-focused companies like retailers also rose.
Netflix and Amazon surged again as stocks that led the market higher in 2017 recovered more of the ground they lost recently. Energy companies got some relief as oil prices turned higher. All that helped stocks build on the market's gains from late Friday.
Some market watchers say the recent bout of turbulence may not be over. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, said he thought stocks and bonds would fall further as investors consider the likelihood that interest rates will keep rising and inflation will increase. Inflation and higher wages can cut into profits, and higher interest rates slow down economic growth.
Paulsen said the consumer prices report on Wednesday or the February employment report due next month could both have major effects on the market.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 36.45 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,656. The Dow climbed 1.7 percent to 24,601.27. It had risen as much as 574, led by big gains for Boeing and Apple.
The Nasdaq composite index advanced 107.47 points, or 1.6 percent, to 6,981.96. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 13.15 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,490.98.
It took just nine days for stocks to plunge 10 percent from their latest peak, which they reached on Jan. 26. According to LPL Financial, it was the swiftest move from a record high to a market correction in the history of the S.&P. 500. The index rose about 1.4 percent Friday but still wound up with its worst weekly loss in more than two years. Despite the two-day recovery, the S.&P. 500 is down 7.5 percent from its record high.
That comes after a remarkably calm year for stocks: There were only eight days in 2017 in which the S.&P. 500 rose or fell at least 1 percent. But it has happened six times in the last seven trading days, and eight times since Jan. 26. That includes several drops that were far larger than anything the market endured last year.
Other gainers in the technology industry included Cisco Systems, which rose $1.07, or 2.7 percent, to $40.60. The chip makers Broadcom and Qualcomm each climbed after CNBC reported that they would meet this week to discuss Broadcom's $121 billion offer to buy Qualcomm. Broadcom was up $8.90, or 3.8 percent, to $244.40, and Qualcomm rose $1.67, or 2.6 percent, to $65.66.
Benchmark United States crude gained 9 cents to $59.08 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 20 cents to $62.59 a barrel in London.
Bonds were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.86 percent and the price dipped slightly to $991/32.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 2 cents to $1.68 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.84 a gallon. Natural gas slid 3 cents to $2.55 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The dollar fell to 108.60 yen from 108.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.2289 from $1.2235.
Gold rose $11.10 to $1,324.20 an ounce. Silver jumped 43 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $16.57 an ounce. Copper added 5 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $3.09 a pound.

Trump Doesn't Give a Dam

Full text: Donald Trump doesn't give a dam. Or a bridge. Or a road. Or a sewer system. Or any of the other things we talk about when we talk about infrastructure.
But how can that be when he just announced a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan? That's easy: It's not a plan, it's a scam. The $1.5 trillion number is just made up; he's only proposing federal spending of $200 billion, which is somehow supposed to magically induce a vastly bigger overall increase in infrastructure investment, mainly paid for either by state and local governments (which are not exactly rolling in cash, but whatever) or by the private sector.
And even the $200 billion is essentially fraudulent: The budget proposal announced the same day doesn't just impose savage cuts on the poor, it includes sharp cuts for the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy and other agencies that would be crucially involved in any real infrastructure plan. Realistically, Trump's offer on infrastructure is this: nothing.
That's not to say that the plan is completely vacuous. One section says that it would "authorize federal divestiture of assets that would be better managed by state, local or private entities." Translation: We're going to privatize whatever we can. It's conceivable that this would be done only in cases where the private sector really would do better, and contracts would be handed out fairly, without a hint of cronyism. And if you believe that, I have a degree from Trump University you might want to buy.
At one level, none of this should be a surprise. The current infrastructure nonplan looks a lot like the sketchy proposal the Trump campaign laid out in 2016, back when he was still pretending to be a different kind of Republican, less committed to the party's economic orthodoxy. Even then he was claiming that he could do infrastructure on the cheap, that a relative pittance of federal money could somehow generate vast investment (although the mystery multiplier has gotten even bigger this time around).
Yet there is something puzzling about Trump's failure to come up with a remotely plausible infrastructure plan. After all, there would be major economic and political advantages to such a program.
First, the economics: America desperately needs to repair and upgrade its deteriorating roads, water systems, power grid and more. True, we're no longer a depressed economy that needs public investment to put the unemployed back to work; massive infrastructure spending would have been an even better idea five years ago. But it's still something that needs doing.
Where would the money come from? Well, if you don't worry too much about deficits -- and as we've just seen, Republicans don't care at all about deficits as long as a Democrat isn't in the White House -- we can just borrow it. Despite a modest rise in interest rates, the federal government can still borrow very cheaply: The interest rate on inflation-protected long-term bonds is still less than 1 percent, which is below realistic estimates of long-run economic growth, let alone the Trump administration's fantasy numbers. So borrowing now to pay for essential infrastructure would still be good economics.
And as I said, there would be political advantages, too. If Trump just pushed ahead with a straightforward, conventional public investment plan, he could trumpet the number of workers employed on new projects. Furthermore, he could surely find a way to stick his name on many of those projects. Historically, many politicians have had what's known in the trade as an edifice complex -- an urge to build big stuff to promote their personal brand and feed their vanity. Certainly Trump of all people would find that prospect appealing.
By the way, some Democrats feared that Trump really would go big on infrastructure, which might drive a wedge into their party and be highly popular besides.
Oh, and another point: Public spending can yield a lot of private profit. An infrastructure program involving real money could be very lucrative for Trump cronies, or for that matter Trump himself. Yes, there are rules that are supposed to prevent that kind of profiteering, but does anyone think those rules would be enforced under current management?
So why isn't Trump proposing something real? Why this dog's breakfast of a proposal that everyone knows won't go anywhere?
Part of the answer is that in practice Trump always defers to Republican orthodoxy, and the modern G.O.P. hates any program that might show people that government can work and help people.
But I also suspect that Trump is afraid to try anything substantive. To do public investment successfully, you need leadership and advice from experts. And this administration doesn't do expertise, in any field. Not only do experts have a nasty habit of telling you things you don't want to hear, their loyalty is suspect: You never know when their professional ethics might kick in.
So the Trump administration probably couldn't put together a real infrastructure plan even if it wanted to. And that's why it didn't.

NASA Budgets for Trip to the Moon, With a Role for the Private Sector

Full text: Sending astronauts back to the moon is one of the top space priorities of President Trump. But his administration wants to accomplish that without giving NASA additional money, and it won't occur until after he leaves office, even if he wins re-election.
Instead, it aims to give the private sector a greater role, according to a budget proposal to be released on Monday.
The administration is also looking to end American payments for the International Space Station by 2025. The space station is currently scheduled to operate through 2024, but the expectation was that it would be extended through at least 2028.
According to excerpts from NASA documents obtained by The New York Times before the budget's release, the administration will propose $19.9 billion in spending for the space agency in fiscal year 2019, which begins on Oct. 1. That is a $370 million increase from the current year, the result of the budget deal reached in Congress last week and signed by Mr. Trump.
The budget numbers were confirmed by a person who was not authorized to talk publicly about them.
In future years, the administration would like NASA's spending to drop to $19.6 billion and stay flat through 2023. With inflation, NASA's buying power would erode, effectively a budget cut each year.
A NASA spokesman said he could not discuss the budget proposal until it was released.
The proposal is just an opening bid. Congress decides the final spending numbers, sometimes adjusting them or ignoring a president's priorities. But an administration's wishes are often incorporated.
NASA's budget will be announced at a moment when the agency has no permanent leaders to carry out the new directions. Mr. Trump nominated Jim Bridenstine, an Oklahoma congressman, to be the next administrator, but the Senate has not yet confirmed him. Whether the administration has the votes to confirm him remains uncertain. This is by far the longest period in NASA's history without an administrator.
Additionally, no one has been nominated for the No. 2 position, deputy administrator.
The Trump administration has also established a National Space Council, led by Vice President Mike Pence, to coordinate space policy between military and civilian agencies. The council held its first public meeting in October, and is to meet again this month.
The Trump administration is also looking to trim the budget of NASA's earth science directorate, which includes climate research and cancel several spacecraft like the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem mission. The nearly $1.8 billion budget for that part of NASA would be about 6.5 percent lower than what was enacted for fiscal year 2017. The Trump administration also wants to end education programs. Similar proposals last year were disregarded by Congress.
The astrophysics division would be cut by 12 percent, but overall, the budget would give an increase to NASA's science directorate, primarily for robotic planetary missions.
Rumors of the intent to end space station financing were recently reported in The Verge and other outlets, drawing strong criticism from some lawmakers, including key Republicans.
"I hope that those reports prove as unfounded as Bigfoot," Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness, said on Wednesday during a Federal Aviation Administration conference on commercial space transportation.
He decried "numbskulls" at the Office of Management and Budget in the White House for coming up with the idea. "As a fiscal conservative, you know one of the dumbest things you can do?" he said. "Canceling programs after billions in investment when there is still serious usable life in it."
The same conference was attended by Scott Pace, the executive secretary of Mr. Pence's space council. While he did not discuss details of the budget, Mr. Pace suggested that money needed to be freed up for new initiatives.
For NASA to push human spaceflight further, he said, "the kinds of commitment of resources that traditionally we've done in low-earth orbit, we can direct some of that toward deeper space exploration."
The budget proposal promises "a seamless transition to the use of future commercial capabilities," and allocates $150 million in 2019 to encourage commercial development in low-Earth orbit.
The administration proposes $900 million for this goal through 2023. If structured like earlier NASA public-private partnerships, like the ones for carrying cargo and crew to the space station, the money would be split between two or more companies.
By contrast, the United States has spent close to $100 billion building and operating the International Space Station.
The end of financing in 2025 does not necessarily mean the station would be discarded then. The Washington Post reported on Sunday that an internal NASA document asserts, "It is possible that industry could continue to operate certain elements or capabilities of the ISS as part of a future commercial platform."
But space experts so far do not see how that would be viable economically because NASA currently spends $3 billion to $4 billion a year.
"I haven't really seen anyone talking about that," said Tommy Sanford, the executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group representing many of the new space companies. "I think that'd be difficult."
Mr. Sanford said the federation was concerned about setting a specific end date. He said it would be better to define benchmarks that commercial alternatives would need to achieve before the International Space Station is retired.
In recent years, more companies have started using the station in areas like pharmaceutical research and manufacturing of fiber optical cable.
"If we abruptly end that, without a smooth transition plan," John Elbon, vice president and general manager of space exploration at Boeing, said at last week's conference, "all that investment will be for naught."
For a greater focus on the moon, the budget plan describes investing in commercial companies to develop and fly robotic landers to carry experiments and other payloads to the moon.
Those companies could include Moon Express and Astrobotic Technology, two companies originally created to compete for a $20 million grand prize in the Google Lunar X Prize. The X Prize Foundation conceded last month that none of the remaining competitors would be able to reach the moon before the prize expires on March 31. Both companies still plan to head to the moon in the next couple of years.
In addition, Blue Origin, a space company started by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has proposed a larger lander called Blue Moon that could deliver several tons of cargo to the surface of the moon.
Efforts to increase research and development aimed at next-generation space technologies for a range of human and robotic missions, one of the priorities of the Obama administration's space policy, would be refocused on nearer-term development on moon missions.
For astronauts, the goal is still to reach "the vicinity of the moon" in 2023. That is the current schedule for the first crewed launch of the Space Launch System, which would fly around the moon but not land.
Under the proposed timeline, work on a lander would not start until that year.

Full text: For years, many liberal economists have argued that a little more federal spending and a higher budget deficit would create a stronger economy.
Now, they're getting their wish, or at least a fun-house mirror version of it. All it took was total Republican control of the government.
The fiscal austerity that drove the budget deficit from around 9 percent of G.D.P. in 2010 to 3 percent in 2016 has, for practical purposes, been abandoned. First, Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax bill in December that sharply cut rates on businesses. Then last week they made a deal to undo budget caps demanded by the Republican House in 2011. President Trump signed that bill on Friday.
This sudden reversal has the economists who have long argued we should run the economy a little hot -- that is, stimulate it using the government's power to tax and spend -- in something of a quandary.
"It's a very weird and conflicted feeling," said Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who worked in the Obama White House. "On some level I should be happy, and I am sort of happy right now, but with some nontrivial caveats."
He and others in this boat don't at all like the composition of this particular easing of fiscal policy. It is focused on tax cuts for businesses, rather than on investment in roads and bridges or worker training. The latter would be the kinds of steps more likely to have long-term payoffs and to benefit working-class Americans, they believe. (A big chunk of the additional spending will go toward the military.)
Liberal skeptics of this new age of anti-austerity also don't like the timing. Mr. Bernstein, no one's idea of a deficit hawk, notes that never in its modern history has the United States run deficits as large as those now on the horizon while the unemployment rate was as low as it is now. That creates the risk that the government will have less capacity to respond to future recessions.
But those misgivings aside, this mix of budget-busting policies will provide the best test in years of some ideas that have percolated among economists, especially but not exclusively on the left. The former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, originally a George W. Bush nominee, spent years imploring Congress to spend more money in the near term to try to boost growth, to little avail.
The case for a more expansionary fiscal policy varies depending on the individual, but arguments have included:
■ It might spur more jobs at higher wages.
■ Coax people who had dropped out of the labor force to look for work.
■ Fuel higher productivity growth.
■ Mitigate a global shortage of safe government bonds.
■ Help break the United States out of a prolonged cycle of sluggish growth and financial booms and busts.
For example, Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and former adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, has been a leading advocate of the idea that "secular stagnation" has taken hold. The idea is that the economy is in a self-reinforcing pattern of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates, and that overreliance on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies to try to spur growth has fueled financial bubbles.
To escape that trap, Mr. Summers urged government to make large-scale investment in infrastructure. That investment, he said, would create jobs for men, a demographic that has disproportionately dropped out of the labor force. And it would improve the long-term economic potential of the United States, taking the pressure off the Fed's interest rate policies to achieve growth.
He argues now that the policies that the Trump administration and Congress have reached, while directionally the same as those he advocates, won't get the job done and carry risks.
"Yes, I have favored more expansionary fiscal policy, and this is more expansionary fiscal policy," Mr. Summers said. "But it's the wrong kind of expansionary fiscal policy, and it's at the wrong time, at the rare moment when fiscal policy is likely to be almost entirely crowded out."
Expect to hear that term, "crowded out," frequently in the economic debates of the years ahead.
In mainstream models of how the economy works, it's the idea that if the government runs budget deficits when the economy is at full employment, its borrowing won't spur new economic activity as desired. Instead, the borrowing will simply raise interest rates and squeeze out private-sector investment, resulting in no net improvement in the economy.
The decline in stock markets since Jan. 26, and the rise in Treasury bond yields, suggests investors are becoming wary of that happening in the coming years.
Advocates of fiscal stimulus during the 2008 recession and the slow recovery argued that crowding out wasn't a valid fear during that time. Vast economic resources, including workers and machines, were sitting on the sidelines, so the government had room to stimulate without causing a rise in interest rates.
A common refrain -- and the baseline for negotiations between the Obama administration and Republicans in the House -- was that any short-term boost to spending had to be accompanied by longer-term deficit reduction. It was on those terms, for example, that stiff budget cuts known as "sequestration" were partly reversed -- with offsets to avoid raising the deficit over the ensuing decade.
"Republicans were very tough about that," said Jason Furman, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers until President Trump took office and is now at Harvard's Kennedy School. Now, a Republican Congress is agreeing to raise spending beyond those sequestration limits without other cuts to offset the increases. "This is very frustrating because it feels like one group of people are living by the rules, while another group is not living by the rules of economics or arithmetic."
The frustration of facing resistance to more expansionary fiscal policy during a period of high unemployment wasn't confined to liberals. As Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke urged Congress to pair a higher short-term fiscal boost with long-term deficit reduction.
As recently as last year, he wrote that "there is still a case for fiscal policy action today," but that it should focus on improving the economy's productive capacity, "for example, through improved public infrastructure that makes our economy more efficient or tax reforms that promote private capital investment."
Still, even if it isn't designed as the stimulus that advocates would prefer, and even if its timing is the direct opposite of what Keynesian economics might recommend, this may be the best test of some of the theories on expansionary fiscal policy that will come along.
"This is a test of whether we're at full employment or not," Mr. Bernstein said. " I think by knocking the unemployment rate down even further, we're going to get more real economic activity, not just more inflation. But now we're going to find out if I'm right."

Full text: So much for all that sanctimony about fiscal responsibility. Forever and always, it can now be said that Republican lawmakers care about the federal deficit only when they want to use it to bash Democratic presidents.
After embracing $1.5 trillion in debt by slashing taxes on corporations and wealthy families in December, the Republican leaders in Congress pushed through a two-year budget deal on Friday that will increase spending by nearly $400 billion. While a lot of that money will be spent on important priorities like disaster relief, infrastructure and education, a big chunk of it will go to an excessive and unnecessary military buildup. Contrast this with the parsimony Republican lawmakers displayed in 2011 when they refused to raise the federal debt limit until President Barack Obama agreed to deep cuts to government programs.
"If you were against President Obama's deficits, and now you're for the Republican deficits, isn't that the very definition of hypocrisy?" Senator Rand Paul said as he held up passage of the budget bill for a few hours -- perhaps until he realized that the definition fit him, too, since he had voted for the tax cuts that will blow up the deficit.
Deficit spending can be an indispensable tool -- to revive an ailing economy, invest in productive infrastructure, rebuild after natural disasters and pay for unavoidable wars. And it was vital for the government to run large deficits after the financial crisis, when the country was tumbling into the worst recession since the Depression.
But the Republican leaders who opposed stimulus spending in 2011 and 2012, when many Americans were struggling to find jobs and the economy was in the doldrums, are now making the absurd argument that the government ought to do more to fuel the economy at a time when the unemployment rate is about half what it was back then and corporate profits have soared.
Even with the economy growing at a decent clip, the government should raise spending on domestic programs that were slashed when Republicans demanded deep cuts. Nondefense spending relative to the economy is the lowest it has been since 1961 -- 3.1 percent of gross domestic product, far below the long-term average of 3.8 percent, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Dilapidated roads, bridges, railways and water systems need to be upgraded and repaired. Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida still need help recovering from last year's hurricanes and making themselves more resilient to future storms. Lawmakers also must spend more to end the opioid epidemic and increase access to substance abuse treatment. The budget bill only partly addresses many of these and other needs.
But the deal Mr. Trump approved on Friday also includes a $165 billion increase in military spending over two years, more than the Trump administration had even requested. Military spending will jump to $716 billion in 2019, from $634 billion in 2017. In inflation-adjusted terms, that would put the Pentagon's budget well above the Reagan buildup of the 1980s and nearly as high as in 2010 -- the peak of military spending since World War II -- when more than 200,000 troops were deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Even before this latest increase, the Pentagon's budget exceeded the combined military spending of the next eight biggest defense spenders globally -- a list that includes Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and India.
Some of the defense increases are understandable. The cost per active service member grew by 61 percent from 2001 to 2012, after adjusting for inflation, because of new and expanded benefits such as incentive bonuses, raises and increased health care expenses. But other increases arose from a dysfunctional budget process manipulated by a defense industry that woos Congress with unneeded or extravagant weapons. These include the F-35 fighter jet, missile defense programs that are plagued with problems, and a plan to modernize the nuclear arsenal over a period of 30 years at a cost of more than $1 trillion.
Democrats went along with this budget. They're the minority party and have limited leverage, and at the moment they are not deploying it very effectively, as has been demonstrated by their failure thus far to clarify their priorities or win protection from deportation for the Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.
The true culprits are the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Both are self-proclaimed deficit hawks. "In this generation, a defining responsibility of government is to steer our nation clear of a debt crisis while there is still time," Mr. Ryan declared in 2012. But recent actions have revealed that the real game is to cut taxes on businesses and the wealthy, and use the resulting deficits as a pretext for cutting programs like Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security that benefit the poor and the middle class.
President Trump has been a bystander in this whole process. He signed the bill, though it ignores many of the administration's requests by, for example, increasing spending on the National Institutes of Health rather than cutting it.
All told, the Republican tax cuts and the budget deal will nearly double the federal deficit to $1.19 trillion in 2019. While no credible analyst doubts that the federal government, which spends about $4 trillion a year, can make its debt payments, the growing deficit will make it harder for the government to respond to future recessions or to make responsible spending decisions. It's a sure bet that, were the economy to tank, Mr. Ryan and his ilk would argue that the country couldn't afford to increase government spending to get it going again because the deficit was already too large.

Full text: The last seven weeks amount to a sea change in United States economic policy. The era of fiscal austerity is over, and the era of big deficits is back. The trillion dollar question is how it will affect the economy.
In the short run, expect some of the strongest economic growth the country has experienced in years, and some subtle but real benefits from a higher supply of Treasury bonds in a world that is thirsty for them.
In the medium run, there is now more risk of surging inflation and higher interest rates -- fears that were behind a steep stock market sell-off in the last two weeks.
In the long run, the United States risks two grave problems. It may find itself with less flexibility to combat the next recession or unexpected crisis. And higher interest payments could prove a burden on the federal Treasury and on economic growth. This is particularly true given that the ballooning debt comes at a time when the economy is already strong and the costs of paying retirement benefits for baby boomers are starting to mount.
It's hard to overstate how abrupt the shift has been.
When the Congressional Budget Office last forecast the nation's fiscal future in June, it projected a $689 billion budget deficit in the fiscal year that begins this coming fall. Analysts now think it will turn out to be about $1.2 trillion.
One major reason is the tax law that passed on Dec. 20, which is estimated to reduce federal revenue by about $1.5 trillion over the next decade, or $1 trillion when pro-growth economic effects modeled by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation are factored in. A budget deal passed in the early hours of Friday morning includes $300 billion in new spending over the next two years for all sorts of government programs and $90 billion in disaster relief, without corresponding cuts elsewhere in the budget.
It is a stark reversal from 2010 to 2016, when congressional Republicans insisted upon spending cuts and the Obama administration insisted on raising taxes (or, more precisely, allowing some of the Bush administration's tax cuts to expire). Those steps, combined with an improving economy, cut the budget deficit from around 9 percent of G.D.P. in 2010 to 3 percent in 2016.
The Near Term: Strong Growth in 2018
In almost any economic model you choose, the new era of fiscal profligacy will create a near-term economic boost. For example, Evercore ISI, the research arm of the investment bank Evercore, estimates that the combination of tax cuts and spending increases will contribute an extra 0.7 to 0.8 percentage points to the growth rate in 2018, compared with the policy path the nation was on previously.
Economists generally think that these policies will have a lower "multiplier" than these policies would have if they took place during a recession, when there is more spare capacity in the economy. But that doesn't mean the multiplier becomes zero.
"Some people assume that because this was a bad process and the tax bill is really regressive that it won't have a short-term growth impact, but I think that's wrong," said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "We shouldn't confuse whatever distaste one has for the composition of the package for totally overwhelming the multiplier effects."
Put a different way, it would be very hard for the government to pump an extra half-trillion dollars into the economy in a single year without getting some extra economic activity out of it.
Another potential near-term positive for the global financial system could be the effect of billions of dollars in bonds issued by the Treasury. For years the world has experienced what some analysts call a "safe asset shortage," too few government bonds and other investments viewed as reliable relative to demand.
This has arguably been a factor in depressed interest rates and sluggish growth across much of the advanced world. More Treasury bonds floating around might reduce those pressures.
The Medium Term: Depends on Economic Slack, and the Fed
Over the next two or three years, things get more murky. What happens will depend on how the economy responds to the additional fiscal stimulus, and how the Fed responds to that.
The big question is whether the economy has the room to keep growing without higher inflation emerging. The unemployment rate is already low at 4.1 percent, so there aren't exactly hordes of jobless people available to be put back to work. That means there is a chance that all this extra money flooding into the economy doesn't go toward more economic output but just bids up wages and ultimately consumer prices.
If that happens, the Federal Reserve would almost certainly raise interest rates more than it now plans, essentially engineering an economic slowdown to try to keep inflation from accelerating. In that scenario, the apparent benefits of tax cuts and spending increases would be short-lived.
But there's no certainty that will happen. It may be that the United States has more growth potential than standard models suggest. Perhaps corporate income tax cuts and looser regulation on business will unleash more capital investment and higher productivity, as conservatives argue. Maybe some of the millions of prime-age adults who have dropped out of the labor force in recent years will come back in, creating more economic potential.
"The really big question mark we have is how much slack there really is in the economy," said Donald Marron, a scholar at the Urban Institute who was once acting director of the Congressional Budget Office. "If you look at conventional measures, unemployment looks really low, but on the other hand if you look back to what we used to think of the potential of the economy a few years ago, we may have some room to grow."
The Long Run: Higher Debt-Service Costs and Less Room to Maneuver
The public debt was already on track to rise relative to the size of the economy before the new tax and spending deals; now it will probably rise faster. The Congressional Budget Office projected last June that the nation's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio would rise to 91 percent in 2027, from 77 percent in 2017.
The C.B.O. hasn't updated those numbers to reflect the new tax and spending legislation, but the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that it will turn out to be between 99 and 109 percent, depending on whether provisions of the tax law are allowed to expire as they are scheduled to.
But those numbers are just an abstraction. The question is what effects higher debt loads might have for Americans in 2027 and beyond.
Higher debt service costs are one big one. Taxpayers in 2027 were forecast to pay $818 billion a year in interest costs even before the tax cuts and spending increases, or 2.4 percent of G.D.P. That will presumably be higher, because taxpayers will be paying interest costs on more debt, and probably at higher interest rates.
And there is probably some point at which the amount of debt the government takes on crowds out private investment; to the degree that the supply of funds to borrow is finite, every dollar the government borrows is not available to be lent to a homeowner taking out a mortgage or a business looking to expand. That said, in practice, the supply of loanable funds is not finite -- households may save more with higher interest rates, for example, and foreign capital might flow in.
The bigger costs of a high national debt may come in how much flexibility policymakers have to respond to a future recession or crisis. If the United States finds itself in a major war or a deep recession, its starting point in terms of debt load will be much higher than it was at the onset of the Iraq War or the 2008 financial crisis.
"It's about risk management," Mr. Posen said. "We may need that fiscal capacity for something else."

Tumultuous Week on Wall Street Finishes With a Small Rebound

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street ended a volatile week on an upswing, as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended Friday's trading session about 1.4 percent higher.
After Thursday's session marked a 10 percent drop from the market's peak in January, the S.&P. 500 and Dow Jones industrial average started higher on Friday, then plummeted, then swung back into positive territory in the afternoon.
Asian and European markets tumbled on Friday. Chinese stocks were among the biggest casualties in a broad sell-off across Asia. It was a stunning reversal for Chinese shares, which investors had been snapping up only days before.
The cause of one of the most turbulent weeks in recent memory, market participants in the United States said, appeared to be widespread expectations that the global economy is improving and that growth would accelerate in the near future.
That has led to fears that interest rate increases could cheapen the value of certain kinds of investments.
"Even if stocks continue to rise, they could rise more slowly and could be subject to large drops," said Kate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.
She said investors were moving money out of riskier stocks like Apple and Disney, which are considered "consumer discretionary" stocks because they don't serve basic daily needs, and into safer areas like utility stocks and United States Treasury notes.
"Longer-term investors should stay invested and not let this worry them. This is an opportunity to buy at lower prices," Ms. Warne said.
Many investors are now growing nervous that central banks will raise interest rates in a bid to keep inflation at bay. If policymakers move too quickly, their efforts could temper the global growth.
Anthony Clemente, the chief executive of Canaras Capital, which specializes in high-yield loans and has $1.3 billion under management, said some of the market movement appeared to be an effort by portfolio managers to protect themselves from volatility in stocks rather than a broader fear of market turmoil.
"It's really out of equities and inflows into the debt markets," he said. "There's an expectations that yields -- fixed income and debt instrument -- are the place where you will want to be at some point."
Whatever the cause, there is now little doubt that markets are jittery.
After being lulled into a sense of complacency by years of steadily rising stocks, even small worries can snowball into a bad day for stocks. The losses can then feed on themselves in a financial industry dominated by computerized trading systems, with the weakness in the United States spreading around the world.
"Asia is going to be the tail that gets wagged by the U.S. dog," Timothy Moe, chief Asia Pacific strategist at Goldman Sachs, said on Friday.
As with stocks in the United States, Chinese shares have surged in recent months, on the back of a strong economy. An improved global outlook has led to more buying of Chinese exports. The authorities also seem to have slowed what had been an alarming borrowing binge.
But the Chinese market does offer reasons for concern. Investors kept a careful eye this week on China's currency, the renminbi, which is carefully managed by the Chinese government. It took a hit on Thursday, falling as much as 1.2 percent before strengthening a bit on Friday.
Before that, the renminbi had been rising steadily against the American dollar, leading to worries that Beijing might step in further to contain it. World markets can be sensitive to sharp swings in China's currency.
The tough day of trading on Friday put Chinese shares by some measures into correction territory. "We are witnessing the longest rally in the history of Chinese stocks," analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote to clients early this week, adding, "A tactical correction appears overdue, and markets could fall further."
Shares in Shanghai fell about 4 percent on Friday, while Hong Kong shares lost 3.1 percent. Shares in Tokyo fell 2.3 percent. In Europe, stocks wavered, off more than 1 percent in afternoon trading.
In the logic of stock markets, bad news can sometimes be good news. Recent gains in the value of the euro against the dollar and other major currencies were expected to slow exports and potentially put the brakes on the eurozone economy.
Slower growth would, in turn, dissuade the European Central Bank from raising interest rates too soon, prolonging the cheap money that has been partly responsible for the bull market.
"The E.C.B. has, in fact, a vital interest in keeping euro area interest rates at low levels," Ralph Solveen, an analyst at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients on Friday.

Full text: LONDON -- British shoppers began noticing in recent weeks that hummus prices were up significantly. The cause: a drought thousands of miles away.
Insufficient rains in India have resulted in several years of poor harvests of chickpeas, the main ingredient in hummus. The country, by far the world's largest producer of chickpeas, mostly grows the legume for domestic consumption. But worse-than-expected harvests mean that it has had to buy more chickpeas from growers elsewhere, putting pressure on supplies worldwide and driving up prices.
Those limited supplies of chickpeas have combined with rising demand for hummus in Britain to send prices higher. Average prices for the dish at supermarket are 12 percent higher than a year ago, according to the trade magazine The Grocer and the research consultancy Brand View. That is significantly more than grocery price inflation of 3.6 percent, and overall inflation of 2.7 percent.
It is the latest example of weather leading to poor harvests in one part of the world, and resulting in shortfalls and price rises at supermarkets far away. And it serves as a reminder of the complexity and fragility of the vast global system putting food on the plates of consumers around the world.
■ Last year, a cyclone that devastated Madagascar sent prices for vanilla pods surging. The east African island nation accounts for 80 percent of the world's vanilla supply, and the storm meant the country's annual crop was cut by around 15 percent.
That set off a supply crunch, at one point pushing prices for vanilla pods, which were about $30 a kilogram, or $13.60 a pound, in 2012, to more than $700 a kilogram in 2017. Those prices, coupled with poor crops, were too high for some retailers. Oddono's, an ice cream chain in London, stopped selling vanilla ice cream for several months.
■ A drought in California drove almond prices sharply higher in 2014 and 2015. That came just as demand for a broad range of nuts was surging, pushed in particular by increased consumption in China.
■ In 2015, the combination of rising demand for chocolate in Asian countries, unusual weather in major cocoa-producing countries of West Africa and attacks of fungus resulted in higher prices for chocolate. The factors just happened to coincide with Valentine's Day.
Britain is particularly vulnerable to shifts in the international food system: It imports almost a third of its food, and a weaker currency, driven in part by uncertainty over the country's exit from the European Union next year, could make groceries even more expensive.
The unexpectedly severe drought in India of the past few years has affected hundreds of millions of people in the country. It has also had consequences for global markets, including for chickpeas, as India typically produces 10 times the amount of the legume as the next-biggest producer, according to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
In Britain, hummus has quickly gone from being a niche snack, introduced to supermarkets in the 1990s, to being a staple. The dish, a specialty of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, was voted one of the products most likely to be found in Britons' fridges in a 2013 survey of European food habits. Annual sales of hummus in the country total more than 100 million pounds, or about $140 million, up about 50 percent from four years ago, according to the research firm Kantar Worldpanel.
Indeed, worldwide demand for hummus has driven up interest in chickpea production, and analysts expect a shift toward healthier eating will continue to bolster the dish's popularity. Farmers in the United States, for example, were forecast to drastically raise their chickpea harvests last year, according to official data, after what was already a record year in 2016. And scientists from Scotland and Ethiopia are jointly exploring the development of drought-resistant chickpeas.
For now, some manufacturers in Britain are trying to absorb the higher costs.
Ramona Hazan's London-based business, Ramona's Kitchen, makes about 75 tons of hummus a month, both for supermarkets and for sale directly to customers. Each 250-gram tub costs about £1.60, but tighter margins resulting from higher chickpea prices mean she is now looking at diversifying.
"We might look at pea and mint dips, extend our range to things not as chickpea-based," Ms. Hazan said.
Others have taken to searching for options elsewhere. AGT Poortman, which supplies chickpeas to companies that make hummus for British supermarkets, said its prices had increased around 40 percent from 2015 to 2017. To supply clients, it has asked them to allow it to buy chickpeas from a wider variety of places.

Another Dive Puts Market in Correction Territory

Full text: After watching stocks march higher for nearly nine years, investors are suddenly confronting a new reality: The long, smooth ride is over. And it doesn't feel good.
Major stock indexes suffered a steep drop in late trading on Thursday, the second-straight day that stocks dived shortly before the markets closed. The 3.75 percent decline pushed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down more than 10 percent from its peak in late January. That means the market is technically in correction territory -- a term used to indicate that a downward trend is more severe than simply a few days of bearish trading.
"We've been trained that the market does nothing but go up," Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said of investors. "And then suddenly, they're anxious, they're sitting nervously on the sidelines, and then they can't take it anymore."
Trying to pinpoint the exact reasons for the last week's tumble is a fool's errand. But the most likely culprit appears to be fear that central banks will increase interest rates in an effort to fend off inflation and ensure that fast-growing economies don't overheat. Those fears were stoked Thursday when the Bank of England warned that it might raise interest rates faster than investors had expected.
The past week has offered a vivid illustration of how, in a market dominated by fast-moving, computerized trading strategies, things can go from good to bad in the blink of an eye. Last Thursday, markets were on an epic winning streak. But a bad day last Friday was followed by more selling, which begot more and more selling.
In addition to the S.&P. 500's drop on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.15 percent. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index -- a measure of the choppiness of markets -- surged by 21 percent.
The S.&P. 500 crested at 2,872.87 on Jan. 26. Since then, it has fallen almost 10.2 percent, or 292 points, to close at 2,581 Thursday.
The sell-off continued in Asia on Friday. Shanghai's stock market was down about 4 percent midday, while shares in Hong Kong and Tokyo had fallen more than 3 percent. Futures contracts that track stocks in the United States traded erratically, suggesting that the markets on Friday could be in for another day of uncertainty.
The market correction does not mean that the bull market in stocks -- which have been roaring since March 2009 -- is over. Markets also experienced a correction in early 2016 before shaking off their jitters and continuing to climb.
Indeed, such ups and downs are routine in most market environments. What makes the past week feel different is that an eerie calm had blanketed markets for the previous year.
Noah Weisberger, a managing director at AB Bernstein, said that over the past few decades, a 10 percent drop would normally happen every 18 months or so.
"It's disquieting, it feels terrible, it's eye-popping when you look at the screen, but it doesn't yet tell you that something is broken," he said. "It's certainly a change in behavior relative to 2017, but then again, 2017 is an anomalous period with incredibly low volatility in the market, a very smooth glide-path higher."
Volatility is back -- with a vengeance. Among the reasons for that is the rise of computer-driven trading, which can accelerate the pace of upward or downward price movements. When algorithms pick up "sell" signals, they can instantly shift trading strategies and move billions of dollars.
"That's probably partly why you're seeing these big swings in the market," said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush, an investment firm. "I don't think that's being driven by human hands."
The long bull market -- stocks were up more than 300 percent at their peak in late January -- has been underpinned, in part, by the extraordinary efforts of the world's central bankers to re-energize growth in the aftermath of the American financial crisis and the deep global recession that followed.
Those efforts helped push interest rates to the lowest levels since World War II, making the safest investments unappetizing and prodding investors toward the stock market.
In the face of broad global growth, some think the central banks will raise interest rates faster than previously expected, eroding a crucial source of confidence that the stock market climb would continue.
Earlier Thursday, the Bank of England said as much, strengthening its forecasts for economic growth and stating that it may have to raise interest rates "somewhat earlier and to a somewhat greater extent than we thought in November."
That statement sent up interest rates -- or yields -- on British government bonds, known as gilts.
Yields on Treasuries followed suit, rising as high as 2.88 percent before retreating slightly. The sight of yields on United States government bonds approaching 3 percent seemed to give the markets pause.
Higher government bond yields can make it more expensive for individuals, companies and governments to borrow money. They serve, for example, as the foundation for the interest rates that banks charge on fixed-rate mortgages.
Investors are trying to figure out whether the global economy can keep growing at its current pace if rates rise -- a concern that is contributing to the recent swings in stock prices.
But there's reason to be optimistic about the economy's resilience.
Government data released on Thursday showed that claims for unemployment insurance in the United States remained low, near levels not seen since the early 1970s. That suggests unemployment -- which was 4.1 percent in January -- is likely to remain low in the near future.
Corporate profits also appear solid.
But some of the biggest losers in Thursday's rout were stocks that had done well this year. Canada Goose, for example, which had been up more than 20 percent this year, sank 16.6 percent. Tesla, which had climbed 10.8 percent this year, fell 8.6 percent.
Other hard-hit stocks belonged to companies that could be vulnerable to inflation because rising prices could pinch their profits.
On Thursday, the underwear and sock behemoth Hanesbrands saw its shares tumble nearly 11 percent, making it the worst-performing stock in the S.&P. 500. Early in the day, the company offered a weaker than expected forecast for the year because of rising prices for commodities -- although the company's chief executive noted that Hanesbrands would try to pass on some of those costs to customers.
Even the most successful companies could not dodge Thursday's carnage. Shares of Apple fell 2.75 percent, knocking more than $22 billion off its market value.

Full text: The Sunday before last, as I emerged tired and dispirited from Penn Station after a two-plus hour trip from the Newark airport, I found myself pondering President Trump's campaign pledge "to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment," a theme he raised in this year's State of the Union address and is expected to address again next week.
A year ago, I embraced the newly elected president's initiative, calling on him "to build something awe-inspiring."
Given the deficit-exploding impact of the new tax code, it's difficult to see where the money will come from. In any event, after this trip, I'll settle for something far more modest: basic improvements to public transportation.
Regional transportation infrastructure is largely the responsibility of state and local governments, and it's especially complicated in places like the New York metropolitan area, which includes multiple jurisdictions and agencies. But just as the federal government spurred the creation of the Interstate highway system under President Dwight Eisenhower, it could revitalize the nation's transportation infrastructure -- without blowing up the deficit -- with a combination of better regulation, creative incentives, loans and grants. Many transportation projects are sound investments that can pay for themselves.
My trip to Manhattan from Newark Liberty International Airport began at Terminal A. Newark is a finalist in Amazon's quest for a second headquarters location, but one look at that terminal should be enough to send the e-commerce giant's representatives back to Seattle. The aging terminal was packed and badly lit, with peeling, mismatched carpeting. There was a line out of the men's room because so much plumbing was out of order. There was no dedicated TSA Pre line and the food options were minimal.
Many consumer reviews of Newark generally, and Terminal A in particular, are scathing. "Let me just say that Terminal A is hell on earth," wrote one traveler on the airport review site Skytrax.
No one, including the airport's owner and operator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, defends the terminal. "The Port Authority recognizes that Newark's Terminal A, which opened in 1973, can no longer adequately serve today's passengers," a spokeswoman acknowledged.
Terminal A is scheduled to be demolished, which is why it's gotten little or no investment. Ground was broken for a new terminal last summer, and in December the Port Authority approved $496 million for early-stage development. It's expected to ask for more funding as soon as next week, and the project is estimated to cost $2.3 billion. But even if all goes according to plan, the new terminal isn't expected to be fully operational until 2022.
The Port Authority has been mired in scandal since at least 2013, when the Fort Lee lane-closing scheme exposed political machinations by appointees of New Jersey's then-governor, Chris Christie. Rick Cotton, a veteran civil servant and infrastructure expert whom New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo named as the authority's executive director last year, has pledged reforms.
Newark's Terminal B, which received a $350 million update in 2014, and Terminal C, which was built by United Airlines and is operated under a long-term lease by the company, are far better, though both attract plenty of complaints from travelers.
A major issue for the New York area's airports is that the Port Authority is allowed to divert revenues collected from airline passengers to nonairport uses, like the PATH train and the new Oculus station at the World Trade Center, a project that went grossly over budget. Federal law bans such redirections elsewhere, but the Port Authority was one of several airport operators that were exempted.
"If Newark airport kept all the money it generated from landing fees it could be a world-class airport," said Tom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, an independent urban research group that focuses on infrastructure and public policy in the New York area. But doing so would starve other Port Authority needs, such as mass transit, he added.
Improving Newark and the rest of America's airports needn't add to the federal deficit. Airports can fund capital improvements by levying fees on passengers and airlines. Airlines typically oppose that, and federal law currently caps such fees, known as passenger facility charges. Efforts to raise the cap, which hasn't been increased in 15 years, have gone nowhere in Congress.
"It makes no sense that the fees would be the same for Des Moines and Newark, given their vastly different mass transit needs," said Mr. Wright.
After a 10-minute walk in Terminal A, I boarded the AirTrain for what is supposed to be an 11-minute trip to the Newark Airport train station. That seemed ample time to make the next New Jersey Transit train to Manhattan, due in 20 minutes.
Nothing about the AirTrain inspires confidence. It moved along the monorail at what felt like a snail's pace, shuddering at every curve. Twice it inexplicably stopped for extended periods. During the second of these stops, within sight of our destination, I watched in frustration as my train to Manhattan came and went.
Complaints about the AirTrain have been mounting for years, and the Port Authority has conceded it's "unreliable." It has been periodically shut down for repairs, and passengers have had to be evacuated after being stuck on board.
Though the AirTrain is less than 25 years old, and cost $769 million ($1.3 billion adjusted for inflation) to build, the Port Authority concluded it must be demolished and replaced. The current capital plan calls for $385 million in repairs to the existing AirTrain, and $40 million for planning its replacement, but doesn't include the cost of the new train system. The planning proposal anticipates "substantial completion" in 2022, though that seems overly ambitious.
Once I reached the station, I learned that the next New Jersey Transit train wouldn't arrive for 50 minutes. When I went to the enclosed (and presumably heated) waiting area, it was empty, and entry was barred by a guard at the door.
A Port Authority official said the area was closed because of an unattended bag. Some time after I left, it reopened when a police dog certified in bomb detection determined the bag was harmless.
A New Jersey Transit spokeswoman, Nancy Snyder, explained that weekend service from Newark Airport is "limited" because of Amtrak maintenance work. Only three trains run per hour, clustered within the first 20 minutes of the hour, she said, and I evidently missed the last of those.
The number of New Jersey Transit trains is also constrained by tunnel capacity under the Hudson River. Although a new rail tunnel has been one of the country's top infrastructure priorities for years, in January the Trump administration cast doubt on the federal government's commitment to fund half the cost of the first phase of the project, estimated at $11 billion. (New York and New Jersey have pledged to pay the rest.)
In 2010, of course, Mr. Christie famously canceled a project for a new Hudson River tunnel, citing cost overruns, a decision whose reverberations continue to be felt by New Jersey's beleaguered commuters.
The train, when it finally arrived, was packed. I found a seat, but other passengers were standing. Mr. Christie's successor as governor, Phil Murphy, has called New Jersey Transit a "national disgrace" and has pledged better funding and improvements.
Once we reached Penn Station, the escalator leading from the platform was broken, creating a logjam at the narrow stairways as passengers struggled with heavy luggage.
Ms. Snyder said that New Jersey Transit maintains nine escalators on the Seventh Avenue side of Penn Station and that, as of this week, all were functioning. But she recommended passengers use the Eighth Avenue side of the station, which offers better access to and from platforms.
After I passed through Penn Station (no further comment needed) the final indignity was a broken escalator leading to Seventh Avenue, which is Amtrak's responsibility. The 39 escalators in Penn Station maintained by Amtrak, many of them dating to the 1960s, are notorious for malfunctioning. They can take months to repair, as The Wall Street Journal reported in 2015.
Last year, referring to commuters' "summer of agony," Mr. Cuomo said conditions at Penn Station had become "intolerable" and sent a letter to the White House asking Mr. Trump for emergency funding. The governor also called for removing the station from cash-starved Amtrak's jurisdiction as part of a "long-term solution."
Other than acknowledging receipt of the letter, the White House hasn't responded.

Full text: In 2011, House Republicans, led by Paul Ryan, issued a report full of dire warnings about the dangers of budget deficits. "The United States is facing a crushing burden of debt," it declared, warning of a looming fiscal crisis that might soon "capsize" the economy. Citing the horrors of big deficits, Republicans refused to raise the federal debt ceiling, threatening to create financial turmoil and effectively blackmailing President Barack Obama into cutting spending on domestic programs.
How big were these horrifying deficits? In the 2012 fiscal year the federal deficit was $1.09 trillion. Much of this deficit, however, was a direct result of a depressed economy, which held down revenues and increased outlays on unemployment benefits and other safety-net programs. The deficit fell rapidly over the next few years as the economy recovered.
This week Republicans, having just enacted a huge tax cut, cheerfully agreed to a budget deal that, according to independent experts, will push next year's deficit up to around $1.15 trillion -- bigger than in 2012. True, this won't quite match 2012's red ink as a percentage of G.D.P.; but this time none of the deficit will be a result of a depressed economy.
Wait, it gets worse. In 2012 there were strong economic reasons to run budget deficits. The economy was still suffering the aftereffects of the 2008 financial crisis. Unemployment was around 8 percent. And the Federal Reserve, which normally takes the lead in fighting slumps, had very limited ammunition: It had already cut interest rates to zero, and its policy of "quantitative easing" -- purchasing longer-term debt -- was of questionable effectiveness. (And Ryan, among others, fiercely attacked the Fed's efforts, which he claimed -- wrongly -- would "debase the currency.")
The state of the economy in 2012 was exactly the kind of situation in which running budget deficits is actually a good thing, because they help sustain overall spending. By contrast, there is no comparable case for deficits now, with the economy near full employment and the Fed raising interest rates to head off potential inflation. (Maybe the Fed is moving too soon, but the contrast with 2012 is still extreme.)
If anything, we should be using this time of relatively full employment to pay down debt, or at least reduce it relative to G.D.P. "The boom, not the slump, is the time for austerity at the Treasury," wrote John Maynard Keynes. But Republicans have turned that sage advice on its head. They are providing more stimulus to an economy with 4 percent unemployment than they were willing to allow an economy with 8 percent unemployment.
There have been many "news analysis" pieces asking why Republicans have changed their views on deficit spending. But let's be serious: Their views haven't changed at all. They never really cared about debt and deficits; it was a fraud all along. All that has changed is the fact that a Republican now sits in the White House.
How do we know Republicans were never sincere about the deficit? It was obvious, even at the time, to anyone who looked at their fiscal proposals. These proposals always involved giant tax cuts for the wealthy -- funny how that worked -- offset by savage cuts in social benefits. Even so, assertions that deficits would go down depended entirely on assuming lots of revenue from closing unspecified loopholes and huge savings from cutting unspecified government programs. In other words, even at the peak of their deficit-hawk posturing, all Republicans really had to offer was redistribution from the poor to the rich.
However, pretending to care about the deficit served several useful political purposes. It was a way to push for cuts in social programs. It was also a way to hobble Obama's presidency.
And I don't think it's unfair to suggest that there was an element of deliberate economic sabotage. After all, Republicans weren't just vehemently opposed to fiscal stimulus; they were also vehemently opposed to monetary stimulus. Basically, they were against anything that might help the economy on President Obama's watch.
Now Obama is gone, and suddenly deficits don't matter.
But let me not just bash Republicans. Let me also bash their enablers -- all those who were duped into believing their claims to be deficit hawks, or pretended to believe them in order to appear balanced and bipartisan. Such people did America a great disservice.
And they will continue to do a great disservice if they obscure what's happening now. Please, let's not talk about the wrongheadedness of fiscal policy -- about imposing austerity in a depressed economy, then running up the deficit when we're already near full employment -- as a problem of "political dysfunction," or assert that both parties are to blame. Democrats didn't block stimulus when the economy needed it, or push a tax cut that will worsen inequality and explode the national debt.
No, this is all about Republican bad faith. Everything they said about budgets, every step of the way, was fraudulent. And nobody should believe anything they say now.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's nominee to lead the Internal Revenue Service is a longtime tax lawyer who has specialized in defending people and companies against the tax agency in court.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump formally nominated Charles P. Rettig, a Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer with the firm Hochman, Salkin, Rettig, Toscher & Perez, to succeed John A. Koskinen, the commissioner whose term ended in November.
If confirmed, Mr. Rettig faces a steep task in overseeing the agency as it begins enforcing the sprawling $1.5 trillion tax overhaul Mr. Trump signed into law last year amid a shrinking staff and budget. Since 2010, the I.R.S. budget has been cut by $900 million -- or 17 percent, after adjusting for inflation -- and its staff reduced by 21,000, or 23 percent.
The agency has also been under attack by Republicans, who have accused it of improperly targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, and by Mr. Trump. During the campaign, Mr. Trump, who has refused to release his personal tax returns, accused the agency of unjustly hounding him with audits year after year and said that paying as little as possible was "the American way."
As commissioner, Mr. Rettig would oversee the audit of Mr. Trump's personal tax returns. The president has in the past said he would only release the returns once they were no longer under audit.
Writing for Forbes in 2016, Mr. Rettig said he would not advise Mr. Trump, then a candidate, to release his tax returns while an audit was continuing. "Is there any legal impediment to Trump publicly releasing his tax returns? Absolutely not," Mr. Rettig wrote. "Would any experienced tax lawyer representing Trump in an I.R.S. audit advise him to publicly release his tax returns during the audit? Absolutely not."
Mr. Rettig went on to speculate that Mr. Trump's returns "might actually be somewhat unremarkable but for the fact they are the returns of Donald Trump," and that it was "unlikely an accurate overall financial picture will surface by simply reviewing his returns. He likely pays taxes at a lesser rate than many of us given the nature of his real estate and similar investments being subjected to lower tax rates than salaries earned by the rest of us."
Mr. Rettig also mused whether Mr. Trump might be inflating his wealth. "He is likely worth far more than us," Mr. Rettig wrote, "but may be worth far less than the approximately $10 billion he wants us to believe."
Mr. Rettig has deep experience with disputes over the amount of taxes paid. He has defended clients against the I.R.S. in tax fraud investigations. He has twice led negotiations that resulted in settlements between the I.R.S. and Americans who had been improperly sheltering money overseas.
Last year, he sued the I.R.S. on behalf of a California bank holding company over a $1.5 million corporate tax bill that the company said was wrongly assessed. In 2014, he filed a similar suit on behalf of a California couple over $644,000 in tax penalties and interest that the couple said the I.R.S. had wrongly assessed.
After the release of the so-called Panama Papers in 2016, which detailed offshore tax sheltering by some of the world's richest and most powerful people, Mr. Rettig wrote in a separate article for Forbes that "Anyone, located anywhere, who is potentially impacted by the public release of the Panama Papers should consider immediately contacting competent, experienced counsel."
Mr. Rettig would bring more than 35 years of experience practicing tax law to the agency. He has overseen the I.R.S. Advisory Council and several professional organizations, including the taxation section of the State Bar of California.
Republicans expressed hope on Thursday that Mr. Rettig might provide a fresh start to their relationship with the I.R.S.
"It's past time we restore Americans' faith in this agency," Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said. "I look forward to learning more about Mr. Rettig and his qualifications to both achieve this goal and ensure an efficient implementation of the biggest tax rewrite in over 30 years."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Once Deficit Hawks, Republicans Open the Money Spigot

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Big government is officially back in style.
Republicans propelled themselves to power in Washington by promising an end to fiscal recklessness. They are now embracing the kind of free spending and budget deficits they once claimed to loathe.
Congress is debating a bipartisan spending deal that would blow through the caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act, unlocking $300 billion in additional spending for the military and domestic programs over the next two years. That comes on top of last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package and as the White House prepares to unveil on Monday a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan that would require $200 billion in government funding.
While the White House says it plans to offset that $200 billion through unspecified cuts, none of the other spending is paid for at a time when the nation's debt already tops $20 trillion.
The long-term implications of all this borrowing put the United States on track to ultimately owe more to its creditors than the economy produces over the course of a year. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects that the United States will run $2 trillion annual budget deficits by 2027 and have a debt-to-gross domestic product ratio of 105 percent -- a level not seen since the end of World War II.
"With this deal, we will experience trillion-dollar deficits permanently," said Andy Roth, vice president of the conservative Club for Growth. "That sort of behavior, the last time I checked, is not in the Republican platform."
The seeds of this ballooning debt load are already taking root -- the Treasury Department said last month that it expects to borrow $955 billion this fiscal year and more than $1 trillion in both 2019 and 2020. That money appears set to get only more expensive to borrow, as the Federal Reserve looks to continue raising interest rates and investors demand higher returns from an increasingly debt-laden government.
Indeed, the borrowing spree is contributing to recent volatility in financial markets, as investors fret that the additional fiscal stimulus, paired with a strengthening economy, could fuel inflation and translate into higher interest rates more quickly than anticipated. Major stock indexes dropped sharply again late Thursday afternoon, falling into a market correction, or a drop of more than 10 percent from their peak, largely on comments from the Bank of England that it might raise interest rates sooner and higher as it looks to fend off possible inflation. Investors poured into bonds in a flight to safety, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury bill to a four-year high of 2.88 percent.
For many Republicans, backing the budget agreement is a break with conservative fiscal orthodoxy that carries risk going into the midterm elections. The party's professed commitment to limited government and deficit reduction helped Republicans regain control of the House and Senate during the Obama administration and also helped President Trump win election, with the candidate promising to get federal spending under control.

Last May, the Trump administration released a budget projecting the United States would swing from a deficit of $440 billion in 2018 to a surplus of $16 billion in 2027. The budget called for deep cuts to domestic programs and a robust increase in military spending.
Instead, the opposite has happened as Washington has opened the spending spigot in ways once unimaginable to the Republicans' fiscal discipline wing.
Some budget experts have pointed out that the budget deal, which Mr. Trump supports, is more costly than the fiscal plan that Hillary Clinton proposed during her 2016 presidential campaign.
Paul Winfree, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, calculated that the 2019 base level of nondefense discretionary spending surpasses what President Barack Obama sought in his final budget request.
"This is getting comical," Mr. Winfree, who recently left a job as an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, said in a post on Twitter.
While the current pact is only for 2018 and 2019, those who preach fiscal restraint fret that the spending spigot is unlikely to be shut off after that. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects that the two-year deal would set the stage for $1.7 trillion in additional deficits over the next 10 years because Congress will be operating from a higher budget baseline and will be unlikely to adopt a fresh round of austerity.
"This is the new baseline," said Steve Bell, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee. "With this and the tax cuts, a balanced budget becomes a pipe dream."
Republican lawmakers are re-entering a "deficits don't matter" phase, like the ones that persisted during the Reagan and Bush presidencies. That has conservative economists queasy, as they look at a government budget that is only going to face more stress as an aging population turns to Medicare and Social Security and drives up spending levels.
"Republicans were very concerned about debt and deficits during President Obama's two terms in office. Then their concern kind of evaporated," said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "I do think as an economic reality, deficits do matter."
Mr. Strain said the implications of the nation's debt trajectory included significantly higher interest payments, a loss of confidence in American Treasury bonds and less room to maneuver in a recession.
The White House's Office of Management and Budget is expected to release its fiscal 2019 budget next week. Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said the budget outline would "outline a path toward fiscal responsibility" and that Mr. Trump remained concerned about fiscal discipline.
"He is concerned about spending in Washington," Mr. Shah said. "He's expressed that for years."
Last week the Treasury Department said the United States will need to borrow $441 billion in privately held debt this quarter, the largest sum since 2010, when the economy was emerging from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.
Left-leaning economists are also scratching their heads at the speed at which Republicans seem to be disavowing their commitment fiscal restraint.
"I think it's a little bit surprising and puzzling," said Jason Furman, a former chairman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, noting that trillion dollar budget deficits is uncharted territory during a period of full employment. "We've never had anything like that outside of a war or a recession."
Mr. Furman said it would be wise for lawmakers to find some offsets for their spending spree.
For their part, Republican leaders who back the budget agreement are focusing on their desire to bolster military spending. They insist they would like to cut spending on programs such as Medicare and Social Security, the biggest drivers of the debt, if the political will were there.
"We're going to work on other entitlement issues this year," Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show on Thursday. "It's the entitlements that need to be reformed if we're going to deal with the debt."
But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has ruled out addressing entitlement programs this year.
To Republicans who oppose the spending bill, the days of Tea Party activists railing against the growing debt seem like ancient history.
"We're living in an unprecedented time from the standpoint of spending, and it's very concerning," said Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who considers himself a deficit hawk.
Despite the disappointment of Republicans such as Mr. Corker, the desire to reduce deficits could return.
A fight between Republicans and Mr. Obama over federal spending and deficits ultimately led to passage of the 2011 Budget Control Act, whose spending caps would be lifted as part of this budget deal.
Mr. Strain, of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested that for deficit reduction to become a prevailing policy for Republicans, another Democratic president might be required.
"We've seen that movie before, and I don't see any reason to think we won't see it again," Mr. Strain said.

Full text: Stocks fell Wednesday in a seesaw trading session, as markets sought direction after several tumultuous days of trading. After registering a 1.7 percent gain on Tuesday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index spent much of Wednesday in positive territory, led by large industrial companies positioned to capitalize on global growth and investors hunting for potential bargains from recent selling.
But slumping oil prices weighed on the energy stocks throughout the afternoon. Crude oil futures closed down 2.5 percent in New York. Exxon Mobil fell 1.8 percent, and Chevron dropped 1.6 percent. The energy sector, which fell 1.7 percent, helped pull the S.&P. 500 back into negative territory in the last hour of trading. The broad index fell 0.5 percent.
Other indexes also dropped. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.9 percent.
Another uptick in interest rates also seemed to dampen what had started out as a relatively decent day for stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.84 percent after lackluster demand in an auction of $24 billion worth of the benchmark government bonds. Yields on 10-year Treasuries, which serve as the foundation for a range of consumer borrowing rates, are near their highest levels since January 2014.
The steady climb in interest rates has gained pace in 2018. And it has become a concern for investors who believe the low interest rates since the financial crisis have been a cornerstone of the long bull market for stocks. Interest rates on shorter-term Treasury bonds, such as the two-year note, have also risen sharply.
Those shorter-term bond yields tend to be sensitive to changing expectations surrounding monetary policy, another source of worry in recent days.
Just a few days ago, the Labor Department's most recent jobs report, which showed the United States economy adding a solid 200,000 jobs in January, helped send markets sharply lower. The report also showed wages growth rising at their fastest pace in years.
Those developments, on their face, should not be bad signs for the consumption-heavy American economy. But some economists consider wage growth an indication that inflation could rise. And investors took the wage data as a reason to worry that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly than policymakers had previously suggested.
Stocks fell sharply when the January jobs report was issued on Friday. The sell-off gathered force on Monday when the S.&P. 500 fell 4.1 percent, its biggest single-day drop since August 2011. The sell-off briefly spread through global markets. But a solid performance by markets in the United States on Tuesday seemed to cool the fire.
With markets in positive territory early Wednesday, President Trump broke his silence on stock market volatility, posting a message on Twitter that promoted the health of the American economy and calling the recent sell-off a "big mistake."
"We have so much good (great) news about the economy!" Mr. Trump wrote.
The American economy does indeed appear to have significant momentum. At 4.1 percent, the unemployment rate is low. And the gross domestic product grew at an annual clip of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter. Recent corporate earnings reports have been solid, with several companies outlining plans to increase investment, in part because of the tax code overhaul that became law in December.
Industrial companies are also piggybacking on that economic strength both in the United States and abroad.
Ball Corporation, a maker of metal packaging like beer cans, was one of the best-performing stocks in the S.&P. 500 on Wednesday. Shares in Ball, which has plants around the world, rose sharply after the company reported favorable earnings results and cited momentum in its business supplying the aerospace industry. Other large industrial companies, such as Boeing, also rose, helping to lift indexes.
"As we look forward, the market drivers of better economic prospects and higher profits have not changed at all," Steven M. Duryee, a portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley's Bergman Continuum Group, a wealth management firm, said in an email to clients.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Watching the wild swings in the stock market has been a heartbreaking experience for Jasmine Okougbo, who started investing only last month. Ms. Okougbo, 26, a business operations manager in Tucson, has an individual retirement account set up through her company and shares she got from her parents for her birthday. In one week, the value of her investments sank 65 percent.
"I don't think I will be buying or trading on the market again anytime soon," she said. "I still don't think it has hit me how much I lost so quickly."
For many millennials, the recent stock market gyrations have been a painful lesson in volatility that is being driven by fears that inflation and interest rates could rise faster than expected. Many have retreated from the market into savings accounts.
Twitter feeds quickly filled with teary, wailing GIFs and heart emoticons cracked in two -- pithy punctuation about anemic 401(k) accounts being whittled down to wisps. Many young investors bemoaned the misfortune of equity portfolios shriveling up weeks after their cryptocurrency holdings also began deflating.
Lulled into confidence by the second-longest bull run in history, some had forgotten the passwords to their trading accounts and, to their panic, were locked out.
Mario Tehuitzil, 27, ducked into a restroom to check his cryptocurrency and stock holdings on Monday and felt "a punch to the gut," then a growing "rush of anxiety and nausea." His $33,000 stock portfolio had plummeted by more than 40 percent, to $19,000 in value, before swelling back to $24,000 on Wednesday.
"I'm aware of the risks but I never expected this rapid and severe drop," said Mr. Tehuitzil, a New York-based pediatrics assistant. "Looks like the down payment for an apartment I've been eyeing will have to wait."
Millennials, a sprawling and diverse demographic generally said to be born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, are known for their passion for social media and an affinity for instant gratification.
But as investors, haunted by the trauma of the Great Recession, they have been mostly cautious. Many young people struggling to find work retreated back to school or into part-time work. For millennials living paycheck to paycheck and sometimes bunking with their parents, saving for retirement seemed a remote priority as they watched debts pile up.
Since hitting bottom in 2009, however, the stock market has more than tripled its value. More millennials began venturing into investing, toggling between stock apps and cryptocurrency charts on their phones and boasting of good returns on Twitter and Snapchat.
Rather than turn to professional advisers, who tend to handle much larger amounts than most young people have to invest, many millennials also tapped a growing roster of so-called robo-advisers that offer low-cost, autopiloted portfolio management.
Josh Stillman, 27, was too afraid to look at his retirement account this week but saw on Wealthfront, a robo-adviser he began using last year, that his investments had slumped 3 percent during the sell-off before recovering somewhat.
Mr. Stillman, who produces and hosts digital videos in Los Angeles, said he taught himself about investing by conducting online research and watching YouTube tutorials.
"I feel like my formal education did not educate me at all for investing or planning for my future," said Mr. Stillman, who has a bachelor's degree in anthropology from the University of Rochester.
Only about a third of millennials currently hold stocks. And more than 80 percent of young investors -- a far higher share than among older age groups -- describe their investing strategy as "conservative," according to survey data released this summer by the Legg Mason asset management firm.
But the survey, conducted as major indexes were surging to new highs amid ostensibly low volatility, found that the group expected to eventually take on more risk than their elders. Many have piled into virtual currencies like Bitcoin.
Accustomed to a steadily rising stock market and the allure of astronomical gains in cryptocurrencies, millennials have a far different expectation of what typical returns look like compared with investors who have seen more cycles.
Millennials now expect an average annual return of 13.7 percent, compared to the 7.7 percent return that baby boomers expect, according to a survey last year from the AMG asset management company. Young investors are four times as likely as boomers to consider themselves to be highly knowledgeable.
But when the slump overtook the market on Friday, many were stunned.
"They've never seen a sell-off like this, and it's especially scary because they don't know who to ask for advice -- they may not have a relationship with a financial adviser they can call or text to walk them back from the cliff," said Jason Dorsey, president of The Center for Generational Kinetics, a research firm. "For many of them, it's been a pretty rude awakening."
Many millennials are familiar with debt because of their credit cards and student loans. But concepts like portfolio diversification and long-term investing are less well-known, experts said.
"If you haven't been taught how markets truly work over time, and you don't have the historical perspective, then bouts of volatility like this could cause you to make bad decisions," said Brian Levitt, a senior investment strategist at OppenheimerFunds.
Many young investors were sanguine about the swings as the Dow Jones industrial average gained back 567 points on Tuesday after shedding a total of more than 1,841 points on Friday and Monday. On Wednesday, Wall Street edged lower; the Dow lost another 19 points, or 0.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.5 percent.
Paul Whited, 24, lost nearly $800 of the $12,000 in his portfolio as holdings in biopharmacy and technology stocks were walloped. On Tuesday, he made back $300.
The Knoxville-based accounting student began investing actively two years ago. His recent losses hurt, he said, but the volatility could present an opportunity to buy.
"Investing in stocks to secure a safe retirement is too important to let fear change my plans," he said. "I have plenty of time ahead of me to earn my money back and then more."

Is the Economy at Risk of Overheating? With Inflation, It's Tricky

Full text: To the degree the recent wild swings in the stock market are rooted in economic fundamentals, these are the fundamentals to fear: that the already strong economy may overheat, inflation may spike, and the Federal Reserve may then raise interest rates more aggressively to try to combat that higher inflation. The kernel of evidence that supported those fears was a report Friday that average hourly earnings for American workers rose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ended in January, the highest since the economic expansion began nine years ago.
It's only a single data point, and an erratic one at that. But when paired with a rock-bottom unemployment rate and some signs of acceleration in economic growth, it suggests that overheating/inflation is a meaningful risk for the United States economy in 2018 in a way it hasn't been for a decade.
What does it all mean and how real is the risk? To answer the question, it helps to start with some basics.
What is inflation?
Inflation is when the buying power of a currency falls over time. When inflation is 2 percent, a basket of products that cost $100 today would cost $102 a year from now.
But people buy lots of different things, some prices are always rising and others falling, and the exact mix of items I buy is different from the mix of items you buy.
That's why government statisticians and mainstream economists focus on indexes created to try to capture the full range of goods and services people consume, weighted by how much an average household spends on each.
Plenty of people may have their own preferred way of measuring inflation; in recent years a profusion of commentators has emphasized declines of the dollar relative to other world currencies, or to gold, as definitive evidence. But the advantage of broad indexes is they approximate, if imperfectly, how much prices are changing for the range of things ordinary people buy.
Is inflation good or bad?
It's both.
High inflation can be disastrous. In Venezuela right now, in Zimbabwe a few years ago, in Weimar Germany in the early 1920s, inflation was so extraordinarily high that the currency essentially ceased to be a useful medium of exchange, leading to a barter economy and breakdown of the country's financial system.
Even milder versions of high inflation, such as the inflation that topped out at more than 14 percent in the United States in 1980, is damaging. At that level, those who have accumulated savings or fixed pensions see their purchasing power vanish over time, and borrowing costs skyrocket (ask anyone who took out a home loan in the early 1980s what their mortgage rate was). That dynamic can impede growth and create broad unhappiness. The economist Arthur Okun even invented the "misery index" in the 1960s, calculated by adding up the unemployment rate and inflation rate.
But when inflation turns negative -- that would be deflation, meaning the purchasing power of a currency rises over time -- it can also be disastrous. Debts become more onerous over time, and consumers and businesses have incentive to hoard cash rather than spend or invest it.
That's what the United States and other countries experienced during the Great Depression, and it has been experienced in milder forms by Japan over much of the last 20 years and Europe since 2010.
So how much inflation do we want?
It might seem inherently bad to have the purchasing power of a falling dollar. But having a bit of inflation seems to grease the wheels of the economy while not distorting economic decisions too much. It helps cushion against deflation, and gives the Fed room to cut interest rates and stimulate the economy during a downturn, helping keep the economy on an even footing.
Over the last couple of decades, central bankers around the world have mostly settled on 2 percent per year as the optimal level of inflation that they aim for. It's a level low enough that the purchasing power of their currencies is fairly stable and people don't have to worry about inflation all that much in doing business with one another, while also keeping a buffer to prevent deflationary effects from taking hold.
That said, 2 percent is a fairly arbitrary number, and some economists argue that steady inflation at a somewhat higher level would help prevent recessions.
The important thing is arguably less the exact level of inflation and more that it is fairly stable over time. It is big swings that tend to be most disruptive, favoring either debtors (inflation) or creditors (deflation), and generally contributing to lack of faith in a country's financial system.
For now, though, 2 percent is the goal.
How much inflation are we getting?
Under the inflation measure that the Federal Reserve most focuses on, prices rose only 1.5 percent in 2017, below the target. That's based on the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy (the logic being that commodity prices can swing wildly for reasons unrelated to underlying inflation trends).
That's not far from the 2 percent target. But the numbers have been undershooting that target continuously since 2012. That undershooting has been a key rationale for the Fed's keeping interest rates low -- its aim is to boost economic growth and thus help get inflation up to the 2 percent target.
Wait, what does inflation have to do with economic growth?
The answer is more uncertain than you might think. A central component of the models that mainstream economists have used for decades is that the inflation rate is shaped by the amount of "slack" or unused capacity in the economy, especially unemployment.
The intuition goes like this: When the unemployment rate is high, there are lots of workers available for any employer that wants to hire them. So employers don't need to compete for workers by paying higher prices. But if the unemployment rate is low, companies have to pay more to get employees, driving up wages. Higher wages in turn mean more money coursing through the economy chasing finite goods and services, creating inflation.
That basic relationship between unemployment and inflation is known as the Phillips Curve. It did a pretty good job explaining inflation trends from the 1950s to the 1980s, and still forms the underpinnings of how many policymakers think about where inflation comes from: that inflation is essentially evidence that the economy is running too hot, producing goods or services at a level that is not sustainable.
It is a little like revving a car. Once a car is already at top speed, if you push the accelerator harder, you won't go any faster, but you may overheat the engine. Inflation, in this model of how the world works, is the evidence of overheating.
Is that really how the world works?
That's not at all clear.
For one thing, the Phillips Curve relationship hasn't been working quite right in the last decade. The unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in late 2009 to 4.1 percent today, and yet wages have been rising at a modest rate, between about 2 and 2.5 percent, throughout that time (at least until the January 2.9 percent gain).
Even as wage gains start to emerge, the relationship between higher wages and overall inflation isn't ironclad, either. For example, the Fed's preferred inflation measure dipped through the first eight months of 2017 despite a low unemployment rate and steady wage gains.
You can imagine a lot of factors that affect inflation that are unrelated to the domestic labor market. Perhaps in a modern, globalized world, when there is a shortage of American workers, companies are better able to outsource service work and import manufactured goods, rather than bid up wages.
If low unemployment spurs new investment in productivity-enhancing machinery, wages could rise without broader inflation breaking out, because higher worker pay would result in higher output, not just more money chasing the same goods.
Or maybe employers have so much power in the labor market now that they can keep wages depressed despite low unemployment, rather than get in bidding wars with one another.
The traditional overheating story might be right. But the recent evidence is hardly definitive.
What does this all have to do with the stock market?
The unemployment rate is already low, and the new tax cut may push economic growth even higher. Wall Street knows that if Fed officials think inflation is poised to exceed its 2 percent target, they will raise interest rates to try to stop that from happening.
If the Fed -- under new leadership, as Jerome Powell became chairman this week -- believes it can let the economy roar ahead without inflationary pressure, it will probably continue its recent practice of low interest rates and gradual rate increases, which in turn is good news for stocks.
But if the overheating/Phillips Curve narrative is coming true, the Fed will have to raise interest rates to try to cool the economy, which would make capital more costly for businesses and dampen consumer spending. That's all bad news for stocks.
What happened Friday was that a wage number was published that was consistent with the overheating/Phillips Curve story of how the economy works, which is a big reason markets sold off.
So is high inflation really a risk right now?
For the last decade, the Fed has been more focused on trying to get inflation higher rather than lower, so in some sense the possibility of finally breaking out of that low-inflation, low-growth, low-interest-rate pattern would be welcome.
Right now, prices in the bond market suggest that the Fed is in a sweet spot -- that inflation will indeed hover around 2 percent in the years to come. As recently as August, inflation-protected bond prices implied that prices would rise only 1.6 percent a year over the next five years; that is up to 2 percent now.
But there are risks on both sides of that forecast.
One month's wage number doesn't definitively mean that the first step of the overheating story is happening -- low unemployment translating into higher pay for workers. And it definitely doesn't mean that the second step is happening -- higher wages translating into higher overall price inflation.
Seeing how things evolve in 2018 and beyond will be fascinating not just for watchers of the stock market and the Federal Reserve, but also for all those who would like to see a bigger paycheck, or who dread what higher inflation might do to their savings.

Full text: The global financial markets are not in crisis. Though some pundits stoked panic with their coverage of several days of market plunges before Tuesday's leap, stock prices are still near their record highs, the economy is creating jobs and many workers are finally getting decent raises after years of stagnant wages. Which doesn't mean that there's nothing to worry about. In recent months, time after time, both the current administration and its allies in Congress have called into question their credibility and competence to manage the economy or handle a financial crisis if one were to occur. President Trump has repeatedly patted himself on the back for a surging stock market, seemingly unaware that stocks can go down, not just up. His Treasury Department in December released a one-page analysis that made outlandish economic assumptions to justify giant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy families. Republican lawmakers in Congress went even further, attacking the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, both nonpartisan, because those analysts had the temerity to warn that the tax law would add to the federal deficit.
Mr. Trump wants everyone to know that his election delivered a booster shot to the economy and stocks. "The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me," he told reporters in November. Truth is, the president was just lucky enough to have inherited a growing economy and a rising stock market. Though his tax cuts were an expensive gift to investors, he has not been in office long enough to have fundamentally changed that trajectory. But his erratic behavior and poor policy choices are clearly worrying the majority of Americans who disapprove of the president.
One reason some investors have become nervous recently is they fear that the tax cuts, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers sold as a way to stimulate the economy, could end up hurting the economy in the not so distant future. The tax law and a push by the Trump administration to increase military spending will reduce federal revenue and force the Treasury to borrow more money when the economy is close to full employment. This could stoke inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. That, in turn, would slow the economy.
The prospect of a recession or financial crisis on Mr. Trump's watch is unnerving, because he is as confident in his own abilities as he is lacking in knowledge and sound judgment. When confronted with criticism, he lashes out like an intemperate child. On Monday, he said Democrats who did not applaud during his State of the Union address were un-American and treasonous. If the stock market falls further, will the president try to reassure the public, or will he launch a Twitter fusillade blaming the drop on, say, a conspiracy hatched by the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge fund manager who wants Mr. Trump impeached?
Many people would have been more sanguine about the Trump presidency had he surrounded himself with competent aides and advisers. Instead, he has stacked his administration with incompetent yes men, right-wing ideologues and Washington swamp dwellers. Consider the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a former investment banker, who unnerved the currency market last month by suggesting that the United States was trying to weaken the dollar. His statement broke with the longstanding practice followed by Treasury secretaries from both parties to avoid making careless public pronouncements about American currency. Mr. Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the White House's chief economic adviser, also debased their credibility last year by arguing with no evidence whatsoever that the Republican tax cut would pay for itself. Over in Congress, the Republican House speaker, Paul Ryan, tried to pass off as good economic news that a public school secretary would take home an extra $1.50 a week as a result of the tax law.
Then there is the harm wrought by the tax law. By greatly expanding the deficit, it will limit the federal government's ability to stimulate the economy in the future when it actually needs a jump-start. In many ways the tax law is already having a perverse effect. Mr. Ryan, for one, is citing the deficit to make the case that the government needs to slash Medicaid, Medicare and other important government programs. Other members of his party are using the deficits to argue that the government cannot afford to repair and upgrade the country's dilapidated infrastructure.
A big drop in stock prices focuses minds, especially when it comes after years of relatively steady gains. But the real crisis is in Washington, not on Wall Street.

Full text: Mere days ago, in what feels like a different era now, the biggest thing that people in control of money appeared to fear was complacency. Stock markets in the United States were surging, enthralled by the regulation-slashing, tax-shrinking predilections of President Trump. Every major economy in the world was expanding. The worst that could happen, the money masters averred, was that investors would be lulled into reckless investments, taking on too much risk in the belief that the dangers of the marketplace had been tamed.
As it turns out, the dangers were already at work. A decade-long era of easy access to money engineered by central banks in Asia, Europe and the United States was ending, opening a new chapter in which corporations would have to pay more to borrow and ordinary people would have to pay more to finance homes, cars and other purchases.
To digest the wild swings in stocks and bonds from New York to London to Tokyo is to absorb this uncomfortable realization taking hold.
Investors concluded that interest rates would rise faster than they had anticipated, almost certainly in the United States, and perhaps eventually in Europe and Asia, too. They yanked their treasure out of stocks and entrusted it to safer repositories of wealth like bonds and cash.
A wave of selling commenced in New York on Friday, continued in Asia and Europe on Monday, and then completed its trans-global journey with a sharp drop where it had all started. While a global rout continued into Tuesday, anxiety subsided in the United States, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 1.7 percent at the close. The gains helped erase some of the losses over the past week, although the S.&P. 500 is still more than 6 percent off its peak in late January.
No degree in finance was required to divine the lesson of the moment: Markets go down as well as up, a reality often drowned out by the euphoric celebrations to greet one record or another being shattered.
While trading in the United States was clearly the initial source of alarm, the concerns spread to everywhere that money changes hands. The American economy had swapped the frivolity of a stock market party for the grim trappings of a bedside vigil. The result was gloom and anxiety in every reach of the financial sphere.
"The United States is by some distance the largest market on earth," said Gaurav Saroliya, director of global macro strategy at Oxford Economics in London. "Growth in the United States has a huge bearing on economies everywhere. If the largest market is selling off, that has a very powerful effect on investment sentiment. It makes people risk averse."
The fear that seized the United States was the spawn of good times. As the feeling sank in that stock trading was governed by a surplus of exuberance, the odds increased that the Federal Reserve would dampen the festivities by lifting interest rates faster than policymakers had previously telegraphed.
Not for nothing, central banks are seen by investors as crucial yet fun-averse grown-ups charged with solemnly watching for trouble. When crises emerge, they make money available to spur commerce while keeping terror at bay. The global economic expansion underway now is in large part a product of the Fed's swiftly unleashing an overwhelming surge of credit after the start of the financial crisis in 2008, combined with the slower yet, eventually, effective torrent of cash delivered by the European Central Bank.
But when the party gets raging -- when economies accelerate and stock prices ascend to levels out of whack with fundamentals -- central bankers play killjoy, lifting interest rates to snuff out attendant dangers.
Higher rates diminish speculation that can end badly by making credit more expensive. They slow economic growth while making stocks less appealing, because corporations must pay more to keep up with their debts. Investors can make more just by keeping their holdings in cash or bonds, rather than by accepting the higher risk of stocks.
The bitter irony of the current swoon is that it was triggered by the emergence of something the world has been awaiting for years: higher wages for workers.
Even as unemployment rates have lowered drastically in Britain, Japan and the United States, companies have continued to find new ways to make more products and sell more services without paying more to their employees. This has been a major source of unhappiness among working people, and a subject of consternation among policymakers.
Then, last Friday, the latest monthly snapshot of the American labor market revealed that wages had climbed 2.9 percent in January compared with a year earlier. The tight job market was forcing employers to pay more.
This appeared to presage a strengthening of American consumer power. If more working people take home more money, they will presumably be more inclined to buy houses and cars, generating jobs in construction and at auto plants from Michigan to South Carolina. They will fill restaurants, necessitating more truck drivers to ferry the food, and more mechanics to keep the trucks running.
This same so-called virtuous cycle appeared to be amplifying global growth. More cars made in the United States would require more brake linings made in Mexico and more circuitry forged in China, using copper mined in Chile. More construction would require equipment from Germany and Japan, and more iron ore from Brazil to make steel.
This interconnectivity has been central to the anticipation that a strengthening economy in the United States would lift fortunes around the world.
But the increase in wages for American workers meant something else. It was a flashing warning to investors about potential inflation, or rising prices, which have crippled many economies. The Fed, always vigilant, wields a standard tool for snuffing out inflation if necessary: higher interest rates.
This is how a positive jobs report, presumably a sign of a strengthening American economy, wound up as the impetus for the dumping of stocks from Taipei to Toronto. It enhanced the likelihood that the Fed would raise rates faster. It prompted investors to wonder how long the European Central Bank could maintain its own ultralow rates.
In the past year, Europe has shaken off perpetual worries of a grinding decline to emerge as one of the faster-growing major economies on earth. Inflation remains weak in Europe, undergirding expectations that the central bank will be slow to take back its free money.
But if the Fed were to lift rates faster, that could prompt Europe and perhaps even Japan to follow suit. Otherwise, the United States would be in a position to capture an outsize share of global investment, as rates presumably rise on American government bonds.
All of this is playing out amid a transition in central bank leadership. At the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, the economist who was the chairwoman of the Board of Governors, on Monday completed her term and handed power to her successor, Jerome H. Powell. Mr. Powell is widely expected to continue Ms. Yellen's cautious march toward higher interest rates. Still, as a newcomer taking the tiller in the midst of extraordinary volatility, he is a variable.
Mario Draghi, the Italian who heads the European Central Bank, is scheduled to complete his eight-year term late next year. At the Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda's term as governor expires in April, and there is uncertainty over whether he will be reappointed.
Some economists think that the dour talk is overblown and that the stock markets are running on emotion untethered from economic reality, a narrative that gained force as markets in New York snapped back from the depths on Tuesday.
The fundamentals of the United States expansion remain intact. Rising wages should indeed give people money to spend without resorting to some newfangled credit bubble that ends tragically.
Whatever the interest rates, central banks retain trillions of dollars on their balance sheets earmarked for buying up financial assets, making credit available. And the return to higher interest rates is inevitable, a healthy turn for a world economy that can finally close the books on the global financial crisis that began a decade ago.
"We have gotten used to this low interest rate environment," said Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at SEB, a global investment bank based in Stockholm. "This is not the normal situation."
The global economic expansion has occasioned hopeful talk that the world now has multiple engines of growth, inoculating it against trouble in any single region. But the events of recent days have challenged that notion, given that a sudden deterioration of stock prices on Wall Street quickly burst into a global rout.
Sentiments are clearly a viral phenomenon. Yet the distress in global markets also underscores the fact that real economic fortunes are fused.
If General Electric, Ford and other multinational companies see their share prices brought down as borrowing costs climb, they could limit plans for expansion. The trend would be felt in diminished orders for computer chips made in Taiwan, flat-panel displays forged in South Korea and auto parts built in the Czech Republic. It could cool demand for raw materials harvested from Argentina to India to South Africa.
"Business cycles across different markets are more correlated than they have ever been," said Mr. Saroliya, of Oxford Economics. "It's the global supply chain."

Full text: We've been here before. Stocks can fall fast and bounce back hard, even if they haven't moved all that much or that quickly in recent years. But perhaps you haven't been here before. Maybe you just started investing in an individual retirement account or 401(k) at your first full-time job. Or perhaps you feared the stock market all through your 20s and 30s but finally got up the nerve to wade in 18 months ago.
And now, after watching the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fall by several percentage points since Thursday and bounce some of the way back on Tuesday, you have a different kind of fear: that all the stock market riches have been won already or that your emotions will get the best of you amid all of the volatility. It's tempting to sell what you have as quickly as possible to make that feeling go away.
But before you do, take a deep breath and ask yourself these six questions.
Is the Stream of News Useful?
Watching the overall market numbers move up and down on television or the internet can be addictive. Even if your net worth is low, when the market goes up and down by a few percentage points in a day, there can be sizable dollar amounts at stake.
But part of what you're trying to do here is avoid making panicked decisions. Big red or green arrows or commentators with raised voices generally don't induce calm. Also, those talking heads know nothing about you and why you invested in the first place. So don't base your actions on their pontificating and pronouncements.
Why Did You Invest in the First Place?
Let's say you're in the first half of your career. You probably invested in stocks because over the very long haul, they deliver better returns than the other investment choices that are easily available to you at an online brokerage firm or through your workplace retirement plan.
When you buy stocks, you're purchasing tiny little pieces of the profits that our capitalist system generates. Nothing about the events of the last few days suggests that the system is under siege. Quite the contrary: The markets may be spooked in part by the fact that the economy is humming along so nicely that companies will have to pay more for workers. That can hurt the profits that help drive stock prices and also lead to inflation.
What Is Your Timing?
You invest because you want to retire in four decades or send your kids to college in two decades, or buy a home or a boat in one. Or maybe it's something else entirely. Whatever the goal, it probably comes with a rough time horizon: You want to do this thing starting around that time.
The small overall decline in the stock market over the past few days pales in comparison with the large gains over the past few years. So hopefully you're still on schedule to meet your goals, absent any big health or job changes.
This moment of checking your gut, however, is as good a time as any to consider whether you have the right proportion of your money in stocks versus other options like cash, bonds or real estate that don't experience this kind of volatility or may not rise or fall in tandem with stocks. In other words, are you taking too much risk? Or too little? If so, buy or sell some stocks accordingly -- not because of what the stock market will or will not do next but because you are or are not on track to pay for the things you want to buy someday.
Can You Predict What the Market Will Do Next?
Let me answer that one for you: No. Perhaps you got lucky with some individual stocks as a teenager or used what you learned in finance class to buy just the right mutual fund at exactly the right time.
Congratulations! But you're almost certainly more lucky than you are smart. Professionals rarely do so well over 50 years that their decisions about when to get in and out of a stock lead to better performance than they might have achieved by just putting money into an index fund that buys every stock in a particular category. And you can't know ahead of time whether you are that rare breed of market genius.
Still tempted to sell and wait out this latest market hiccup? Plenty of studies warn against this, including one that shows that missing out on just 10 of the best days in the stock market over 160,000 daily returns in 15 markets around the world can cause you to end up with about half of what you would have earned if you had stuck with an index fund over time.
How Much Does This Affect Your Net Worth?
Any decline hurts, even if it's only on paper and you don't plan on selling for decades. But consider everything else that might happen over that many years.
You will (hopefully) pay down your student loan debt. You will (hopefully) get promotions and raises or start a company that will increase your income. You will buy a home, and its value will probably go up over time, or at least match inflation. Or you'll rent and draw dividends from the freedom and flexibility that brings you.
In other words, you are not the stock market. There is so much more to your net worth (and, hopefully, self worth) than a bouncing S.&P. 500 chart. Check in with your life, and if it's better than it was a year or five years ago, think about that if the stock market keeps falling.
Can You Sleep at Night?
Some of us (O.K., me, although I do a good job of hiding it in my columns) are more anxiety-prone than others. And maybe there is only so far we can go toward suppressing those feelings.
So be it. Maybe holding stocks, or a high allocation of stocks in a college savings account for a 12-year-old (me again), isn't right for you. That's not a character flaw. But it does have ramifications. You may have to work more or work longer or take on a side hustle to meet your goals. If that doesn't bother you, lower your stock holdings accordingly.
Above all, know yourself. The call to action at times like this may feel urgent. But chances are that if you're new at this, you have many decades of investing ahead of you. So there's no rush to make a buy or sell decision right this very second.

G.O.P. Stimulus Moves Are Stoking Fears of Inflation and Deficits

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Republicans are pouring government stimulus into a steadily strengthening economy, adding economic fuel at a moment when unemployment is at a 16-year low and wages are beginning to rise, a combination that is stoking fears of higher inflation and ballooning budget deficits. The $1.5 trillion tax cut that President Trump signed into law late last year, combined with a looming agreement to increase federal spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, would deliver a larger short-term fiscal boost than President Barack Obama and Democrats packed into their $835 billion stimulus package in the Great Recession.
The administration is also expected to soon roll out its $1.5 trillion infrastructure package, which would include $200 billion in new federal spending, offset by unspecified cuts elsewhere.
The question is how much added fuel is good for the economy.
Fears that the extra economic boost could spark faster inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to accelerate the pace of interest rate increases appear to be at least partially driving the stock sell-off that has rattled markets over the last several days. Higher interest rates would raise federal borrowing costs as the United States continues to borrow heavily -- the national debt has topped $20 trillion and annual deficits are creeping up toward $1 trillion. Treasury officials said last week that the United States will need to borrow $441 billion in privately held debt this quarter, the largest sum since 2010, when the economy was emerging from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.
The added stimulus is drawing some quiet cheers from liberal economists, who say a fiscal shot at a time of low unemployment could boost typical workers' wages in ways unseen for two decades. But it is raising alarms among fiscal hawks.
"This is exactly the wrong fiscal policy at the wrong time," said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "We should be bringing down the debt and ensuring we have room for stimulus during downturns. Instead we are overheating the economy and selling out the future. It's shortsighted and foolhardy."
The threat of rate increases is a major reason some economists, including those at the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, project only a modest boost in economic growth from the tax law over the next decade.
The tax cuts and spending increases could add up to more than $800 billion in additional federal deficits over the course of 2018 and 2019. Analysts project they will hasten the return of trillion-dollar annual budget deficits, and set the United States apart from other industrialized economies, which have reined in their fiscal expansions as growth picks up.
"In a world of deficit discipline," Ethan S. Harris, the head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research note on Tuesday, "the U.S. stands out in terms of its deteriorating deficit."
The Republican tax law's $1.5 trillion deficit-financed price tag over the next decade is front-loaded. It will reduce federal revenue by $416 billion over this year and next, before accounting for additional economic growth, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. Many corporations are showing evidence of that in their quarterly earnings releases, as companies like JPMorgan Chase & Company and Verizon project billions of dollars in tax savings in 2018.
Administration officials say the law will spark enough growth to pay for itself, a claim that no rigorous outside analysis supports. They also say the cuts will not stoke inflation, because they will increase the supply of capital in the economy and boost productivity.
Economic modeling by the administration suggests growth from such tax cuts "does not put upward pressure on prices," Kevin Hassett, the chairman of Mr. Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday morning. Still, he said, "it's clear that the data are so strong that the markets are beginning to worry about Fed policy" and rising interest rates.
Republicans have not offered similar reassurances about deficit-financed spending increases. Those appear increasingly likely as congressional leaders work toward a deal to shatter caps on military and domestic spending, imposed in the back half of Mr. Obama's first term to instill fiscal discipline, to help pave the way for a long-term spending package.
The likely spending increases include money for the military, domestic programs and disaster aid, along with a plan to shore up faltering multiemployer pension plans. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that those increases will cost more than $500 billion, and that congressional negotiators are mulling roughly $100 billion in revenue increases to offset them, yielding a deficit increase of $400 billion.
Those figures do not include any potential deficit spending from an infrastructure bill, which the White House hopes to push Congress to approve this year.
Mr. Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act included about $300 billion in additional spending for 2009 and 2010, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and slightly less than $300 billion in tax cuts and refundable tax credits. Adjusting for inflation, that would be a combined stimulus of about $675 billion in today's dollars. Each of those amounts is lower than the comparable projections for the new tax law and the contemplated new spending increases.
The 2009 stimulus package was passed when the unemployment rate was almost twice as high as it is today, and the national debt was half what it is now. At that time, Republicans called it a dangerous borrowing spree. "This bill sends us on a worldwide borrowing binge," Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, now the House speaker, said in a floor debate in 2009. "We're going to go out and borrow four times as much money this year than we ever have in the history of this country in a single year. This is not just a road to stagnation, it is a road to stagflation."
Fiscal hawks say that assessment is more applicable to the economy today.
"We have a growing economy, the labor market's tight, we don't have a lot of idle resources," said Matthew Mitchell, the director of the Project for the Study of American Capitalism at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. "Basically, the very best argument for Keynesian economics doesn't apply now. So it really is the time to be austere."
While divided government in the last six years of Mr. Obama's term produced constraints on spending, Mr. Mitchell noted, Republican control under Mr. Trump appears to be ripping them up. Democrats are helping to do that on the spending side. The spending agreements pending in Congress appear to be so large, in part, because Democrats have demanded domestic discretionary spending increases alongside large increases in military spending pushed by Republican defense hawks.
Democrats largely denounce Republicans for playing down deficit concerns now, after years of warning that government borrowing was holding the economy back. "There was a far greater need for economic stimulus in 2011 than today," said Neera Tanden, a former Obama adviser who is the president and chief executive of the Center for American Progress think tank.
But some liberals welcome the extra fiscal juice and its potential to help workers who struggled in the slow-growth years after the recession.
Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was one of the Obama administration's stimulus architects in 2009, opposed the Trump tax bill but supports efforts to stimulate the economy when unemployment is low, in hopes of boosting wage growth.
"There's a kind of recklessness of Team Trump that could kind of rebound to the benefit of people," Mr. Bernstein said in an interview, before alluding to the possibility that there are still workers outside the labor force who could be drawn back to work by a hotter economy.
"As long as there is still slack in corners of the labor market," he said, "then this kind of fiscal stimulus of the economy near full employment is a kind of test I support."

Full text: What is the stock market telling us with its precipitous drop over the last several days? In all likelihood, not much of anything. That's because the stock market, though crucial in the long run for individuals accumulating wealth and companies raising capital, is so erratic as to be useless in providing information about the short run. The 8.5 percent drop in the S.&P. 500 through Monday's close (before a 1.7 percent rebound on Tuesday) could signify the onset of a global recession. But it could just as well mean only that some trading algorithms at a big hedge fund collided in weird ways.
For what really matters -- the well-being of the economy and the ability for individuals and companies to prosper in the years ahead -- look first to fundamental economic data, especially those that tend to be leading indicators. Second, look to the bond market and other financial market indicators that are more reliable measures of investors' expectations than stock prices.
There is good news on both fronts, as both point to a global economy that will continue growing steadily in the months and years ahead, perhaps with inflation that is a bit higher than in the recent past. That contrasts this market sell-off with drops in 2011, 2015 and 2016, which coincided with pessimistic signals in both economic data and the bond market.
The stock market can, when looked at in concert with these other indicators, provide some useful insight. Right now it appears to be more noise than signal.
The economic data has been solid in recent weeks. Just Friday, the Labor Department reported that the United States added a robust 200,000 jobs in January. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta tracks incoming economic data to estimate current growth of gross domestic product, and its indicator is pointing toward robust economic expansion -- a 4 percent annual rate.
Of course, there is plenty of statistical error built into those numbers, and they may turn out to be incorrect. But even many of the real-time indicators that tend to work as early warnings of an economic slump are looking just fine. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators ticked up in its most recent release, and weekly claims for unemployment insurance benefits have hovered near record lows in recent weeks.
Just Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of activity at service companies rose sharply in January, which made it one of those curious days when good economic news coincided with a steep market sell-off.
The bond market is also looking optimistic about the future, with prices suggesting that continued growth -- without inflationary overheating -- is the most likely future.
The stock market has lost ground since the start of the year, thanks to the sharp sell-off Monday. But the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds is up in that span, from 2.4 percent to 2.8 percent at Tuesday's close. That suggests bond investors think that continued steady recovery will allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates gradually.
Bond investors are pricing in higher inflation than the United States has experienced in recent years, but roughly in line with the 2 percent the Federal Reserve aims for. Prices for inflation-protected bonds imply 2.09 percent annual inflation over the coming decade, up from 1.98 percent at the start of the year.
Other market indicators that might signal global economic troubles, like the price of oil, instead point to a steady-as-she-goes global economy.
None of this makes a case for economic complacency. There are plenty of things that could go wrong in the world, from conflict on the Korean Peninsula or in the Middle East to destructive trade wars. But if the stock market was actually giving us any insight into the likelihood of those outcomes, we would expect to see moves in bond and commodity markets that just aren't happening.
Think of it this way. The economy is like a horse race -- and what we really care about is which horse wins, places or shows. The bond market is the equivalent of the people betting directly on the race. And while of course gamblers get it wrong sometimes, the market is efficient enough that there's a fairly direct relationship between the odds a horse pays and its probability of victory.
The stock market, by contrast, is like a weird side game in which people bet one another on which gambler is going to have the best day. It's erratic, volatile and a couple of degrees removed from the underlying horse race on which it is all based.
And that's why the best way to make sense of the drop in the stock market is to think of it as a sideshow to the broader trajectory of the United States and global economy, which for now look perfectly fine.

Full text: The fear generated by Wall Street's sharp fall in recent days had been greatly magnified by the calm that preceded it. Before the 8 percent decline in United States stocks over the past week -- which was followed by a bounce back of nearly 2 percent on Tuesday -- the S. & P. 500 had gone two years without suffering a drop that large. Spoiled by this unnaturally placid stretch, many Americans had forgotten what a routine market setback even looks like. They better get used to this. In a typical year, according to data going back three decades, the market experiences a correction of about 10 percent. What Americans are witnessing now is thus a return to normal market behavior, which has never followed a straight line.
This year could be pivotal, because the conditions that underpinned the steady upward march of stock prices are now likely to deteriorate. In the United States and around the world, stocks have been buoyed by the trifecta of accelerating global growth, low inflation and loose central bank policies, all of which are now poised to turn against the bubbly market.
Optimists believe that the global economy this year can still grow 4 percent, the pace it maintained during the post-World War II miracle. But the miracle was driven mainly by the postwar baby boom, which ended years ago. Many investors have yet to internalize the fact that 4 percent growth is unrealistic. Fewer workers means slower economic growth and will make it difficult for the world economy to sustain even its 2017 pace of just over 3 percent growth.
Fewer workers also means labor shortages and higher inflation. Unemployment rates are close to a 40-year low in developed economies, including the United States. If the United States economy keeps adding 200,000 jobs per month, as it did in January, the unemployment rate could fall below 3.5 percent by the end of the year. And a rate that low has never been sustained in the past.
This looming shortage of workers is now putting upward pressure on wage growth, which has been steadily rising in recent months. And historically, wage growth has been a strong driver of inflation, as workers use their expanded paycheck to bid up prices for goods and services.
This then is the big picture: Over the past year, investors worldwide have been pleasantly surprised by an unusual combination of economic growth beating their expectations and inflation undershooting expectations. These pleasant surprises fed an unnatural calm. Over the coming year, these forces are likely to reverse, as labor shortages slow growth and begin to drive up inflation and bring a normal level of volatility back to the markets.
The scale and timing of a turn in the markets is likely to be decided by the third leg of the trifecta: easy money. Central banks have been printing money like never before, holding interest rates at record lows for extended stretches. Investors have used this cheap liquidity to drive up prices for everything from stocks and bonds to Bitcoin and fine art. The United States stock market is now around 25 percent higher than it would have been had it grown at its historic average pace.
Stock values have rarely risen so high, yet many seasoned investors had come to believe that these nosebleed valuations could be justified as long as the Federal Reserve Board kept interest rates low. When investors are worried about the future, they move money into cash, and today their cash balances are at record lows. In other words, complacency was arguably at a record high when the correction began last week.
Watching their market wealth soar, even average middle-class Americans got caught up in the faith that nothing could go wrong. They started spending aggressively again, after dialing back in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The United States savings rate has fallen to a mere 2.4 percent, from post-crisis peaks of well over 6 percent. Consumer credit card debt is rising. By some estimates, the confidence inspired by rising stock prices accounted for a third of the economic growth over the past two years.
In the past, whenever the stock market has been this expensive, an increase in interest rates has brought it back down to earth. In recent years, the swelling size of the stock market has magnified the potential economic impact of a correction. If the stock market suddenly reverts to its long-term trend, implying a fall of almost 25 percent, it could push the American economy close to recession.
All eyes are now on the central bank. Confidence that the idyllic economic conditions of the past year will last indefinitely has been rattled, particularly as wage growth begins to signal a return of inflation. Many investors are fretting that the Fed may be compelled to raise rates faster than anyone had expected, just the kind of negative surprise that could deflate sky-high prices in all assets, and not only for stocks. The year 2018 may be remembered as the time when the moody market beast returned to its natural state.

How a Roaring Economy Spooked the Stock Market

Full text: "The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is great news for Americans' 401(k), retirement, pension and college savings accounts." That was President Trump only a week ago during his State of the Union address as he triumphantly touted the gains in the stock market since he became president.
And then, well, you know. Stocks plunged Friday, and on Monday the market continued to plummet. The Dow fell almost 1,600 points at one point before finishing down more than 1,100 points, or 4.6 percent.
Fingers, of course, are pointing.
The president's critics have said his decision to tether his success or failure to the stock market was ludicrous.
Yes, it was a mistake, but not for the reason you might think.
The reason for the market's downward turn isn't that investors believe his stimulus measures, like tax cuts and deregulation, are failing, or might fail.
It is quite the opposite: Investors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down by raising interest rates faster than expected.
Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. Don't forget what set off the plunge on Friday: better-than-expected job growth numbers.
It is very possible that by the time election season comes around for 2020, even if this market dip is simply a blip, the economy will be, or will have been, in a recession.
To explain the phenomenon, Ray Dalio, the founder of the largest hedge fund in the world, Bridgewater Associates, imagined the president at the wheel of car.
"Fiscal stimulation is hitting the gas, which is driving the economy forward into the capacity constraints," Mr. Dalio said. That, he added, "is triggering interest rate increases that are hitting the brakes, first in the markets and later in the economy."
Before all the pundits pass out from hyperventilating over the market "correction" -- and quick fact-check: technically a correction is defined as a drop of 10 percent or more -- let's take a deep breath: The market's fall may seem precipitous, but it has dipped only 8.5 percent from the top.
That's certainly significant, especially if you jumped into the market in the last several weeks for the first time. But, in truth, it's as if we had turned back the clock to where the stock market was in the middle of December, when investors -- and, yes, the president -- were proudly cheering its success.
The market was always bound to turn downward after a record run. Early last week, Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, predicted as much, saying, "Whatever the trigger, a correction of some kind seems a high probability in the coming months." He probably didn't appreciate how quickly he would be proved right.
Despite a steady drumbeat of optimism about the economy from top business executives -- and rightly so, given the record results they've been producing and expect to produce over the next year -- some investors have been quietly suggesting that the market was starting to look expensive when factoring in the likelihood of inflation.
"With the global economy rebounding and resource utilization tightening, we are carefully positioning for the possibility that inflation surprises to the upside," Ken Griffin, a co-founder of the Chicago hedge fund Citadel, wrote in a note to his investors last week.
At the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, Switzerland, chief executives were remarkably optimistic about their own businesses and the economy. But Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, added a note of caution: Things were going so well, he said, that "I promise you, we are going to be sitting here in a year and you all will be worrying about inflation and wages going up too high."
That optimism may be an economic contra-indicator. "Optimism about global growth is disturbingly high at Davos," Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, told Reuters. "While I am of the opinion that the global economy is gaining momentum, I always find it discomforting when virtually everybody shares the same opinion. My fear is that that economic optimism is spilling over into global equities, which will lead to a mania in stocks."
For now, that fever may be breaking, but it is likely to be only temporary. "These big declines are just minor corrections in the scope of things, there is a lot of cash on the side to buy on the break, and what comes next will be most important," Mr. Dalio wrote in a note to his clients Monday.
How long this bull run will continue is anyone's guess, but the betting line is that while it may have another a year or two, it will end.
"History shows that economic cycles exhibit fairly consistent symptoms leading up to a recession," Guggenheim wrote in a note to investors late last year, "starting with a labor market that evolves from cool to hot and a monetary policy stance that progresses from loose to tight in response."
"Our analysis of these metrics suggests that the current expansion will end as soon as late 2019," Guggenheim wrote.
Just in time for the next presidential election.

Is Trump Correct That the U.K.'s National Health Service Is 'Not Working'?

Full text: LONDON -- In a tweet on Monday, President Trump claimed that thousands of people in Britain were marching because their country's National Health Service was "going broke and not working," and that Democrats pushing for universal health care in the United States were pursuing a similar failed model. Here is a closer look at his claims.
Is the N.H.S. 'Not Working'?
The National Health Service is certainly being stretched.
Since the start of this decade, budgetary austerity has kept annual growth in health spending at around 1.2 percent (adjusted for inflation) -- significantly less than the 4 percent increases that were the historic norm.
Patients often wait months, even for essential procedures. Waiting rooms are often crowded.
Such crowding -- and in particular immigrants' use of the health system -- was cited as a factor by some voters in Britain's June 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. But paradoxically, the plans for that "Brexit" may have made the situation worse: Fearing that they will not have a long-term future in Britain, many skilled health workers, particularly nurses, have left the country, exacerbating staff shortages.
Meanwhile, strains on the system have been worsened by an unusually strong flu outbreak this winter that forced hospitals to cancel many elective procedures and, in some cases, delay surgeries for patients with life-threatening conditions like cancer and heart disease.
A shortage of beds has also resulted in delays to emergency services, with some patients waiting up to 12 hours in emergency wards before being seen.
Do Britons Want to Get Rid of It?
Not at all. In fact, the thousands who marched in London on Saturday were there not to criticize the health service, but to urge the government to support it and give it greater funding to cope with the winter crisis.
Protesters carried banners reading "More Staff, More Beds, More Funds" and "Saving Lives Costs Money, Saving Money Costs Lives." They chanted, "Keep your hands off our N.H.S."
Created in 1948 during a bleak period after World War II, the National Health Service is seen as one of Britain's most cherished institutions -- a greater source of pride, according to some polls, than even the monarchy.
The service is known for its simplicity: It is free at the point of use to anyone who needs it. Paperwork is minimal, and most patients never see a bill. Almost no one in Britain is bankrupted by medical expenses, no one needs to delay medical treatment until they can afford it, and virtually everyone is covered.
To take one measure, the United States spends more than all other rich nations on health care, but with decidedly mixed outcomes. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States spent 17.2 percent of its economic output on health care in 2016, compared with 9.7 percent in Britain. Yet Britain has a higher life expectancy at birth and lower infant mortality.
Why Did Mr. Trump Mention It?
Many observers noted that Mr. Trump wrote his Twitter post less than an hour after Nigel Farage -- the former leader of the populist U.K. Independence Party and an ally of Mr. Trump -- appeared on a Fox News program and claimed that the pressures faced by the N.H.S. were caused by immigration.
"The big problem we've got is a population crisis caused by government policy on immigration," Mr. Farage said. "We have a population of 65 million, but it's increasing by half a million people a year. We just haven't got enough hospitals, we haven't got enough doctors, we haven't got enough facilities."
Mr. Farage also warned that if the United States introduced a universal health care system, it would become "politically impossible" to return to a private system or reduce the benefits.
"Let's be in no doubt we've got a big problem, a really big problem with the N.H.S.," he said.
Britain's political leaders were quick to answer Mr. Trump. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was "proud" of the service, and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, also a member of her governing Conservative Party, responded on Twitter by criticizing America's health care system for not covering all of its citizens.
Who Favors Such a System?
It depends. Many Americans -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- talk about support for "universal health care," but that term usually refers to universal health insurance coverage, and there are competing visions of how to achieve that goal.
Public support for a single-payer system -- one in which the government pays medical bills -- has been growing, and politicians on the left like Bernie Sanders have urged America to "join every industrialized country and guarantee health care to all Americans as a right." (The United States does have a single-payer system, Medicare, for Americans over 65.) Polls show that a plurality, but not a majority, favor such a system.
Before the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010, President Barack Obama expressed sympathy for the single-payer approach, but he ultimately went for a complex system of tax credits and legislative and spending changes to expand insurance coverage -- bringing down the number of uninsured to 28 million in 2016, from more than 48 million in 2010.
Although a Republican effort to repeal the law failed last summer, the system remains on shaky ground. The Republican-led Congress recently rescinded the part of the law that requires individuals to hold health insurance, but companies with more than 50 people are still required to offer coverage for their workers.
For now, the system of subsidy payments to help low-income Americans get coverage remains intact, as does the system of exchanges from which people not covered through their employers can shop for a health plan.
The Takeaway
Mr. Trump may have had a point -- that many British people are unhappy with their National Health Service -- but not one that supports his overall view.
Most British people want more funding to shore up their single-payer system, and support for getting rid of it is negligible.

Full text: If measured by news headlines, you might assume these are dire times in the financial markets. There is a "market meltdown" in the United States and "ugly, ugly scenes" in the European exchanges. Evidence of higher wages was "whacking" global markets last week, while higher bond yields threatened to "topple" a multiyear rally. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 666 points, as if scripted by a devilish hack, which was followed by an even steeper decline Monday, amid erratic trading.
There is an important idea to keep in mind at a time like this: Take the long view.
This market decline so far has returned the market roughly to its level in mid-December, less than two months ago. The 7.8 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 over the last six trading days is similar in scale and speed to drops in January 2016 and August 2015, neither of which left lasting scars, and is short of the 10 percent drop that would qualify as a market correction.
But some common cognitive errors are making this sell-off seem more dramatic than it is. And the reasons behind it may be more benign than it seems at first glance.
Media coverage frequently emphasizes moves in the Dow Jones industrial average. But you probably developed your intuition for how to interpret those numbers at a time when the index was much lower.
The Dow fell by 1,175 points Monday, which represents a quite large 4.6 percent decline. But while it was the biggest single-day point decline, there were steeper percentage declines on several occasions during the global financial crisis and its aftermath, not to mention the 508- point drop in the Dow in 1987 that represented a 22.6 percent market crash.
At a minimum, update your mental calculus of what constitutes a "big" market swing. Even better, focus on percent changes rather than point swings in an arbitrarily constructed index.
But our perceptions are distorted by more than thinking of points rather than percentages. The last 18 months have been one of the least volatile periods for the stock market in modern times. Humans have a bias toward recency, an inclination to let recent experience shape our expectations for the future.
The S.&P. 500 did not decline by more than 2 percent on a single trading day in all of 2017, which helps explain why Friday's 2.1 percent drop seemed so startling. (The percentage drop on Monday was a much rarer event, one that last occurred in 2011.)
But 2017 was weird. There were five such days in 2016, six in 2015 and four in 2014. In 2011, there were 21 trading days in which the S.&P. fell by more than 2 percent, nearly two per month. A bit of overreaction is as natural as people in normally dry Los Angeles having trouble driving in the rain.
There's no doubt that the 7.8 percent drop since Jan. 26 is substantial; it represents nearly $2 trillion of paper wealth. But you find some better news underneath that unpleasant fact when you look at what has happened in the bond market while stocks have been falling.
Frequently when investors become more pessimistic about the economy, stocks fall and the yield on bonds falls as well. That pattern happens because a weaker economy implies not just lower corporate profits (hence the falling stock indexes) but lower inflation and continued low interest rates from the Federal Reserve (which implies bonds are more valuable and their yield should fall).
But that hasn't been the pattern in this downturn. During the stock market swoon on Friday, the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds rose sharply. Bond market measures of future inflation rose. Even after that trend reversed during the Monday sell-off, interest rates are still higher after this drop in markets (2.7 percent at Monday's close) than they were before (2.66 percent on Jan. 26).
Instead of reflecting economic pessimism, this stock market sell-off seems rooted in a form of optimism -- that employers will have to pay higher wages, cutting into profits, and that higher inflation will cause the Fed to raise rates faster than had been assumed. Throw in some worry that markets were getting a little overheated and you have a recipe for the downturn we've just witnessed.
In other words, this bad news for stock investors seems to be driven in part by good news for workers. And since most people earn more money from their jobs than from their investment portfolios, that's a trade a lot of people would be happy to take.
This downward swing in markets may be the kind of occasional stumble that every bull market experiences, or could be the beginning of the end of a market rally that has been going on for an awful long time.
But regardless of which it becomes, it's good for everyone's mental health to look beyond the day's headlines and focus instead on percentage changes instead of point changes -- and on historical patterns and the "why" behind the day's drop in the markets.

Full text: Since the global financial crisis a decade ago, a few simple guidelines have helped investors make sense of the markets. Global growth and inflation will be perpetually weak. Central banks will help by keeping interest rates low. And stocks will almost invariably rise.
The rule book is now changing, a shift that is sending tremors through the financial markets. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell by more than 4 percent on Monday, deepening its losses from the previous week and erasing its gains for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average sank by 4.6 percent. Bond yields, the basis for key borrowing costs such as mortgage rates, have risen fast in recent weeks.
In trading in Asia on Tuesday morning, markets signaled another tough day. Major stock markets in the region plunged after the drop in the United States on Monday, suggesting the pain could continue. In Japan, stocks were down more than 5 percent in morning trading, while shares in Hong Kong were down more than 4 percent.
Those sharp moves come as investors digest the growth prospects for the world -- and rebalance their views on the relative merits of stashing their cash in risky assets like stocks, safer spots such as government bonds and the myriad investment opportunities offered by a global economy moving in sync.
The world's largest economies are all expanding, as the most important central bank, the United States Federal Reserve, is draining billions of dollars from the financial system and raising interest rates. And investors are concerned that tenuous signs of inflation could mean central banks around the world will start to remove their support even faster.
It's an interesting complexity for investors to assess. What's good for the economy isn't always good for the markets. The strong job report last week fueled hopes that wage growth would follow. But higher wages could lead to higher inflation, creating new challenges for the central bank to manage.
New leadership at the Fed is adding a degree of uncertainty. Jerome H. Powell was sworn in as the 16th chairman of the Federal Reserve on Monday, after the departure of his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. The markets do not have a clear understanding of exactly how, if at all, Mr. Powell's views on unemployment and inflation will differ from that of Ms. Yellen.
A rocky patch for the markets could become awkward for President Trump. He has repeatedly claimed credit for surging stocks, while business optimism over his push to cut taxes and decrease regulation has helped fuel the "Trump Bump."
While giving a speech during Monday's sell-off, Mr. Trump made no mention of stocks. Afterward, the White House instead extolled the "long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment, and increasing wages for American workers."
Mr. Trump's habit of regularly boasting about stock market surges is a practice other presidents avoided. They knew that what goes up may go down again, and they did not want to take the blame for market forces beyond their control.
Stocks surged broadly during the president's first year in office. By late January the S.&P. 500 was up 27 percent since Mr. Trump's inauguration. But the last few days of trading cut those gains to just 17 percent.
"When you get this kind of sell-off, it kind of feeds on itself," said Michael P. Ryan, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Wealth Management.
Although the market opened lower on Monday, it actually had climbed into positive territory in the morning. But the declines snowballed throughout the afternoon. The 4.1 percent drop was the worst for the S.&P. since August 2011.
Back then, the sell-off followed growing concern about a chaotic budgeting process in the United States. A showdown between Congress and the Obama administration over the debt ceiling brought the country to the brink of default. In response, credit rating firm Standard & Poor's stripped the United States of its triple-A rating, spooking markets.
The economy today is in tricky territory from a markets perspective. Investors have been excited about the prospects of the tax cuts, but they are also fretting that the government may be spending too much to pay for them.
Economists often advise governments to run large deficits during recessions to stimulate growth. But the United States economy is already solid.
It grew at an annual pace of 2.6 percent last quarter. Unemployment was 4.1 percent January.
In essence, the $1.5 trillion tax cut may be stimulus that the economy does not need. The extra money raises the prospect that the economy could overheat, stoking inflation.
"We're pouring a tremendous amount of fuel on the fire," said Rick Rieder, who oversees roughly $1.7 trillion in assets as global chief investment officer for fixed income at the asset manager BlackRock.
Global investors are also trying to navigate a changing economic backdrop.
After years of sluggish growth, major economies in Europe and Japan appear to have good momentum. On Monday, an index of eurozone purchasing manager activity, considered a good gauge of growth, hit a 12-year high, suggesting that the surprisingly strong European economy has further room to grow.
Against the strength, investors are wondering whether those central banks will tamp down on their efforts to help growth, which could send interest rates higher. Investors are anticipating that the European Central Bank could pull back, depending on the economic conditions.
The weakness on display in the United States set the tone for foreign markets. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped by 2.6 percent on Monday. Benchmark equity indexes in France, Italy and Spain all fell by more than 1 percent.
In the United States, financial stocks endured some of the steepest drops, led by Wells Fargo. After the close of trading Friday, the large lender was the subject of an extraordinary regulatory action when the Fed barred it from growing until it improved corporate controls.
Industrial stocks tumbled 4.5 percent. The aluminum maker Arconic fell 8.9 percent after its earnings failed to impress investors. The company also said it would bolster capital spending to ramp up production.
Likewise, ExxonMobil fell 5.7 percent Monday. The energy giant disappointed investors with its quarterly earnings report last week. The energy sector was one of the worst-performing parts of the S.&P. 500, falling by 4.4 percent.
The corporate environment reflects forces, along with the changing course of global central banks, that could further add to the choppiness of markets.
For example, oil prices have risen as global growth has picked up steam. That encourages energy companies like ExxonMobil to increase investment, as does provisions in the tax overhaul that make capital spending more advantageous. ExxonMobil has said it plans to spend $50 billion on investments in the United States over the next five years.
Those investments could be good business moves and help feed into the broader economy. But they could also send share prices lower in the short term, as investors have become accustomed to companies using investment dollars to buy back their own stock, a popular move for corporations in recent years. Goldman Sachs analysts recently noted that corporations themselves represent the single largest source of demand for stocks in the United States.
Now, the combination of global growth and tax incentives to make capital investments "actually completely changed the paradigm to just borrow to buy back your stock," said Mr. Rieder of BlackRock.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Jerome H. Powell took the reins of the Federal Reserve on Monday with a depleted board and a list of challenges that has suddenly expanded to include a second day of stock market wobbles. Mr. Powell is unlikely to respond to the decline in stock prices unless it worsens dramatically. In remarks after his swearing-in as Fed chairman, he emphasized the health of the economy.
"Today, unemployment is low, the economy is growing and inflation is low," Mr. Powell said in a brief video statement that the Fed published on its website. "Through our decisions on monetary policy, we will support continued economic growth, a healthy job market and price stability."
The stock market declined 35 percent in the three months after Alan Greenspan became Fed chairman in August 1987, including the "Black Monday" crash in mid-October. Mr. Greenspan responded by sharply cutting the Fed's benchmark interest rate and issuing a public statement declaring that the Fed was ready and willing "to support the economic and financial system."
The intervention, which reversed the decline, was celebrated at the time, but it contributed to an expectation in financial markets that Mr. Greenspan would not allow stock prices to fall.
The current downturn is much smaller. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 6 percent since Thursday. Mr. Powell said on Monday that the economy is in good health. With unemployment low, the Fed is focused on raising its benchmark interest rates to stay ahead of inflation.
"Powell could have done without a slump in the U.S. stock market, but unless the slump becomes a rout, he is unlikely to intervene," wrote John Higgins, an economist at Capital Economics.
The Fed's enforcement action against Wells Fargo on Friday is another new addition to Mr. Powell's plate. The Fed halted the bank's growth until it improves its internal checks and balances, a move that comes as the Fed's seven-member board is down to just three governors, the smallest number in the institution's history.
In addition to Mr. Powell, the members of the board are Randal K. Quarles, the vice chairman for supervision, and Lael Brainard.
Mr. Quarles, who oversees financial regulation issues at the Fed, has recused himself from Wells Fargo-related business because he held significant investments in the firm before he joined the Fed last year. That leaves Ms. Brainard, the other member of the committee that oversees supervision, as the Fed's point person on the Wells case, although Mr. Powell would also participate in significant decisions.
Other Fed governors could be arriving. President Trump has nominated Marvin Goodfriend, a conservative economist, to join the board. He is awaiting Senate confirmation.
Mr. Trump has not announced nominees for the other three seats on the board.
The regulators who directly supervise Wells Fargo are employees of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, one of the 12 regional banks that make up the Fed system. Before the 2008 financial crisis, the regional reserve banks exercised significant control over the institutions headquartered in their regions. But in 2010, the Fed centralized the regulation of large banks to improve the consistency of regulation and to take a broad view of issues affecting multiple banks.
The judgment about Wells Fargo's progress will be made by a staff committee, the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, that is led by Michael S. Gibson, the Fed's director of supervision and regulation, in close consultation with the board of governors.
Wells Fargo has been through this process once before. The company was censured in December 2016 for failing to file an adequate plan for dealing with a financial crisis.
Mr. Powell was sworn into office by Mr. Quarles, a longtime friend. When Mr. Powell worked as a senior Treasury Department official under President George Bush in the early 1990s, he hired Mr. Quarles as an assistant. Later the two men worked together at the Carlyle Group, a private equity investment firm.
Mr. Quarles was selected by Mr. Trump as the Fed's point man for an overhaul of post-crisis financial regulations, which the president views as excessive. Mr. Powell on Monday reiterated his view that the financial system "is now far stronger and more resilient" as a result of increased regulation and "we intend to keep it that way." He added that there is room for improvement to make regulation "efficient as well as effective."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As President Trump boasted about the economy during a speech on Monday, he left out one of his favorite lines. Nowhere did he mention the skyrocketing stock market. Viewers at home understood why. In the corner of their television screens, a graphic showed the Dow Jones industrial average seemingly in free fall -- down 500 points, down 600, down 800, down 1,000.
By the time a bullish Mr. Trump was done speaking in Blue Ash, Ohio, the bearish market had plunged by nearly 1,600 points before recovering somewhat to close 1,175 points down.
No president in modern times has connected his political fortunes to the stock market as much as Mr. Trump, who relentlessly cited its meteoric rise as a sign of his success at restoring confidence in the American economy. But the drastic sell-off on Friday and Monday demonstrated why most presidents scrupulously avoid talking about short-term gyrations in share prices: If you live by the Dow, you may die by the Dow.
Barely a week went by last year when Mr. Trump did not crow about the rising market, making it a major talking point for his case to the country that he had made a difference. He took credit for the market at least 25 times in January alone. Even when the Dow fell 363 points on the day of his State of the Union address last week, Mr. Trump simply ignored the drop and talked about how the market had "smashed one record after another" since his election.
Despite the stumble of the past two trading sessions -- totaling 1,841 points, or 7 percent -- the Dow remains far higher under Mr. Trump, and there is no sign that the broader economy has lost momentum. But critics who have chafed at what they considered the president's shortsighted boasting for the past year saw Monday's meltdown as overdue comeuppance and eagerly piled on.
"Good time to recall that in the previous administration, we NEVER boasted about the stock market -- even though the Dow more than doubled on Obama's watch -- because we knew two things: 1) the stock market is not the economy; and 2) if you claim the rise, you own the fall," Jay Carney, a White House press secretary for President Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter.
It would be an exaggeration to say that Mr. Obama never trumpeted the market's performance -- "the stock market is booming," he said in 2014, a few days after boasting, "I don't have to tell you about the stock market and where that's gone." But it was rare enough that it stood out. Likewise, Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush made a point of generally avoiding public commentary on short-term market movements.
After Monday's tumble, Mr. Trump's aides were left in the awkward position of ignoring it or explaining that it was not especially meaningful. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who accompanied Mr. Trump to Ohio, declined to comment on the market when he encountered reporters on Air Force One during the trip back to Washington and again on the tarmac after it landed. The television on the plane was tuned to Fox Business Network as it dissected the day's dark developments.
"Look, markets do fluctuate in the short term. We all know that," Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, told reporters en route to Ohio when the market was heading down. "And they do that for number of reasons. But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong and they're headed in the right direction -- for the middle class, in particular."
After the president returned to the White House, his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, issued a written statement.
"The president's focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment and increasing wages for American workers," she said. "The president's tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people."
Those tax cuts may actually be contributing to the market's decline. Analysts attributed plummeting share prices to Friday's job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment. Rising wages are a good thing for those who receive them, and for the presidents who seek to stimulate them, but investors see them as a sign of possible inflation and higher interest rates.
Mr. Trump pushed through a $1.5 trillion tax cut plan in December to fuel faster growth despite warnings from economists that the economy did not need the help. The economy is growing slowly by historical standards, but the low level of unemployment suggests that it is also growing about as fast as it can.
Instead of fueling growth, investors worry that the extra money Mr. Trump is pumping into the economy through tax cuts and, if he is successful, with a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan will inflate wages and prices. And that could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly, suppressing growth to keep a lid on inflation.
"Even before the fiscal stimulus plan has really begun to kick in, we are already seeing markets worrying more about inflation," said Torsten Slok, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. "They are coming to the conclusion that the U.S. economy is in danger of overheating."
Concern about rising deficits may be weighing on financial markets, as well. The federal government, which competes with private investors for available funds, plans to borrow almost $1 trillion this year, a big jump from last year's total of $519 billion, the Treasury said last week. That is a direct result of the decision to cut taxes without reducing federal spending. Indeed, the administration is now pushing for more spending on defense.
Mr. Trump also decided last year that he would not nominate Janet L. Yellen for a second term as Fed chairwoman. Instead, he nominated Jerome H. Powell, who was sworn into office on Monday as the market opened for business.
Mr. Powell, who had been a Fed governor since 2012, has emphasized continuity. But investors have a long history of anxiety about new Fed chairmen. During Alan Greenspan's first months in office in 1987, the stock market lost more than 30 percent of its value. And Mr. Powell is a relatively unknown quantity on Wall Street.
Still, some analysts cautioned against overinterpreting the meaning of market movements.
"In many cases, it is near impossible to figure out what moves the stock market in any given day," said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard University economist and former chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Bush. "The stock market is a leading indicator, albeit an imperfect one. So it is natural to see a rising market as good news. But it is highly speculative to tie a stock market movement to any particular set of policies."
While the Dow closed at its lowest point in two months, the market remains well above where it was when Mr. Trump was elected. Even with the loss, the Dow is 23 percent higher than on Inauguration Day 2017 and 33 percent higher than on Election Day 2016.
Over all, the 25 percent increase in 2017 was the largest annual rise since 2013, when the Dow shot up by 26.5 percent. Over the eight years of Mr. Obama's presidency, which began at the depths of a financial crisis and recession, the market rose nearly 150 percent.
After calling attention to the daily running of the bulls for so much of the past year, Mr. Trump chose to focus on other metrics on Monday at a manufacturing plant in Ohio where the company used some of the proceeds from the tax cuts to give employees bonuses.
"Your paychecks are going way up," he told workers. "Your taxes are going way down. And right now, for the first time in a long time -- and you've seen it -- factories are coming back. Everything is coming back. They all want to be where the action is."
At least some of the action, for the moment, will be on the trading floor.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead: ECONOMY
Draghi to face questions on stimulus program.
The official reason that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is appearing on Monday before the European Parliament is to present the bank's annual report for 2017. But members of the European Parliament, meeting in Strasbourg, France, are certain to ask Mr. Draghi the burning question of the moment: When will the central bank end the stimulus program known as quantitative easing? If past experience is any guide, Mr. Draghi will stick to the script he used during a news conference in January. He will emphasize that, even though the eurozone is booming, the central bank will not stop pumping money into the economy until there are more convincing signs that inflation is picking up. Jack Ewing
Trade deficit likely to be highest in years.
The United States Commerce Department on Tuesday will release data for all of 2017 for international trade in goods and services. The data will probably show the trade deficit reaching the highest level in years. President Trump has maligned the trade deficit in goods as a sign of manufacturing job loss and pledged to reduce it. But data released on Tuesday is likely to show that the figure soared last year, as the strong American economy lifted demand for imports. In November, the trade deficit reached a nearly six-year high. Ana Swanson
ENTERTAINMENT
For first time since Fox deal, Disney to lay out plans.
When the Walt Disney Company reports its earnings on Tuesday afternoon for the quarter that ended in December, Wall Street expects to see per-share profit of roughly $1.61 and revenue of $15.5 billion, each up about 4 percent from the same quarter in 2016. More interesting, however, will be discussion on Disney's post-earnings conference call with analysts, when Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, will discuss the Magic Kingdom's state of affairs and plans for its future for the first time since striking a $52.4 billion deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox. Mr. Iger will probably not offer many details about the merger, which government regulators still must approve. But he may discuss the multiple streaming services that Disney is building -- and hopes to supersize with Fox assets. Mr. Iger could also mount a defense of the "Star Wars" franchise (the last film flopped in China and took in $612 million in North America, less than some people would have liked) while facing questions about the future leadership of ESPN, where the hunt for a new president is underway. Brooks Barnes
AUTOS
G.M. and Tesla report earnings.
General Motors reports fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday and is expected to post earnings of nearly $6.50 a share for 2017. But investors will listen more closely for what G.M. has to say about this year and 2019, as sales in the United States decline. G.M. has said it expects flat earnings in 2018 and then growth in 2019. This year, G.M. plans to introduce new generations of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, two of the most profitable vehicles it makes.
A day later, on Wednesday, Tesla will provide its results for the final quarter of 2017, and a substantial loss is likely. Analysts expect the electric-car maker to post a loss of about $3 a share, compared with an adjusted loss of 69 cents a share a year ago. Tesla has lost money four quarters in a row and in seven of the last eight. More troublesome may be an expected update on production of the Model 3 compact. As recently as last July, the company hoped to be able to make 20,000 a month by the end of 2017, but in January, it said it delivered just 1,550 in the fourth quarter. Neal E. Boudette
BANKING
Europe's biggest lenders to report results.
Several of the Europe's largest lenders are scheduled this week to report their results for the fourth quarter, including the French banks BNP Paribas and Société Générale and Italy's largest lender, UniCredit.
Several European lenders have already said they have taken large charges related to changes in United States tax laws, with the Swiss bank UBS, for example, falling to a loss in the quarter as a result of a write-down of 2.87 billion francs, or about $3.08 billion, on deferred tax assets. Chad Bray
GOVERNMENT
Congress faces another funding deadline.
The federal government is facing another shutdown this week, with funding set to expire on Thursday. Lawmakers will again be under pressure to reach a budget agreement to extend funding. With hopes for a broad budget agreement dim, Congress is expected to pass yet another short-term stopgap measure despite resistance from Republican deficit hawks and Democrats who want to cut a deal on immigration legislation. Alan Rappeport
BANKING
Interest rates expected to remain steady in England.
The Bank of England will release its latest monetary policy decision and unveil its updated forecast for inflation on Thursday, to be followed by a news conference by Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England. The Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep interest rates steady after raising its key rate for the first time in a decade to 0.5 percent in November.
The central bank has said that rates are expected to rise at a "gradual pace" and that it would probably increase interest rates only twice over its three-year forecast period. Chad Bray

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Jerome H. Powell, who will be sworn in Monday as the Federal Reserve's 16th chairman, is stepping into his new role as a half-decade of economic tranquillity is beginning to show some signs of strain. The Fed has gradually been increasing interest rates to maintain control of inflation, and markets are starting to notice. Stock prices fell Friday as investors contemplated higher rates with a tightening labor market.
Mr. Powell, charged with keeping the economy in the safe space between overheating and recession, arrives on that high wire as a relative unknown. He is a lawyer by training and an investor by trade in a role reserved almost exclusively for economists in recent decades.
He has said that he plans to continue the Fed's gradual retreat from the economic stimulus campaign it mounted after the 2008 financial crisis, and markets have taken him at his word.
It is harder to predict how he would respond to faster growth -- or to a financial crisis.
But Mr. Powell, who turned 65 Sunday, arrives in the job with a deeper knowledge of financial markets than his recent predecessors, and what friends describe as strong political instincts.
"I worry not at all," said Seth Carpenter, who worked with Mr. Powell at the Fed and is now the chief United States economist at UBS. He said that Mr. Powell, in his early days at the Fed, would pull staff members aside after meetings with long lists of questions. In time, the lists got shorter.
"It got increasingly deep and increasingly technical and increasingly sophisticated to the point where I think that this idea that he's not a real economist is just bunk," Mr. Carpenter said.
Louis Crandall, a longtime Fed watcher at Wrightson ICAP, said every Fed chief faced unexpected challenges. In 1987, the stock market crashed two months after the installation of Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman. Mr. Greenspan was one of the nation's most prominent economists, and his views were well known, but Mr. Crandall said no one had asked what he'd do about a market crash.
Mr. Powell also has well-established views on financial regulation, a crucial issue as the Trump administration seeks to loosen the strictures imposed on the industry after the 2008 crisis.
In the fall of 1991, Mr. Powell, then an assistant Treasury secretary, was summoned before Congress to explain how the government had failed to prevent an elaborate scheme by a bond trader at Salomon Brothers to corner the market in some Treasury securities.
Under sharp questioning, Mr. Powell resisted demands for a regulatory crackdown. He pressed for Salomon executives to lose their jobs, and he favored changes to prevent any recurrences. But he cautioned Congress against meddling with a market that mostly worked.
In October, shortly before Mr. Powell was nominated as chairman of the Federal Reserve, he told an audience of bond traders that he remained proud that the government had shown restraint.
"Regulation should always take into account the impact that it has on markets -- a balance that must be constantly weighed," he said. "More regulation is not the best answer to every problem."
In his remarks, Mr. Powell also highlighted the importance of financial market participants holding each other to a high standard. That approach was reflected in Friday's announcement that the Fed was slapping sanctions on Wells Fargo for failures of corporate governance. The action was taken during the final hours of Janet L. Yellen's tenure as Fed chairwoman, but with Mr. Powell's full support.
Mr. Powell has emphasized the importance of oversight by bank boards of directors, and the Wells action criticized the company's board for failing to do its job. The Fed also published harshly critical letters to the last two chairmen of the Wells board, holding them accountable for the problems.
Mr. Powell is a lifelong Washingtonian. He went away to college at Princeton but came back to law school at Georgetown. He went away to work on Wall Street but came back in the early 1990s to take a job under Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who had also been his boss at the white-shoe investment bank Dillon Read.
Mr. Powell has the calm and unassuming manner of a person confident in his abilities. Mr. Carpenter said the only time that he had seen Mr. Powell show irritation was when he persisted in addressing Mr. Powell as "Governor Powell" rather than "Jay."
John Dugan, a longtime friend who worked for Mr. Powell at Treasury, said Mr. Powell's success owed much to playing well with others. "He has a tremendous sense of humor, but not an unkind one," said Mr. Dugan, a former comptroller of the currency.
The Salomon scandal began with a routine phone call. At the time, Wall Street firms wrote bids on scraps of paper stuffed into a wooden box. The New York Fed policed the process by calling a small selection of buyers to verify bids. In the spring of 1991, a staff member reached a surprised supposed bidder. A quiet investigation found that Salomon was bidding in other peoples' names. No firm was allowed to buy more than 35 percent of a given debt issue; at one auction in May 1991, Salomon bought 94 percent, allowing the firm to resell at a premium.
Mr. Powell oversaw the government's borrowing program, so he led the repairs, including the negotiations over a long weekend in August that resulted in the departure of Salomon's top management and the installation of Warren E. Buffett as chairman. The bond trader went to prison.
Mr. Powell "was impressive to me because he thought clearly and he didn't jump to conclusions," said Deborah A. Perelmuter, then the head of the domestic trading desk at the New York Fed, who watched Mr. Powell hammer together a consensus on the necessary changes -- including the replacement of paper slips with electronic bidding. "He seemed to have his head on straight."
His views about regulation remain substantially unchanged. He supports the stronger rules imposed on financial companies after the 2008 crisis, but he has said he sees room for streamlining and he favors measures that encourage the industry to take responsibility for its conduct, where possible.
After leaving Treasury, Mr. Powell remained in Washington and made a fortune as a private-equity investor at the Carlyle Group. By 2010, he was looking for a new challenge, and he joined the Bipartisan Policy Center for an eight-week project simulating a state's insolvency. He was not paid.
Searching for an encore, Mr. Powell recognized, earlier than most, that the Tea Party Republicans who arrived in Congress in January 2011 were genuinely opposed to raising the nation's borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling. Since he had been in charge of government borrowing, he also understood, better than most, that default would cause a crisis.
Working by hand, he modeled the government's cash flows, calculating when Treasury would run out of money. He called it the "X date," coining a term that remains in common use. He published his analysis online and, for several weeks, no one paid any attention. Then, quite suddenly, he found himself in the spotlight. Treasury had published its own calculations but the media -- and congressional Republicans -- wanted an independent source of information. All the better that Mr. Powell was himself a Republican.
"Jay was somebody who they could trust, who could help get facts into the discussion." said Shai Akabas, the director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, who worked for Mr. Powell as an analyst at the time. "He likes to earn your respect by working hard. It's not about saying, 'I'm here to help.' It's showing them that you're really there constructively."
Mr. Powell started briefing individual members of Congress about the need to raise the debt ceiling and in mid-June briefed the entire House Republican caucus, explaining that failing to act would cause a lot of pain for a lot of people.
When Republican leaders met with Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, to negotiate a deal, they mentioned that Mr. Powell's presentation was a crucial reason they would be able to rally the necessary votes to raise the ceiling.
Mr. Geithner asked Mr. Powell if he would be interested in returning to public service. In December 2011, President Barack Obama nominated Mr. Powell for a seat on the Fed's board of governors.
Mr. Powell, who lives in Chevy Chase, Md., with his wife, Elissa Leonard, a filmmaker, is now preparing for a new challenge. One looming test: He has often commuted to the Fed on his bike, an eight-mile ride. He is trying to persuade his new security detail to let him stay in the saddle.

U.S. Chases Russia Into New Arms Race as a Treaty Takes Effect

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A treaty committing the United States and Russia to keep their long-range nuclear arsenals at the lowest levels since early in the Cold War goes into full effect on Monday. When it was signed eight years ago, President Barack Obama expressed hope that it would be a small first step toward deeper reductions, and ultimately a world without nuclear weapons. Now, that optimism has been reversed. A new nuclear policy issued by the Trump administration on Friday, which vows to counter a rush by the Russians to modernize their forces even while staying within the treaty limits, is touching off a new kind of nuclear arms race. This one is based less on numbers of weapons and more on novel tactics and technologies, meant to outwit and outmaneuver the other side.
The Pentagon envisions a new age in which nuclear weapons are back in a big way -- its strategy bristles with plans for new low-yield nuclear weapons that advocates say are needed to match Russian advances and critics warn will be too tempting for a president to use. The result is that the nuclear-arms limits that go into effect on Monday now look more like the final stop after three decades of reductions than a way station to further cuts.
Yet when President Trump called on Congress to "modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal" in his State of the Union address last week, he did not mention his administration's rationale: that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has accelerated a dangerous game that the United States must match, even if the price tag soars above $1.2 trillion. That is the latest estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, one that many experts think is low by a half-trillion dollars.
Mr. Trump barely mentioned Mr. Putin in the speech and said nothing about Russia's nuclear buildup. His reluctance to talk about Russia and its leader during his campaign and first year in office -- and his refusal to impose sanctions on Russia mandated by Congress -- has fueled suspicions about what lies behind his persistently friendly stance toward Mr. Putin.
In the State of the Union speech, the president focused far more on North Korea and on battling terrorism, even though his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, had announced just days ago that "great power competition -- not terrorism -- is now the primary focus of U.S. national security."
In contrast to the president's address, the report issued on Friday, known as the Nuclear Posture Review, focuses intensely on Russia. It describes Mr. Putin as forcing America's hand to rebuild the nuclear force, as has a series of other documents produced by Mr. Trump's National Security Council and his Pentagon.
The report contains a sharp warning about a new Russian-made autonomous nuclear torpedo that -- while not in violation of the terms of the treaty, known as New Start -- appears designed to cross the Pacific undetected and release a deadly cloud of radioactivity that would leave large parts of the West Coast uninhabitable.
It also explicitly rejects Mr. Obama's commitment to make nuclear weapons a diminishing part of American defenses. The limit on warheads -- 1,500 deployable weapons -- that goes into effect on Monday expires in 2021, and the nuclear review shows no enthusiasm about its chances for renewal.
The report describes future arms control agreements as "difficult to envision" in a world "that is characterized by nuclear-armed states seeking to change borders and overturn existing norms," and in particular by Russian violations of a series of other arms-limitation treaties.
"Past assumptions that our capability to produce nuclear weapons would not be necessary and that we could permit the required infrastructure to age into obsolescence have proven to be mistaken," it argues. "It is now clear that the United States must have sufficient research, design, development and production capacity to support the sustainment and replacement of its nuclear forces."
The new policy was applauded by establishment Republican defense experts, including some who have shuddered at Mr. Trump's threats to use nuclear weapons against North Korea, but have worried that he was insufficiently focused on Russia's nuclear modernization.
"Obama's theory was that we will lead the way in reducing our reliance on nuclear weapons and everyone else will do the same," said Franklin C. Miller, a nuclear expert who served in the George W. Bush administration and was an informal consultant to Pentagon officials who drafted the new policy. "It didn't work out that way. The Russians have been fielding systems while we haven't, and our first new system won't be ready until 2026 or 2027."
"This is a very mainstream nuclear policy," Mr. Miller said of the document, arguing that new low-yield atomic weapons would deter Mr. Putin and make nuclear war less likely, rather than offer new temptations to Mr. Trump. "Nothing in it deserves the criticism it has received."
A senior administration official, who would discuss the policy only on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Trump had been briefed on the new nuclear approach, but was leaving the details to Mr. Mattis and to his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. The president, the official said, was primarily concerned about staying ahead in any nuclear race with Russia, and to a lesser degree with China.
Even Mr. Trump's harshest critics concede that the United States must take steps as Russia and China have invested heavily in modernizing their forces, making them more lethal. The administration's new strategy describes the Russian buildup in detail, documenting how Moscow is making "multiple upgrades" to its force of strategic bombers, as well as long-range missiles based at sea and on land. Russia is also developing, it adds, "at least two new intercontinental-range systems," as well as the autonomous torpedo.
Russia has violated another treaty, the United States argues, that covers intermediate-range missiles, and is "building a large, diverse and modern" set of shorter-range weapons with less powerful warheads that "are not accountable under the New Start treaty." Yet Mr. Trump has not publicly complained about the alleged treaty violation or the new weapons.
Though members of the Obama administration were highly critical of the Trump administration document, there is little question that Mr. Obama paved the way for the modernization policy. He agreed to a $70 billion makeover of American nuclear laboratories as the price for Senate approval of the 2010 New Start.
The new document calls for far more spending -- a program that at a minimum will cost $1.2 trillion over 30 years, without inflation taken into account. Most of that money would go to new generations of bombers and new submarines, and a rebuilding of the land-based nuclear missile force that still dots giant fields across the West.
While those systems are the most vulnerable to attack, and the most decrepit part of the force, they are also among the most politically popular in Congress, because they provide jobs in rural areas.
In some cases, Mr. Trump's plan speeds ahead with nuclear arms that Mr. Obama had endorsed, such as a new generation of nuclear cruise missiles. The low-flying weapons, when dropped from a bomber, hug the ground to avoid enemy radars and air defenses.
Other weapons, though, are completely new. For example, the policy calls for "the rapid development" of a cruise missile that would be fired from submarines, then become airborne before reaching its target. Mr. Obama had eliminated an older version.
It also calls for the development of a low-yield warhead for some of the nation's submarine ballistic missiles -- part of a broader effort to expand the credible options "for responding to nuclear or non-nuclear strategic attack." But critics of the low-yield weapons say they blur the line between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons, making their use more likely.
Andrew C. Weber, an assistant defense secretary during the Obama administration who directed oversight of the nation's nuclear arsenal, called the new plan a dangerous folly that would make nuclear war more likely.
"We're simply mirroring the reckless Russian doctrine," he said. "We can already deter any strike. We have plenty of low-yield weapons. The new plan is a fiction created to justify the making of new nuclear arms. They'll just increase the potential for their use and for miscalculation. The administration's logic is Kafkaesque."
One of the most controversial elements of the new strategy is a section that declares that the United States might use nuclear weapons to respond to a devastating, but non-nuclear, attack on critical infrastructure -- the power grid or cellphone networks, for example.
All of the new or repurposed warheads would come from the National Nuclear Security Administration, an arm of the Energy Department that officials say is already stretched thin.
"We're pretty much at capacity in terms of people," Frank G. Klotz was quoted as saying after retiring last month as the agency's head. "We're pretty much at capacity in terms of the materials that we need to do this work. And pretty much at capacity in terms of hours in the day at our facilities."

Full text: As the unemployment rate has fallen in recent months and the economy has roared, one central question has bedeviled the American job market: Where is the wage growth? New data on Friday suggested an answer: It is here, and it is now.
Average hourly earnings jumped 2.9 percent in January from a year earlier, the Labor Department said on Friday, the latest sign that the long, slow economic recovery is at last reaching Americans' pocketbooks. Separate data released this week showed that private-sector wages and salaries rose 2.8 percent in the final three months of 2017 compared with a year earlier, the fastest growth since the recession.
"People have been wondering when the wages are going to start to rise," said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job marketplace ZipRecruiter. "I think that over the first six months of this year, we're really going to start to see the wages rise."
If such predictions are borne out, there could be political ramifications. President Trump hailed his economic record in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, and Republicans are counting on the strong economy to help them in the midterm elections in November. Most economists contend that Mr. Trump deserves relatively little credit for the strong economy, which predates his election and is partly a result of a global rebound outside his control. But voters may not focus on such nuances.
Economists cautioned against reading too much into a single month of data, which is preliminary and will be revised at least twice. Several times in recent years, wage growth has appeared to pick up, only to fall back to earth in subsequent months. And other measures of wage growth haven't yet shown the same acceleration.
But there is reason to think that pay gains will prove more durable this time around. Job growth has been steady -- employers added 200,000 jobs in January, modestly more than in December -- and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. That is forcing companies to compete harder for workers, a recipe for pay increases.
"It's as tough as it's ever been," Michael Mabry, president and chief operating officer of Mooyah Burgers, Fries and Shakes, a 100-restaurant chain based in Texas, said of the current hiring environment.
Mr. Mabry said that in some parts of the country, workers would walk off the job knowing that they could find another restaurant hiring down the street. Still, he said, Mooyah can't just raise pay across the board -- the burger industry is "a pennies business," Mr. Mabry said, and wage increases quickly eat into profits.
Instead, Mr. Mabry said, he is looking for ways to make restaurants more efficient by reducing turnover, improving morale and cross-training workers for various jobs. The goal, he said, is to be able to pay higher wages to fewer workers.
Mooyah is also trying to recruit untapped sources of talent. The company recently started a program to help franchisees expand their marketing efforts by hiring at-home parents and others who had not been in the labor force. The jobs are meant to appeal to people who might not be looking for traditional work: They do not require being at an office every day or having a traditional schedule. Mr. Mabry said that kind of flexibility made sense when filling full-time slots with experienced workers was harder than ever.
"Why do I have to be pigeonholed into a particular résumé or a particular experience?" Mr. Mabry said of his recruitment approach. "I'm sure there is someone out there who can bring something different to the team. It's just having an open mind."
More companies are likely to adopt that kind of flexible approach as the labor market tightens. And there are other signs that companies are rethinking their approach to hiring. They are becoming more willing to consider candidates with criminal records, for example, or to waive educational requirements. The car retailer AutoNation said this week that it was no longer refusing to hire workers who tested positive for marijuana use -- a sign of changing legal and societal norms, but also an indication that companies are rethinking hiring practices in a tight labor market.
"People who are marginally employable suddenly become highly employable in a period like this," said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM, a financial consulting firm.
There were some notes of caution in Friday's report. The total number of hours worked -- a measure that combines the number of jobs and the average hours worked on those jobs -- fell slightly, a sign that demand for labor might not be as strong as the headline job-growth figures suggest. And the unemployment rate for African-Americans, a figure highlighted by Mr. Trump after it fell to its lowest recorded level in December, jumped nearly a full percentage point, to 7.7 percent. The unemployment rate for white Americans fell to 3.5 percent.
But despite such month-to-month fluctuations, economists say the tightening labor market is paying dividends to groups that were left behind by earlier stages of the recovery. Wages have risen most quickly in lower-paying industries in recent months, and employment gains have gone disproportionately to less-educated workers.
Companies including Walmart, Starbucks and Lowe's have also announced new benefits for hourly workers, such as paid time off to care for sick relatives and paid parental leave. And the number of Americans working part time because they can't find full-time work has fallen 15 percent in the past year.
Taken together, the data paint a picture of an economy that is not just creating jobs but that is increasingly creating good ones.
"Employers don't simply raise wages when the labor market gets tighter; they may also raise the quality of the job to get people to come on board," Ms. Barrera said.
Mr. Trump and other Republicans argue that the economy will also benefit in coming months from the new tax law. They point to recent announcements from Walmart and other companies, which have cited tax savings in their decisions to raise wages and pay bonuses. (One-time bonuses aren't included in the hourly wage data released Friday, but will show up in broader measures of income.)
Many economists are skeptical of such claims, regarding them as timely public relations moves. And they question the wisdom of providing fiscal stimulus when unemployment is low and the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to curb inflation. But they said there were signs that corporate executives had become more confident in the economy since Mr. Trump took office, which could make them more willing to hire workers and raise pay.
"I hear my clients saying the tax bill gave them more confidence in the pro-business economy," said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a staffing firm. "There's confidence coming from D.C. that they're not going to get in the way."

Stocks Plunge As Boom Starts To Look Shaky

Full text: Investors have spent much of the last year shrugging off geopolitical and economic risks, from the threat of nuclear conflict with North Korea to a potential trade war with China. Instead, they have focused on the strength of the United States economy, driven by banner corporate profits and President Trump's push to lower taxes and reduce regulation. The optimism helped lift stock markets ever higher, extending the boom into its ninth year.
Now, investors are suddenly skittish.
On Friday, stocks tumbled by more than 2 percent, propelling the market to its worst week in two years.
The immediate catalyst was the jobs report, which showed the strong United States economy might finally be translating into rising wages for American workers -- a sign that higher inflation could be around the corner. But what is really worrying investors is that the fuel behind this stock market boom, namely cheap money from global central banks, may disappear sooner than they thought.
In recent weeks, the shift in sentiment has played out across the world's largest financial markets. As stocks have sold off, Treasury yields have surged. The dollar has slumped.
"It's a legitimate concern, when inflation spikes up a little bit, that people should evaluate how is this going to affect profits and how is this going to affect the Fed," said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse. "The market is becoming more vigilant around these concerns, and that's good and that's healthy."
In a strange way, investors are nervous that the global economy is doing too well.
Since stocks began climbing during the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, their rise has been supported by some of the lowest global interest rates seen since World War II. To jump-start growth, central bankers around the world slashed interest rates and took other steps to push down yields on safe government bonds.
Their goal was to incentivize investors to put their cash to work in the economy -- for example, by buying corporate stocks and bonds -- rather than stashing it in the relative safety of government bonds. The theory is that the fresh flood of capital would make it easier for companies to raise money, invest in their businesses and hire workers. Central banks wanted to heal their economies.
They have healed.
For the first time since the financial crisis of 2008, the world's largest economies are growing in unison. The United States and China led the way, but the expansion now includes Europe, long mired in a debt crisis, and perennially laggard Japan.
Given the strength of the global economy, central banks, led by the United States Federal Reserve, have started to remove some of the supports that helped supercharge stock and bond prices over the last decade. The Fed started raising rates two years ago. And with the robust jobs report on Friday showing the fastest wage growth in years, some think the pace of rate increases could quicken.
Average hourly earnings for United States workers were 2.9 percent higher in January than the previous year, the fastest annual increase in years. Although a welcome development for workers, economists often view rising wages as an early indication of inflationary pressure. If faster price increases do begin to emerge, the Fed could try to head them off with more aggressive rate action.
Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve's departing chairwoman who had her last working day on Friday, was viewed by some as being more concerned about measures of weakness in the job market than by the risk of rising inflation, and therefore more willing to keep rates low. Her successor, Jerome H. Powell, will face different challenges as the Fed charts a new course in raising interest rates.
Interest rates that are set every day in the global bond markets are already leaping higher, in anticipation of central bank rate increases later this year. On Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note -- a widely used gauge for overall interest rates -- rose to more than 2.8 percent, the highest level since early 2014.
Rising rates have myriad consequences, including making it more expensive for companies and individuals to borrow money, like for buying a home or a car. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.2 percent, up from less than 4 percent at the end of 2017.
Uncertainty about how the economy will react to rising borrowing costs has raised the blood pressure of investors. In one sign of a shift underway, a measure of expected market turbulence, the CBOE Volatility Index, jumped by more than 25 percent on Friday. The so-called VIX has spent months at historically low levels, reflecting a placid market mood that seems to have evaporated over the last week.
The stock markets this week have reflected the jitters.
The energy sector was especially hard hit, with energy giants ExxonMobil dropping 5.1 percent and Chevron falling 5.6 percent on Friday after reporting lackluster earnings. The energy sector of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.4 percent during the week, the biggest drop of all industrial sectors in the benchmark.
Health care stocks did not fare much better. Express Scripts, Cigna and UnitedHealth Group, among others, were battered Tuesday after Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway announced they were teaming up to create a health care company for their employees.
Tech stocks, which have been a crucial driver of the broader market rise, also slipped. Apple reported record-breaking profit late Thursday, but the company disappointed investors with a weaker-than-expected sales forecast. Its shares sank roughly 4.3 percent on Friday, worse than the broader market.
That is not to say the market is collapsing. The S.&P. 500 fell 3.9 percent this week. Still, it remains close to historic highs and 21 percent above where it stood a year ago, after another year of solid economic growth.
The United States economy expanded by a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2017. That is below the pace of some past expansions -- the economy grew at around 4 percent annually in the late 1990s. But it is enough to keep creating significant numbers of jobs, including 200,000 in January.
The economic expansion should be a comfort to investors. Higher revenue allows companies to offset rising costs, such as workers' pay, if inflation picks up. The tax cuts are also expected to help bolster growth.
"If we start to see growth slowing and inflation acceleration, that's when I get concerned," said Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. "As long as growth continues to improve, a little bit more inflation that we're seeing now is fine."

What Credit Is Trump Due For Economy?

Full text: Most presidents will at some point benefit from a surging economy and stock market, but none has claimed more credit for them than Donald J. Trump, as he did again during this week's State of the Union address. Among the highlights: "$8 trillion and more" in stock market gains.
"2.4 million new jobs" created since his election.
"Over 3 million workers have gotten tax-cut bonuses" and "rising wages."
All thanks to "the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history."
Since the president has frequently complained that the media denies him credit for any of this, I thought it only fair to assess the degree to which the undeniably strong economy, low unemployment and surging stock market are because of Mr. Trump's achievements, notably his sweeping tax bill.
It turns out that's no easy task, especially since Mr. Trump has only been president for a year, and the tax legislation is little more than a month old. Economists are still debating the impact on the economy of Ronald Reagan's 1986 tax reform legislation more than 30 years after its passage.
"It's not like chemistry or physics where you can do a controlled experiment and change one variable," said Joel Slemrod, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, and co-author of a seminal study of the economic impact of the 1986 tax reform act. "We can never be entirely sure because we don't know what would have happened without the tax act."
Even so, "there are specific things that are hard to imagine being attributed to anything else" other than the tax legislation, said Alan Auerbach, professor of economics and law at the University of California, Berkeley, and Professor Slemrod's co-author on the study of the 1986 reform.
With that in mind, here's a look at the major areas where Mr. Trump claims credit.
The Stock Market
The S.&P. 500 index rose 23 percent during Mr. Trump's first year in office, an increase surpassed only by Franklin Roosevelt and Barack Obama, both Democrats who took office in the wake of financial crises and stock market crashes. Mr. Trump's policies and Republicans in Congress deserve some credit, given that economists expect the cut in corporate taxes to raise company earnings, and stock prices are fundamentally a reflection of earnings expectations.
"There's no question after-tax earnings will be higher" thanks to the tax legislation, Professor Slemrod said.
But the estimated impact on after-tax earnings -- a range of 7 to 10 percent, according to most economists -- accounts for less than half the stock market's rise over the past year. The rest is because of other factors, which may include Mr. Trump's pro-business outlook, but also many things beyond his control.
Stock market valuations are reaching lofty levels by many measures, and those gains may prove ephemeral if growth doesn't live up to investors' rosy expectations. "The value of the stock market isn't an indicator of the economic health of America," Professor Slemrod noted.
The Economy
Gross domestic product grew by 2.3 percent last year, lower than Mr. Trump's predictions of 3-plus percent, but significantly better than the 1.6 percent growth in 2016, Mr. Obama's last year in office.
As should be obvious, passage of the Republican tax legislation was too recent to have had any impact on those numbers. To the extent that expectations of tax reform fueled investment decisions, they may have had some effect, but that's nearly impossible to measure.
The first real clues will come next year, when 2018 gross domestic product numbers are released. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new tax legislation would raise G.D.P. by seven-tenths of a percent over what it would have been under the old law.
"The economy has been strong, and forecasts for next year have been bumped up due to the tax cut, " said Professor Auerbach. "But there's a lot going on. You won't be able to tell what the impact is from just a few quarters."
Even 10 years after the 1986 law, "it was very difficult to tease out the impact of tax reform on the economy," he said. "The best estimate is it didn't have much effect."
Professor Slemrod agreed. "Tax policy might not be as critical to the rate of business investment as had been thought," he said.
Still, if United States economic growth hits Chinese levels of 7 percent a year or more, which Mr. Trump repeatedly has said is attainable, then Republicans will have a "much stronger" basis for claiming credit for it, Professor Slemrod said. But he deemed such an outcome "extraordinarily unlikely."
Wage Growth and Bonuses
Many companies have been doling out bonuses to employees since the tax legislation passed, but "I don't think that tells us anything," Professor Slemrod said. That's because in standard economic theory, labor market conditions dictate employee compensation levels, not cash flow or profitability.
"The labor market was strengthening long before Mr. Trump was elected or the tax bill was passed," Professor Slemrod said. "If companies were going to raise wages anyway to stay competitive, they have a public relations incentive to attribute it to tax cuts."
Wage growth actually slowed during the first year of Mr. Trump's presidency compared with the last year of Mr. Obama's.
Mr. Auerbach added that given the length of the recovery and low levels of unemployment, many economists "have been wondering why we haven't seen stronger wage growth" as competition for labor heats up. "Now we may be starting to see it."
Much the same can be said about unemployment, which fell to 4.1 percent from 4.7 percent during Mr. Trump's first year as president, and which also reflects the tight labor market conditions that have been developing for years. The unemployment rate fell much more during the Obama years (three full percentage points, from when Mr. Obama took office until when he left), which would be expected given the severe recession he inherited.
In any event, it's far too soon to evaluate Mr. Trump's impact on the labor market. Economists generally agree that at least some of the Republican tax cuts will flow through to workers, although there are widely differing projections about how much, and most say the largest share will go to shareholders in the form of dividends, stock buybacks and higher share prices. Professor Slemrod said we may never know for sure, but "in five or six years we may be able to tell if some of the more extreme claims are reasonable."
Interest Rates and Inflation
It's interesting what President Trump didn't claim any credit for: low interest rates and inflation. Perhaps that's because they're moving upward, although slowly, and pose the biggest threat to the economic indicators he extolled. (On Wednesday the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark rate unchanged after raising it three times during the last year.)
Unlike the 1986 tax legislation, which claimed to be revenue-neutral, the latest Republican bill is a huge tax cut. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new law would add just over $1 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. It predicted higher interest rates as a result, which it estimated would cost the Treasury an additional $66 billion in debt service costs.
Some supporters of the tax law contend that economic growth will come so quickly that increased tax revenue will more than make up for the cuts. The actual impact on the deficit won't be evident for at least a year, but the rising deficits that followed tax cuts in 1981 forced Republicans to raise taxes in both 1982 and 1984.
Interest rates are already trending higher. Both Professors Auerbach and Slemrod agreed that rates are likely to rise further and would be an important measure of the impact of the tax legislation and Mr. Trump's economic policies. If they rise faster than at the cautious pace the Federal Reserve has projected and investors expect, that could bring the stock market rally to an abrupt end. Higher-than-expected rates could also slow the economy, or even tip it into recession.
How sensitive the stock market is to interest rates was on display the same day as Mr. Trump's speech, when shares plunged on fears of higher rates after the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2.7 percent; that's still very low by historic standards, but higher than when Mr. Trump took office.
The big tax cut is a large economic stimulus, and "right now stimulus is a danger," said Professor Auerbach, given that there is nearly full employment and already-strong economic growth.
We'll know a year from now whether the Federal Reserve stuck with its projected three increases in rates this year, and whether any exceeded quarter-point increments.
The bottom line: Presidents tend to get credit (or blame) for whatever economies they preside over, but it's far too soon to evaluate Mr. Trump's long-term impact. Even after years have passed, Professor Slemrod said, "We'll never know with 100 percent certainty."

Full text: Over all, average hourly earnings were only 2.5 percent higher in December than a year earlier, barely outpacing inflation. It's part of a stubborn pattern that is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year. These are a few factors that may be playing a part: Declining Unionization Over all, average hourly earnings were only 2.5 percent higher in December than a year earlier, barely outpacing inflation. It's part of a stubborn pattern that is one of the mysteries of a recovery now in its ninth year. These are a few factors that may be playing a part: A collapse in union membership among private-sector employees -- to 6.5 percent last year from the upper teens in the early 1980s -- appears to have played a key role in holding down wages. Average pay for workers represented by unions tends to be higher than for those who aren't, even after controlling for education and other characteristics. And in industries and regions with a larger union presence, pay tends to be higher for all low- and medium-wage workers, not just those represented by unions. "If you work for a nonunion firm and your employer is worried about the possibility of a unionization drive, one way to dampen down that possibility is to pay workers at the union rate," said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis. The effects are especially pronounced for men. A study by Mr. Rosenfeld and two colleagues estimated that average wages for men in the private sector who are not union members (excluding senior managers) would have been 5 percent higher -- about $2,700 per year -- by 2013 if unions had the same reach as in the late 1970s. NOAM SCHEIBER
A Lagging Minimum Wage The federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, has not increased since 2009, and its purchasing power has never returned on a sustained basis to what it delivered in the 1960s and '70s. In response, some state and local governments have passed laws raising minimum wages to as high as $15 an hour, arguing it is the best way to ensure that low-wage workers who otherwise have little leverage are able to earn a living wage and share in the country's economic growth. That movement has produced a backlash in Republican-controlled statehouses, where lawmakers have tried to pre-empt localities from enacting their own minimum wages. Opponents maintain that raising the wage floor is a job killer and reduces the number of hours worked. Most of the recent research, however, shows that a moderate increase in the minimum wage has little or no effect on overall employment. Whatever negative effects there might be, economists say, are offset by workers' greater purchasing power and revved-up economic activity. PATRICIA COHEN
Sluggish Productivity U.S. PRODUCTIVITY One possible explanation for slow wage growth: Productivity growth has been just as anemic. Productivity -- in its simplest form, how much value the average employee creates in an hour of work -- rose about 2 percent per year from the 1970s through the first decade of this century. It has risen less than 1 percent per year since then. Standard economic theory holds that over the long run, pay and productivity ought to rise together: As workers produce more per hour, companies can afford to pay them more. That doesn't always happen in practice -- pay has lagged behind productivity, at least by some measures, since the 1970s. Still, if productivity picks up, it's wages are likely to follow suit. The trouble is, weak productivity growth is just as much of a mystery as weak wage growth. There are pessimistic explanations (recent technological advances are less economically significant than those of earlier eras) and optimistic ones (recent advances are significant, but we haven't felt their full effects yet). But no one is really sure. BEN CASSELMAN
Or Maybe It's Normal With the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, the lowest since 2000, economists have been surprised by the slow growth in paychecks. Historically, when that few people are unemployed, companies have had to pay more to attract workers -- supply and demand. But maybe competition for workers isn't quite as intense as the rate suggests. The government's definition of unemployment excludes anyone not actively looking for work. Adam Ozimek, an economist at Moody's Analytics, has found that under a broader definition -- anyone in the prime working years who isn't employed -- recent wage growth is in line with historical norms. Mr. Ozimek's analysis suggests a sizable pool of people who are neither working nor counted as unemployed but who might be willing and able to work under the right circumstances. Some may be struggling with addiction or other illnesses, or may have been out of work so long that they've stopped looking. Others may just not be willing to work for the wages offered. As the economy improves, more may come off the sidelines. But as some economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco recently argued, that could make overall wage growth look worse, because people entering the labor force usually earn relatively low salaries. Demographics could also be a factor as retiring baby boomers (who, on average, earn relatively high wages) are gradually replaced by millennials (who generally earn less) BEN CASSELMAN

The Gang That Couldn't Think Straight

Full text: A few days after President Trump was inaugurated, Benjamin Wittes, editor of the influential Lawfare blog, came up with a pithy summary of the new administration: "malevolence tempered by incompetence." A year later, that rings truer than ever. In fact, this has been a big week for malevolence. But today's column will focus on the incompetence, whose full depths -- and consequences -- we're just starting to see.
Let's start with a few recent stories.
In his State of the Union, Trump devoted part of one sentence to the disaster in Puerto Rico, struck by Hurricane Maria. "We are with you, we love you," he declared. But the island's residents, almost a third of whom are still without power four months after the storm, aren't exactly feeling that love -- especially because on the very day Trump said those words, FEMA officials told NPR that the disaster agency was ending its work on the island.
FEMA later said that this was a miscommunication. But at the very least it suggests a complete lack of focus.
Oh, and for the record, I don't believe that Trump, who spent much of his speech falsely blaming brown people for a nonexistent crime wave, loves Puerto Ricans.
Trump also declared, as he has in the past, that he is "committed" to taking action on the opioid epidemic. But he's been in office a year and has basically done nothing.
What he did do, however, was appoint a 24-year-old former campaign worker, with no relevant experience before joining the administration -- who appears to have lied on his résumé -- to a senior position in the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which should be coordinating the effort (if one existed).
Meanwhile, the Trump-appointed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resigned after Politico reported that she had purchased tobacco-industry stocks after taking office. This was unethical; it was also deeply stupid. And the C.D.C. isn't some marginal agency: It's as crucial to safeguarding American lives as, say, the Department of Homeland Security.
The thing is, these aren't isolated examples. A remarkable number of Trump appointees have been forced out over falsified credentials, unethical practices or racist remarks. And you can be sure there are many other appointees who did the same things, but haven't yet been caught.
Why is this administration hiring such people? It surely reflects both supply and demand: Competent people don't want to work for Trump, and he and his inner circle don't want them anyway.
By now it's obvious to everyone that the Trump administration is a graveyard for reputations: Everyone who goes in comes out soiled and diminished. Only fools, or those with no reputation to lose, even want the positions on offer. And in any case, Trump, who values personal loyalty above professionalism, probably distrusts anyone whose credentials might give some sense of independence.
But what's the problem? After all, stocks are up and the economy is steadily growing. Does competence even matter?
The answer is that America is a very big country with a lot of strengths, and it can run on momentum for a long time even if none of the people in charge know what they're doing. Sooner or later, however, stuff happens -- and then incompetence becomes a very big deal, as it already has in Puerto Rico.
What kind of stuff may happen? The scariest scenarios involve national security. But we can't count on smooth sailing for the economy, either. And who will manage economic turbulence if and when it hits? After all, we currently have perhaps the least impressive Treasury secretary in U.S. history.
Matters are a bit better at the Federal Reserve, where nobody seems to have bad things to say about Jerome Powell, just confirmed as Fed chairman. On the other hand, why didn't Trump just follow the usual norms and appoint Janet Yellen, who has done a fantastic job, to a second term?
One answer may be that Trump is a traditionalist -- and few things are more traditional than passing over a highly qualified woman in favor of a less qualified man. But I also suspect that he found Yellen's independent stature threatening.
And lower-level Fed appointments are becoming cause for concern.
Last week, senators at a confirmation hearing questioned the economist Marvin Goodfriend, whom Trump has nominated for the Fed's Board of Governors. Democrats pointed out that Goodfriend was wrong, again and again, about monetary policy during the crisis, repeatedly predicting inflation that didn't happen.
Now, everyone makes bad predictions now and then; God knows I have. But you're supposed to face up to your mistakes, figure out what went wrong and adapt your views. Goodfriend refused to do any of that. And why should he? His errors were politically correct; they reinforced Republican orthodoxy. From the G.O.P.'s point of view, having been completely wrong about monetary policy isn't a defect, it's practically a badge of honor.
The point is that even at the Fed, which is partly insulated from the Trumpian reign of error, U.S. policymaking is being denuded of expertise. And the whole nation will eventually pay the price.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it was still trying to stimulate faster economic growth as one of the longest expansions in American history neared the end of its ninth year. The Fed said after a two-day meeting of its policymaking committee that it was leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent, a relatively low level that the Fed said would help support continued job growth and stronger inflation.
The Fed's economic outlook remained relatively upbeat, setting the stage for a rate hike at its next meeting in March. But the decision to hold steady in January, while widely expected, underscored that the Fed still regards the economic expansion as fragile and in need of assistance.
The announcement brought down the curtain on Janet L. Yellen's four-year tenure as the Fed's chairwoman. She will step down on Saturday at the end of her term. The Fed said that her successor, Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor since 2012, would take the oath of office on Monday morning.
The economy grew 2.3 percent in 2017, extending a prolonged period of unusually stable growth. And economic forecasters, including most Fed officials, expect somewhat faster growth this year, partly as a result of the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that went into effect in January.
The Fed said the economy is growing at a "solid rate" and the labor market continues to improve.
The assessment "is about as strong a characterization of the domestic economy as the committee has had during the current recovery," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. He said it was a "strong signal" that the Fed is planning to raise its benchmark rate in March.
A measure derived from asset prices, which tend to rise with the Fed's benchmark rate, implied about a 78 percent chance of a March rate increase on Wednesday, according to CME Group, up from about 71 percent before the Fed released its statement.
The unemployment rate stood at 4.1 percent in December, and Fed officials do not expect it to fall much further. Instead, as growth continues, they expect inflation to begin rising more quickly.
But Fed officials are still committed to moving slowly. Growth, while steady, remains weak by historical standards, and although unemployment is quite low, wage growth remains sluggish, too.
"The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation," the Fed said in the postmeeting statement.
The announcement made little impression on financial markets because it left the Fed's plans unchanged. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.05 percent on the day to close at 2,823.21. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which has climbed over the last few months on market expectations of stronger growth and inflation, closed at 2.7 percent, down 0.02 points on the day.
Much of the economic strengthening happened under Ms. Yellen's leadership, a period during which the Fed extended the economic stimulus campaign it began after the 2008 financial crisis. While critics warned that the Fed had exhausted its ability to improve economic conditions, and would instead unleash inflation, Ms. Yellen convinced her fellow Fed officials that the economy had room to grow, and events proved her right.
On Wednesday, some Fed employees wore shirts or jackets with the collars turned up, or popped, in a tribute to Ms. Yellen, who favored that look in public appearances.
Mr. Powell, a Republican with a background in investment banking, consistently voted in favor of Ms. Yellen's policies as a member of the Fed's board, and said during the confirmation process that he intends to continue the gradual unwinding of the stimulus campaign.
The next meeting of the policymaking committee is scheduled for March 20 and 21. If the Fed raises rates, it would be the sixth consecutive quarterly tightening of monetary policy.
"For a while now, the Fed has been very predictable in the face of a pretty benign environment," said Luke Bartholomew, an investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
The risk, he said, is that the $1.5 trillion tax cut that began to take effect this month will produce faster growth and inflation, forcing the Fed to consider increasing rates more quickly.
Most Fed officials predicted in December that the Fed would raise rates at least three times in 2018. Some analysts predict a fourth increase, citing a strengthening economic outlook.
There are countervailing pressures. Inflation remains low despite the Fed's repeated predictions that faster inflation is around the corner. The Fed's statement suggested that officials are gaining confidence in that prediction, saying they expect inflation to gain strength this year.
"Everything from stronger growth at home and abroad to debt-financed tax cuts have raised expectations for inflation," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
The value of financial assets, on the other hand, continues to soar as investors have shaken off the rate increases, keeping borrowing costs low and creating pressure for the Fed to move more quickly.
Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, stirred financial markets on Wednesday by telling Bloomberg Television that investors had become irrationally exuberant.
"There are two bubbles: We have a stock market bubble and we have a bond market bubble," Mr. Greenspan said. But he did not predict an imminent correction. "At the end of the day, the bond market bubble will eventually be the critical issue, but for the short term, it's not too bad," he said.
So far, Fed officials have played down the importance of both factors, insisting that they are focused on raising rates slowly as the labor market tightens.
Ms. Swonk noted that the Fed had demonstrated little ability to constrain financial markets without causing broader economic damage.
Mr. Powell, she said, "will be reluctant to voice publicly the concerns that he and his colleagues have about the froth in financial markets."
She added, "Previous attempts by the Fed to jawbone financial markets into place have failed."
Mr. Powell may make his public debut as the Fed's chairman in mid-February, when the House and Senate hold hearings on monetary policy twice a year. The dates have not been announced, but the testimony will offer Mr. Powell a first chance to calibrate expectations for his tenure.

Full text: Stocks in the United States overcame a brief stumble to close slightly higher on Wednesday, snapping a two-day losing streak. The dip came after the Federal Reserve released its latest statement on interest rate policy and the economy, in which the central bank signaled that it expects inflation to pick up this year. The Fed, as expected, held off on raising interest rates.
Stocks bounced back in the last hour of trading, with gains by technology companies outweighing losses in health care and other sectors.
The latest batch of strong earnings from big companies, including Boeing, helped put investors back in a buying mood a day after the market had its biggest drop since August.
"The markets have turned around," said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. "Many people have been waiting for it to dip as it's marched higher and higher, and we finally had two days of weakness, particularly yesterday."
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.38 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,823.81. The Dow Jones industrial average added 72.50 points, or 0.3 percent, to 26,149.39. The Nasdaq composite climbed 9 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,411. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 7.82 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,574.99.
All told, the indexes ended January with solid gains.
Boeing climbed 4.9 percent after the aerospace giant's latest results topped Wall Street's expectations. The stock, which has been the biggest gainer in the Dow over the past year, added $16.66 to $354.37.
Electronic Arts led the rally in technology companies, jumping 7 percent after the video game maker forecast quarterly earnings and sales that were well ahead of what analysts expected. The stock was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, rising $8.26 to $126.96.
Some 80 percent of the companies that have reported earnings in recent weeks have beat expectations. Typically, it's around two-thirds. Management teams are also touting stronger sales growth than in previous quarters.
"The combination is really helping drive the market higher and making investors feel more confident about the outlook for 2018," said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
The market was higher for most of the day but briefly gave up its gains after the Fed released its economic and interest rate policy update.
The central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a still-low range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent and signaled that it expects to resume raising rates gradually to reflect an improving, healthy job market and economy.
The Fed also said that it expects inflation to finally pick up this year and to stabilize around the Fed's target level of 2 percent. In its previous statement, the Fed had predicted that inflation would remain below its target rate.
That revision appeared to put off some investors, triggering the sell-off that pulled stock indexes into the red until the last hour of trading.
"Investors have continued to think that inflation will remain below 2 percent, and the Fed is more clearly indicating that they think inflation will pick up to the 2 percent range," Warne said. "And that's led to higher long-term rates and, as a result, stocks have moved down today."
Health care stocks posted the biggest decline for the second day in a row.
Eli Lilly lost $4.64, or 5.4 percent, to $81.45, while Gilead Sciences gave up $3.49, or 4 percent, to $83.80.
Some companies' quarterly report cards failed to impress traders.
Juniper Networks slumped 7.7 percent after the provider of network equipment forecast quarterly results that were well below what Wall Street analysts expected. The stock fell more than any other company in the S&P 500, shedding $2.17 to $26.15.
Textron shares also fell after the industrial conglomerate's results fell of forecasts. The stock slid $1.51, or 2.5 percent, to $58.67.
Bond prices didn't move much. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 2.72 percent after briefly moving higher.
The prospect for stronger economic growth, both in the U.S. and abroad, has helped drive bond yields higher in recent months. This week yields have hovered at the highest level since April 2014. Rising yields make bonds more appealing to investors seeking income, but they can also lead to higher financing costs for companies, homebuyers and other borrowers.
The dollar rose to 109.11 yen from 108.78 yen on Tuesday. The euro edged up to $1.2410 from $1.2404.
Gold rose $3.60 to $1,339 an ounce. Silver added 18 cents to $17.24 an ounce. Copper gained 1 cent to $3.20 a pound.
Oil prices reversed an early slide. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 23 cents to settle at $64.73 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 3 cents to $69.05 a barrel in London.
In other futures trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.91 a gallon. Heating oil was little changed at $2.07 a gallon. Natural gas fell 20 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $3 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Germany's DAX fell 0.1 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 0.1 percent. London's FTSE 100 fell 0.7 percent. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.9 percent. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.3 percent.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: No one can accuse the Trump administration of being boring, even when it comes to telecom. According to leaked documents, there is a proposal going around the White House to build a federally owned 5G telecommunications system -- the next version of a mobile broadband network -- or perhaps even to nationalize the 5G networks that private telecom companies are now building. (5G is the "fifth generation" wireless protocol, which promises to be faster and more secure than its predecessor, 4G, but requires new antennas and cell towers.) The White House proposal, which at the moment is just an idea, appears driven by concerns about security threats related to China's development of 5G networks. But the strongest case for building a national network is different. Done right, a national 5G network could save a lot of Americans a lot of money and revive competition in what has become an entrenched oligopoly. Done wrong, on the other hand, it could look like something out of Hugo Chávez's disastrous economic playbook.
Americans spend an extraordinary amount of money on bandwidth. The cable industry is the worst offender: Since cable providers have little effective competition, cable bills have grown at many times the rate of inflation and can easily reach thousands of dollars per year. Mobile phone service is not exactly a bargain, either. And with plans to connect cars, toasters and pets to the internet, broadband bills may continue to soar.
These bills, collectively, function like a private tax on the whole economy. Could a public 5G network cut that tax?
A national 5G network would be a kind of 21st-century Tennessee Valley Authority. The government would build or lease towers across the country, prioritizing underserved areas, and set up a public utility that sold bandwidth at cost. This cheap bandwidth would be made available for resale by anyone who wanted to provide home broadband or wireless, thus creating a new business model for small local resellers.
The new competition might save people money in a few ways. First, it could create price competition for the four national carriers (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint). More important, it could do the same for cable broadband, whose providers face minimal competition in most areas. And it might give small telecom businesses a new lease on life. As a result, prices could be cheaper and jobs could be created.
As with any public infrastructure, the case for it is strongest if private industry won't build it and the public benefit is considerable. The case for public roads rests on the assumption that private industry won't build roads that reach the whole country. In telecom, we see a similar pattern: Companies like Verizon have been happy to build fiber-optic or 4G service in cities like Boston and New York but are less excited about doing so in poor and rural America.
But the case for a national 5G network comes with two major caveats. First, it has to be done right: A strongman approach -- nationalizing AT&T's and Verizon's nascent networks instead of building new ones -- is too Chávez-esque. Seizing private assets in peacetime without good reason sets a dangerous precedent. And you don't need to be paranoid to fear the combination of the world's largest government and largest telecommunication companies. Any federally owned 5G network would need to have privacy protections and be as separate from the political branches as possible.
The second caveat is that while the government can be good at building things, its management record is less inspiring. Any national network it builds should be government-owned for its first decade or so, and then sold off to the highest bidder.
The idea of "Trump 5G" has come as an unwelcome shock to the major telecommunications firms and their allies. Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, warned that "any federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction" from winning "the 5G war." Presumably, he doesn't mean that competition is bad, but that a plan for nationalization will cause private industry to stop investing in its networks. Fair enough. But the economy has countless other areas in which private and public programs compete, and the key question is how considerable the loss of private incentives would really be, and whether the public benefits compensate for it.
That's a tough call. But if winning the 5G war is the F.C.C.'s priority, a federal network might be how we get 5G to more citizens more quickly. It is surely a crazy idea, but we live in crazy times, and if done right, it merits serious consideration.

Full text: The other day my barber asked me whether he should put all his money in Bitcoin. And the truth is that if he'd bought Bitcoin, say, a year ago he'd be feeling pretty good right now. On the other hand, Dutch speculators who bought tulip bulbs in 1635 also felt pretty good for a while, until tulip prices collapsed in early 1637. So is Bitcoin a giant bubble that will end in grief? Yes. But it's a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology. And there's something to be learned about the times we live in by peeling away that wrapping.
If you've been living in a cave and haven't heard of Bitcoin, it's the biggest, best-known example of a "cryptocurrency": an asset that has no physical existence, consisting of nothing but a digital record stored on computers. What makes cryptocurrencies different from ordinary bank accounts, which are also nothing but digital records, is that they don't reside in the servers of any particular financial institution. Instead, a Bitcoin's existence is documented by records distributed in many places.
And your ownership isn't verified by proving (and hence revealing) your identity. Instead, ownership of a Bitcoin is verified by possession of a secret password, which -- using techniques derived from cryptography, the art of writing or solving codes -- lets you access that virtual coin without revealing any information you don't choose to.
It's a nifty trick. But what is it good for?
In principle, you can use Bitcoin to pay for things electronically. But you can use debit cards, PayPal, Venmo, etc. to do that, too -- and Bitcoin turns out to be a clunky, slow, costly means of payment. In fact, even Bitcoin conferences sometimes refuse to accept Bitcoins from attendees. There's really no reason to use Bitcoin in transactions -- unless you don't want anyone to see either what you're buying or what you're selling, which is why much actual Bitcoin use seems to involve drugs, sex and other black-market goods.
So Bitcoins aren't really digital cash. What they are, sort of, is the digital equivalent of $100 bills.
Like Bitcoins, $100 bills aren't much use for ordinary transactions: Most shops won't accept them. But "Benjamins" are popular with thieves, drug dealers and tax evaders. And while most of us can go years without seeing a $100 bill, there are a lot of those bills out there -- more than a trillion dollars' worth, accounting for 78 percent of the value of U.S. currency in circulation.
So are Bitcoins a superior alternative to $100 bills, allowing you to make secret transactions without lugging around suitcases full of cash? Not really, because they lack one crucial feature: a tether to reality.
Although the modern dollar is a "fiat" currency, not backed by any other asset, like gold, its value is ultimately backed by the fact that the U.S. government will accept it, in fact demands it, in payment for taxes. Its purchasing power is also stabilized by the Federal Reserve, which will reduce the outstanding supply of dollars if inflation runs too high, increase that supply to prevent deflation. And a $100 bill is, of course, worth 100 of these broadly stable dollars.
Bitcoin, by contrast, has no intrinsic value at all. Combine that lack of a tether to reality with the very limited extent to which Bitcoin is used for anything, and you have an asset whose price is almost purely speculative, and hence incredibly volatile. Bitcoins lost about 40 percent of their value over the past six weeks; if Bitcoin were an actual currency, that would be the equivalent of a roughly 8,000 percent annual inflation rate.
Oh, and Bitcoin's untethered nature also makes it highly susceptible to market manipulation. Back in 2013 fraudulent activities by a single trader appear to have caused a sevenfold increase in Bitcoin's price. Who's driving the price now? Nobody knows. Some observers think North Korea may be involved.
But what about the fact that those who did buy Bitcoin early have made huge amounts of money? Well, people who invested with Bernie Madoff also made lots of money, or at least seemed to, for a long time.
As Robert Shiller, the world's leading bubble expert, points out, asset bubbles are like "naturally occurring Ponzi schemes." Early investors in a bubble make a lot of money as new investors are drawn in, and those profits pull in even more people. The process can go on for years before something -- a reality check, or simply exhaustion of the pool of potential marks -- brings the party to a sudden, painful end.
When it comes to cryptocurrencies there's an additional factor: It's a bubble, but it's also something of a cult, whose initiates are given to paranoid fantasies about evil governments stealing all their money (as opposed to private hackers, who have stolen a remarkably high proportion of extant cryptocurrency tokens). Journalists who write skeptically about Bitcoin tell me that no other subject generates as much hate mail.
So no, my barber shouldn't buy Bitcoin. This will end badly, and the sooner it does, the better.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve's departing chairwoman, will preside over her final policymaking meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday where, in a fitting finale, the Fed is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged as the economy continues to gain strength. Ms. Yellen's four-year tenure has been defined by her campaign to stimulate job and wage growth by holding interest rates at low levels for much longer than markets had expected.
Her patience was rewarded: Unemployment steadily declined while inflation remained low.
Now, as Ms. Yellen makes way for her successor, Jerome H. Powell, who was confirmed by the Senate last week, the challenges confronting the central bank also are starting to change.
The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in December, and the Fed does not expect it to fall much further. Instead, as economic growth continues, it expects faster inflation. After hiking rates three times last year, Fed officials have predicted that they will raise rates another three times in 2018.
"Yellen had the uncharted territory of getting an economy going with low inflation," said Seth Carpenter, a former Fed economist who is now chief United States economist at UBS. Mr. Powell, he said, "is going to be in a very different world: Fiscal stimulus when you're already at full employment."
Analysts and investors are unruffled by the impending departure of Ms. Yellen and installation of Mr. Powell. They have accepted Mr. Powell's assertions during the confirmation process that he intends to continue the Fed's current approach to monetary policy.
"The way I think about it is, Jay Powell will be a reassuring force of continuity," said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist for Standish Mellon Asset Management.
Ms. Yellen is also leaving a clear road map. When the Fed began in October to reduce its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it purchased as part of its post-crisis stimulus campaign, it announced a multiyear timetable that it said would remain unchanged barring emergencies.
The Fed has made clear that the January meeting will be a place holder, not least because of the transition in leadership, and markets have taken the message. The headline on Morgan Stanley's preview of the January meeting: "Where's the Snooze Button?"
But markets are equally convinced that the Fed will tighten policy for the sixth straight quarter at its next policy meeting in March, which will be Mr. Powell's first meeting as the chairman.
Ms. Yellen's priority was ensuring that the Fed did not raise rates too quickly; Mr. Powell could face the challenge of making sure that the Fed does not move too slowly.
Fed officials said as they embarked on the tightening process that they wanted to avoid the mechanical predictability of the previous tightening cycle between 2004 and 2006. Like the proverbial frog in the stovetop pot, investors found it easy to ignore the slow and steady increases.
But the Fed, wary of surprising markets, has once again fallen into a pattern of carefully signaling each rate hike -- and markets, once again, are largely unconcerned. The ease of borrowing has increased over the last year, according to measures of financial conditions.
"They said that policy was too gradual and predictable" during the last tightening cycle, said Mr. Reinhart, who played a key role in the last round of rate increases when he was head of the Fed's division of monetary affairs. "And now it is predictable and gradual and even slower."
Under Ms. Yellen, the unemployment rate has declined to 4.1 percent from 6.7 percent in February 2014, while inflation has remained below the Fed's 2 percent target. During the first three years of her tenure, in particular, Ms. Yellen repeatedly found reasons to argue that the Fed should delay raising interest rates, extending the Fed's stimulus campaign.
Scott Sumner, an economist at George Mason University, wrote in an October appraisal that Ms. Yellen's performance was "near perfection." He added that, at the end of her tenure, Ms. Yellen will likely have achieved the Fed's dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing inflation "better than any other chair in history."
There were plenty of critics along the way. A coalition of labor and community groups, the Fed Up campaign, pressed Ms. Yellen throughout her term to increase the Fed's stimulus campaign. Republicans and conservative economists fretted that the Fed was doing too much.
Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York, said that the persistence of low interest rates had been painful for banks and other financial firms, many of which also resented Ms. Yellen's focus on strengthening financial regulation. "It's not goodbye, good luck from Wall Street," he said. "It's don't let the door hit you on the backside on your way out."
Eleanor Herlands, a 92-year-old retiree in Stamford, Conn., said that she and other savers had suffered during the long years of low interest rates.
"They pushed people to buy stocks, people that knew nothing about the stock market," said Mrs. Herlands, who opted instead to keep her money in savings accounts. "I made my own choices, but I never dreamed that it would go on this long. Now I'm pleased that I'm finally getting at least a little relief."
She said she was now earning an average of 1.6 percent on her accounts.
Ms. Yellen, 71, is the first person in modern history to serve a four-year term as Fed chairman without being appointed to a second term. She has not said what she plans to do next.
She leaves behind some challenges for her successor.
Fed officials in recent months have begun to debate whether the central bank should adjust its approach to monetary policy before the next downturn. The Fed's traditional approach is to stimulate growth by reducing interest rates. But rates, which reflect real borrowing costs and inflation, are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future.
The potential solutions mostly involve embracing more inflation.
The current economic expansion also is approaching the end of its ninth year, one of the longest periods of uninterrupted economic growth in American history.
Some forecasters say they can see clouds on the horizon, though a little squinting is required.
Oliver Jones, markets economist at Capital Economics, predicted the Fed's march toward higher interest rates may finally begin to pinch financial markets by the second half of the year -- just as the stimulus provided by the tax cuts is beginning to fade.
"As growth in the U.S. economy starts to slow, we think that the long-running rally in the U.S. stock market will go into reverse," Mr. Jones wrote in his predictions for 2018. He added, "History suggests that a correction in the U.S. stock market would be contagious, even if growth in the rest of the world generally remains healthy as we expect."

Consumer Confidence Helps, Until It's Gone

Full text: Amid the constant turmoil in domestic and global politics these days, the economy's steady expansion has been a source of comfort. But look more closely and you will find that economic growth rests on a surprisingly amorphous base: consumer confidence. In the United States, consumer confidence has been ascending since 2009. What's more, the domestic data have been synchronized to a remarkable degree with similar metrics from around the world.
We know that consumer confidence is a critically important advance indicator of economic booms and busts. At the moment, it is forecasting a continuing expansion. Yet the troubling fact is that we don't fully understand how and why consumer confidence acts as it does.
Since 2009, there have been ups and downs in consumer confidence lasting months, but those downward swings have not interrupted the long uptrend in the United States. This pattern has held for all four major American indexes: the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's consumer confidence index.
Some recent readings have been a bit weak, but we have seen such minor shifts many times since 2009 and they haven't meant much. Even the recent shutdown of the United States government -- and the prospect of further political conflict -- may not matter for this metric. When the government shut down briefly in October 2013, there was a temporary drop in confidence, but that didn't stop the longer-run rise.
The simplest explanation is the necessarily slow but consistent recovery from the crushing financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. After all, a financial crisis of that magnitude leads to lawsuits, bankruptcies, career disruptions and other economic events that muddy a recovery, and they take a long while to clear up.
There is some truth to that explanation, but it is insufficient. It omits a critical yet elusive factor: animal spirits. John Maynard Keynes popularized that term in 1936, referring to a psychological state in which people get a consumerist and entrepreneurial bug that allows them to forget their worries and let their optimism guide their economic decision-making. In homage to Keynes, the economist George Akerlof and I used "Animal Spirits" as the title of a book in 2009. Flourishing animal spirits involve complacency, a playful mood, a "damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead" feeling of confidence.
That kind of exuberance now seems to be fueling the stock market, where prices have outstripped fundamental valuations. Real (inflation-corrected) corporate earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were, for the third quarter of 2017, only 6 percent higher than they were in the second quarter of 2007, just before the financial crisis. In contrast, real stock market prices were 39 percent higher. That disproportionate increase is based much more on how earnings are being valued than on how the level of earnings has increased.
Such surges have happened before. The four major confidence indexes took a long ride up between 1990 and 2000, again after a recession. From the bottom of the Michigan index in October 1990 to a peak in February 2000, real S.&P. 500 price per share rose 256 percent while real earnings per share rose only 78 percent.
Why did share prices rise so much in that period? A traditional explanation is that investors had a "rational expectation" of future earnings increases, but it is clear that they were grossly mistaken. The S.&P. 500 lost just over half its real value from its peak on March 24, 2000, to its trough on Oct. 9, 2002. No concrete event caused this plunge, though we can point to the bursting of the dot-com bubble and a recession. Both were plausibly caused by a drop in overinflated confidence.
The critical question, then: What drives these decade-long swings in confidence, including the upsurge that is still underway?
Take the current confidence cycle. While Donald J. Trump's presidency may have exerted some impact on animal spirits in the last year, it doesn't explain the preceding eight years of slowly improving confidence. And I am skeptical that the upward swing can be entirely explained by standard factors like government and central bank stabilization policy or technological innovation.
Scholars are working on this problem. At the American Economic Association annual meeting in Philadelphia this month, I chaired a session on "Confidence, Animal Spirits and Business Cycles." All three researchers presented papers describing how animal spirits are helping to drive the economy in the United States and across the world.
Ayhan Kose, director of the World Bank Group's work on global macroeconomic outlook and forecasts, summarized work by the bank's researchers on confidence indexes and the business cycle. They compiled a new database of such survey-based indexes and measures of economic activity in 95 countries. Much of their data goes back before 2000, and in some cases to the early 1960s. The researchers found that consumer and business confidence tended to start declining before the peak of the business cycle, and to start recovering before recessions ended.
In short, confidence indexes are indeed leading indicators in a vast array of countries, and these individual country confidence indexes are driven by a global cycle, though how this cycle is synchronized still isn't clear. Fluctuations in animal spirits remain an essential mystery for economists, though it is encouraging to see that quantitative studies of the issue are underway.
As a practical matter, consumer confidence numbers are important but still limited in their predictive power. For example, the latest consumer confidence index numbers do not strongly suggest any imminent change in the uptrend we have been seeing for so long. That bodes well for the economy over the short term.
But history indicates that a long uptrend like this one will eventually shift downward, even if we can't say when it will happen. While the timing will be a surprise, we can expect a sharp change in direction that is likely to have serious consequences for the economy in the United States and around the world.

Full text: The American economy finished off last year on a firm footing, and is poised for more vigorous growth in the months to come. Preliminary estimates released by the government on Friday showed that the nation's output increased at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the final quarter of 2017. Although that performance amounts to less than the heady 4 percent annual growth that President Trump has promised, it is further evidence -- along with a sinking jobless rate and surging consumer confidence -- of the economy's resilience.
"The year-end is solid," said Joel Prakken, chief United States economist at Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit. Details within the report, about climbing business investment and depleted inventories, suggest more economic strength than the bare-bones headline number might indicate. "It portends well for 2018 demand," he said.
In the year ahead, hefty tax cuts, particularly for businesses, are expected to encourage more investment and spending, although many economists predict ballooning deficits will overtake the positive effects in the longer term. One-time quirks that could affect growth measurements this year could also end up artificially pumping 2018's figures.
Even analysts with ambitious forecasts for the next year, however, agree that the United States is unlikely to sustain annual growth of much more than 2 percent given a smaller, aging work force; sluggish productivity growth; and soaring deficits.
"The economy's sustainable trend is around 2 percent," Mr. Prakken said.
The Commerce Department's report on the gross domestic product -- which showed growth for all of last year at 2.3 percent -- is a rough draft. The fourth-quarter estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months, and it could increase or drop by as much as a percentage point, based on previous recalculations. After all, government statisticians have to put together the fourth-quarter estimate without complete data on construction, trade and inventories.
Mr. Trump inherited an improving economy, and during his first year in office, the trend continued and growth accelerated. Supporters credit Mr. Trump with revving up business and consumer confidence, and say tax cuts and eased regulation are fueling capital investment and job creation. They also point to a booming stock market, though market gains are not necessarily a gauge of economic underpinnings.
The president ticked off those items on Friday when he hailed America's economic strength at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where global leaders have been sharing encouraging economic news all week.
The American economy recovered from a plodding start in the first three months of 2017, when sharp cuts in consumer spending limited G.D.P. growth to 1.2 percent on an annualized basis. It sprang back over the next six months, with the rate reaching 3.1 percent in the second quarter and 3.2 percent in the third.
In the fourth quarter, holiday shoppers were enthusiastic, and spending on business and residential housing was up. A persistent appetite for foreign goods continued to widen the trade deficit -- it reached nearly $72 billion for goods alone in December -- and dragged down gains. But inventory declines that detracted from G.D.P. last quarter should rebound over the next as businesses refill empty shelves.
The American economy's performance has also been buoyed by simultaneous growth in nations around the world, which has fueled trade and enabled foreign consumers to buy more American-made products.
For several years after the recession, the United States' steady if unremarkable growth was a bright spot compared with struggling economies abroad. Under President Barack Obama, who took office when the economy was floundering, yearly growth averaged 2.1 percent during the recovery. After a high of 2.9 percent in 2015, it dropped to 1.5 percent in 2016.
But in 2017, more than eight years into the nation's recovery, the expansion spread to at least 120 countries, according to a report released this week by the International Monetary Fund. In several, growth rates outpaced that of the United States. Among large economies in the Group of 7, the United States ranked fifth, according to a report from the World Economic Forum. On a list of 29 advanced economies, it ranked 10th, though it sank close to the bottom in terms of equitably sharing the gains.
Exhilarating stock market gains have also been a worldwide phenomenon. Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, pointed out that the major stock indexes in Japan, Hong Kong, Germany and South Korea registered gains comparable to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, if not better.
"The U.S. performance doesn't stand out relative to the rest of the world," he said.
The I.M.F. warned against assuming that the current economic cycle would go on indefinitely, however, particularly given the towering debt of the United States and other countries. By borrowing so much, the government can crowd out other investors and drive up interest rates. At the same time, giant deficits crank up pressure to cut government spending on health care and housing, policing and schools. With less money to go around, spending dries up and consumer demand -- the economy's primary engine -- slows.
"Political leaders and policymakers must stay mindful that the current economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long," said Maurice Obstfeld, the I.M.F.'s chief economist.
Despite all the attention that the growth statistics engender, economists warn against reading too much into G.D.P. figures. In recent years, more and more experts have noted the increasing difficulty in measuring a knowledge-based economy where services like Facebook and Google are free and innovations and improvements often lack an accurate price tag.
An additional, unexpected flaw in recent United States data may come more sharply into focus this year. G.D.P. figures may have been artificially lowered over the last decade because of tax policies that encouraged domestic-based multinationals to shift billions of dollars in domestic profits overseas.
After Ireland became a tax haven, its growth rate suddenly rocketed to more than 25 percent in 2015. At least a portion of what was counted, however, had been generated in the United States and should have been counted toward American growth, said Alan J. Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. A significant chunk of the United States trade gap has been caused by companies overstating imports from their foreign subsidiaries and underreporting exports, Mr. Auerbach said.
One analysis estimated that such accounting methods subtracted $280 billion from the tally of the nation's output in 2012. The new tax law reworks many of those international provisions. Those changes "should somewhat temper the incentives" to book money offshore, said Fatih Guvenen, one of the authors of the analysis, "but still doesn't eliminate them."
The tax-code changes could muddy attempts to measure growth in 2018, and possibly 2019, though. If enough companies stop disguising significant domestic profits as foreign, G.D.P. in the United States would suddenly expand -- without any underlying change in output.
"Over the next couple of years, I think there will be a one-time jump in the level of G.D.P. because the profits that Apple, Google, Facebook and others attributed to an offshore tax haven affiliate will now appear in their U.S. accounts," said Mr. Guvenen, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota.
"If it happens at a larger scale, it will give the appearance of faster G.D.P. growth," he said.

Full text: Stocks in the United States spent a second day flipping between small gains and losses Thursday as investors again looked for hints about the Trump administration's stance on international trade and the dollar. Major indexes ended the day mixed as airlines plunged while biotech drugmakers climbed. Homebuilders fell sharply after the Commerce Department said sales of new homes dropped in December. Airlines suffered a second day of sharp losses as investors worried about rising costs and the possibility of lower air fares. Retailers and technology companies slipped, but health care companies including Biogen and Celgene rose.
High-dividend stocks such as utilities rallied as bond yields fell, making those stocks more attractive to investors seeking income.
The dollar made a small recovery in the afternoon after President Donald Trump said he wants to see a stronger currency. The dollar has fallen to three-year lows, and it fell further on Wednesday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there were advantages to the dollar's weakness over the last year.
Investors took that to mean the administration would not do much to prop up the dollar. Mnuchin said Thursday that he supports a stronger dollar over a longer term.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and Dow Jones industrial average still rose enough to set more records, but stocks have wobbled this week as investors monitored the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to get a sense of how the Trump administration's nationalist stance might affect global trade. Trump is scheduled give a speech there at around 7 a.m. Eastern time Friday.
Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist for BTIG, said investors have mostly tuned out political news in the last year, but it might be time for that to change because after a stretch of historic calm in the markets, volatility is rising slightly.
"Economies and earnings are the drivers of the market long term, but politics needs to be respected," he said.
The S.&P. 500 inched up 1.71 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,839.25. The Dow average climbed 140.67 points, or 0.5 percent, to 26,392.79. The Nasdaq composite fell 3.89 points to 7,411.16. Most of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange closed lower.
The dollar edged up to 109.41 yen from 109.05 yen and the euro rose slightly to $1.2404.
Among airlines, Alaska Air lost $2.62, or 4.1 percent, to $62.07 and Southwest Airlines sank $2.02, or 3.2 percent, to $60.19. They took even bigger losses Wednesday after United Continental said it plans to add passenger capacity at a faster pace over the next few years. That could increase the chances of a glut of flights and lower fares at the same time airlines are dealing with higher fuel expenses and higher labor costs.
The Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell more than 9 percent in December, partly because of severely cold weather. NVR sank $237.20, or 6.6 percent, to $3,350 while Lennar fell $2.35, or 3.3 percent, to $68.47. Those stocks have made huge gains over the last year because of strong demand for homes and rising prices.
Bond prices edged up. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.62 percent from 2.65 percent.
The European Central Bank did not make any changes to its stimulus programs. ECB head Mario Draghi said the eurozone economy still needs support to keep raising the rate of inflation toward healthier levels. It will continue to buy 30 billion euros ($36 billion) in bonds per month until at least September.
Benchmark United States crude lost 10 cents to $65.51 a barrel in New York.
Gold picked up $6.50 to $1,362.40 an ounce, and after recent strong gains is at its highest price since August 2016.

Full text: DAVOS, Switzerland -- In the year and a half since Britain's shocking decision to sever itself from the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May has labored to portray her country's future as one of glorious progress. She has described a bold new era in which Britain would look beyond the confines of Europe, striking trade deals and reclaiming its place as a global power. All the while, an uncomfortable reality has been sinking in. Britain's stature on the world stage has diminished, and its economy has sagged. The former colonial empire has been reduced to a lesser actor, a reality that hit home on Thursday as Mrs. May delivered a sparsely attended speech before the World Economic Forum.
Mrs. May devoted part of her speech to declaring Britain's steadfast commitment to global trade and international engagement. But one of her primary examples of that commitment -- highlighting Britain's role in a European bloc it is actively leaving -- underscored the strange moment she inhabits.
"The U.K. has been at the forefront of championing new trade deals including the E.U.'s deals with Canada and Japan," Ms. May said. "And as we leave the European Union, the U.K. will continue to be a global advocate of free trade."
The day before, President Emmanuel Macron of France had received rock star-style treatment from a packed crowd that waited nearly an hour for a chance just to get into the room where he was to speak. People who arrived a moment before Mrs. May's speech found empty seats within a few rows of the stage.
Much of Britain's receding status comes from its decision to abandon Europe -- Brexit, in the parlance -- and to remove itself from a realm of some 500 million people that sprawls from Ireland to Greece. Given that nearly half of Britain's exports land within the European Union, any rupture to this trade could cost the country substantial treasure.
Around the world, every major economy is now growing in a synchronized wave of expansion that has finally put the finish on a wrenching global downturn that began a decade ago.
"It is the best moment in the global economy since the '50s," said Kenneth Rogoff, an international economist at Harvard University.
Britain stands out as one of the weaker performers. Its economy probably expanded by just 1.7 percent last year and is expected to grow by only 1.5 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
By contrast, the I.M.F. estimates that the United States economy will grow by 2.7 percent this year, and the 19 nations that share the euro currency will collectively expand by 2.2 percent.
Britain's weak performance is due in large part to market sentiments about Brexit. The vote sent the British pound plunging against both the dollar and the euro. Although the pound has recovered much ground since then, Britain has been choking on the effects of the shift: A net importer of goods, Britain is paying higher prices for products it brings in from Europe, China and elsewhere, contributing to inflation that is running at a 3 percent annual pace.
And the country's pending divorce from Europe has marginalized its role within the bloc just as European leaders are channeling the Continent's newfound economic strength into furthering their integration.
"Who sees the U.K. as an important discussion partner?" asked Hans-Paul Bürkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group, based in Frankfurt.
In recent months, Mrs. May has pursued a split with Europe that changes as little as possible, while simultaneously trying to evade the wrath of anti-European members of Parliament in her governing Conservative Party.
Mrs. May's government hopes to negotiate a transitional arrangement with Europe that allows Britain to remain within the single European marketplace and customs union to ensure that trade continues unabated.
The price of such arrangement will almost certainly be Britain's continuing to make substantial contributions to the European budget while still living by European rules, including the free movement of people -- the very item that provoked the electoral backlash that delivered the Brexit vote.
President Trump's administration has sought to bolster Britain's place in the world while offering its support for Brexit. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, sought to reassure Britain that its so-called special relationship with the United States was intact.
"I do think we've had a very special economic relationship, and we expect that to continue," Mr. Mnuchin said, hours before Mr. Trump was scheduled to meet privately with Mrs. May.
The president remained intent in striking a bilateral trade deal, Mr. Mnuchin added. "As soon as the U.K. is ready, we'd be prepared to negotiate a very attractive trade deal," he said.
But so long as Britain remains within the European customs union, it cannot negotiate trade deals with other countries. Such negotiations are the sole preserve of European bureaucrats in Brussels.
And trade between the United States and Britain is already so free of tariffs that a deal would probably be of far more symbolic importance than a spur to increased commerce.
In her speech, Mrs. May steered clear of any discussion of the particulars of Brexit, instead devoting most of her time to calling for a new social compact that would bring social media platforms to heel for enabling trafficking in hate speech and facilitating communication among terrorists.
Above all, she cast Britain as a country that is not in retreat.
"The United Kingdom has a proud history of stepping up and seizing the opportunities of our time," she said. "We stand ready to do so again."
By that point, several people attending the speech were standing and walking toward the exits.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, directed unusually sharp criticism at Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, on Thursday, effectively accusing Mr. Mnuchin of violating agreements among nations against starting currency wars. Mr. Draghi, speaking at a news conference here, said he objected to "the use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn't reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed." He then quoted from an agreement reached in Washington in October under which countries promised to "refrain from competitive devaluations."
Mr. Draghi did not mention Mr. Mnuchin by name, but he was clearly referring to the Treasury secretary's remarks on Wednesday at a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland, that a weaker dollar was good for United States trade. The comment was interpreted as an effort to talk down the dollar, which would breach the international nonaggression pact on currency rates.
On Thursday, Mr. Mnuchin told reporters in Davos that his comment had been misunderstood.
"I thought it was actually balanced and consistent with what I've said before," he said, "which is we're not concerned with where the dollar is in the short term. It's a very, very liquid market and we believe in free currencies. And that there's both advantages and disadvantages of where the dollar is in the short term." (After arriving in Davos, President Trump said during an interview that he wanted "to see a strong dollar" and that Mr. Mnuchin's remarks had been misinterpreted.)
Central bankers usually refrain from rhetorical fisticuffs with government officials, but Mr. Mnuchin's initial remark arrived at a sensitive time for the eurozone.
Europe's economy is performing better than anyone had expected it would be just a few months ago. But the growth has brought some unwelcome side effects. In particular, the euro has reached a three-year high against the dollar as investors anticipate the European Central Bank dialing back its economic stimulus efforts sooner than previously expected, which would mean higher interest on the euro.
A strong euro makes products manufactured in the 19-country eurozone more expensive abroad, which could hurt exports and ultimately create a drag on economic growth.
Mr. Draghi has already struggled to contain investor expectations about when the central bank would end the money-printing program known as quantitative easing. He was obviously unhappy that a top official in the Trump administration was inciting volatility in currency markets.
Mr. Draghi portrayed Mr. Mnuchin's comments as part of a broader deterioration in international etiquette. At a meeting of the central bank's Governing Council that preceded the news conference, Mr. Draghi said, "Several members expressed concern, and this concern was broader than simply the exchange rate. It was about the overall status of international relations right now."
The central bank signaled no changes in policy on Thursday, reiterating that it would continue its stimulus program at least through September in order to hold down market interest rates and to nudge inflation toward the official target of 2 percent. And policymakers left open the possibility of increasing the stimulus efforts if conditions worsened.
A statement by the Governing Council included several phrases that would normally be taken as indications that the central bank was in no hurry to put the brakes on the growth of the eurozone economy. Among the relevant phrases:
"Domestic price pressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend."
"The recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty."
"An ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary."
Still, the euro rose against the dollar as traders effectively ignored attempts to convince them that there had been no change in the bank's stance.
"Without saying anything new," Mr. Draghi moved the markets, Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING Bank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients. "But probably not in the intended direction."
Investors and analysts had been even more keenly attuned than usual on Thursday to any changes in Mr. Draghi's tone or language that might hint at an end to the stimulus program. Comments by some Governing Council members suggested that a growing faction favored an abrupt end to stimulus after September, rather than a gradual withdrawal.
Since December, the indicators of eurozone growth have steadily gotten stronger. Surveys of business and consumer confidence find both at their highest levels in more than a decade. Unemployment, at 8.7 percent, is at its lowest level since early 2009. The leading survey of business confidence in Germany is at a record high, according to data published on Thursday.
As a result, expectations have risen that the quantitative easing program, in which the central bank creates new money and uses it to buy government and corporate bonds, will end after September. Such a move would set the stage for the bank to begin raising its key interest rate, currently at zero, sometime in 2019.
A majority of the 25-member Governing Council probably lean toward a gradual end to quantitative easing. But some members who are not usually considered hard-liners on the issue of inflation have lately questioned whether it made sense to prolong the stimulus program.
Among those doing the questioning is Benoît Coeuré, one of six members of the central bank's executive board, which oversees its operations. (The other council's other 19 members are the leaders of the national central banks in the eurozone.) Mr. Coeuré has generally been seen as a proponent of quantitative easing.
Recently, though, he has sounded very bullish about the eurozone economy, a sign that he might join those who think the bond-buying should come to an end. As one of the Governing Council's most influential members, Mr. Coeuré could help tip the balance of power.
"The current economic expansion in the euro area is stronger than it has been for a decade," he said in Bangkok last month, "and broader than for two decades."
Mr. Draghi, in effect, said on Thursday the appearance of increasing disagreement among Governing Council members was not significant.
"I don't think the differences between the various members of the Governing Council are as substantive as they were on other occasions," he said. "We are not talking about deep existential differences."

Full text: Stocks in the United States bounced up and down and finished mostly lower Wednesday as technology companies slumped. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross discussed a more nationalist trade stance, with uncertain effects for the market. The dollar, already at three-year lows, got even weaker. Stocks got off to a strong start, but technology companies took heavier losses as the day wore on, led by chipmakers after Texas Instruments gave a disappointing forecast for the current quarter. Apple also fell.
The dollar sagged against other currencies after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the currency's decline is good for U.S. exporters, suggesting he isn't likely to try to stop its slide. Airlines plunged after United Continental said it plans to ramp up passenger capacity.
Mnuchin and Ross are at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mnuchin's comments sent the price of gold and silver higher, as investors often buy precious metals when they're concerned about inflation or softness in the dollar. Weakness in the dollar usually helps companies that export a lot of goods from the U.S., but it can hurt smaller, more domestic companies by driving up the costs of imported components.
"Small caps are much more domestically focused than large caps are, but (they are) still buying from foreign companies," said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Investment Management.
Hackett said smaller U.S. companies will report faster profit growth this year than larger ones. That's because the benefit those companies will get from the recent corporate tax cut will outweigh the pain from the weaker dollar.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1.59 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,837.54. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.31 points, or 0.2 percent, to 26,252.12. In the morning the Dow rose as much as 181 points and later fell as much as 103 points before turning higher again. That's an unusually large swing for the Dow given the market's recent lack of volatility.
The Nasdaq composite fell 45.23 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,415.06. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks skidded 11.10 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,599.61.
Investors have focused on global trade issues the last few days. On Tuesday, the administration placed tariffs on imported solar power components and washing machines.
On Wednesday Ross said the U.S. is fighting back against countries that have taken advantage of trade deals in the past.
"Trade wars are fought every single day," Ross said. "Unfortunately, every single day there are various parties trying to violate the rules, and trying to take unfair advantage of things ... the difference is that U.S. troops are now coming to the ramparts."
European stocks dropped. Germany's DAX slumped 1.1 percent and the French CAC 40 fell 0.7 percent. The British FTSE 100 fell 1.1 percent.
Texas Instruments fell $10.19, or 8.5 percent, to $109.70 after analysts were disappointed with its revenue forecast for the current quarter. Competitor Applied Materials gave up 88 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $56.91 and Nvidia fell $3.11, or 1.3 percent, to $235.80.
Chipmakers have made huge gains in recent months, and Nvidia has more than doubled over the last year. Citi Investment Research analyst Christopher Danely said business conditions for chipmakers are weakening after a run of strong results.
United Continental plunged after it said it's planning more aggressive growth over the next few years. It's aiming to increase its passenger-carrying capacity by 4 to 6 percent a year through 2020. United has done better recently at handling competition with lower-cost carriers, but investors worried that more flights will mean reduced prices and hurt its profits. The stock plunged $8.9, or 11.4 percent, to $69.05.
The dollar dropped to 109.05 yen from 110.30 yen. The euro advanced to $1.2405 from $1.2294. The ICE US dollar index fell almost 10 percent in 2017 and is down 3 percent so far this year.
Gold climbed $19.60, or 1.5 percent, to $1,356.30 an ounce and silver rose 58 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $17.49 an ounce. Copper rose 12 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $3.23 a pound.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.64 percent from 2.62 percent. That helped banks because higher yields let them charge higher interest rates on loans. JPMorgan Chase rose $1.46, or 1.3 percent, to $115.67.
Appliance maker Whirlpool, which gets most of its revenue overseas, continued to rally as the falling dollar could boost its sales and aid its earnings. The stock rose 3.5 percent Tuesday after the tariffs were announced, and on Wednesday it made its biggest gain in 18 months as it rose another $6.99, or 4.1 percent, to $178.97.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.14, or 1.8 percent, to $65.61 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 57 cents to $70.53 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline rose 1 cent to $1.92 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 2 cents to $2.11 a gallon. Natural gas gained 7 cents to $3.51 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Asian stocks were mixed. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.8 percent while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong index rose 0.1 percent. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.1 percent.

Full text: Technology and consumer-focused companies led U.S. stocks to more records Tuesday. Netflix, at the center of both groups, soared after saying it gained more than 8 million subscribers at the end of 2017. Bond prices rose and yields fell after the Bank of Japan said it isn't cutting back its stimulus programs. Yields had reached long-time highs, and the decline helped high-dividend companies like utilities and real estate investment trusts. Health care and household goods companies fell after Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble gave disappointing quarterly reports.
U.S. solar power companies spiked after President Donald Trump approved tariffs on imported solar-energy components. Some investors were relieved: analysts said the tariffs will make production more expensive for U.S. companies, but they weren't as harsh as they could have been. Companies that do their manufacturing overseas finished lower and some of the U.S. companies gave up their gains before trading ended.
"You could probably argue that this particular tariff is the first implementation of the protectionist rhetoric than he ran on," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at Charles Schwab. That didn't worry investors much, but Frederick said stocks might decline if there are signs other countries are retaliating or that the administration is preparing to take more aggressive steps.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 6.16 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,839.13. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.79 points to 26,210.81. The 30-stock index was pulled lower by Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble's losses. The Nasdaq composite jumped 52.26 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,460.29. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 5.54 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,610.71.
Netflix said it picked up 8.3 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, a much stronger result than the company and analysts had expected. The streaming video company's stock soared $22.71, or 10 percent, to $250.29.
Big technology companies also rallied. Facebook rose $3.98, or 2.1 percent, to $189.35 and Google's parent company Alphabet gained $12.01, or 1 percent, to $1,176.17. Online retailer Amazon climbed $35.23, or 2.7 percent, to $1,362.54.
The tariff on imported solar-energy components will start at 30 percent and it's aimed at cheaper imports places like South Korea and China. The latter country called the measures an abuse of trade remedies.
Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said the extra costs from the tariffs will stop some projects from being built, but added that solar power capacity in the U.S. should keep growing at a rapid pace over the next few years.
First Solar rose as much as 8.6 percent before turning lower and falling 48 cents to $68.48. SunPower gained 6.8 percent early on, but later fell 56 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $8.16. However Sunrun gained 37 cents, or 6.1 percent, to $6.41. JinkoSolar Holdings sank $1.85, or 7.9 percent, to $21.52 and Canadian Solar declined 13 cents to $15.64.
The administration also placed a tariff of 50 percent on large washing machines and some components. Whirlpool climbed $5.33, or 3.2 percent, to $171.98.
Johnson & Johnson dropped after the health care giant said sharply higher spending canceled out a big jump in sales. A federal appeals court also ruled against Johnson & Johnson, saying a patent on its rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade isn't valid. Remicade is its biggest-selling drug and the ruling could lead to increased competition. Its stock shed $6.31, or 4.3 percent, to $141.83.
Tide detergent maker Procter & Gamble lost $2.84, or 3.1 percent, to $89.05. The company reported a bigger profit and better sales than Wall Street expected, but analysts said its profit margins were weak.
Bond prices turned higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.62 percent from 2.66 percent. For the last few days, the 10-year yield has been at its highest level since September 2014.
Asian stock indexes also rose after the Bank of Japan said it will continue making massive asset purchases and using negative interest rates to spur inflation. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.3 percent and South Korea's Kospi climbed 1.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.7 percent.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose 90 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $64.47 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 93 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $69.96 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.91 a gallon. Heating oil added 3 cents to $2.09 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 22 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $3.44 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold rose $4.80 to $1,336.70 an ounce. Silver lost 8 cents to $16.91 an ounce. Copper fell 9 cents to $3.11 a pound.
The dollar slid to 110.30 yen from 110.99 yen. The euro edged up to $1.2294 from $1.2258.
The International Monetary Fund estimated that the world economy expanded at a 3.7 percent annual pace last year, the fastest since 2011, and said it believes growth will accelerate to 3.9 percent in 2018-19. The IMF noted surprisingly strong growth in Europe and Asia and predicted that U.S. tax cuts will give the American economy a short-term boost.
Germany's DAX climbed 0.7 percent and the British FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent. France's CAC 40 fell 0.1 percent.

Populist Pitchforks Seem Farther Away as 2018 Party Starts in Davos

Full text: LONDON -- The World Economic Forum has never suffered from a lack of extravagance. But this year the champagne may be flowing even more freely than usual in the Swiss Alps resort of Davos, owing to a turn in the global situation pleasing to the sorts of people who make the annual pilgrimage -- heads of state, corporate chieftains and those who manage extraordinary piles of money. The last time these putative guardians of civilization convened for this festival of internationalist concern, they found themselves in an uncustomary position: in the cross hairs of a global insurrection.
Britain had recently voted to abandon the European Union, dealing a shock to post-World War II European integration. An outsize share of the French electorate was in the thrall of Marine Le Pen and her threats to advance the revolt against European leadership. Donald J. Trump was only days away from his inauguration pledging to use the Oval Office as a war room in a relentless assault on global institutions, including the World Trade Organization, NATO and the Paris climate accord.
From inside the World Economic Forum, which starts on Tuesday, these events seemed part of the same storm system, one energized by anger in many major economies over widening income gaps. Those wealthy enough to own jets -- a group amply represented at Davos -- were pulling away from everyone else. The resulting popular fury was threatening to tear down decades-old international agreements.
The threat to the rules-based international order appeared so dire that when President Xi Jinping of China devoted his address before a packed assembly to fashioning himself a champion of global trade, he was celebrated as a rare source of adult supervision in an era of reckless iconoclasm. Never mind that Mr. Xi's government jails dissidents, censors the internet and is accused of running a relentlessly mercantilist economy. Among the investor class at Davos, he was the newly enshrined leader of the world.
A year later, anxieties over populism have largely subsided, and the global economy appears healthier than anytime in years. American participants will arrive only weeks after Washington showered wealthy households and corporations with generous tax cuts. And the man who bestowed that windfall, President Trump, now plans to attend Davos, as if to underscore fraternity with his billionaire brethren.
The Davos crowd had plenty of reasons to feel fortunate before. Now, they have more.
Ms. Le Pen was vanquished by an unabashed champion of globalization, the former Rothschild investment banker -- and previous Davos attendee -- Emmanuel Macron. Britain is still officially pursuing an exit from Europe, but one that involves changing little of substance while the politicians pretend to serve up a revolution. And Mr. Trump's antiglobalist thunder has produced minimal alteration to the global order, with NATO and the W.T.O. still alive, and a promised trade war with China yet to materialize.
For the first time since the global economic downturn that began a decade ago, the world's major economies are growing in unison.
Europe, long the basket case of the world economy, is now a leader in expansion. In France, Mr. Macron's victory has delivered alterations to the country's famously voluminous and inflexible labor code, pleasing business overseers while promising Nordic-style protections for workers. Spain, long synonymous with youth unemployment, has shown vigor as exports grow. Not even the drama over the threat of secession from the wealthy region of Catalonia has derailed growth.
In the United States, an increasingly robust economy fed by stimulus unleashed in the Obama administration has gained momentum from a raging stock market fueled by investors delighted in the corporate tax-cutting, regulation-slashing proclivities of the Trump administration.
China has quieted fears that its years of breakneck economic growth would yield a destabilizing slowdown, instead adding to the global growth festivities. Brazil has escaped its depression, and Mexico continues to grow in the face of doubts about the North American Free Trade Agreement's survival. Even Japan, where recessions are rarely distant, has impressed with an enduring economic expansion.
"There are increasing signs that the global economy has turned a corner with evidence that resurgent economic confidence is beginning to match the optimism which has long been a feature of financial markets," declared Peter Dixon, senior economist at Commerzbank AG in London, in a recent note to clients. "The global economy looks to be on a solid footing, with global growth in 2018 expected to be the fastest since 2011."
For Davos participants, who tend to enjoy a self-congratulatory worry about sub-Saharan Africa in between mindfulness training, a simulation of life as a Syrian refugee and an economic rationale for low taxes, these are comforting times to be alive.
Not that the worry cabinet is empty. As Mr. Trump and the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un continue to exchange insults and threats of nuclear Armageddon, no moment is fully insulated against dread.
The China trade war Mr. Trump has long promised could become reality as he grows frustrated with Beijing's reluctance to deny North Korea access to fuel.
Washington's continued renegotiation of Nafta could yield an impasse at seemingly any point, imperiling commerce among the United States, Canada and Mexico, and perhaps serving a shock to the global supply chain.
Though Europe appears far stronger than it did a year ago, a looming election in Italy could elevate the Five Star movement, a party that has been skeptical of the euro and the European Union.
A fragile leadership coalition in Germany, Europe's most powerful nation, has diminished the prospect of further European integration, rendering unlikely aspirations pursued by Mr. Macron for the creation of a finance minister for the 19 countries that use the euro along with a shared budget.
Britain's mode of exiting Europe is clearly aimed at protecting the status quo, yet acrimony within the governing Conservative party combined with perpetual misreading of the European political mood could derail all that. The year underway is supposed to see Britain and Europe negotiate the framework of their new trading arrangement, a fraught and complex undertaking in the best of circumstances. A rupture would cost treasure, given that nearly half of Britain's exports land in Europe.
Not least, the same sources of anger that built the populist wave are still operative, even if the political tenor has -- at least for the moment -- moderated.
While the global economic expansion has generated jobs in many major economies, wage gains remain weak. In Britain, typical workers are earning less than they did a decade ago, after accounting for the rising costs of housing, food and education.
In the United States, most workers have not had their pay climb in inflation-adjusted terms in more than four decades. Mr. Trump's lone major legislative achievement, the passage of a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts, is likely to exacerbate that by concentrating most of the spoils to wealthy households and corporations.
The Republican Party appears likely to trim spending on publicly financed health care for poor and older people as a way to cover the revenue lost from cutting corporate taxes.
At last year's World Economic Forum, the official agenda was full of conversations about how to reform capitalism to make it more bountiful for broader portions of the public. It was not a new conversation for Davos attendees, but it had gained urgency with the sense that the pitchforks were then massed at the palace gates.
The solutions discussed were short of items involving money changing hands. Some participants talked about the middle-class-restorative effects of sleep and meditation, as if the compulsion of wage earners to work second jobs reflected their failure to settle on the right brand of pillow.
Corporate executives with eight-figure compensation packages said that workers needed to take ownership of their own job training to earn more. Billionaire hedge fund managers suggested that the best way to make wages climb for working people was to cut taxes for the wealthiest.
If anyone was inclined to suggest that one way to address inequality might be for people with enormous amounts of money to share some with the less affluent via progressive taxation, they did not enjoy a prominent platform at Davos (or in Washington, as it turned out).
This year, the Davos agenda will again explore how to broaden the benefits of capitalism, under the banner "Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World." Discussions will focus on the future of work, the promises and pitfalls of automation, and the potential appeal of governments extending a so-called universal basic income, in which every citizen is guaranteed sustenance.
But the public-facing agenda is really just the wallpaper at Davos, a realm in which the world's largest financial institutions throw lavish dinners for clients in hotel ballrooms, where mergers are explored in private suites, where diplomacy is pursued, lucrative relationships are forged and pop bands entertain at parties underwritten by tech titans.
Everywhere in Davos, signs remind the assembled of the World Economic Forum's stated mission -- "Improving the State of the World."
But for those who make it to the mountaintop, things are already pretty good. Indeed, they may be better than ever.
All of which means that Davos is likely to present an especially raging party for those fortunate enough to attend this year.Those elsewhere on earth can be forgiven for wondering what all this lofty talk has to do with them.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead: TRADE
Nafta negotiations restart on a tighter deadline.
Negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States will gather in Montreal this week to try to hammer out a reworked North American Free Trade Agreement before Mexico's presidential election this summer. Mexico and Canada are expected to begin offering more counterproposals to the demands made by the United States, which the business community and Mexican and Canadian negotiators criticized as potentially harmful to the pact. In a Twitter post last week, President Trump mentioned the United States' trade deficit with Mexico and called Nafta "a bad joke." Ana Swanson
ECONOMY
Greece on finance ministers' agenda.
Aid to Greece will be one of the main topics when eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels on Monday. The ministers, collectively known as the Eurogroup, will receive an update on Greece's progress in meeting conditions for the financial support it has received from other eurozone countries. The meeting will be the first under the Eurogroup's new president, Mario Centeno of Portugal, who has promised to push for closer cooperation among eurozone countries on issues including dealing with troubled banks. Jack Ewing
BANKING
UBS kicks off bank earnings season in Europe.
The Swiss bank UBS will report its fourth-quarter results on Monday as earnings season kicks off for European lenders. Several of UBS's American counterparts took big fourth-quarter charges associated with changes in United States tax laws, including Goldman Sachs, which reported its first quarterly loss since 2011. Chad Bray
ECONOMY
Trump to be key speaker at World Economic Forum.
The world's financial elite gather in the Swiss ski resort of Davos for the annual World Economic Forum, beginning on Tuesday. This year's highest-profile attendee? President Trump, who rode to power on a populist wave. Last year, President Xi Jinping of China was the star of Davos, championing economic globalization in a speech widely seen as a coming-out party. Mr. Trump, by contrast, could use his appearance at Davos to trumpet the improving American economy, from the rise in the stock market to the low jobless rate. Prashant Rao
Bank of Japan expected to maintain the status quo.
The Bank of Japan will announce its monetary policy decision on Tuesday, and is expected to maintain its fiscal stimulus policies. With no change in policy expected, analysts will instead be looking at comments from the bank's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, for signs about when the current stimulus is likely to reduced -- a step that its counterparts in the United States and Europe have begun to take. Zach Wichter
MANUFACTURING
The question for General Electric: What's next?
When General Electric reports its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, the numbers from the recent past will matter far less than clarifying what lies ahead. Last week, G.E. announced a surprising $6.2 billion charge to pay for lingering problems in its finance unit. The new chief executive John Flannery suggested that the setback might accelerate his plan for paring back the struggling industrial giant. Steve Lohr
ECONOMY
Europe's Central Bank may offer clues on future of stimulus.
The surprising strength of the eurozone economy has raised questions about whether the European Central Bank will cut back its stimulus measures sooner than expected. As a result, Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, is likely to be grilled about the central bank's intentions on Thursday after a meeting of the Governing Council. In January, the central bank cut its money printing program in half, and has said it will keep up the stimulus at least through September. But statements by some members of the Governing Council have fed speculation that the program could end abruptly after that, setting the stage for interest rate increases in 2019. Jack Ewing
TRADE
Decisions expected on jets and solar products.
The White House faces a Friday deadline for a decision on whether to impose tariffs on foreign solar panels. American makers of the products say they have been devastated by cheap products from China, while others in the solar industry warn that restrictions on imports could raise the price of solar power and make the sector less competitive. The United States International Trade Commission will also cast its final vote on Thursday on a trade case that Boeing brought against the Canadian aircraft maker Bombardier. The trade case is a common one but in this instance it has been heavily politicized; the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain both weighed in on behalf of factories in their countries that help produce Bombardier jets or parts for them. Ana Swanson
Growth estimate may show strength of economy in Trump's first year.
The Commerce Department will release its initial estimate for economic growth for the final quarter of 2017 on Friday morning, and offer a preview of how much the economy grew in President Trump's first year in office. Both the second and third quarters of 2017 boasted gains of more than 3 percent on an annual basis. If that happens again, it would be the first time since before the recession that the economy registered three consecutive quarters of 3 percent annual growth. At the moment, most analysts don't expect that to happen. Wall Street is forecasting a 2.9 percent annual growth rate, adjusted for inflation, for the final three months of 2017. In any case, the meager growth rate of 1.2 percent for the first quarter of 2017 is almost certain to keep the full year's rate below 3 percent. Patricia Cohen

The View From the Bitcoin Bubble

Full text: Five years ago, I wrote my first article about virtual currencies, documenting the sizable stockpile of Bitcoins that the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, had amassed. At the time, I figured Bitcoin would be a flash in the pan, with roughly the life span of pet rocks or Furbys. But neither Bitcoin nor the Winklevii, as they're known, has withered under the unending stream of skepticism. The value of a single Bitcoin is now up more than 11,000 from when I wrote that first story, and the brothers have become billionaires, at least on paper.
I have continued writing about Bitcoin throughout its remarkable rise, but I could have never anticipated the way the technology has broken out over the past year, with everyone from Vladimir Putin to mom-and-pop investors in South Korea looking at how to use and profit from the technology.
(Most recently, I wrote about the enormous electricity consumption of the network of computers supporting Bitcoin, which now uses as much energy as some medium-sized countries.)
These developments have been enough to turn me, over the last year, into essentially a full-time cryptocurrency reporter. It's safe to say that's a first for The Times.
Before this all began, I was covering financial markets and banks from New York. That gave me a grounding to begin understanding this, but Bitcoin has turned into a very different kind of financial market At the banks, I kept hearing about how they were taking this technology seriously as something that might change their business in the long run. That is because beneath the digital tokens, Bitcoin introduced a new kind of crowdsourced financial infrastructure, known as the blockchain, that allows for the creation of money and financial records that aren't maintained by any central authority like a bank or a government.
Claims about Bitcoin's longevity differ dramatically. If you listen only to virtual currency aficionados, you would think that digital money is certain to dethrone the dollar as the global reserve currency and kill Wall Street, to boot. I get dozens of emails every day from entrepreneurs who tell me how they are going to use the technology introduced by Bitcoin to revolutionize the music industry, or shipping business, or even democracy itself. Meanwhile, very smart people like Warren Buffett and Joseph Stiglitz have continued to say that the whole thing is just a bubble waiting to burst.
How is a single journalist supposed to work through it all? It can feel a bit like being there at the invention of the stock market, but with no certainty that stocks would actually work as promised -- and with everything hinging on software that few people understand.
Certainly one part of this requires understanding the technical details of how Bitcoin and other digital tokens work. The time I've spent grappling with the inner workings of virtual currencies has given me a sense of why so many computer scientists see the Bitcoin network as real technological innovation and not just a token that people buy and sell. I have a good stable of geeks who help walk me through the details when I get confused. And when I go to dinner parties it comes in handy -- everyone these days wants to talk about how Bitcoin works and whether it is a bubble.
But from that first article about the Winklevoss twins, I have tried to focus, whenever possible, on the real people who are buying and using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, and what is motivating them. That has taken me to Argentina, where I saw how people are using virtual currencies to escape the inflation their local currency is experiencing. It has also led me to the online black markets, where virtual currencies have made it easier for addicts to buy deadly drugs from China and for criminals to collect ransom payments.
It is also the real-world usage that tests whether Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are able to live up to the big promises that they are making. With most virtual currency projects, I've found that there are relatively few real-world transactions to back up the big, speculative bets that investors are making.
Perhaps most fascinating is how these new currencies draw communities around them. It's a potent reminder that all money is a social construct: The more people who believe a Bitcoin or dollar will retain its value in a week, the greater the value the currency will have.
But these are still early days. The death of Bitcoin has been wrongfully proclaimed many times already. For my part, The Times's rules against investing in what we write about has allowed me to be equally open to this going up or down.
Beyond that, these virtual currencies are all living economics experiments, testing how different sorts of incentives create different behaviors. Bitcoin has an elaborate system of carrots and sticks designed to attract followers and to increase the cybersecurity of the Bitcoin network. But these incentives don't always work as expected. That uncertainty is what makes it so interesting to watch -- and to report on.

'Greatest Showman' Becomes a Sleeper Hit

Full text: Talk about a death-defying stunt. "The Greatest Showman," a musical about the circus impresario P.T. Barnum, was dismissed by many critics when it arrived in theaters just before Christmas. Uncool. Old-fashioned. Mawkish. And when initial ticket sales were poor, most box office analysts decided "The Greatest Showman" was a prime example of Hollywood being unable to pry people away from their Netflix accounts. Better stick to the superheroes and sequels.
Over the past four weeks, however, "The Greatest Showman" (20th Century Fox) has become a rare sleeper hit, lifted by positive word of mouth, stunt marketing (singalong screenings) and a popular soundtrack album. Ticket sales in the United States and Canada now stand at $113.5 million, including an $11 million haul between Friday and Sunday, good for fifth place over the weekend. The movie stars Hugh Jackman and Zendaya and was produced by a team that included Peter Chernin and Laurence Mark.
Similarly underappreciated movies dominated the weekend box office, with "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle" (Sony) leading the charge. Derided by most of Hollywood before its release as an act of desperation by a franchise-starved Sony, "Jumanji" was No. 1 for a third consecutive weekend, collecting about $20 million, for a new domestic total of $317 million. That astounding result is roughly in line with "Skyfall," the 2012 James Bond hit, after adjusting for inflation.
"Jumanji" is now closing in on $770 million worldwide.
Next came two new dramas -- critical duds both -- aimed at older men, a fickle group that studios rarely focus on anymore. (It's easier for studios to concentrate on family-oriented mega-movies because they are more likely to attract a global audience.) Surprise: Both did well.
"12 Strong," starring Chris Hemsworth and based on the nonfiction book "Horse Soldiers," about a Special Forces operation in Afghanistan after Sept. 11, sold about $16.5 million in tickets. It was produced for roughly $30 million by Alcon and Black Label Media, two companies backed by the FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith. Jerry Bruckheimer was also a producer.
"Den of Thieves" (STXfilms and Diamond Film Productions), which was independently financed for roughly $30 million, according to the trade news website Deadline.com, took in an estimated $15.3 million. Starring Gerard Butler and Jordan Bridges, "Den of Thieves" is about a grizzled Los Angeles cop who tracks a group of bank robbers.
Ahead of the announcement of Oscar nominations on Tuesday, several prestige-minded movies expanded into semi-wide release. Paul Thomas Anderson's "Phantom Thread" (Focus Features), starring Daniel Day-Lewis as a British dressmaker in the 1950s, did the best. It sold roughly $3.4 million in tickets at 896 theaters, for a new total of $6.2 million.
The darkly comedic Tonya Harding biopic "I, Tonya" (Neon) was close behind, collecting about $3 million in 799 theaters, for a total since arriving in limited release on Dec. 8 of $14.7 million.
And the gay romance "Call Me By Your Name" (Sony Pictures Classics) took in $1.5 million from 815 theaters, for a per-screen average of $1,847 and a total since arriving on Nov. 24 of $9.2 million.

Oil Prices Buoy Russia, Despite West's Sanctions

Full text: MOSCOW -- In Russia, as in Texas and other energy-dependent regions around the globe, a rising tide (of oil) lifts all boats. That helps explain why on Thursday, as four American senators asked the State Department and other government agencies to blacklist two senior officials, the Russian stock market rose.
It was not the prospect of more sanctions, of course, that was buoying the Moscow markets but the global price of oil, which has been soaring to heights not seen in several years.
"Sanctions are important, that is for sure, especially for the market and for debt and equity investors, but for G.D.P. and the life of ordinary Russians, oil is far more important," said Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Moscow, referring to Russia's gross domestic product.
Rising global oil prices, which hit a three-year peak last week above $70 a barrel, are brightening Russia's once gloomy outlook.
Goldman Sachs has forecast economic growth of 3.3 percent for 2018, well above even the government's own estimates. Consumer spending is picking up. Inflation has dropped to 2 percent, a level once unimaginable for Russia.
For years, Russian government officials have argued that the country's pariah status and Western sanctions were not having much effect.
But in a sign of how quickly Russia's economy has turned around, the country's economic development minister wound up this week actually trying to tamp down what he described as too-rosy expectations of a strong recovery, such as the one outlined in the forecast by Goldman.
"I think that, for now, there's no basis for such optimism," the minister, Maksim S. Oreshkin, told reporters at the Gaidar Forum, an annual economic conference in Moscow.
To be sure, nobody is predicting a return to the oil boom years, and sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United States and other nations have hobbled important state-owned companies and banks.
Yet the oil price rise in the first weeks of the year, if it persists, could shift the economic landscape for Russia and outweigh the ill effects of sanctions.
The price rise so far, for example, is outweighing any negative effects on the Russian economy from the threat of new sanctions from the United States for the Kremlin's election meddling.
In compliance with a law Congress passed last summer, the Treasury Department is expected to release on Jan. 29 a blacklist of Russian businessmen deemed close politically to President Vladimir V. Putin.
On Thursday, four Republican senators, Roger Wicker, Marco Rubio, Cory Gardner and Lindsey Graham, urged the State Department and other agencies to expand the blacklist with the inclusion of two senior business and government figures -- Alisher B. Usmanov, a metals magnate and onetime investor in Facebook, and Yuri Y. Chaika, Russia's prosecutor general.
But the global price of petroleum products like oil and natural gas, which account for about 50 percent of Russia's exports, has a greater sway over Russia's economy than sanctions imposed after the Ukraine crisis and meddling in the American election, economists say.
"Cheap loans are unavailable to most Russian companies," because of sanctions, Aleksander Y. Abramov, a professor at the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, said in a telephone interview. "But that is a midterm problem. In the short term, the rising oil prices are a factor for growth."
Also, Russia's economy grew last year despite a production-cutting agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. That deal remains in effect, but rising global oil prices suggest it could be unwound sometime this year, further helping Russia's economy.
In Russia, as in other petroleum-dependent countries, high oil prices have often proved to be a curse. With plenty of money, there is no incentive for the government to spur growth in nonnatural resource sectors, while the strong currency that comes with the influx of petrodollars makes it hard for other Russian industries to compete globally.
Historically, periods of low oil prices have been associated with market liberalization in Russia, beginning with the Soviet-era reforms of perestroika and glasnost under Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the 1980s and continuing with the introduction of a flat tax and other business-friendly measures at the turn of the century.
High oil prices, in contrast, have correlated with political repression and assertive foreign policy moves in Moscow, from the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 to the war in Georgia in 2008 and the intervention in Ukraine in 2014.
Unfortunately, from a Western perspective, that correlation seems to have broken down lately, with Mr. Putin steadfastly refusing to yield to Western pressures despite the three-year slump in oil prices.
The average Russian is expected to benefit from the oil price rise in one direct way. After the presidential election in March, the government was expected to announce an unpopular overhaul of the pension system that analysts say is necessary for longer-term growth. Russia currently has one of the world's lowest retirement ages, 55 for women and 60 for men. (At 71.87 years, it also has one of the developed world's lowest life expectancies.)
Under new rules, the retirement age for men and women was set to rise to 65. That now seems less likely, as the government is predicting a budget surplus.

Full text: Americans are warming to the Republican tax law, and becoming more confident in the economy as a whole. They just aren't sure that President Trump deserves much credit. The tax overhaul that Mr. Trump signed into law just before Christmas remains relatively unpopular and highly polarizing, according to a new poll conducted for The New York Times by SurveyMonkey. But support for the law has grown significantly over the past month, and more Americans believe that they will receive a tax cut. Forty-six percent of Americans strongly or somewhat approved of the law in early January, up from 37 percent when the bill was nearing passage in December.
At the same time, falling unemployment, accelerating economic growth and a surging stock market have made Americans increasingly positive about both their own finances and the overall economy. That could be good news for Republicans hoping to overcome Mr. Trump's unpopularity in the midterm elections.
Michael Moran, a recently retired business executive in Georgia, said the economy in his town an hour north of Atlanta was "red hot." The job market is so tight, he said, that he can't even find an electrical contractor to perform repairs on his house.
"There's help-wanted ads everywhere -- you see them on all the stores," Mr. Moran said. "In 2010, you could've just yelled out the door and had people lining up."
Mr. Moran said that he had initially been concerned that the president's shoot-from-the-hip style could be bad for financial markets and the economy. A year into his term, Mr. Moran still isn't a fan, but he said he was "pleasantly surprised" by Mr. Trump's stewardship of the economy. The corporate tax system was overdue for an overhaul, Mr. Moran said, and he applauded efforts to reduce regulations on businesses.
"I won't say that Trump deserves all the credit for that, but it is true that the economy just really picked up," said Mr. Moran, who described himself as a political moderate who leans Republican but voted for neither Mr. Trump nor his opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Over all, 42 percent of Americans believe the national economy is better than it was a year ago, according to the Times survey, which polled 10,509 adults in the first week of January. Only 23 percent believe the economy has gotten worse. And a broader measure of consumer confidence, which combines five questions on economic and financial conditions into a single index, rose significantly in January after remaining flat for most of 2017.
Ordinarily, such figures would bode well for Republicans heading into the midterm elections this fall. Most Americans, however, said Mr. Trump's policies had either hurt the economy or had little effect on it; only 38 percent said his policies had made it better.
"The overall story remains that the president is not getting credit for an economy that has been continuing on an upward trajectory," said Jon Cohen, vice president for survey research at SurveyMonkey.
Other recent surveys show public confidence in the economy is rising, but less movement on the tax bill. A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that two-thirds of Americans viewed the economy as excellent or good, up 3 percentage points from December. A Gallup poll published last week found that approval for the law had risen to 33 percent in January from 29 percent in December, an increase that was not statistically significant.
Supporters of the tax law dismissed its poor poll numbers in the fall, saying Americans would like it more once they began to see its benefits in their take-home pay. "The results are going to be what sells this bill," House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, told reporters in mid-December.
Many Americans won't start to see more money in their paychecks until February, because the Internal Revenue Service issued new tax withholding guidance only last week. But a series of high-profile announcements, from companies such as Walmart and Wells Fargo, have cited the tax bill in decisions to raise wages or give employees one-time bonuses.
Many analysts, however, say the pay increases were more a result of the strong labor market than the tax law. A Morgan Stanley survey of Wall Street analysts released on Tuesday found that only 22 percent expected the companies they follow to direct at least some of their tax savings to employee compensation. By contrast, 83 percent of analysts said companies would increase share buybacks, dividends or merger activity. (Analysts could select multiple responses.)
Still, the law, which cut taxes for businesses and individuals while eliminating many deductions and credits, isn't particularly popular. Forty-nine percent of Americans in the Times survey said they disapproved of it, and far more people said they were strongly opposed to it than strongly in favor. And deep political divisions are evident: 86 percent of Republicans approve of the law, but just 13 percent of Democrats do.
Most Americans still don't think they will see their taxes go down under the new law. According to the survey, 41 percent of Americans expect a tax cut this year, up from 33 percent in December. Most independent analyses estimate that three-quarters or more of households will receive a tax cut in 2018, although those cuts are set to expire after 2025.
Doug Leichliter, a retiree in western Pennsylvania, questioned the wisdom of a big tax cut at a time when unemployment is already low, saying he worried that it could lead to inflation. And he said he doubted that middle-class Americans would see much benefit in any case.
"I think everybody's going to see a little bump, but the vast majority of the money is going to go to the 1 percent," Mr. Leichliter said. "I don't necessarily think the money's going to trickle down."
About the Survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 10,509 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Jan. 1 to Jan. 5. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.

Full text: Apparently the plan to Make America Great Again will let some Americans die. Kentucky rushed last week to become the first of the nation's 50 states to impose a work requirement on recipients of Medicaid. Under the state's HEALTH plan, most able-bodied 19-to-64-year-olds -- excluding the pregnant, the medically frail and some others -- will have to work, get job training or perform community service for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for coverage, starting in July.
They will have to pay for it, too -- a premium starting at $1 per month for families living on up to one-quarter of the federal poverty line, or about $400 a month for a family of three (such families exist, apparently) and rising to $15 for those who manage to stay above the poverty threshold.
The initiative is, of course, not about saving the state money by pushing poor people off the insurance rolls. It is providing moral education. In the words of Gov. Matt Bevin, the HEALTH plan will free Kentuckians from the "dead-end entitlement trap" and give them "a path forward and upward" so they can fend for themselves.
But the fact remains that the plan is expected to reduce Medicaid spending by $2.4 billion over five years. Roughly half of the 350,000 able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries in Kentucky currently do not meet the work requirements, by the government's estimates, and could lose their benefits. Five years from now, the Bevin administration calculates, the change will have culled some 100,000 people from the rolls.
Kentucky won't be the last. Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin have already submitted their own similar proposals. Barring legal challenges, the Trump administration is eager to let them do it. Millions of Americans stand at risk of losing their health care. Many -- the most fragile, the least great -- could die as a result.
Mr. Bevin might care to glance south over the border. In 2005, Tennessee removed 170,000 people -- almost one in 10 Medicaid beneficiaries in the state, mainly working-age adults without children -- from its Medicaid program to save money. They didn't do well.
The cuts didn't just eat into poor Tennesseans' finances. One study found that childless adults in Tennessee -- especially the least educated -- started delaying or forgoing visits to the doctor. They reported suffering more days in bad health and incapacitated. And they recorded more visits to hospital emergency rooms, which are required by law to care for all comers, regardless of their ability to pay.
Delayed care can kill. Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among women. One of eight American women will get it. Detecting it early is critical. Specifically, the five-year relative survival rate for localized breast cancer is 98.5 percent when detected early, but only 25 percent when detected at a distant stage. Waiting for 60 days or longer to get treatment raises the risk of dying of breast cancer over five years by 85 percent.
Another study from Tennessee found that losing access to Medicaid led to delays in diagnosis, so more breast cancers were caught at a later stage. Women who lived in low-income ZIP codes were 3.3 percentage points more likely to receive a diagnosis of late-stage cancer than women living in high-income ZIP codes.
"We are ready to show America how this can and will be done," Mr. Bevin said at a news conference in Frankfort. And yet Kentucky's approach to Medicaid draws from a well-worn playbook, one from which both Republicans and Democrats have drawn to trim the social safety net over the years.
Kentucky was an eager participant in the last big so-called entitlement reform, visited upon the nation's poor just over two decades ago. Under that 1996 program directed at welfare benefits, the entitlement to federal assistance was replaced by a hodgepodge of programs managed by the states and financed by a fixed dollop of federal cash. Work requirements became the norm. And people got less help.
The number of families in poverty in Kentucky has budged little since then, declining to 116,000 from 132,000. But the number of families getting cash assistance has fallen by two-thirds. Today, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program covers only one of five poor families in the state. For a single mother with two children, it provides $262 a month -- a third less than it did two decades ago, adjusted for inflation.
And Kentucky is hardly the stingiest state. In 15 states, antipoverty cash benefits reach fewer than 10 percent of the families with children in poverty. In all of them, the change was sold as a way to encourage poor Americans to get off their backsides, get a job and prosper on their own -- free of the clutches of the welfare state. Yet though it pushed many poor families into employment, it failed at mitigating their distress: Rarely do such families' breadwinners earn enough to move out of poverty.
The problem with the latest twist in Republicans' effort to pare the social safety net is that removing the poor's health insurance may not just make their life more difficult.
It might kill them.
It is well known by now that health insurance saves lives. A review of recent research in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that the odds of dying for non-elderly adults are between 3 and 41 percent higher for the uninsured than for the insured.
Work by Katherine Baicker, now at the University of Chicago, with Benjamin Sommers and Arnold Epstein at Harvard found that Medicaid expansions in the past significantly reduced mortality. Their research, they concluded, "suggests that 176 additional adults would need to be covered by Medicaid in order to prevent one death per year."
It doesn't take a leap of imagination to figure out what might happen if 100,000 people were to lose their coverage.
As Lawrence H. Summers, once President Barack Obama's top economic adviser, noted about the Republican tax cut passed in December, thousands would die if the tax bill were to cut the health insurance of 13 million people, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated.
These would be mostly lower-income Americans. Maybe they would be people from Kentucky -- the state with the most cancer deaths and the most preventable hospitalizations, 45th out of 50 in the incidence of diabetes and 47th in terms of heart disease.
Would their deaths cause America to be greater?

Tech Giants' Rise Gives Rebalancing a New Appeal

Full text: Index-based investing is appealing partly because it promises to simplify decision-making. Buy a fund that tracks a major index like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and you can sit back knowing you don't have to switch in and out of sectors and stocks. You own a balanced portfolio that should perform well in all sorts of market conditions.
But do you really?
If you think you're protected from market swings by holding index-based investments, think again.
The central story of 2017's thundering bull market was the relentless advance of shares of fast-growing companies, particularly in the technology industry. The so-called Faang stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) rose so far so fast that index-based investments that were once balanced now seem top-heavy with risky highfliers. Faang stocks made up just 6 percent of the S.&.P. 500 in 2013. By the end of last year, they accounted for 12.3 percent, noted Joe Abbott, chief quantitative strategist with Yardeni Research.
Over all, large growth stocks soared 25.4 percent in 2017. Large value stocks, whose earnings and revenue grow more slowly and which are typically cheaper by such metrics as price-to-earnings ratio, tacked on 12.6 percent.
So is now the time to rebalance by adding value and trimming growth?
For investors with long horizons, "rebalancing is an excellent strategy," said Chris Brightman, chief investment officer for Research Affiliates. "Wealth is built long term with periodic rebalancing," he added.
One way to offset the heavy weighting of tech stocks in exchange-traded funds and index funds that reflect market advances is through an index like the Guggenheim Equal Weight S.&.P. 500 E.T.F., Mr. Brightman said. Equal weight indexes own the same amount of all stocks and so are not overexposed to market highfliers. Over the last decade, the S.&.P. 500 Equal Weight index has returned just over 10 percent annually, while the market-cap-weighted S.&.P. 500. has returned less than 9 percent annually.
Tom Galvin is lead manager of the Columbia Select Large Cap Growth fund. Though his mandate requires holding growth companies, he has been lightening up on some highfliers. "We have been trimming back some of the winners," Mr. Galvin said. The fund has sold off roughly 20 percent of its Amazon stock and roughly one-third of its position in Facebook, he said.
Still, Mr. Galvin emphasizes that the tech rabbits have raced ahead largely because they've met or exceeded expectations. Apple's year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Apple cited its revived strength in China, along with better-than-expected unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs, in its most recent quarterly report.
Similarly, a year ago, analysts expected Facebook to earn about $4 a share over the next 12 months, Mr. Galvin said. But Facebook succeeded so well in making its gigantic membership an audience for ads, it earned over $5 a share in the last four quarters.
Growth stocks may also have fared well because they are suited to current economic conditions. "I think growth stocks do very well in a low-inflation environment, when pricing power is elusive and therefore unit growth is the key driver to profit growth," Mr. Galvin said. There is a flip side, though: "If you felt strongly we were moving to a sustained reflationary environment, you'd want more value," he added.
Sebastien Page, head of the Global Multi-Asset division within T. Rowe Price, also sees merit in increasing value holdings. "As a general statement, value should benefit more than growth from the tax cut," he said. Financial companies, typically considered value stocks, pay relatively high taxes and will benefit from a tax cut.
But because the market has risen almost nonstop since 2009, value stocks are also fairly expensive, some argue. "You don't want to buy your beaten down, distressed deep value stocks," said Mike Fleisher, lead portfolio manager of the Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value fund. "You want to buy a value stock with a catalyst."
Mr. Fleisher cited Citigroup as a worthwhile stock. "They're buying back shares," he noted. "Our quantitative research finds that when a company has bought back shares over the previous 12 months, it tends to outperform the next 12 months," he said.
For investors disinclined to pick through hundreds of stocks to find the right value catalyst, there is another way to rebalance. Mr. Page of T. Rowe Price favors stocks in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada. "Non-U.S. stocks have only been this cheap relative to U.S. stocks 7 percent of the time in the last 15 years," he explained. Two E.T.F.s that invest in such developed market stocks are the iShares MSCI EAFE E.T.F. and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets E.T.F.
Mr. Brightman also favors rebalancing across more than just the growth-value axis. "Every sector of the U.S. stock market is expensive," he said. "The fascination of the public with a narrow group of tech stocks is beginning to look a little bubbly."
So-called value stocks are also no bargain, he said. "You will not escape a bear market by being in value stocks," Mr. Brightman said.
The market won't necessarily decline simply because prices are high, he added. "It just means over the longer term you would get lower returns," he said.
Mr. Brightman urges very broad diversification. He includes United States equities, other developed market equities, emerging market stocks, real estate investment trusts, commodities and government bonds.
"If you have a long horizon, equal weighting and rebalancing are your friends," he said.

Full text: The prospect of a strong economy in the United States and a strengthening one in much of the rest of the world is good news for workers and for many companies. But for bond investors, it is a headache. "We're not of the view that there is any sector that stands out as extremely cheap on a valuation basis," said Ashok Bhatia, senior portfolio manager in Neuberger Berman's Fixed Income Multi-Sector Group.
Yet in 2017, many investors turned to bonds anyway. Nearly $380 billion found its way into bond funds, nearly double the flow into stock funds, according to the Investment Company Institute.
That makes a certain amount of sense in Year 9 of a bull market that has lifted the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index more than 370 percent since the 2009 low. When stocks seem risky, core bonds are safer havens.
But despite a recent surge, bond yields are still fairly low and don't scream opportunity, either. The Vanguard Total Bond Index, the largest index portfolio, has a yield of about 2.5 percent. The actively managed Dodge & Cox Income fund had a recent yield of 2.75 percent And investors are getting paid less to take on risk. The 5.6 percent yield of the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond E.T.F. is nearly half a percentage point lower than a year ago.
What's worse, if the economy remains strong, there is a good chance that yields will move higher. That is a problem for fixed-income investors because rising bond yields mean falling bond prices. For people holding bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, total return is a combination of yield and price. It all makes it less likely that core bond funds -- those that focus on high-quality securities -- will be able to match the 3.7 percent average gain for 2017, which was 1.5 percentage points ahead of the inflation rate.
"We are in a transition market," Mr. Bhatia said.
As evidence, consider that the difference between short and long-term rates is less than it has been since 2007. In bond market parlance, the yield curve has flattened.
Why has this happened? Shorter rates are being pulled upward by the Federal Reserve from the near-zero level that the Fed instituted during the financial crisis.
Longer term rates, on the other hand, are constrained by the expectation that inflation will remain very low in 2018.
Rick Rieder, global chief investment officer of Fixed Income at BlackRock, says inflation could surprise the market next year. It is possible that a falling unemployment rate at a time of solid economic growth could put ample pressure on wages that would, in turn, raise inflation off the floor. "I think we can get to 2 percent," Mr. Rieder said. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure has crawled along below 1.5 percent since the financial crisis.
A 2 percent inflation rate would most likely just nudge long-term rates higher, he said, adding that he expects a "slow and low trajectory" for long-term rates. His base case is that the 10-year Treasury rate, now at about 2.5 percent, won't rise much beyond 2.7 percent.
Unless inflation surges unexpectedly, a 3 percent yield for the 10-year Treasury note may not be likely. Julien Scholnick, a fixed income manager at Western Asset Management, which manages $435 billion in global bond portfolios, notes that a year ago, the 10-year Treasury bill rose briefly to 2.6 percent. And that was after the surprise election of Donald J. Trump spurred an expectation of quick stimulus materializing through tax changes, infrastructure spending and regulatory easing.
"We don't see higher inflation as probable," in 2018, Mr. Scholnick said. With an expectation that long-term rates will not venture far from current levels, the Western Asset Core Plus Bond fund currently has an average duration -- a measure of risk to changing interest rates -- that is slightly higher than the six-year norm for the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index.
Shifting economic and market dynamics in 2018 may raise the value of small tweaks to basic bond portfolios.
The high-quality United States bonds in the aggregate bond index will deliver on their main purpose in your 401(k): When stocks falter, these bonds will hold their ground, and they may even rally. But the aggregate index will also be very sensitive to Federal Reserve interest rate increases, as 37 percent of the index is invested in Treasuries and another 27 percent in government agency bonds.
Mr. Bhatia at Neuberger Berman recommends adding high-quality corporate bonds, which will not be as sensitive to rising rates as government bonds. The flattening yield curve makes short-term issues attractive; you get a solid yield without the higher volatility of a fund invested in longer-term bonds. The 2.5 percent recent yield for the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond Index fund is about half a percentage point more than the yield for comparable short-term Treasuries.
The recently enacted tax package could also be a moderate benefit for corporate bonds. With a lower corporate tax rate, businesses are expected to bring more foreign earnings home, increasing the cash available to pay for dividends and share repurchases. That could mean the supply of new corporate bonds will shrink a bit, as companies lose some appetite for issuing debt to bolster shareholder returns.
Basic math suggests that there is less reason to invest in lower quality corporate bonds. Kathy A. Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, points out that high-yield bonds pay about 3.4 percentage points more than similar maturity Treasury issues, in contrast to the 5.4-percentage-point spread investors have typically been paid for taking on the risk of junk bonds. That's not much compensation, given that junk bonds tend to behave a lot like stock in bad markets.
Investors who enjoyed the strong 6 percent return for multisector bond funds in 2017 should take note that on average, more than one-third of the assets of these go-anywhere bond funds is invested in junk bonds, according to Morningstar.
Mr. Scholnick says Western Asset Management has reduced its high-yield holdings and increased its investment in bank loans. These securities are a form of low-quality corporate bonds with two compelling value propositions over standard junk bonds. In the event of a default, bank loan investors are paid before regular bond investors. In addition, the interest rate on bank loans fluctuates along with a benchmark index, such as the London Interbank Offer Rate, or Libor, and prospects for an increase are viewed as good.
Emerging market bonds may be the best relative value for bond investors these days, considering that in many countries, economies are growing, inflation is low and central bank policy is reasonably strong.
"In the past, it was emerging markets that held all the debt, but now all the debt is in Japan, Europe and the U.S.," said Mr. Rieder of BlackRock. In 2018, the best opportunities for positive returns after accounting for inflation could be in emerging markets.
Emerging markets also are often more volatile. So for less adventuresome investors, money market funds may be appealing. The Federal Reserve's rate increases are slowly pushing these yields off zero. Mr. Bhatia says such funds will probably pay 1.5 to 2 percent by the end of this year.
Even if the returns in money market funds are low, you are paid something to park your money on the sidelines while waiting for sell-offs in bonds and stocks to present better prices to reinvest.
"Suddenly, it's an asset class to consider," he said.

Full text: TUNIS -- The authorities in Tunisia have arrested nearly 800 people who were protesting tax increases and other government policies after a series of clashes with the police. The arrests have alarmed observers of Tunisia, the only country to emerge from the turmoil of the Arab Spring with a semblance of a stable democracy. Although some of those who were arrested were released, the number of detentions drew criticism from human rights groups.
"We're concerned about the high number of arrests," Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said Friday in Geneva. "Some 778 people we understand have now been arrested since Monday, and around a third of those arrested were between the ages of 15 and 20."
He added: "We call on the authorities to ensure that people are not arrested in an arbitrary manner and that all those detained are treated with full respect for their due process rights and are either charged or promptly released."
Three local leaders of the Popular Front, the main leftist opposition party, were detained in the town of Gafsa, reportedly because they were suspected of vandalism. The party said its leaders had been targeted in a political campaign that was "reproducing the methods of the oppressive Ben Ali regime," a reference to Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the dictator who was toppled in 2011. The party's office in El Aroussa was vandalized.
The protests, which began on Monday, have been largely aimed at a series of austerity measures and tax increases that went into effect on Jan. 1 and have quickly rippled through the economy, which is plagued by high inflation and high unemployment.
Although the protests appeared to be ebbing on Friday, there were calls for new political agitation on Sunday -- the seventh anniversary of Mr. Ben Ali's overthrow.
The police remained out in force in Tunis. There were several scuffles. Mayssa Oueslati, a woman from Tunis, shoved a police officer, telling him to leave her alone. She said he had told her, "We know you from before -- be careful."
She said the police were practicing familiar tactics of intimidation: "We know their ways, how they watch us when we go in a cafe or just protest. There is a gap between policemen and the youth. You can see it in how they treat soccer fans in stadiums, not just with protesters."
Several of the protesters marched on Friday under the slogan "What Are We Waiting For?"
Amna Guellali, a Tunisia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the number of police officers was very high compared to the number of protesters, and expressed concern about whether the protesters had adequate freedom of movement.
In a news release, Reporters Without Borders said that journalists covering the protests had been intimidated, including a French reporter who was taken from his home and escorted to a police precinct for questioning. The police asked him for the contacts of journalists in Tebourba, a site of protests. (The reporter refused, and was released.)
One death has been attributed to the protests, that of Khomsi el-Yerfeni, who died Monday in Tebourba. Onlookers said that he might have been struck by a police car, but the authorities said that he was not hit and that he had suffered from chronic shortness of breath. An autopsy has been conducted but not yet released.
With its relatively stable democracy, Tunisia has been a rare success story following the Arab Spring uprisings that began here in 2010 and soon spread to Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain and other nations.
The International Crisis Group, an organization committed to preventing and resolving deadly conflicts, warned in a report on Thursday that the achievements of Tunisia's revolution risked being overshadowed by political tensions and a nostalgia for strong, centralized government.
The group added: "Tunisia has a special responsibility to stand up to this tendency, to avoid new jihadist violence, to prevent a return to political polarization and to sustain its role as the sole Arab state sticking to a peaceful, more democratic course since the 2011 Arab Uprisings."
The group urged the strengthening of Tunisia's political institutions, the creation of a constitutional court and the establishment of independent oversight bodies and called for long-delayed local elections to be held this year.
But the unrest in Tunisia has both political and economic dimensions. While a group of Tunisian organizations were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 for helping to manage the country's transition to democracy, reviving the economy has been far more difficult.
There are also big regional differences. In towns like Thala, the dominant concerns are the economic despair of young people grappling with high inflation and a lack of jobs; in the more affluent capital, Tunis, young protesters have been focusing on reforms in governing.

Markets Brush Off the Year's First Wobble to Return to Record Highs

Full text: Stocks in the United States brushed aside their first wobble of the year and got back to setting records on Thursday. Energy stocks led the way after the price of oil touched its highest level since 2014. The gains for indexes marked a return to calm, after a whiff of nervousness wafted through markets a day earlier as interest rates rose. After rates held steady on Thursday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index marked its seventh gain in the last eight days.
The S.&P. 500 rose 19.33 points, or 0.7 percent, to a record 2,767.56. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 205.60 points, or 0.8 percent, to 25,574.73, the Nasdaq composite gained 58.21 points, or 0.8 percent, to 7,211.78.
Optimism about a strengthening global economy and growing corporate profits have helped propel markets even though stocks have become more expensive than they have historically been relative to earnings.
The market's smooth ride upward hit a bump Wednesday when worries rose that a jump in interest rates could derail the ascent. Rates have been ultra-low since the Great Recession, a culmination of a decline in bond yields over the last three-plus decades.
"Everyone's on edge about waiting for what's to come," even though central banks have promised to take a slow path toward higher rates, said Marina Severinovsky, investment strategist at Schroders.
"There shouldn't be a falling-off-the-cliff mentality, but we're so primed," she said. "We're 30 years into this, waiting for the trigger."
Rates retreated on Thursday after China's foreign exchange regulator challenged a report that had helped drive up yields, which said China may slow or halt purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds. A United States government report on Thursday also showed that inflation was weaker on the wholesale level last month than economists expected.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.54 percent from 2.56 percent late Wednesday. It had climbed as high as 2.59 percent on Wednesday.
While a quick jump in rates could easily jolt markets out of the calm ride they have been on, investors say markets are prepared for a gradual rise.
"We're all anticipating rising rates, and have been for some time," Severinovsky said. "Given where global growth is, we should have higher rates than we do today."
Energy stocks were the day's biggest stars after the price of oil touched its highest price in more than three years. Benchmark United States crude gained 23 cents to settle at $63.80 per barrel after earlier climbing as high as $64.77. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 6 cents to $69.26 per barrel.
That helped drive energy stocks in the S.&P. 500 to a 2 percent gain, the largest among the 11 sectors that make up the index. They are at their highest level since the end of 2016.
Anadarko Petroleum had one of the biggest gains in the index after jumping $3.09, or 5.6 percent, to $58.50.
The stock market has repeatedly shrugged off concerns through its placid ride to records. Whether investors are worried about a pickup in rates or about how stocks have become expensive, any dip for the market over the last year has been shallow and short.
The next test for markets may arrive in coming weeks as companies report how much profit they made at the end of 2017.
Businesses will need to produce strong growth to justify their stocks' gains, and expectations are also high that chief executives will unveil encouraging profit forecasts for 2018 after Washington cut their income-tax rates.
The dollar dipped to 111.09 Japanese yen from 111.35 late Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.2036 from $1.1957, and the British pound rose to $1.3536 from $1.3509.
Gold gained $3.20 to settle at $1,320.60 per ounce.

Investors Fear End Of Binge On Bonds

Full text: For nearly a decade, central banks around the world have been the biggest buyers of bonds, sending interest rates plummeting and stock markets soaring. Now, investors are starting to worry about what would happen if the richest nations start to scale back on a buying binge that most of them began to stimulate economies hurt by the global financial crisis.
The most immediate fear: A sharp falloff in bond prices would rattle equity markets that are now trading at record highs. Beyond that, there is a looming concern that as the global economy heats up, inflation, a bond investor's main worry, will start to inch up, fed by higher wage demands on the part of workers everywhere.
"Your largest investor might be stepping back, that's what spooked people," said John Briggs, a bond strategist at NatWest Markets. "The market is very vulnerable to any change in supply and demand."
That vulnerability has been on display in recent weeks, with many investors selling out of their bond positions, pushing the yield -- which rises as bond prices fall -- on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury bill up to a high of 2.59 percent on Wednesday from 2.3 late last year.
Bond markets appeared to be further spooked on Wednesday by a report that China's central bank, which owns $1.2 trillion in United States Treasury bonds, may be poised to slow or even halt its buying of United States debt. China has total reserves of just over $3 trillion.
Yields on 10-year Treasury notes climbed in early trading, and the dollar weakened at the prospect of lessened demand tied to a selling of United States bonds by a large holder like China. The rising yields led Bill Gross of Janus Henderson, whose renown as a bond investor came to define the multidecade bull market for fixed-income securities, to pronounce the start of a bear market for bonds, although he said on Wednesday that he did not foresee drastic losses.
Officials at the agency that manages China foreign reserves on Thursday issued a statement that media reports about suspending purchases of Treasuries "may quote the wrong source of information, or may be fake information."
Analysts do not believe that the country, which under President Xi Jinping has taken pride in its standing as an elite member of the club of wealthy nations, would rashly unload the securities it has amassed over the years.
Not only would such a step hurt China by decreasing the value of its bond holdings, it would wreak havoc in a global economy that the country is now fully integrated into through deep trade and financial links.
To some experts, a move by China to pull back on its bond-buying could simply be seen as responsible-reserve management by one of the world's richest central banks. "The boring explanation here is that China just has enough Treasuries in its portfolio," said Brad Setser, an expert in global capital flows at the Council on Foreign Relations.
But there is another interpretation that gets at the simmering tensions between the United States and China over North Korea and trade. "It is possible too that China wants to signal to its people that it will not keep financing the U.S. when the U.S. is not treating China with respect," Mr. Setser said.
There is also a belief among many economists that the tax cuts recently signed into law by President Trump could worsen the United States' financial position and make its debt less attractive as an investment.
For now, investors appear to have accepted the benign view. Major stock indexes in the United States were down only slightly on Wednesday, and the VIX index, which measures investor expectations of a sharp market move in the future, remained just over 10, a very low level.
Nevertheless, the mere thought that China might choose to unload some of its Treasuries fed broader concerns about how the markets react as central banks in the United States, Japan and Europe normalize policies adopted to prop up faltering economies.
All told, the three central banks are sitting on $14 trillion in securities they have bought since 2009: a $4.4 trillion mix of Treasuries and mortgage securities held by the Federal Reserve; the European Central Bank's $5 trillion in corporate and government bonds; and $4.5 trillion worth of bonds and exchange traded funds accumulated by the Bank of Japan.
Moreover, the view that the United States government, in the wake of the tax cut package, will have to issue more securities to finance a larger budget deficit is giving bond investors pause.
"The U.S. is about to issue a whole lot more debt in an environment where the demand for that debt is about to go down," said Daniel W. Drezner, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. "What that means is interest rates are about to go up."
And that is bad news for bond investors.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In the wake of a deep economic crisis and a disappointingly slow recovery, a growing number of experts, including some Federal Reserve officials, say it is time for the Fed to consider a new approach to managing the economy. Since the mid-1990s, the Fed has focused on keeping inflation slow and steady, at about 2 percent a year, in the belief that it was the best way to nurture economic growth and avoid painful downturns. Those pushing for a new approach do not agree on the best alternative -- the ideas range from minor tweaks to tossing the current rule book -- but there is broad agreement that the Fed should seize the moment now, before the next crisis hits.
"Monetary policy has not been as successful as we might like over the last decade," Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said this weekend at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia. "Now really is the time for every monetary economist to say, 'Is there something better?"'
The stakes are high: The Fed pursues its goals by raising and lowering borrowing costs to influence economic growth and stability. Effective management allows the economy to prosper: Employment grows, wages rise and people enjoy better standards of living. Mistakes cause recessions.
The Fed has faced questions about its methods in the decade since the 2008 crisis, but in recent weeks, officials have shown a willingness to welcome the debate. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said it was time to talk about approach because the Fed is finally wrapping up its response to the last crisis, which entailed unprecedented steps to lower borrowing costs and get financial markets moving.
"The right timing of this debate is really now because the U.S. economy has fully recovered from this recession," Mr. Williams said.
Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, told attendees at the economics gathering in Philadelphia that there was an urgent need for more and better research on the available alternatives.
"The most important issue on the table right now is that we need to consider the possibility of a new economic normal that forces us to re-evaluate our targets," he said. "It is a question for the profession itself, and we do need people thinking about this."
The Fed's current approach is known as inflation targeting. It works in large part by training the public to expect a certain level of inflation, disciplining the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage demands of workers. It is, in other words, a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The Fed announced in January 2012 that it would seek to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, formalizing its implicit target since the mid-1990s.
The rise of inflation targeting reflected a consensus among academics and policymakers that central banks did not have direct control over broader economic performance but did exercise direct control over inflation, and that keeping inflation low and stable was the best way to support growth.
Most central banks in developed nations similarly target a low rate of inflation, taking the view that unpredictable increases in prices are economically disruptive. The European Central Bank, for example, aims to keep inflation "below, but close to" 2 percent.
But the Fed's focus on inflation in the real economy did not prevent asset prices like mortgage-backed bonds from soaring to unsustainable heights before 2008, and concern about keeping inflation low limited the scope of its post-crisis stimulus campaign.
Moreover, the combination of low inflation and modest growth has left the Fed with very little room to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. During past downturns, the Fed lowered rates by an average of five percentage points. But the Fed's benchmark rate currently sits in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. That would make cutting the rate a less effective tool than in previous firefights.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's outgoing chairwoman, has emphasized that the Fed has other weapons in its arsenal. After 2008, the Fed bought large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage bonds and promised to keep interest rates low for years at a time, encouraging borrowing by businesses and consumers.
Ms. Yellen is expected to be succeeded by Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor who is awaiting Senate confirmation as the next Fed chairman.
Some outside economists say the Fed is putting a brave face on a bad situation.
"We are living in a singularly brittle context in which we do not have a basis for assuming that monetary policy will be able as rapidly as possible to lift us out of the next recession," said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary.
The proposed alternatives to inflation targeting can be sorted into two categories. The first contains one simple idea: The Fed should permanently embrace higher inflation. The second is full of complicated ideas for temporarily embracing higher inflation during downturns.
Olivier Blanchard, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who began his term as president of the American Economic Association at the Philadelphia meeting, said the choice of a 2 percent target had no particular economic logic to recommend it. Raising the target to 4 percent would give the Fed more room to operate without significantly larger economic costs, he said.
Many economists, however, are wary of the simple solution.
Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, has warned that the costs of dropping a new anchor would be significant. On Monday, at a Brookings Institution conference convened to discuss alternatives to the 2 percent target, Mr. Bernanke dismissed a 4 percent target as politically untenable.
"The Fed is not going to adopt a 4 percent inflation target," he said. "It's just not going to happen."
But Mr. Bernanke has added his name to the list of those seeking an alternative to the current system. Last year, he proposed that the Fed should announce that it would temporarily tolerate higher inflation during future economic recoveries.
A mechanized version of that idea, popular in some academic circles, would instruct the Fed to target an alternative economic measure, nominal gross domestic product, or N.G.D.P., which sums inflation and real economic growth. Under a 4 percent N.G.D.P. target, for example, the Fed would aim for a combination of inflation and growth that equaled 4 percent, such as 2 percent inflation and 2 percent growth. During a period of lower inflation, like the last decade, such a target would require the Fed to dictate more aggressive stimulus.
Some are skeptical that the Fed can improve the economy by trying harder. Atif Mian, an economist at Princeton University, has argued in his research that high levels of household debt are limiting the impact of monetary policy because many households cannot or will not continue borrow.
"There is this implicit assumption that things will have traction if you just push hard enough," Mr. Mian said. "But what is the mechanism through which this will raise actual G.D.P.?"
Indeed, the Fed and other central banks have not even succeeded in hitting their 2 percent targets in recent years, for reasons that remain unclear. Inflation in the United States has been below that level for the last six years, although most Fed policymakers continue to predict that higher inflation is around the corner.
Ms. Romer said more ambitious targets might encourage central banks to try harder to stimulate inflation.
In practice, she said, the Fed could have purchased more Treasuries and mortgage bonds as part of its response to the crisis, or even engaged in direct lending to businesses.
"We should not just assume that what we've done for the last 25 years is right," she said.

Full text: For ordinary Iranians, the great promise of the 2015 nuclear deal was economic revival. International sanctions would be lifted, foreign investment would flow and the standard of living, crippled by years of ostracism by the United States and its partners, would rise, allowing Iran to once again flourish. That hasn't happened, or at least not the way Iranians expected, thus producing conditions that helped make the recent protests -- the most serious since 2009 -- possible. Over two weeks, thousands of Iranians in more than 80 cities took to the streets to denounce high unemployment, inflation, corruption and the government's habit of spending money on foreign wars while cutting programs at home.
As the unrest unfolded, President Trump blamed the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated under President Barack Obama because it required the United States to put millions of dollars back into the hands of a repressive government -- money that belonged to Iran but was frozen after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and returned when Iran curbed its nuclear program.
It's more plausible that by raising expectations for a better life, the deal opened Iranians' eyes and made them less tolerant when the government fell short.
The deal has had a beneficial effect. The economy grew by 7 percent in 2016 and was expected to do so again in 2017, a far cry from the 9 percent shrinkage in the two years before March 2014, when modest sanctions relief took effect. Oil production is nearly at pre-sanctions levels, foreign companies are making new energy investments and Boeing has received orders for commercial aircraft.
Nevertheless, growth and investment aren't doing enough to meet the needs of a population mainly too young to remember the Islamic Revolution.
While low oil prices are a big factor in Iran's failure to rebound, so are corruption, mismanagement, a weak banking system, a failure to curb money laundering, a flawed rule of law and a record of human rights abuses, including arrests of American-Iranian businessmen, that make foreign companies reluctant to do business there. The hard-line Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and various religious institutions, which control much of the economy, are major impediments to reform.
Now that some 22 people have been killed and at least 1,000 detained, the anti-government protests may be petering out without a clear indication of whether they will have a lasting impact. They certainly aren't the end of the struggle among Iranian hard-liners, determined to maintain rigid Islamic laws that dictate how people should live; moderates like President Hassan Rouhani, who advocate social liberalization and engagement with the West; and now, assuming the protesters stay engaged, an angry working class.
On Monday, Mr. Rouhani came to the protesters' defense, saying they objected not just to a weak economy but also to widespread corruption and the clerical government's strict policies on personal conduct and freedoms. "One cannot force one's lifestyle on the future generations," he said in remarks reported by the semiofficial ISNA news agency.
All this reveals a real struggle for Iran's soul that requires an approach more sophisticated than Mr. Trump's, which would exploit the turmoil to justify reneging on the nuclear deal. That would free Iran to resume nuclear activities and enable new sanctions that would shift Iranian rage from Tehran to Washington. Some American officials and analysts want to go further and overthrow Iran's government.
But Iran's future is for the Iranians to determine. The United States needs to be humble about what it doesn't know and cautious about more direct involvement in the country's politics. America has a troubled history with Iran, including overthrowing the country's democratically elected leader in 1953. Wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Vietnam are haunting reminders of America's failures at trying to orchestrate political and social change abroad.
The question is not whether but how to help Iranians who favor nonviolent change. The United States, with its Western allies, should, of course, advocate the right of Iranians to seek peaceful political change, condemn the arrests of peaceful protesters and the violence against them, and urge internet companies to make it harder for Iran's leaders to block social media apps like Telegram that are so crucial to organizing and public debate. If he cares about the Iranian people, as he claims, Mr. Trump will also lift the ban on Iranians traveling to America.
But the president should also be aware that foolish moves by his administration could empower the most regressive forces and set back reforms that could bring Iran fully into the community of nations.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. Extreme weather events caused a total of $306 billion in damage in the United States last year, making 2017 the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday.
A trio of major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, contributed hundreds of billions to the total. But the year was seemingly mired in disaster, from a freeze in the Southeast that damaged fruit crops in March, to hail storms that whipped across Colorado, Oklahoma and other central states in May, to the tornadoes that struck the Midwest in June.
Unusual consequences of extreme weather could be found all over the map. Thirteen cows died in a field in Pennington County, S.D., after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil; they had changed their grazing patterns during a drought that lasted much of the year in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The cows' demise was a small part of the $2.5 billion of damage that struck the three states.
In all, there were 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage in 2017. In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were only three such disasters, adjusted for inflation. This year's $306 billion in damage broke a record set in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina contributed to a total of $215 billion in damage, also adjusted for inflation.
Scientists cannot always say with certainty how a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change. But some may be related to warming, and the contiguous United States experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2017. The temperature average was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center.
Here are the 16 billion-dollar disasters from 2017: Some made headlines for weeks, and some were simply overtaken in the public's consciousness by the next one.
Hurricane Harvey, August: $125 billion
Hurricane Maria, September: $90 billion
Hurricane Irma, September: $50 billion
Western wildfires and California firestorm, autumn: $18 billion
Colorado hailstorm, May: $3.4 billion
Severe weather in the South and Southeast, March: $2.6 billion
Drought in North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana, spring through autumn: $2.5 billion
Minnesota hailstorm, June: $2.4 billion
Midwest tornado outbreak, March: $2.1 billion
Tornado outbreak in Central and Southeast states, March: $1.8 billion
Missouri and Arkansas flooding, May: $1.7 billion
California flooding, February: $1.5 billion
Widespread Midwest severe weather, June: $1.5 billion
Severe weather in Nebraska, Illinois and Iowa, June: $1.4 billion
Southern tornado outbreak, January: $1.1 billion
Southeast freeze, March: $1 billion

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead: ECONOMY
Reconsidering the 2 Percent Inflation Target
The Federal Reserve aims to keep inflation rising at an annual rate of 2 percent. That has been the lodestar of monetary policy in the United States for the past 40 years. But a growing chorus of voices inside and outside the Fed think it's time for a change. Interest rates are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future, and the combination of low rates and low inflation leaves little room for the Fed to respond to future economic downturns. Experts have advanced a variety of alternatives, which can be sorted into two broad categories: Replace the 2 percent target permanently, or agree to replace it temporarily when the economy next needs the Fed's help. On Monday, the Brookings Institution will hold a discussion on the alternatives that will include the former chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, and the presidents of the Boston Fed and the San Francisco Fed, among other experts. Binyamin Appelbaum
TECHNOLOGY
The Latest Innovations From Tech Companies
At the International CES trade show this week in Las Vegas, thousands of tech and car companies will showcase some of their hottest new innovations: artificial intelligence, self-driving car systems, smart refrigerators, voice-controlled accessories, fifth-generation cellular connectivity and more. Brian X. Chen
ECONOMY
Looking to European Central Bank Minutes for Clues
The European Central Bank on Thursday will publish an account of its monetary policy meeting that was held in December. Analysts will read the minutes even more closely than usual to see if they confirm speculation that an increasingly strong faction on the central bank's Governing Council is in favor of making the current round of monetary stimulus the last. The central bank said last fall that it would cut its purchases of government and corporate bonds in half in January, but promised to keep buying debt at least through September. With the eurozone economy exceeding expectations, many economists think there will be no reason to continue the purchases after that. Jack Ewing
BANKING
Expect Some Pain With U.S. Bank Earnings
For big American banks, the pleasure of a lower corporate tax rate won't come until after a brief jab of pain: Banks have been warning their investors about a rough fourth quarter as they adjust accounting procedures in response to the new Republican tax plan, which President Trump signed into law late last month. The first quarterly earnings reports are due this week, with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo leading the pack. Wells Fargo has not said how the tax bill will affect its earnings. JPMorgan said last month that it could take a $2 billion hit. Emily Flitter
RETAIL
Holiday Shopping Numbers Could Provide Relief
The Commerce Department is scheduled to release data on holiday sales on Friday. Many early indications suggest it could have been a strong holiday shopping season, which might bring much-needed relief for retailers struggling to transform their e-commerce businesses. Michael Corkery
ECONOMY
Economists Watch for Signs of Inflation Uptick
The American economy is the strongest it has been in a decade, but inflation remains in check. That's good for consumers, but it's something of a mystery for Federal Reserve policymakers. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release data on consumer prices in December. Economists expect it to show that inflation remained low, but will be watching closely for any sign of a pickup, which could prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly. Ben Casselman

Full text: Humira is the best-selling prescription drug in the world. You may have seen the commercials. Because of Humira, a woman with rheumatoid arthritis can wash her puppy in the bathtub, another with colitis can stroll happily through a fair packed with food vendors, while a third suffering from psoriasis can go to the gym without hiding her neck.
But they probably wouldn't all look so relieved if they saw the bill. The price of Humira, an anti-inflammatory drug dispensed in an injectable pen, has risen from about $19,000 a year in 2012, to more than $38,000 today, per patient, after rebates, according to SSR Health, a research firm. That's an increase of 100 percent.
Pharma bosses probably miss Martin Shkreli, the reigning villain of the industry. If you'll recall, Mr. Shkreli, as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired Daraprim, a drug used to fight infections in AIDS patients, and then raised the price overnight to $750 a pill from $13.50. He also trolled critics and spent $2 million on a one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album, before his conviction on three securities fraud charges last year.
For a time, Mr. Shkreli's antics, along with the soaring price of EpiPens, sold by Mylan, deflected attention from the rest of the industry. A more typical play for drug companies -- the Humira play -- is to start at a high price and keep raising it ever higher, but incrementally.
"What they have done with Humira is just as unfair, just as morally wrong, but they did it over five years," said Ben Wakana, a former Obama administration spokesman who became executive director of Patients for Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group, because his younger brother couldn't afford Humira without the financial support of their parents.
"People are skipping doses, people are rationing, people are going into bankruptcy because of this drug," he said in an interview, arguing that Humira is both more expensive per dose and has a far higher volume than Daraprim.
AbbVie, which was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, declined to comment.
How much you actually pay out of pocket, and whether you can afford Humira at all, depend on your insurance and eligibility for discounts.
Anne Marie Garza, 51, an administrative assistant in Houston who suffers from colitis and Crohn's disease, said she had held off buying her latest dose because her insurer had changed. She was trying to see if she could avoid an out-of-pocket payment of more than $1,200, one of two she would have to make this year, on top of her rising expenses for vitamins and supplements to manage the disease. She has relatively good insurance, but the payments will strain her budget.
"During the holidays, I was contemplating what am I'm going to do," she said. "I was thinking should I just go on a liquid diet, because I can't afford this."
It's a difficult choice.
"It does give you your life back," she said of the drug. "I literally couldn't go away from the house or very far from a bathroom, 20, 25 times in the bathroom all day long, I can't imagine living like that," she said, adding, "I was becoming a hermit because I was so sick."
Humira, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of AbbVie's $25.6 billion in revenue in 2016, was not simple to develop. It is among a new class of drugs known as biologics, which are made from living cells rather than synthetic chemicals. The industry has argued that high American prices are needed to fund drug development, but a 2016 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association found "no evidence of an association between research and development costs and prices; rather, prescription drugs are priced in the United States primarily on the basis of what the market will bear."
Competitive pressures have been muted. Copies of biologic drugs, known as biosimilars, are not as easy to produce as normal generic drugs, and AbbVie's aggressive patent strategy has allowed it to further push off rivals. While there are name brand competitors to Humira, they are not exactly alike, complicating efforts by doctors or insurers to switch a patient from one drug to another.
Looking at the international picture tells its own story about drug costs. A prefilled carton with two syringes costs $2,669 in the United States, compared with $1,362 in Britain, $822 in Switzerland and $552 in South Africa, according to a 2015 report from the International Federation of Health Plans.
"You've got the largest market for pharmaceuticals, which has the highest prices," said Christopher Raymond, senior biotech analyst at Piper Jaffray. "That doesn't make any sense."
But it is typical. Other countries have single-payer systems, like Britain's National Health Service, that negotiate with drug companies or governments that exert price controls.
AbbVie has put some of its earnings to work lobbying against efforts at price controls in the United States, recently in California. The industry also successfully lobbied in 2006 to bar Medicare from negotiating over drug prices. While President Trump once talked about taking action on drug prices, his administration did not follow through in the health care debate last year.
By contrast, Britain's National Health Service, while strained of late, has more formidable negotiating leverage.
"I do think we need something like that in the United States, not the N.H.S. broadly, but some means of dealing with the extreme pricing instances," said Richard Evans, founder of SSR Health.
An analysis by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review found that Humira's list price would need to be discounted by at least 55 percent to be cost effective for rheumatoid arthritis, its originally approved use.
Dr. Steven D. Pearson, the founder of the institute, which provides cost benefit data to health plans, said competing drugs were overpriced as well.
"Even in a space like this, where there is a lot of competition, we don't see the prices coming down," he said. "That speaks to the fact that it doesn't often function like a free market usually would."
For now, Americans have to rely on the generosity of the drug industry, such as it is. I took a spin through AbbVie's corporate Code of Conduct, entitled "Inspired by Integrity." It's a lofty document. "WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING PATIENTS' LIVES," it says, in all caps.
It even makes a point of saying that AbbVie supports the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That declaration, if you read it, says, "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care."
AbbVie joined a few of its rivals in saying it would limit price increases to single digits this year, and so only raised Humira by another 9.7 percent this month, roughly four and a half times the inflation rate. For the drug industry, that counts as generosity.
