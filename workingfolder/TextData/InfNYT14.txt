Full text:   Janet Yellen is fond of saying that decisions by the Federal Reserve Board will be "data dependent." In remarks on Friday at Harvard University she added that the Fed should raise rates "gradually and cautiously" as the economy improves.
If she's true to her word, Ms. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, will resist what many people think will be an interest rate increase when the Fed's policy committee meets in mid-June. The underlying economic data -- on jobs, prices and economic growth generally -- simply do not support such an increase.
Widespread expectations of a rate increase arose in part from a misreading by investors of the minutes of a Fed meeting in April. What the minutes actually said was that "it likely would be appropriate" to raise rates in June -- if economic growth picked up in the second quarter, if the labor market remained strong and if inflation rose from its depressed levels.
Those are very big ifs that, by all indications, are not being met.
Government data on economic growth in the second quarter will not be out before the Fed's next meeting, but early signs are grim. In May, service-sector growth in the United States slowed markedly and manufacturing continued a steep decline, according to recent purchasing managers' surveys by Markit, a data supplier. The surveys, which have been prescient, suggest that growth in the second quarter will be at a meager annual rate of 0.7 percent, on par with growth in the first quarter of 0.8 percent.
Recent jobs numbers have also been disappointing. Job growth last month, reported shortly after the Fed's April meeting, was the slowest since September, with only 160,000 new positions added. Job growth in May could be even worse if, as anticipated, the recent slowdown in services and manufacturing impedes hiring. The Markit surveys project a gain in May of only 128,000 jobs.
As for price inflation, it remains below the Fed's target of 2 percent. What evidence there is of inflation is largely attributable to slowly rising oil prices, not to any significant or fundamental improvement in wages or spending or, by extension, economic health.
Rate increases are called for when economic activity is speeding up to the point of overheating, as reflected in an upward spiral in wages and prices. At its best, the economy in recent years has managed to grow at an annual rate of about 2 percent, a moderate pace that has resulted in considerable slack in the job market. Raising rates in June would apply the brakes to a recovery that has never hit full speed and that now appears to be slowing.
This sad reality must be frustrating for the Fed. When the term of the previous Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, ended in 2014, it was widely assumed that the Federal Reserve's next big task was to reverse the near-zero interest rate policy of the bailout years. That assumption has created pressure on the Fed, partly self-imposed, to do just that.
Adding to the frustration is that Fed policy is not to blame for the economy's underperformance. Congress bears much of the blame because of its tightfisted federal budgets when more government spending is needed to offset feeble spending and investment in the private sector. Still, sound policy making by the Fed requires answering to conditions as they are, not as policy makers might wish they were.

Abstract: The cost of foreign goods has soared in Venezuela, which is importing far less as part of Mr. Maduro's effort to conserve dwindling central bank reserves. Why doesn't the government acknowledge that the bolívar is artificially overvalued and make the exchange rate closer to what it should be? A devaluation would sharply increase prices at state-run stores that many poor Venezuelans rely on to survive, and would make debts denominated in dollars far more expensive to repay.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Supermarket shelves in Venezuela are chronically bare, and power shortages are so severe that government offices are now open only two days a week. The health care system has collapsed, the crime rate is one of the world's worst, and inflation is rapidly eroding what remains of the currency's value.
"The economy has gone from bad to worse to horrific," said Jason Marczak, director of the Latin America Economic Growth Initiative at the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, part of the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based research organization. "The Venezuelan government is doing a good job of leading itself into chaos."
Here are some basic questions and answers on how Venezuela got to this point under President Nicolás Maduro and what could happen next.
How could this happen in a country that has the largest reserves of oil in the world?
The price of oil, Venezuela's only significant export, has plummeted, which means revenue could fall by 40 percent this year. The government's huge borrowing, partly a legacy of the years when oil prices were far higher, has helped bring the crisis to a head because Venezuela now has far less money to repay its foreign debt, forcing Mr. Maduro to slash imports in order to avoid default.
On top of that are the consequences of a drought, which has shriveled the country's hydropower generation, a critical source of electricity.
Is the situation going to get worse or better in the coming months?
The country owes roughly $120 billion to foreign creditors and must make a payment of nearly $7 billion this year, most of it in the final quarter. Speculation has persisted that Venezuela may default on the payment or have to default next year, especially if oil prices remain low.
Venezuela's problems have been worsening for years, since well before Mr. Maduro took power. What is different now?
The political opposition in Venezuela is far more unified than it was during the era of Mr. Maduro's popular predecessor, Hugo Chávez. He died in 2013, but many economists say his policies of state ownership, unfettered spending, subsidies and domestic price controls are at least partly responsible for the crisis today.
With Mr. Chávez gone, Mr. Maduro's opponents have won a majority of seats in the national legislature and have collected nearly two million signatures on a petition to start a recall of Mr. Maduro.
So why doesn't Venezuela just default on its foreign debt and force Wall Street creditors to renegotiate more favorable terms?
Venezuela may have a lot to lose in a default, too.
Its foreign debt is partly owed by the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, the country's principal generator of revenue. Venezuelan officials fear that a default would bring bondholder lawsuits. That could severely disrupt PDVSA's operations and result in seizures of the company's overseas assets -- perhaps even from its Houston subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum Corporation, which owns three big refineries and has thousands of gas stations.
Citgo is vital for Venezuela because it generates much of the oil revenue that the country is still receiving. Despite the political tensions between the two nations, the United States is Venezuela's largest customer.
Venezuelan officials are also mindful of Argentina's default in 2001, which took more than a decade of litigation to resolve.
"If you default on PDVSA, you have Argentina 2, and nobody wants that," said Pablo Venturino, managing director of White-Bridge Capital Management, a New York investment firm that specializes in Latin American debt securities. PDVSA, he said, "is the main generator of cash flow for your country."
Why is Venezuela's inflation rate so high?
The cost of foreign goods has soared in Venezuela, which is importing far less as part of Mr. Maduro's effort to conserve dwindling central bank reserves.
The government has sought to soften the impact by raising wages and printing more bolívars, the national currency. But that is a recipe for inflation, creating too much money chasing too few goods. By some estimates, the inflation rate could reach nearly 500 percent this year and 1,600 percent in 2017.
While the official exchange rate is about 10 bolívars to the dollar, the black-market rate, which is regarded as more accurate, is about 1,100 bolívars to the dollar, though it shifts around. Many economists say this disparity is unsustainable.
Why doesn't the government acknowledge that the bolívar is artificially overvalued and make the exchange rate closer to what it should be?
A devaluation would sharply increase prices at state-run stores that many poor Venezuelans rely on to survive, and would make debts denominated in dollars far more expensive to repay. It would also be an admission by Mr. Maduro that an important Chávez-era policy has failed.
How are we seeing this policy reflected in daily life?
Subsidized food and fuel sold by state-run stores are priced far lower than they are really worth. This has created enormous lines of shoppers for goods that quickly sell out. While many Venezuelans spend hours in these lines daily because they cannot afford to buy food at privately run stores, others profit by buying at state prices and reselling at higher prices, which has created a flourishing black market. Datanalisis, a Venezuelan polling company, estimates that more than half of all Venezuelans have purchased from black-market hawkers, known as bachaqueros.
Why are they called bachaqueros?
They are named after large, voracious ants, bachacos, which cut leaves and bring them back to their colonies. While this is a disparaging term, many Venezuelans supplement their income as part-time bachaqueros, and others have quit their jobs to be full-time bachaqueros.
So Venezuelans have developed an inventive way to cope. Isn't this a good thing?
Not really, many economists say. The amount of time ordinary Venezuelans spend to purchase life's daily necessities has frustrated and angered them. It has also created a new class of speculator-merchants who profit illicitly from government policy.
"This is the crazy thing about the system," said Ricardo Hausmann, director of the Center for International Development at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, who was Venezuela's planning minister in the early 1990s and is an outspoken critic of Mr. Maduro. "A lot of people are putting in effort, and none of that increases the supply of anything," he said. "This is perfectly unproductive labor."
Can Mr. Maduro really enforce his threat to seize private businesses to make them produce?
Under Mr. Chávez, many companies were expropriated in industries like telecommunications, banking, steel, cement and dairy processing, as was the nation's largest supermarket chain. Mr. Maduro has sought to make examples of some companies. Last year, managers of a pharmaceutical company were arrested on suspicion of artificially creating shortages. In February, Mr. Maduro called the owner of Empresas Polar S.A., Venezuela's largest private company, a thief and a traitor.
Still, Mr. Maduro has not seized any businesses yet, which some political analysts attribute to the government's inability to take over anything more. "It's part of his rhetoric," said Risa Grais-Targow, director of Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in Washington. "He's stayed very true to the message of economic war with the private sector. To what extent do people believe it? Not that much."
Why doesn't China, one of Venezuela's biggest benefactors and creditors, help bail out Mr. Maduro's government?
China, a large customer of Venezuela's oil under guaranteed contracts, recently announced eased terms on its existing loans to Venezuela, roughly $50 billion. But, like other foreign powers, China is reluctant to grant new loans to the Venezuelans, possibly because of worries about Mr. Maduro's political longevity.
Correction: June 28, 2016, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A Q.-and-A. article on May 28 about the Venezuelan economic crisis misstated one consequence of a devaluation of the bolívar, the Venezuelan currency. It would make debts denominated in dollars -- not bolívars -- more expensive to repay.

Full text:   Stocks rose on Friday to wrap up their strongest week in almost three months.
Banks gained ground after the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, said the central bank intended to keep raising interest rates if the economy continued to improve.
Stocks turned higher over the last few hours of trading to finish at their highest levels of the day. Banks made the largest gains, as they stand to make bigger profits on lending if interest rates rise further. Phone companies traded higher after Verizon reportedly agreed in principle to a new contract with its striking employees. Alphabet led technology stocks higher.
Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed would move slowly and carefully on interest rates. But there were signs that the economy was improving throughout the week, including increased home sales, leading to big gains for stocks. On Friday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew a bit more in the first quarter than it previously estimated.
"Both inflation and growth are on an upward trend," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist for BMO Global Asset Management. He said investors might be worrying a bit less about the Fed's plans because the economy was showing signs of improving.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 8.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,099.06. The Nasdaq composite index picked up 31.74 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,933.50.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.93 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,783.22.
Bank stocks were led higher by Bank of America, which rose 18 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $14.88, and Citigroup, which picked up 47 cents, or 1 percent, to $46.58.
Bank stocks have struggled this year because the Fed has pushed back plans to raise rates. Bond prices dipped and yields rose, another sign investors expect interest rates to increase. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.85 percent, from 1.83 percent on Thursday. The yield on the Treasury note is closely tied to interest rates.
Thomas Perez, the labor secretary, said Verizon and its unions had agreed in principle to a new four-year contract. About 39,000 landline and cable employees in the Eastern United States went on strike in April. They had been working without a contract since August. Verizon gained 46 cents, to $50.62.
Google's parent company, Alphabet, rose after a federal jury said the company did not need permission to use tools made by Oracle when it built its Android software. Oracle had sought $9 billion in damages, and said it planned to appeal the ruling. Shares of Alphabet added $10.67, or 1.4 percent, to $747.60.
Benchmark American crude oil lost 15 cents, to $49.33 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gave up 27 cents, to $49.32 a barrel in London.
The machinery maker Terex dropped after the Chinese heavy equipment maker Zoomlion abandoned its effort to buy the company. Zoomlion offered to buy Terex at the start of the year, after Terex accepted an offer from Finland's Konecranes. Terex backed out of that deal and will instead sell its crane business to Konecranes. Terex stock sank $3.44, or 14.1 percent, to $20.89.
The scientific equipment maker Thermo Fisher said it would buy the electron microscope maker FEI for $107.50 a share in cash, or about $4.2 billion. Two months earlier, Thermo Fisher paid $1.3 billion to buy Affymetrix, a company that makes equipment to analyze genetic codes. FEI stock climbed $13.55, or 14.3 percent, to $108.13, and Thermo Fisher added 93 cents, to $152.13.
The price of gold fell $6.60, to $1,213.80. Gold has slipped about 5 percent over the last two weeks.

Full text:   The American economy is picking up speed after a slow start to the year, with resilient consumer spending and a buoyant housing market just about making up for a falloff in investment by cautious companies.
But the overall gains are still likely to fall short of what many experts -- not to mention ordinary workers -- would hope to see as the recovery nears the end of its seventh year.
These crosscurrents highlight the challenge facing policy makers at the Federal Reserve as they weigh whether to raise interest rates when they meet in mid-June, or wait until July or later in the year.
On Friday, the Commerce Department raised its estimate of the pace of growth in the first quarter of 2016 to 0.8 percent, a move driven mostly by better data on inventories and housing. Other areas of the economy, especially manufacturing and mining, still face significant headwinds.
One explanation for the hesitancy of businesses to spend is pressure on earnings after several years of expanding margins. The Commerce Department said corporate profits rose just 0.3 percent in the first quarter, after a 7.8 percent drop in the fourth quarter of 2015.
"It just confirms that we had a soft start to the year but not quite as bad as we thought," Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said on Friday. "Business investment was very weak, but the one bit of positive news was a surge in home construction. We're still in the recovery stage in the real estate market, especially for multifamily buildings."
The government's initial estimate of first-quarter economic activity, released in late April, showed an annual growth rate of 0.5 percent. The third and final estimate for growth will be released on June 28.
For the second quarter, which covers April, May and June, most experts forecast that the pace will pick up to about 2.5 percent.
Underscoring the consumer's ability to shrug off the anxiety that has gripped some businesses, the University of Michigan said on Friday that its monthly survey of consumer confidence in May showed sentiment at its healthiest level since June 2015. Expectations for future growth improved among both high- and middle-income households, according to the University of Michigan researchers.
The reports on Friday also suggest that 2016's economic trajectory will follow an arc that has bedeviled forecasters for years: a soft first quarter followed by a turnaround in the spring even though underlying conditions remain largely the same throughout the period.
"There is better momentum now, but it's still a bit of a head fake," said Diane Swonk, an independent economist based in Chicago.
In 11 of the last 15 years, a listless January, February and March were followed by a snapback in economic expansion in the next quarter, a trend Ms. Swonk said could not be explained by "polar vortexes and other one-off factors."
"It could be everything from a change in the structure of the economy to mismeasurement," Ms. Swonk said. Government agencies are working to improve their methods, she said, but budgets are tight in Washington and it has been difficult for federal statisticians to keep up with the broader shift from manufacturing to services as a growth engine in recent decades.
The seasonal kinks in the data can "create a false sense of security," she said, obscuring the continuing paucity of real economic gains for many Americans over time. "It was still a tepid quarter even if it was less bad. That doesn't equal good growth."
Although revisions and statistical quirks are nothing new for economists, Ms. Swonk explained that they appeared much larger these days because the overall level of economic growth was low to begin with. "You notice it much more when you're skating so close to thin ice," she said.
Just how thin that ice really is has prompted considerable debate within the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street as Fed officials ponder a possible interest rate increase when they meet in mid-June.
Until recently, most outside experts did not expect the Fed to lift its short-term rate lever until September at the earliest. But the official account of the central bank's last meeting in April, released May 18, showed that policy makers were ready to tighten monetary policy in June if they thought the economy was indeed getting stronger.
Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said positive recent indicators like retail sales and buoyant home prices in April strengthened the hand of Fed hawks, although they could wait, because markets remained anxious before Britain's June 23 referendum on whether to leave the European Union.
With the so-called Brexit vote looming, one alternate possibility would be for the Fed to hold off in June but telegraph that it plans to move at its July gathering, Mr. Shepherdson said.
Next week should provide greater clarity on the economy's real momentum. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report on consumer income and spending in April, and Friday will bring the Labor Department report on May unemployment and hiring, a crucial metric for the Fed.
Buried in the details of the gross domestic product report on Friday were signs that inflation was picking up to more normal levels after years of dormancy, Mr. Harris said. In particular, he said, the so-called core measure of consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter, just above the Fed's 2 percent target.
"This nudges the Fed closer to a rate hike, although June is still very much up in the air," Mr. Harris said. "They want to see clear evidence that the second quarter is stronger than the first quarter."
Mr. Shepherdson also called the decision a close call in a note to clients on Thursday. "We're sticking to our September base case," he said, "but we fully accept that June and July are also very real possibilities."

Abstract: Mr. Foster's destination, wedged between a pizza parlor and the opioid addiction clinic, was the Tapering Vapor, a bare-bones e-cigarette shop and makeshift lounge that serves as his modest oasis, a place to catch a mild nicotine buzz and let a world of worry float away on banks of big, cloying, candy-flavored clouds. Ms. Chapman, 47, said she had two master's degrees and was currently holding six part-time jobs -- a mix of clerical, academic and online work, none of which provided health insurance.

Full text:   NORTH WILKESBORO, N.C. -- Kody Foster had finished his Wednesday afternoon shift at the warehouse where he earns $12.50 per hour. Normally, he would be packing himself into his Ford Focus, with its Bernie Sanders sticker and plaque with the number 48, in honor of the stock-car racer Jimmie Johnson.
But this week, Mr. Foster, 26, couldn't get the Ford's check engine light to turn off, and the dealership told him that fixing it would cost $1,000, which he didn't have. So instead, he borrowed his sister's ancient red minivan, with its sliding door that doesn't shut right.
He drove along River Road, the hillsides lush and tangled with kudzu, then up Main Street in this faltering Appalachian town, the largest in a county that has seen its factory jobs wither, its Nascar track shutter and its homegrown business -- Lowe's, the home-improvement chain -- move its headquarters to a Charlotte suburb in 2003.
Mr. Foster's destination, wedged between a pizza parlor and the opioid addiction clinic, was the Tapering Vapor, a bare-bones e-cigarette shop and makeshift lounge that serves as his modest oasis, a place to catch a mild nicotine buzz and let a world of worry float away on banks of big, cloying, candy-flavored clouds.
In an America riddled with anxieties, the worries that Mr. Foster and his neighbors bring through the doors of the Tapering Vapor are common and potent: Fear that an honest, 40-hour working-class job can no longer pay the bills. Fear of a fraying social fabric. Fear that the country's future might pale in comparison with its past.
Wilkes County, with a population of nearly 69,000, has felt those stings more than many other places. The textile and furniture industries have been struggling here for years, and the recession and the loss of the Lowe's headquarters have helped drive down the median household income. That figure fell by more than 30 percent between 2000 and 2014 when adjusted for inflation, the second-steepest decrease in the nation, according to an analysis of census data by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
Still, the regulars at the Tapering Vapor -- overwhelmingly white, mostly working class and ranging from their 20s to middle age -- provide a haze-shrouded snapshot of an anxious nation navigating an election year fueled by disquiet and malaise.
Mr. Foster drove past the old Key City furniture plant; the original business was killed off by cheap imports and the Great Recession. The new tenant, a legal moonshine maker called the Copper Barrel Distillery, was proudly hawking bottles of the product that had once been the not-so-secret shame of this place -- as well as $19.99 ball caps, made in Bangladesh, emblazoned with the distillery's logo.
He parked next to the addiction clinic, with a discreet sign that read, "Mountain Health Solutions." Just a few hours earlier, it had been the busiest business on the block.
The Tapering Vapor was almost empty save for Andrew Taylor, the manager. He stood behind the counter under a Guy Fawkes mask, the universal symbol of protest and disaffection, and near the dry-erase board listing dozens of flavors for sale. The names suggested fantasia and abundance: Summer Melon, Broken Neon, Caramel Latte, Unlimited Power.
The two friends greeted each other with a joke borrowed from a popular Vine video. Mr. Taylor, 22, blew out a cloud that smelled like orange cheesecake.
Moments later, another customer, Karen Chapman, came in carrying an oversize handbag. She ordered a bottle of nicotine-laced liquid flavored like dark chocolate and tobacco.
She said she had quit smoking cigarettes in March, soon after her favorite character on the reality television show "Mob Wives," Angela Raiola, died of cancer. Ms. Chapman, 47, said she had two master's degrees and was currently holding six part-time jobs -- a mix of clerical, academic and online work, none of which provided health insurance.
"This is not the life I saw for myself," she said.
Now Mr. Foster was at work at the counter, his eyes locked in concentration under his ball cap. He was building a custom heating coil for the kind of powerful vapor-delivery device he and his friends prefer: a walkie-talkie-size gadget called a vaporizer, or a mod. It was a complicated procedure, involving an electric drill and a spool of 36-gauge alloy wire.
Mr. Foster has always had a knack for building. Before the recession, his father built fancy mountain retirement homes here. Now retirees were nosing around the North Carolina mountains again, and his father was building again. Sometimes Mr. Foster pitches in.
But this afternoon, as he sucked on a mod loaded with a banana-strawberry concoction, he was trying not to think about the trouble he was in. About how he messed up by buying the little white Ford off the showroom floor in 2012; the $265 monthly payments were killing him.
How his Verizon bill inched close to $300 the month before because he lost track of how much video he had streamed.
How he, his wife and their 4-year-old son were living at his mother-in-law's place after the landlord sold the house they had been renting for $400 per month. How even a two-bedroom trailer in a crummy neighborhood around here was going for $600 per month. "More than I can handle," he said.
And how his second child was due in July.
"It's not just me. There are other people in similar boats," Mr. Foster said. He acknowledged that maybe he was to blame for some if it. Maybe he should have stayed in college. Maybe he should have kept better track of his cellphone's data plan.
But in his America, he said, it seemed that just a few bad choices could doom anybody who wasn't born with Donald Trump money. "If you make just one poor decision," he said, "then you're screwed."
Mr. Foster's social life is the Tapering Vapor. And it is his online chatter with friends and strangers while he is immersed in the virtual worlds of games like Battlefield and Grand Theft Auto V on his PlayStation. The Internet means that few ideas are exotic anymore, even in a place like this, and Mr. Foster has been evangelizing to friends and co-workers lately on behalf of the documentary "Zeitgeist: Addendum." Mr. Foster had watched it online and was intrigued by its critique of international capitalism and its banking and monetary systems.
Mr. Foster likes Mr. Sanders's promise of universal health care, and his pledge to make tuition free at public colleges and universities. His dream, which seems distant now, is to one day return to school and study marine biology.
His support for Mr. Sanders makes him an outlier in largely conservative Wilkes County. Mr. Trump won the March 15 Republican primary here with 47 percent of the vote, garnering more than twice the votes of Hillary Clinton, who won the Democratic primary.
Among those who chose Mr. Trump was Mr. Taylor, a native of western North Carolina who never knew the world before the North American Free Trade Agreement or the Internet. He is a gamer and amateur musician. He attends Baptist Bible study and owns a throwback "Legend of Zelda" T-shirt. He plays bluegrass and the White Stripes.
And though globalization provides him with his preferred instruments of leisure -- a foreign-made Xbox and a cheap, sturdy Japanese acoustic guitar -- he is also one of globalization's discontents.
On the whole, Mr. Taylor agrees with Mr. Trump that the United States, particularly places like Wilkes County, received raw deals from the trade pacts that began with the passage of Nafta. Some of the textile and furniture industry remains here. But it is not like it was. Or at least the way people tell him it was.
He has long been skeptical of big government, and the way government works generally. It did not help that the Food and Drug Administration announced greater regulation of the e-cigarette industry this month. He figured it would soon put little shops like this one out of business.
"I don't think he's going to be worse than anybody else up there," Mr. Taylor said of Mr. Trump. If nothing else, he said, "He'd be somewhat more interesting to watch things unfold under."
Like many others here, both successful and not, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Foster are united in their belief that they are living among the ruins of a lapsed golden age.
The post-World War II success story that people once told about themselves here was captured in a 1948 promotional film, uploaded to YouTube by the State Archives of North Carolina, called "This is Progressive Wilkes County." It shows the locals of that era bustling on now-sleepy downtown thoroughfares here and in Wilkesboro, the smaller sister city across the Yadkin River, as shopkeepers offered pies and pastries, men's suits and prescription drugs.
"Every day is Saturday in these thriving mountain towns," a narrator says.
Today, Michael A. Cooper, Jr., 30, a lawyer who grew up in North Wilkesboro, compares the county to a Jenga tower whose pieces scattered when the old industries pulled out. The methamphetamine phenomenon crested here two or three years ago, but the labs continue to flourish among its 754 square miles of hollows and low mountains. Perhaps even more prevalent are prescription drugs -- particularly opioids like Oxycodone and Opana.
Mr. Cooper is a rare young white-collar professional who stayed in town. Many of his clients are people he went to high school with and are now in trouble over drugs or caught in the tangle of family court and dead-end jobs. It doesn't surprise him that Mr. Trump's message resonates.
"If there were winners or losers in America in this century, they were the losers," he said. "You're talking to people who haven't won in 30 years, and now somebody is telling them they're going to win again."
Mr. Trump is popular here for a number of reasons. The county is 93 percent white, but from 1990 to 2014, the Hispanic population there grew from 360 people to 4,154, according to census figures. On a Wednesday in March, Brona Wood, 58, a maintenance worker at the county courthouse, came in to the Tapering Vapor for a bottle of liquid called Fruity Juice. If Mr. Trump is elected, she said, "The Mexicans is going to stop coming in here and taking everybody's jobs."
Eddie Settle, the chairman of the County Commission, was giving a driving tour of the county a few days before the March primaries when a pickup truck adorned with a Confederate flag passed by. It is a common sight here, Mr. Settle said, though he argued that the Confederate symbol has less to do with racism than an ingrained suspicion of those in power. He said the same dynamic explained Mr. Trump's appeal: "It's not because he's Donald Trump. It's because he's anti-establishment."
As part of his tour, Mr. Settle drove by the large chicken processing plant in Wilkesboro, operated by Tyson Foods. Pay on the production line ranges from $10 to just under $14 per hour. It employs about 2,800 people.
Out on Route 421, near the bustling Wilkesboro Walmart, the highway is lined with common American chains -- Sonic, Chik-fil-A, Dollar Tree, Hardee's, Taco Bell, Sally Beauty Supply -- a sign of the area's low-wage jobs. The county's unemployment rate was almost 15 percent in February 2010. In April, it was 5.4 percent, about the same as the national rate.
"We don't have an unemployment problem here," said Jim Smoak, the chairman of the Wilkes Economic Development Corporation. "We have a wage problem."
Even before Mr. Trump's rise, government and business leaders here had concocted a plan for making Wilkes County great again. They introduced advanced engineering and computer training in high schools, and at the community college, they added computer controlled lathes and mills and a programmable practice production line -- all to train future workers for the Kia or Hyundai plant or other big manufacturing facility the county hopes to lure. So far, no luck.
Some of the clientele at the Tapering Vapor have made their own luck, working hard and earning a measure of economic security. Others are just getting by.
Billy Williams, 30, walked in wearing an oversize football jersey, with a front tooth conspicuously missing, and asked for a strawberry-raspberry liquid called Beetlejuice. He said he had been working a few hours a week at a restaurant across the river. It was not as many hours as he'd like, but he said it was the best work he could find, given his felony cocaine conviction from many years ago.
Kim Shumate, 58, walked in, looking for a replacement part for her mod. She quit smoking cigarettes after her house went into foreclosure in 2012. That was after Lowe's, at the height of the recession, stopped contracting with her husband's company, which had built the interiors of new stores.
Ms. Shumate cries when she thinks about her old house, with its big porch and its trails through the woods. So she tries not to think about it at all.
Lonnie Ramsay, 45, walked in looking for help. He described a nasty falling-out with his girlfriend and said he just wanted to get home to a nearby city. But he only had $25 to his name. He said he had been making $10 an hour at a factory.
One Friday afternoon someone brought a pair of virtual reality goggles hooked up to a laptop to the shop. Mr. Foster exhaled a cloud that smelled like a Popsicle. He said he had been reading up on the idea, explored in the "Zeitgeist" movie, of a "resource-based economy" -- a system in which, he said, "There's no money and everything is controlled by computers and resources are equally distributed and there's no ownership or anything like that."
"The system we have now is going to collapse," he said. "And technology, the automation process, is going to keep taking over and over."
That, he said, would free up people to do what they wanted.
Chris Lentz, 36, a worker for a utility company in a pair of mud-caked boots, frowned and asked, "If people were just given everything they ever needed, then what's the point of going to work?"
And so it went: the thick, sweet haze; the frustrations, diversions and digital toys; and the sense, in this jagged, hyperconnected moment, that everything is possible, or nothing is.
Mr. Foster took a turn with the virtual reality goggles, and put himself on a roller coaster. His body squirmed and bounced on the sofa as he rounded and flew down the virtual tracks until he became queasy, and said he'd had enough.

Abstract: If the economy were repeating the plunge of 2008, fewer voters might be prepared to support a candidate whose policies would disrupt world trade and whose tax cuts would almost certainly lead to a far bigger budget deficit. The 2000 election, which occurred as a big speculative bubble in the stock market and the technology sector was deflating, also lacks strong parallels to today.

Full text:   The boring economy seems to be making this presidential race even more exciting. And uncertain.
The economy has reliably been one of the most important factors influencing a presidential election. A strong economy helps to keep the party in power in power. A weak economy tends to cause voters to want to change the residents of the White House.
But right now, the economy could be best described as moderately, perhaps deceptively, successful.
Growth is lukewarm, but it has been consistent enough to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Wages have not risen by much, and the uneven recovery has left segments of the population behind. But the overall unemployment rate is down to 5 percent. That's unusual for a presidential election season -- it has been at 5 percent or lower in only three of the 14 contests that have taken place since 1960.
The quiet strength of the economy appears to be affecting the campaign. It's far easier for candidates to make economic policy messages resonate when the economy is roaring: the elections of 1996 (Dole vs. Clinton) and 2004 (Bush vs. Kerry). Or when the economy is in the doldrums: 1992 (Bush vs. Clinton). Or when it's facing threats: (high inflation for Reagan vs. Carter in 1980 and a global financial meltdown for McCain vs. Obama in 2008). But when it's middling?
As the political scientist Lynn Vavreck, an Upshot contributor, has pointed out, people are generally not angry about the economy, at least by historical standards. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders will certainly keep highlighting what they see as big weaknesses in the economy, and Hillary Clinton will keep talking about how she would improve it. But if most voters are doing sort of O.K., this approach may have a limited impact.
Indeed, the lack of stark economic problems may have allowed Mr. Trump to push unconventional policies. If the economy were repeating the plunge of 2008, fewer voters might be prepared to support a candidate whose policies would disrupt world trade and whose tax cuts would almost certainly lead to a far bigger budget deficit. And the advances in the economy make it harder for Mr. Sanders to further tap discontent over issues like income inequality.
The B-minus economy will also pose a challenge to whoever wins the White House in November.
A new president might be tempted to try bold, new policies to obtain an extra point of economic growth and spread wealth more evenly. But if there is a chance the economy is going to gradually pick up pace on its own, why risk big disruptive initiatives or squander political capital getting expensive campaign promises through Congress? Why unsettle a stock market that is in its second-longest bull run since the 1930s? (The longest was the 113-month bull market from 1990 to 2000.)
A heavy caveat is necessary: The economy may weaken -- and the stock market may drop -- by the time of the election. Problems in large economies around the world could weigh on the United States. And confidence here and abroad could plummet if Mr. Trump appears to have a good chance of winning and he is still pushing policies that could set off a trade war with China or cost taxpayers huge sums, like mass deportations and construction of a border wall.
Still, if the economy holds, campaign analysts will be scraping around for precedents.
George H.W. Bush won in 1988 against Michael Dukakis by promising to take the country on much the same course as President Reagan did. But while the economy has achieved steady gains under President Obama, Mrs. Clinton might not gain a big advantage by portraying herself as his economic standard-bearer. The economy just hasn't been growing fast enough. Economists expect the economy to grow at around 2 percent this year. In the second half of 1988, it grew at nearly double that rate.
The only years since 1960 when the economy was growing at more than 2 percent and unemployment was at 5 percent or lower at the time of the election are 1964 (Goldwater vs. Johnson), 1968 (Nixon vs. Humphrey) and 2000 (Bush vs. Gore). But the contests of 1964 (the perception that Barry Goldwater was extreme) and 1968 (Vietnam and social disruption) were heavily influenced by noneconomic factors. The 2000 election, which occurred as a big speculative bubble in the stock market and the technology sector was deflating, also lacks strong parallels to today.
The strongest comparison might be the 2012 election. While unemployment was nearly 8 percent at the time, and economic growth was anemic, jobs growth had picked up. But in that election year, the Federal Reserve kept its foot firmly on the monetary policy pedal. This helped ensure momentum in the economy continued through the presidential contest and after. The Fed isn't slamming on the brakes right now, but it is expected to raise interest rates this year, perhaps even before the election.
The Fed's hope is that the economy will keep growing steadily without a big helping hand. And it may. "I think it's a myth that expansions die of old age," Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, said late last year. The economy has grown in each of the previous six years.
Jobs and economic growth will always matter to voters. Whipsaw boom-bust economic cycles of the postwar years played a part in deciding who was president, and the American business cycle hasn't suddenly gone away. But nowadays there are no big wars to finance, just a few long, grinding commitments; inflation is under control; and the recent overhaul of the financial sector appears to have promoted steady credit growth without creating widespread losses. We may be in an era when politicians cannot make much hay out of the economy.
If Mrs. Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee and wins in November, it could show that a cautious candidate can do well in a composed economy. True, the lack of drama in the economy may also be helping Mr. Trump run a wrecking-ball campaign by stirring up other issues. But think about it: If there is one force that can derail him, or restrain him, it's the threat that the economy won't tolerate his more unconventional policies.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. CAIRO -- Egypt seemed poised for a modest comeback. After years of cascading crises that had devastated the lifeblood of its economy, tourism, there were signs of a turnaround.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, that he might soon resume Russian flights to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, which had been suspended after a passenger plane was blown out of the sky more than six months ago.
Then the United Nations World Tourism Organization chose Luxor, home to the famed Valley of the Kings archaeological site, as its world tourism capital for 2016.
But on Thursday, Egypt found itself in a dark, if familiar, place when an EgyptAir passenger jet disappeared from radar and crashed into the Mediterranean with 66 people on board.
For years now, Egyptians have barely had a chance to recover from one crisis before being hit by another: a damaged economy, a diminished currency, a repressive president and a dangerous insurgency waged by a franchise of the Islamic State militant group.
This latest setback was such a shock to the nation that Egypt's leaders abandoned their typical approach to crisis management: obfuscation. Instead, they offered what appeared to be a candid assessment, acknowledging that the disaster might well have been a result of terrorism. And that was even before there was hard evidence of terrorism.
Although visibly strained, Egypt's civil aviation minister, Sherif Fathi, admitted that some Egyptian officials had made errors in dealing with the loss of the plane, EgyptAir Flight 804, and conceded that it might be linked to Islamist militants.
The possibility of a terrorist attack, he said, was "higher than the possibility" of a technical failure.
"The initial response has been different this time," said Michael Wahid Hanna, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation in New York. "We haven't seen the kind of obfuscation that was typical of Egypt before."
Mr. Fathi's rapid acknowledgment of a possible terrorist link contrasted sharply with his government's response to the crash of a Russian charter flight over the Sinai Peninsula in October, when the government repeatedly refused to concede any connection to militancy, only to reverse its position months later.
That about-face was typical of Egyptian official reactions that have often looked like defensive crouches, and that have quietly infuriated some allies and led them to question Egypt's ability to carry out transparent investigations.
Those tactics have pitted President Sisi against some of his closest Western allies. His government has publicly clashed with Italy over the case of Giulio Regeni, an Italian graduate student whose bloodied body was discovered on a Cairo roadside in February. Egyptian officials have aggressively countered Italian accusations that Egypt's security forces were responsible.
Instead, Egypt has offered what are widely considered implausible accounts of how Mr. Regeni was killed.
Egypt also tried to shift blame for the deaths of eight Mexican tourists in an Egyptian military air attack in September. After months of Egyptian inaction over the killings in the country's western desert, apparently the result of a mistake, Mexico's Foreign Ministry issued a statement this month accusing Egypt of failing to investigate the episode properly and of not sufficiently compensating the families of the dead tourists.
The government's reputation for secrecy stoked cynicism among some of the relatives of missing passengers at the Cairo airport on Thursday. "We don't know anything," said Mervat Moamen, who had come for news of Samar Ezz el-Deen, a newly married flight attendant on the plane.
Visibly frustrated, she dismissed official explanations about the fate of the plane as "just propaganda."
Conspiracy theories about the crash floated in the news media, including an interview in the state-run Al Ahram paper with a self-declared expert who claimed the plane had been brought down by an electromagnetic pulse.
British officials have been working with Egypt to improve security at the Sharm el Sheikh airport, but they say it is unlikely they will reverse their flight ban anytime soon.
Tourist numbers have fallen more than 40 percent this year, and a further drop would most likely further weaken the Egyptian currency. This, in turn, would increase inflation and put new pressure on Mr. Sisi, who has responded to criticism with an iron fist this year, silencing critics and street protests through mass arrests and convictions.
Last weekend, 152 people, mostly in their 20s, were sentenced to two to five years in prison for participating in street protests against the transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. The furor over the islands appeared to rattle Mr. Sisi, catching him by surprise, and dealt another blow to his sagging popularity.
Still, analysts say, the EgyptAir crash could also give Mr. Sisi's government a chance to capitalize on international sympathy -- provided it does not engage in the sort of defensive behavior that has alienated allies in the past. As the search for wreckage continued Thursday evening, Mr. Sisi's office issued a stream of statements describing calls of sympathy he had received from the leaders of Italy, Greece, Saudi Arabia and France.
Mr. Hanna, the analyst, said there could be a more cynical explanation for the seemingly more candid approach of Egyptian officials: that they see an opportunity to blame another country, France, for the security lapses that led to the disaster. On social media on Thursday, some Egyptians, anticipating a terrorist link, called for Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport to be shut down on security grounds, much as Sharm el Sheikh's airport was in the fall.
Blaming France, though, could alienate one of Egypt's diminishing number of European friends. The French president, François Hollande, visited Egypt last month to sign a $1 billion weapons contract and a slew of other investment deals with Mr. Sisi.
Paradoxically, the proliferation of challenges facing Egypt may cause Western countries to strengthen their support for Mr. Sisi, despite his harsh policies, Mr. Hanna said.
"It solidifies the status quo," he said. "Because the country faces serious security threats with the potential to spill over into the rest of the world, other countries are loath to make a drastic change and to focus on things like human rights, politics and other freedoms."

Full text:   With a broad new class of workers becoming eligible for overtime, many small businesses are scrambling to figure out how to factor the regulations into their bottom line.
The Obama administration on Wednesday announced the final details of new labor rules to increase the salary cutoff for overtime pay. Although the plan was outlined a year ago and employers have several months to comply, many say the change will be a challenge to small businesses that pride themselves on a scrappy, entrepreneurial culture.
"We are pretty flexible," said Kelli Glasser, who is president and chief executive of Exhibit Concepts, a 100-employee company in Dayton, Ohio, that designs, builds and manages exhibits for museums and trade shows. " If somebody needs to pick up a sick kid or go to a doctor's appointment, we let them do it because we know that at some point they'll make up for it. Once you start tracking hours, that all changes."
Currently, salaried employees who earn more than $23,660 a year and meet other criteria are not entitled by law to overtime pay, which is 1.5 times an equivalent hourly wage after an employee works more than 40 hours a week.
The threshold is scheduled to roughly double, to $47,476, on Dec. 1. That means millions of workers who were salaried will have to have their hours tracked to see if they qualify for overtime pay.
Employers will have various options. They could change the pay structure for employees making less than the new threshold to an hourly rate. They could raise the pay above the threshold so they won't need to worry about overtime. They could even cut the base salaries of those who regularly work more than 40 hours, in expectation that overtime pay will make up the difference.
Among the business owners unsure of what adjustments to make is Lior Rachmany, the chief executive and founder of Dumbo Moving & Storage in New York. After hearing about the new threshold, he started examining how it would affect his 185 employees, 50 percent of whom are paid a salary.
Mr. Rachmany said he was reluctant to move so many additional workers to an hourly scale. "I think you get a better product when people are paid a salary," he said. "When a person knows there is a task to get done, it will get done, not on the clock."
Mr. Rachmany said he would probably end up hiring more entry-level employees and minimizing overtime pay for his affected salaried employees. He is also considering hiring freelancers and independent contractors. By doing so, he could increase operations in busy times and not have overtime be a yearlong worry.
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 established the rules governing which employees qualified for overtime pay. For salaried employees to be classified as exempt from overtime, they must meet certain criteria.
For example, their roles typically need to be administrative, executive, professional or managerial. Currently, to be excluded from overtime, they also must earn at least $23,660 a year, or $455 a week, a figure that was last adjusted in 2004. Before that, the rate had been $250 a week since 1975. Had that amount been adjusted for inflation, it would be more than $52,000 in today's dollars, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
The Labor Department calculated that 4.2 million workers would be affected by the higher overtime level, but the Economic Policy Institute estimated that the higher pay threshold would give 12.5 million more employees, or 23 percent of salaried workers, a new or stronger right to overtime pay.
Although businesses have had a lot of practice over the years adjusting for minimum wage increases for hourly employees in cities and states around the country, this rule change will be a significant shift for many small businesses and entrepreneurs, advisers say.
And unlike changes to the federal minimum wage, changes to the overtime threshold do not require an act of Congress, said Dan Bosch, a regulatory expert with the National Federation of Independent Business, a prominent small-business trade group based in Washington.
As of last month, many companies weren't even aware that the changes were imminent.
"Across the board, nobody seems to know about this," Adam Ochstein, the founder and chief executive of StratEx, a Chicago firm that provides human resources consulting and software to small and midsize businesses, said in an interview in April.
The short period of time before the new rules take effect is worrisome to some business owners.
"I'm not opposed to the change, but what I'm worried about is that it is such a huge increase, more than double, and it's sudden," said Ms. Glasser of Exhibit Concepts. "When we talk about minimum wage increases, those are being phased in most places. For this, there is no phase-in period."
In addition, the new threshold is expected to be the same across the country, with no adjustments for local conditions.
"One amount is being applied nationwide, and it is not necessarily applicable in all markets," Ms. Glasser said. In Dayton, Ohio, the median household income was $46,697 in 2014, the latest figure available from the United States Census Bureau. In San Francisco, the median was $83,222.
Another drawback, she said, was the precedent it would set for unmerited raises. And there is also the risk of a trickle-up effect: Employees not affected by the change might expect to see an increase in pay as well.
Even the employees who would benefit may be unhappy with the rule change. "A lot of salaried employees aren't going to want to track their hours, even if it's to their benefit," said John Swanciger, chief executive of Manta, an online community of more than three million small-business owners. Manta recently surveyed its members about the pending regulations and found that more than half were unaware of the coming changes.
Opting out of the rule is not a choice for companies with any employees who make less than the threshold, said John P. Quirke, a lawyer and partner with McCarter & English in East Brunswick, N.J.
The practice of comp time -- giving employees who work extra time a day off down the road -- will also change. With the new rules, for employees in the private sector making less than $47,476 a year, comp time will not be an option.
"Public entities can offer comp time, but it's illegal for private employers to do so," Mr. Quirke said. Employers can define what constitutes a workweek, but any work beyond 40 hours in that week will be considered overtime.
Small organizations should start by determining which employees could be affected. "I think the biggest issue will be with employees routinely working 45 or 50 hours a week and happily making $40,000 to $45,000 a year," he said. "Companies will need to figure out what to do with them: Reduce their hours or bump their pay?"
For companies with employees who earn less than the threshold but have predictable hours, the easiest strategy may be to do nothing at all. That is, reclassify them as nonexempt and limit their overtime hours.
"They will still need to track their hours, even if they're salaried," said Mr. Ochstein of StratEx, who added that such employers would need to keep close tabs on hours worked to ensure that overtime costs were under control. "Don't have people working 60 or 70 hours a week," he said. "If they are, increase their salary enough so they are exempt or hire more people for those roles."

Abstract: During Ronald Reagan's presidency two decades later, the rise in the economic cycle, coming out of what was then the worst downturn in the post-World War II era, averaged a bit over 4 percent a year. While Donald J. Trump exploits that anger, his grab bag of proposals -- deporting a large share of the work force; offering multitrillion-dollar tax cuts, mostly for the rich, that would only further widen inequality; blocking trade with much of the world; maybe raising the minimum wage, maybe not -- would do nothing to bolster growth.

Full text:   Back when "Gunsmoke" was on TV and Lyndon Johnson was president, the United States economy managed to storm ahead by nearly 5 percent a year for nearly a decade. What we would give to recover some of that power!
During Ronald Reagan's presidency two decades later, the rise in the economic cycle, coming out of what was then the worst downturn in the post-World War II era, averaged a bit over 4 percent a year. By the time George W. Bush lived in the White House, the rebound from recession delivered an average growth rate of under 3 percent.
You want to know how much bounce it has now? In the seven years since the United States emerged from the Great Recession under President Obama, annual growth has averaged just about 2 percent.
The bad news? Unless business and government do something to improve the economy's underlying capability, the United States will be lucky to achieve even that paltry growth rate over any sustained period of time.
"The growth we have experienced has gained from a massive cyclical tailwind," Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary who also served as President Obama's chief economic adviser, told me.
But that cyclical tailwind -- bolstered by putting idle resources back to work, which brought the unemployment rate down to 5 percent from 10 percent -- is spent. The jobless rate will not fall from 5 percent -- close to what economists consider full employment without excessive inflation -- to zero.
What remains is an economy at the mercy of two powerful dynamics. The first is a gradual shrinking of the work force as a share of the population, as it is squeezed by successive waves of retiring baby boomers and no longer gaining from the one-time surge of women into the paid work force in the 20th century. The second is a persistent decline in productivity growth over the last dozen years.
Lakshman Achuthan of the Economic Cycle Research Institute adds it up this way: Over the next five years, labor force growth of half a percentage point plus productivity growth of half a percentage point will push the economy ahead at the anemic pace of just 1 percent a year.
Even the Congressional Budget Office's modest projection that the economy will grow by 2 percent a year over the next 10 years is excessively optimistic, he argues, relying on a tripling of the rate of productivity growth from its average of the last five years.
The Federal Reserve was able to help engineer a recovery from the recession, but there is little the Fed can do to change the economy's underlying prospects. "Monetary policy can't deal with structural problems," Mr. Achuthan said. "The litmus test for any policy is, what impact does it have to improve productivity or demographic growth?"
America's stagnant outlook is important: Debt is a bigger burden in slow-growing economies. Paying for a growing number of retirees becomes more onerous. How the pie is divided becomes a tougher political problem in economies that don't grow.
This stagnation, exacerbated by the fact that most of the income gains the economy has managed to achieve have gone to the upper crust, underlies much of the anger coursing through the public this election year.
On its own, raw growth isn't enough. But without decent growth, combined with policies to maintain low unemployment, there is little prospect of improving the fortunes of the less well-off.
While Donald J. Trump exploits that anger, his grab bag of proposals -- deporting a large share of the work force; offering multitrillion-dollar tax cuts, mostly for the rich, that would only further widen inequality; blocking trade with much of the world; maybe raising the minimum wage, maybe not -- would do nothing to bolster growth. But don't worry, it will be great.
Hillary Clinton, who has put together a coherent platform focused on raising the incomes and enhancing the economic security of middle-class families, has steered clear from addressing the very real danger of low growth over the coming decades. Instead, she has promised to put her husband, who presided over the burst of growth in the late 1990s, in charge of economic policy.
Voters should not let the candidates avoid the tough questions: What, if anything, can and should be done to enhance the economy's ability to grow? Should the prospect of long-term stagnation inform policy more directly?
At the very least, the dismal forecast calls for the government to prepare for another bout of fiscal stimulus. The recovery by now is already seven years old. With interest rates near rock bottom, the Fed would have little room to prevent another spike in unemployment if the economy were to falter.
"If there is a cyclical downturn in a year or in the next several months, there would be nothing in that shotgun," said Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Fed who is now at Princeton. Mr. Blinder has put together a careful set of proposals to refurbish the fiscal policy toolbox in case the economy takes a tumble and stimulus is needed quickly.
"Students learn in Economics 101 that lower taxes and/or higher levels of government spending can mitigate recessions by boosting aggregate demand," he writes. "That simple Keynesian idea should be no more controversial today than Darwinian natural selection or global warming."
But it is. Many Republican politicians reject all three ideas. And as long as the G.O.P. is in control of Congress, that party will have its hand on the nation's spending levers.
The long term is even more challenging.
Some experts, like John G. Fernald, a senior researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, share the view of the budget office that productivity will advance by roughly 1.5 percent a year, returning to its average pace since 1970. That would mean little more than 2 percent annual growth.
Is that the best the United States can do? Not necessarily.
Productivity has slowed to a large extent because hiring is growing faster than capital investment. That means each new worker is most likely not just less skilled but also has less capital to work with, less help from machinery or software to increase output and generate income. One way to increase productivity would be to provide an incentive for capital investment, perhaps with a business tax overhaul that would lead corporations to repatriate the money they are keeping abroad.
Relaxing restrictions on educated immigrants would also increase entrepreneurship and investment. Subsidizing child care might encourage more mothers to return to the work force faster. Eliminating onerous regulations -- things like occupational licenses that restrict eligibility for a variety of jobs and overly tight zoning laws that prevent the building of new homes -- would improve economic efficiency and equity.
More focused training could substantially enhance the human capital of the work force. Public investment to revamp the nation's crumbling infrastructure would not only produce jobs for underemployed construction workers, it would also deliver a big productivity boost.
How much bang would this deliver for our bucks? Mr. Summers says better policies could add from a half to a full percentage point to growth. And he holds out hope that substantial investments in advanced technologies that have not yet shown large productivity benefits will eventually do so.
But even with the best of intentions, cautions Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former Congressional Budget Office chief who is now dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, "we are not going to get back to 3 percent with anything we know how to do now."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. We're in the golden age of innovation, an era in which digital technology is transforming the underpinnings of human existence. Or so a techno-optimist might argue.
We're in a depressing era in which innovation has slowed and living standards are barely rising. That's what some skeptical economists believe.
The truth is, this isn't a debate that can be settled objectively. Which was a more important innovation: indoor plumbing, jet air travel or mobile phones? You could argue for any of them, and data can tell plenty of different stories depending on how you look at it. Productivity statistics or information on inflation-adjusted incomes is helpful, but can't really tell you whether the advent of air-conditioning or the Internet did more to improve humanity's quality of life.
We thought a better way to understand the significance of technological change would be to walk through how Americans lived, ate, traveled, and clothed and entertained themselves in 1870, 1920, 1970 and the present. This tour is both inspired by and reliant on Robert J. Gordon's authoritative examination of innovation through the ages, "The Rise and Fall of American Growth," published this year. These are portraits of each point in time, culled from Mr. Gordon's research; you can decide for yourself which era is truly most transformative. (Readers later added their favorites here.)
-- Trains, turnips and p igs
1870
The Civil War was over and a transcontinental railway newly completed, allowing easy (or at least easier) passage from the great cities of the East Coast to California and many points between.
But even as the glimmers of the technological future were emerging, much would seem primitive today. People lit their houses with candles and whale oil, and heated them with wood or coal-burning stoves that kept homes unevenly heated and smelling of smoke.
Only a quarter of the population lived in cities, most of them in the Northeast. Families were large, and the population skewed young; there were 5.3 people per household, twice as many as in 2010, and 59 percent of the population was under age 25, while today it is more like 34 percent. By modern standards, the population was extremely poor, with the average citizen spending $2,808 a year in 2010 prices -- less than the equivalent of the modern-day per-capita economic output of the Republic of Congo.
They ate pork. Lots and lots of pork -- 131 pounds of it per person per year in 1870 (that number was half as much by 1929 and is around 55 pounds today). Unlike other meat-producing animals, pigs could live almost anywhere and could survive largely on food scraps. Their meat, easily salted or smoked, could be preserved in an era without refrigeration.
Fresh vegetables were scarce; farmers emphasized crops that could be stored or preserved, like turnips, pumpkins, beans and potatoes, instead of leafy greens that would deteriorate quickly. Apples were the only fruit widely consumed, and much of the apple crop was turned into cider or brandy for preservation.
The diet of mainly meat and starch frequently resulted in ailments like rickets and scurvy.
Most rural adults had two sets of work clothes, both made at home, and better-off families had a nicer set of clothing for church or social outings. There was not much in the way of consumer goods, and department stores were in their infancy, just starting to appear in large cities.
Instead of a toilet, you used a chamber pot or an open window in the city, an outhouse with an open pit underneath in the country. Modern toilets were an invention that was in its earliest phases during the decade of the 1870s. Big cities had sewers for both rainwater and human waste, but they flowed into rivers unfiltered.
The New York City subway wouldn't open for another 34 years. Boston had 700 horses per square mile. The average horse produced 40 to 50 pounds of manure and a gallon of urine daily, which made the streets of major cities no pleasant place to be.
By today's standards, entertainment options were limited. Total circulation of newspapers was 2.6 million in a country of 40 million people. There was no telephone, record player, movie or radio. Men could go to the local saloon to drink; women generally couldn't. Vacations and weekends were not really a thing.
Childbirth usually took place at home, and deaths were common both at birth and during early years from diseases like yellow fever, cholera and many others. There was no licensing of doctors, so quacks were common.
--The lights go on
1920
The Great War was over, the Great Depression had not yet started, and life in the United States in 1920 was profoundly different from 50 years earlier.
The most fundamental shift over those decades was that the American home became, in Mr. Gordon's word, "networked." Houses that were once dark and isolated were becoming intertwined. They were starting to be connected to electric grids, providing clean, bright light without emitting smoke. Urban water networks supplied clean water, and sewer systems removed waste without the pungent odors of chamber pots and outhouses. Telephones allowed people to converse with distant friends.
These advances were enabled not just by technological innovation in plumbing and electricity, but also by urbanization. In 1870, 23 percent of the United States population lived in cities, which rose to 51 percent by 1920. Large, ornate Victorian mansions were giving way to small bungalows affordable to the working class, which took off in Chicago starting in 1905. Sears offered prefabricated materials for a bungalow that it boasted could be built with 352 hours of carpenter labor. A less obvious factor in making mass housing available: The inflation-adjusted price of nails dropped by a factor of 10 from 1830 to 1930 with the advent of factory production.
It's hard to overstate how revolutionary the advent of electric light was. In the 1870s, a kerosene lamp could produce 5,050 candle hours worth of light a year at a cost of $20. That same $20 in 1920 bought 4.4 million candle hours a year from bulbs.
In Muncie, Ind., in 1890, there were not more than a dozen bathrooms with running water and sewers across town. By 1925, 75 percent of Muncie's homes had running water and two-thirds had sewer connections, including almost all newly constructed houses.
This is thought to be a major reason public health and life expectancy improved in the years leading to 1920. Many of the major advances in medical treatment, like antibiotics, were yet to arrive, but clean water and waste removal -- chlorination and filtration were introduced -- cut back the death rate from typhoid fever by a factor of five from 1900 to 1920. The number of modern hospitals grew to 6,000 in 1920 from 120 in 1870, and medicine became more of a science, with doctors getting away from selling dubious cure-alls.
Transportation was undergoing its own transformation, and people were becoming far more connected to one another physically. In 1900, just 8,000 motorcars were registered in the United States, but there were 9 million in 1920 and 23 million in 1929. Streetcars and subways, unheard-of in 1870, were in all the major cities by 1920. Intercity trains were becoming steadily faster and more reliable -- a train trip from New York to Chicago that took 38 hours in 1870 was 24 hours in 1900 and 16 hours in 1940.
Add it all up, and Americans who in 1870 would rarely travel farther than they could go on foot or horseback could suddenly range much more widely.
The social effect was particularly great in rural areas. Between 1900 and 1910, one local paper in Illinois reported on the arrival of each new automobile in its town. The automobile "seemed designed to loosen ties and dangle the horizon before the unsettled," wrote the geographer John A. Jakle. Suddenly a farmer had options beyond the general store and the local bank.
The age of processed food had begun. National food brands including Heinz sauces, Campbell's soup, Quaker oats, Jell-O and Coca-Cola had been invented and began to fill cupboards. Instead of a 1870s breakfast of pork and grain mush, a 1920s American ate Kellogg's cornflakes, invented in 1894, and orange juice.
Refrigerated railroad cars and in-home iceboxes meant that vegetables were now available in winter, and not just turnips. Growers in California developed "iceberg" lettuce in 1903, advertising that it could stay fresh as it crossed the country by rail.
Still, much about a 1920 household would still seem foreign to a modern visitor. There were no standardized electrical plugs, so even households with electricity didn't have appliances we would recognize today. Electric refrigerators and washing machines were virtually unknown.
Restaurants were starting to arise, with fancy hotels in the biggest cities employing French chefs, and less expensive restaurants owned by Chinese, German and Italian immigrants starting to appear. While traveling by car, options were few, but the White Castle hamburger stand would open in 1921 and Howard Johnson's restaurant in 1925. A wave of German immigration meant sausages and sauerkraut were becoming widespread. The hot dog on a bun had made its first appearance at Coney Island in 1900, and was becoming ever more popular.
Consumers were starting to have more options, as chain stores arose to offer more variety and lower prices than the small-town general store, which in many places had a monopoly on all manner of goods. The grocery chain A.&P. had 67 stores in 1876 and 15,000 by 1930. Local merchants fought the rise of the chains much as they have fought the rise of Walmart more recently.
And increasingly, anything not available in a local store could be obtained by a mail-order catalog -- the Montgomery Ward catalog was first issued in 1872, the Sears catalog in 1894. By 1900, Sears was fulfilling 100,000 orders a day, and its catalog featured fur coats, furnaces, furniture and much more. The catalog business was helped along by a technological innovation -- parcel post, which arrived in 1913. By contrast, in 1890, only about a quarter of American households received mail at their door.
It wasn't just consumer goods arriving at Americans' doors. Better printing presses and transportation made publishing newspapers more economical, and the average American household read more than three newspapers in the time frame from 1910 to 1930, up from 0.9 in the 1870s.
Telephones were not yet ubiquitous but were spreading quickly. In 1880, the telephone was used for 10 conversations per household per year, a number that reached 800 by 1929; a popular form of entertainment in rural areas became using a "party line" to talk with far-flung neighbors.
The phonograph, invented in 1877 and in wide use by the 1920s, opened up another entertainment option: listening to professional-quality music at home, unheard-of in earlier generations. Outside the home, motion pictures -- still silent, until 1927 -- were the latest thing, offering an affordable way to consume a new form of entertainment. They were wildly popular by modern standards; a 1919 study in Toledo, Ohio, found 316,000 movie visits in a week -- in a city with a population of only 243,000!
The age of electronic information had not yet begun as of 1920, however: The first commercial radio station opened that year (and by 1923, there were 556 of them).
--From newfangled to normal
1970
The changes in transportation and communication starting to be seen in 1920 had become fundamental parts of daily life half a century later.
Air travel was a perilous, uncomfortable endeavor in 1920 (Charles Lindbergh did not cross the Atlantic until 1927, and many died trying that and similar feats); by 1970 jumbo jets connected major cities around the world and were quite safe. Indeed, in many ways flight in 1970 was more pleasant than today, with no security lines and larger, more comfortable seats in coach class -- albeit at a much higher price than today.
Traveling from the West Coast to the East Coast went from being a multiday affair by train to a trip made in less than a single day, at least for those who could afford it.
Cars in 1920 were uncomfortable and prone to breakdowns, and were driven on dirt or irregularly paved roads. A 1920 Ford Model T had to be hand-cranked to start. By 1970, cars were comfortable, with options like radios and air-conditioning. They were driven on comparatively smooth, safe surfaces on the Interstate highway system, most of which had been built by 1972.
Homes were changing, as the innovations that were being increasingly adopted in 1920 became truly universal. Electric light was in 79 percent of households in 1940 and 100 percent in 1970; running water was in 98 percent of homes, up from 74 percent.
Refrigerators rose to 100 percent adoption in 1970 from 44 percent in 1940, and their quality improved a great deal as well; Consumer Reports described constant repair needs in 1949 that had been mostly solved by 1971. The same was true of almost all household appliances.
Air-conditioning, first introduced in the United States in 1923, transformed cities with hot weather, propelling the population growth of places like Las Vegas, Miami and Houston. There were 48,000 room air-conditioning units sold in 1946, which rose to two million by 1957. Still, by 1970 only a minority of households had air-conditioning -- 11 percent with central air, and 26 percent with room units.
Americans started eating a lot less pork and a lot more chicken and turkey; consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables fell as the proportion of people living on or near farms fell, while diets shifted toward much more canned fruits and vegetables (canned vegetable consumption rose from 34 pounds per person per year in 1940 to 93 pounds in 1970). Margarine replaced lard and butter as the cooking fat of choice.
The size of grocery stores exploded, with a wide variety of processed foods; a small chain store in the 1920s offered 300 to 600 items, while a 1950 supermarket stocked 2,200, and its 1985 equivalent 17,500.
The age of mass communication radically shifted the way Americans entertained themselves. A person living in 1920 could listen to a phonograph at home or go to a silent movie at the nearest theater. By 1970, color television and radio were both widely available. Movie attendance in any given week fell to 20 percent of the population in 1970 from 60 percent in 1940. But those who did go could view lush epics with color and sound.
A person had fewer TV channels and fewer movies to choose from than today; the videocassette recorder was years away, so you were captive to what broadcast networks happened to be showing. This resulted in huge audiences; in 1953, 69 percent of televisions were tuned in to the broadcast of the episode of "I Love Lucy" in which Lucy has a baby.
-- Awash in a sea of content
2016
In 1970, anyone who needed to reheat leftovers faced a messy, time-consuming task at the stove -- not the quick minute in a microwave of today. The microwave was introduced in 1965 and was not widely purchased until the 1980s, partly owing to falling price. It cost $495 in 1968, and a compact model with more bells and whistles fell to $191 by 1986.
But the microwave is the exception. Most of the advances in home appliances since 1970 have been trivial in the scheme of things: a little more energy efficiency here, a more ergonomic handle there, greater reliability, meaning fewer repair calls. Indeed, while fashions have changed in homes since then, in terms of décor and layout, the American household works largely as it did then.
Airplanes continued getting safer, with the number of deaths per 100 billion miles traveled falling to less than 1 from more than 100 in 1970. Travel became considerably less expensive -- though the rate of price decrease for air travel was slower from 1960 to 1980 than it had been from 1940 to 1960. Still, air travel had been an upper-middle-class activity in 1970, and now is affordable to the masses.
By some measures, air travel has become more onerous since 1970. There were no security screening lines (those were introduced after a series of hijackings in the late 1960s and early '70s). Seats were larger and came with free meals and drinks. Arguably, though, the bundle offered by circa-1970 airlines for coach class seats is still available: You can still get a bigger seat and free drinks at a higher price, but now it's called first class.
Once you factor in the time it takes to arrive early and get through security, flying from New York to Chicago takes about the same time, and costs about the same in inflation-adjusted dollars, as it did in 1936; modern planes are faster, but then one could show up at the airport 10 minutes before the scheduled flight time and hop on the plane.
Automobiles became more reliable, and car travel far safer, with widespread use of seatbelts, adoption of airbags and anti-lock brakes, better technology to understand how to build a car so that it protects occupants in a crash, and legal and public-awareness efforts against drunken driving. Deaths per 100 million miles driven have fallen from about 11 in 1940 to about five in 1970 to around one today.
Compared with 1970, Americans today eat a good bit less beef, pork and eggs, and about twice as much chicken. They eat more fruits and vegetables. But that's only part of the story. Americans are eating more of their meals away from home, and in restaurants more varied than people in 1970 could have imagined. Thai, Japanese, Middle Eastern and Indian food is now for sale even in small cities.
Some of the biggest changes to everyday life since 1970 have been around information and entertainment. The cliché about TV going from three channels a generation ago to hundreds actually understates it. The television itself has gone from a 19-inch screen to 50 or more inches, with much more vivid color and definition. Besides many more channels, thousands of movies and television shows are available at any moment of the day or night through on-demand streaming services.
And that doesn't even account for the Internet more broadly. In effect, a person can get access to nearly any notable work mankind has ever produced -- novels, movies, visual art -- instantly and at home. Or thanks to Internet-enabled mobile devices that have become widespread in the last decade, nearly anywhere the person is.
Keeping up with distant friends and relatives once required expensive calls on land-based phone lines; now there are free or nearly free conversations through text messages, mobile phone calls or video communication services like FaceTime and Skype. Sending a more detailed message once meant writing it by hand or on a typewriter, putting it in an envelope, driving it to the post office, and waiting a few days for the recipient to get it; now it is an instant, free email.
In short, the sheer number of ways a person can be in touch with others, and consume information or entertainment, has exploded, and the price has collapsed.
This is the area in which human life has changed the most in the last 46 years. We live and travel much as we did in 1970. We eat more variety of foods. Products of all types keep getting a little safer, a little more efficient, a little better designed.
But the real revolution of recent decades is in the supercomputer most people keep in their pocket. And how that stacks up against the advances of yesteryear is the great question of whether an era of innovation remains underway, or has slowed way down.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption with an article on May 15 about the greatest innovations of the current era erroneously attributed a distinction to the flight shown, the landing of a Concorde supersonic jet in New York in 1977. While that landing was the first by the Concorde in New York, which had previously prohibited the jet from landing, it was not the first trans-Atlantic flight by the Concorde, which took place in 1973.

Abstract: GIVEN Donald J. Trump's virtual lock on the Republican presidential nomination, you'd think he'd be a bit more upbeat. Figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show industrial output a tad below an all-time record level, while nearly double the output of the Reagan presidency, another supposed golden age.

Full text:   GIVEN Donald J. Trump's virtual lock on the Republican presidential nomination, you'd think he'd be a bit more upbeat. Instead, his campaign began last summer with "our country is going to hell," then declared, "we're becoming a third world country," and by this month had progressed to the United States "losing all the time."
This election season, the impending apocalypse has been issue No. 1 for presidential aspirants on both sides. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he was running "because the world is falling apart." Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, declared the United States "near an abyss." On the left, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont says the economy has been "destroyed" for all but the wealthy few.
Presidential contenders are hardly alone in such bleak views. An April Gallup poll found that only 26 percent of Americans call themselves "satisfied" with "the way things are going" in the United States. It's been this way for a while: January 2004, during the George W. Bush administration, was the last time a majority told Gallup they felt good about the nation's course.
Yet a glance out the window shows blue sky. There are troubling issues, including the horror of mass shootings, but most American social indicators have been positive at least for years, in many cases for decades. The country is, on the whole, in the best shape it's ever been in. So what explains all the bad vibes?
Social media and cable news, which highlight scare stories and overstate anger, bear part of the blame. So does the long-running decline in respect for the clergy, the news media, the courts and other institutions. The Republican Party's strange insistence on disparaging the United States doesn't help, either.
But the core reason for the disconnect between the nation's pretty-good condition and the gloomy conventional wisdom is that optimism itself has stopped being respectable. Pessimism is now the mainstream, with optimists viewed as Pollyannas. If you don't think everything is awful, you don't understand the situation!
Objectively, the glass looks significantly more than half full.
Job growth has been strong for five years, with unemployment now below where it was for most of the 1990s, a period some extol as the "good old days." The American economy is No. 1 by a huge margin, larger than Nos. 2 and 3 (China and Japan) combined. Americans are seven times as productive, per capita, as Chinese citizens. The dollar is the currency the world craves -- which means other countries perceive America's long-term prospects as very good.
Pollution, discrimination, crime and most diseases are in an extended decline; living standards, longevity and education levels continue to rise. The American military is not only the world's strongest, it is the strongest ever. The United States leads the world in science and engineering, in business innovation, in every aspect of creativity, including the arts. Terrorism is a serious concern, but in the last 15 years, even taking into account Sept. 11, an American is five times more likely to be hit by lightning than to be killed by a terrorist.
Is the middle class in dire straits, as Mr. Sanders contends? Yes, inflation-adjusted middle-class household income peaked in 1998 and has dropped slightly since. But during the same period, federal income taxes on the middle class went down, while benefits went up. Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution has shown that when lower taxes and higher benefits are factored in, middle-class buying power has risen 36 percent in the current generation.
Is American manufacturing in free fall, as Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump assert? Figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show industrial output a tad below an all-time record level, while nearly double the output of the Reagan presidency, another supposed golden age. It's just that advancing technology allows more manufacturing with fewer workers -- a change unrelated to foreign competition.
Manufacturing jobs described by Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders as "lost" to China cannot be found there, or anywhere. As Charles Kenny of the nonpartisan Center for Global Development has shown, technology is causing factory-floor employment to diminish worldwide, even as loading docks hum with activity. This transition is jarring to say the least -- but it was always inevitable. The evolution of the heavy-manufacturing sector away from workers and toward machines will not stop, even if international trade is cut off completely.
A century ago, most Americans worked in agriculture: Today hardly any do, and we're all better off, including farmers. That manual labor, farm or factory, has given way to 60 percent of Americans employed in white-collar circumstances is the important story in the long term. But nothing is achieved by moaning about the past. The challenge is to create even more white-collar opportunities.
Though candidates on the right are full of fire and brimstone this year, the trend away from optimism is most pronounced among liberals. A century ago Progressives were the optimists, believing society could be improved, while conservatism saw the end-times approaching. Today progressive thought embraces Judgment Day, too. Climate change, inequality and racial tension are viewed not as the next round of problems to be solved, but as proof that the United States is horrible.
And yet developing the postindustrial economy -- while addressing issues such as inequality, greenhouse emissions and the condition of public schools -- will require optimism. Pessimists think in terms of rear-guard actions to turn back the clock. Optimists understand that where the nation has faults, it's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.
That's why the lack of progressive optimism is so keenly felt. In recent decades, progressives drank too deeply of instant-doomsday claims. If their predictions had come true, today petroleum would be exhausted, huge numbers of major animal species would be extinct, crop failures would be causing mass starvation, developing-world poverty would be getting worse instead of declining fast. (In 1990, 37 percent of humanity lived in what the World Bank defines as extreme poverty; today it's 10 percent.)
The lack of optimism in contemporary liberal and centrist thinking opens the door to Trump-style demagogy, since if the country really is going to hell, we do indeed need walls. And because optimism has lost its standing in American public opinion, past reforms -- among them environmental protection, anti-discrimination initiatives, income security for seniors, auto and aviation safety, interconnected global economics, improved policing and yes, Obamacare -- don't get credit for the good they have accomplished.
In almost every case, reform has made America a better place, with fewer unintended consequences and lower transaction costs than expected. This is the strongest argument for the next round of reforms. The argument is better made in positive terms -- which is why we need a revival of optimism.
Recently Warren Buffett said that because of the "negative drumbeat" of politics, "many Americans now believe their children will not live as well as they themselves do. That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history." This was not Nebraska folk wisdom; rather, it's sophisticated analysis. The optimistic view is that it's still morning in America, and if we fix what's wrong, the best is yet to come. Such can-do, better-future thinking needs to make an appearance in the 2016 presidential campaign.

Abstract: The situation for new high school graduates is far bleaker, in part because many lower-wage jobs are being filled by college graduates.

Full text:   This year's high school graduates were 10 years old when the economy hit the skids in 2008. Many college graduates in the class of 2016 were 14. Yet, their economic prospects remain darkened by the enduring effects of the Great Recession.
That is not to say there has been no improvement. The class of '16 has more and better-paying job opportunities than earlier post-crash graduating classes, according to a new report from the Economic Policy Institute. But for the most part, today's graduates still face employment conditions that are worse than in 2007, the year before the recession, and are much worse than in 2000, when the economy was last at full employment.
The recent unemployment rate for college graduates ages 21 to 24 was 5.5 percent, compared with 4.3 percent in 2000. Their underemployment rate -- which includes the unemployed, those who have briefly left the work force and those stuck in part-time jobs -- was recently 12.3 percent, compared with 7.1 percent in 2000. And in 2015, nearly 45 percent of college graduates ages 22 to 27 were in jobs that did not require a college degree, compared with 38 percent in 2000. Over the same period, student debt has soared, which means that many of today's graduates are trying to pay off more debt with less secure jobs.
The situation for new high school graduates is far bleaker, in part because many lower-wage jobs are being filled by college graduates. Among high school graduates ages 17 to 20, unemployment is nearly 18 percent, compared with 12 percent in 2000. One in three are underemployed, compared with roughly one in five in 2000.
The soft labor market has depressed wages, with average hourly pay for young college graduates, recently $18.53, barely higher than it was in 2000, adjusted for inflation. Young high school graduates are averaging only $10.66, lower than in 2000, adjusted for inflation.
Without full employment to help push up pay, wages and salaries for all workers lag even as corporate profits rise. But the consequences for young people are particularly severe, because early bouts of unemployment, underemployment and low pay can continue to harm job prospects and earnings over a long period. One's pay and position starting out has a big impact on subsequent raises and promotions, and thus on accumulated wealth over a career.
This trap is especially dangerous for racial minorities and women, who even in the best of times have to combat bias in hiring and pay. For young black college graduates, the recent unemployment rate, at well over 9 percent, is double that of young white graduates. Young female college graduates earn 79 cents for every dollar earned by their male peers, a gap that is bound to get worse as men at the very top of the wage ladder capture an increasing share of total pay.
These persistent problems are the result of political failure. Job growth and pay growth were weak and largely ignored as policy issues for most of the 2000s, even before the Great Recession. To restore full employment after the crash would have required sustained government investment in many areas, including infrastructure, education, health care and energy technologies.
More public spending could have raised demand at a time of diminished private-sector spending. But Republicans in Congress have rejected that approach and have embraced budget cuts that have hampered broader recovery and growth, at times with the support or acquiescence of Democrats and administration officials.
Even piecemeal labor market improvements have been stymied or delayed. A higher federal minimum wage would lift wages for low-earning graduates, and updated overtime rules for salaried workers would lift middle-class pay. But lawmakers last raised the minimum wage in 2007, and it will be 2017, at the earliest, before they do so again. Similarly, the administration is expected to issue new overtime rules soon, but at this late date, putting them into effect will fall to the next administration.
In the meantime, the class of 2016, like many before it, will graduate into a tough economy in which even the college educated are not assured a toehold.

Full text:   Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain who helps websites and apps develop consumer-friendly features, has a professional bone to pick with sites that seem to maneuver people into signing up for services they might not actually want.
He even has a name for the exploitative techniques: "dark patterns." To him, these are debased versions of the typical sign-up, sharing, shopping, checkout and download processes that are standard practice online.
"It's a term for patterns that are manipulative, that you are doing on purpose to get one over on users," Mr. Brignull said when I recently called him.
A few years ago, Mr. Brignull started a site called darkpatterns.org to call attention to the practices.
There's the "sneak into basket" technique, where a retailer automatically adds products -- like a magazine subscription or travel insurance -- to consumers' shopping carts and makes it hard for them to remove the unwanted items. There's the "roach motel" or "walled-garden" technique, in which sites offer fast-and-easy sign-up processes but make it much more cumbersome for consumers to close accounts.
There's also "misdirection," in which prominent marketing come-ons may distract users from seeing check boxes that by default, say, sign them up for a newsletter or membership, spam their contacts or alter their home pages.
And then there's scarcity inflation: "Only two hotel rooms left at this price!"
"If it's real scarcity, that's fine," Mr. Brignull says. "If it's fake scarcity, that's taking advantage of people's natural biases. It's a blurry line."
Persuasive design is a longstanding practice, not just in marketing but in health care and philanthropy. Countries that nudge their citizens to become organ donors -- by requiring them to opt out if they don't want to donate their body parts -- have a higher rate of participation than the United States, where people can choose to sign up for organ donation when they obtain driver's licenses or ID cards.
But the same techniques that encourage citizens to do good may also be used to exploit consumers' cognitive biases. User-experience designers and marketers are well aware that many people are so eager to start using a new service or complete a task, or are so loath to lose a perceived deal, that they will often click one "Next" button after another as if on autopilot -- without necessarily understanding the terms they have agreed to along the way.
"That's when things start to drift into manipulation," said Katie Swindler, director of user experience at FCB Chicago, an ad agency. She and Mr. Brignull are part of an informal effort among industry experts trying to make a business case for increased transparency.
Ms. Swindler and Dennis Ellis, a user-experience strategist at her agency, gave a recent talk titled "Checkbox That Ruined My Life: Manipulative Design" at the South by Southwest Conference in Austin, Tex. They described the reputational and financial risks to online services that employ confusing strategies.
Among other companies, they mentioned LinkedIn. Last year, the professional network agreed to pay $13 million to settle a class-action suit in which plaintiffs accused the company of sending unwanted emails to their contacts.
Steve Johnson, LinkedIn's vice president for user experience, said the company had worked over the last two years to make it clearer to members how the feature that imports their contacts works and to give them more control over it.
"We need a way for them to build a network on LinkedIn quickly and efficiently without tricking them into doing things they don't want to do," Mr. Johnson told me.
The presentation in Austin also cited Ryanair, a low-cost airline with headquarters in Ireland, which changed its checkout process after customers publicly complained about its practice of automatically adding travel insurance policies with their airfares. Whereas Ryanair once placed the insurance opt-out option in a drop-down menu of passengers' home countries -- between Denmark and Finland -- it now simply gives passengers the option of adding insurance.
"Everyone is pushing the envelope all the time," Ms. Swindler said. "That just erodes the relationship between the consumer and the brand."
To help companies gauge where their techniques fall along the persuasive-to-manipulative spectrum, Chris Nodder, a user-experience consultant in Seattle, has developed guidelines for ethical conduct. Systems that nudge people to act in the public interest are "charitable," he told me, while products like Fitbit, which may help people develop better habits, are "motivational."
"If the company benefits more than the consumer, I would call it 'evil design,"' said Mr. Nodder, who wrote a book on the topic called "Evil by Design." If an approach benefits the company and the customer equally, he added, "you are probably in the realm of 'commercial design."'
For instance, when ride-hailing apps run promotions offering customers free rides to sign up their friends -- and the friends get free rides as well -- both the company and consumers benefit.
And then there's JustFab, an e-commerce start-up that runs subscription apparel sites including Fabletics.com, which sells fitness clothing. BuzzFeed has pilloried the site's practices.
Last week, Fabletics was offering a "new V.I.P. membership exclusive" in which it discounts various outfits to $25. When first-time shoppers choose clothing and check out, the site gives them a pricing choice that highlights the discounted V.I.P. membership offer in black and red -- while displaying the regular, non-V.I.P. price in gray.
But this initial choice page does not inform consumers that the membership involves a $49.95 monthly subscription fee for clothing. That disclosure comes at the bottom of a subsequent membership page, where the site explains that it emails members a personalized selection of clothing on the first of every month.
To avoid the $49.95 clothing fee, members must opt out online by the 5th of each month. To cancel their membership, they must call customer service.
These kinds of subscription continuity plans are legal in the United States if the marketing is truthful and the terms and conditions are prominently displayed.
In an email, Shawn Gold, a spokesman for JustFab, said Fabletics provided 14 different notices on the site about the subscription model, including two points where consumers must actively opt in. He added that the company was currently pilot-testing an online cancellation option.
"Customers who accidentally sign up for membership are costly to the business," Mr. Gold wrote. "So we do everything we can to avoid that from happening."
Other online patterns seem more puzzling to me.
When I'm on the desktop computer at the office and finish ordering books on Amazon.com for an article I'm working on, for instance, I can never find a simple log-out button. Instead, I scroll down a column marked "Hello, Natasha -- Your Account" and then click on an option that reads: "Not Natasha? Sign Out." But the notion that in order to sign off, I have to deny that I am me always gives me pause.
"It's really clever -- they want you to do something that is counterintuitive and maybe a little freaky to you," Mr. Nodder said. "There's an element of 'Maybe I just won't sign out this time."'
I subsequently ordered Mr. Nodder's book on evil design from Amazon and then I logged out, my unease notwithstanding.

Full text:   America has been here before.
At the dawn of the 20th century, the economy was already well into a fundamental transformation of the labor force, as industry replaced farming and crafts as the primary source of new jobs. The shift was painful, spawning protest movements and political forces like progressivism. But the United States emerged from the turmoil far more prosperous and powerful.
Notably, the jobs of the new industrial economy were generally more productive and better paid than the jobs it left behind.
The nation is well on its way through a second transition, this time to a postindustrial economy with little factory work to be had. Even as industrial production has grown, the economy has shed seven million manufacturing jobs since 1980. Manufacturing's share of employment has shrunk to 8.5 percent of nonfarm jobs from a peak of nearly 27 percent in 1920.
For politicians on the campaign trail and in Washington struggling to come up with a credible strategy to improve the fortunes of America's understandably angry working class, that shift poses an unanswered question: Where will new, better jobs come from?
Epochal transformations like these are complicated. They are difficult to understand, let alone manage, and are driven not only by domestic forces but also by global dynamics over which American politicians have limited control. During much of the 19th and 20th centuries, government at multiple levels played an essential role in shaping the nation's transition from farms and small towns to cities and factories. It could do so again. What has stopped it is not the lack of practical ideas but the encrusted ideological opposition to government activism of any kind.
The construction jobs once fueled by the housing bubble that burst so violently in 2008 are unlikely to return anytime soon. The jobs picking up the slack today are in retail sales or cleaning buildings, paying little more than $26,000 a year; they are cashier positions paying $21,000, or food-prep jobs paying less than $20,000.
Some growing occupations pay a decent wage: registered nurses earn $71,000 a year, on average. But these examples are the exception, not the norm.
Though the decline of well-paid working class jobs is often portrayed as the inevitable consequence of globalization and technological change, it is in large part the result of a failure of government.
An observation has recently popped up in the academic debate -- in books such as "Concrete Economics" (Harvard Business Review Press) by J. Bradford DeLong and Stephen Cohen, and in "American Amnesia" (Simon and Schuster) by Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson. They point out that for all our love of rugged individualism, government played a large and underappreciated role in reshaping the American economy before -- and it could do so again.
Start with high tariffs against imports imposed from the time of Alexander Hamilton, to help foster America's industrial development. Then huge grants of land to build railways in the 19th century not only opened up the West, they vastly increased productivity in agriculture. From catalog retailing to centralized meatpacking, the railways enabled innovations that spawned entire industries.
The government also played a crucial role on the other side of this transformation: bolstering workers' human capital. From the Land-Grant College Act of 1862, which created a network of public universities, to the offer in the G.I. Bill of Rights to pay for the college education of veterans returning from World War II, the federal government invested aggressively in higher education.
In the early decades of the 20th century, local governments across the country poured money and resources into an impressive expansion of secondary education. Between 1910 and 1940, the high school graduation rate of American 18-year-olds increased to 50 percent from 9 percent.
Finally, the government directly created jobs -- whether in the burst of infrastructure investment in the 1930s that gave us the Hoover Dam, among other huge projects, or the tenfold increase in federal spending from 1939 to 1945 as the government built up the military-industrial complex to fight Germany and Japan.
Why American politics turned against this successful model of pragmatic policy-making remains controversial. Perhaps it was the increasing footprint of money in politics, which has given more clout to corporate interests lobbying for smaller government and lower taxes. Maybe desegregation led to increasing distrust in government by white voters. Perhaps it was the combination of a recession and high inflation of the 1970s, which discredited interventionist government policies.
In any event, there is much the government could do.
Start with investment in the nation's crumbling infrastructure: Lawrence Summers, once the top economic adviser to President Obama, never tires of repeating that this not only is urgently needed but is almost guaranteed to be profitable, given rock-bottom interest rates. While it might not increase employment by tens of millions, as these jobs tend to require high skills, even a relatively small number of construction jobs would provide a needed economic boost.
Then there are health care and education, critical sectors that are growing as a share of the economy and will provide many of the jobs of our future. For both good and ill, they are already deeply entwined with the government.
To be sure, that raises additional challenges: Republican governors refusing to expand Medicaid, for example. But it also offers an opportunity for the government to shape, through its power as a regulator and a contractor of private services, the kinds of jobs these industries will offer.
Why not insist that home health aides acquire a certain set of skills and be paid accordingly?
"The huge issue going forward is, are we going to care for the elderly with a bunch of minimum-wage workers or people with a better certification offering better care for better pay?" asked Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard University. "There is a potential win-win situation where workers and patients end up in better shape."
Similarly, the government has enormous leverage to improve the quality of college education by tightening rules on for-profit universities that feed from the trough of federal funds.
A better path than funneling so much money to low-quality for-profits would probably be to help finance public universities and community colleges.
Not only would that improve the skills of American workers, which are still considered among the poorest in the industrialized world, but it would also probably improve the wages and working conditions of teachers.
The good news is that the United States may have the best opportunity in decades to overcome its anti-government political biases. Donald J. Trump, the admittedly unusual Republican standard-bearer, has publicly called for extensive public investment in infrastructure. More orthodox Republicans, like the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, are also expressing interest in using government levers to tackle the lack of prospects for so many American workers.
There are several levers available. The federal government could try to rebuild a quality bureaucracy, rather than subcontract so much of its work to expensive consultants and bottom-end contractors that employ the cheapest workers available.
It could invest more in research and development, which has flatlined over the past several years.
So what's holding us back? The loss of a vision, once shared across much of the ideological spectrum, of what government can accomplish, when it is allowed to do its job.

Full text:   While packing for a trip to Toronto in 1978, Irwin Weinberg sent his teenage son Jack to a military surplus store with instructions to buy a pair of handcuffs. On the plane, Mr. Weinberg quietly chained one of his own wrists to his briefcase.
The handcuffs were a prop, a gimmick to get the attention of news photographers who had been alerted to his arrival -- and to the arrival of the tiny item in the briefcase: the world's most expensive postage stamp, the 1-cent magenta from British Guiana, issued in 1856. It was to be displayed at a stamp show in Toronto.
Mr. Weinberg, a stamp dealer and collector who died at 88 on May 2, bought the stamp in 1970 for a group of investors for $280,000, a record at the time. It is the only such stamp known to exist.
He went from the airport to a news conference for the stamp show, the Canadian Philatelic Exhibition. No one noticed that when he slipped the key into the handcuffs, it broke. "I thought, just keep talking and worry about it later," Mr. Weinberg recalled in an interview in 2015.
After the news conference ended and the reporters dispersed, Mr. Weinberg told one of the stamp-show organizers that they had to find a way to free him. Security guards borrowed hairpins and tried paper clips. A firefighter who arrived produced a saw and was starting to cut into the handcuffs when the door opened and one of the reporters returned.
Mr. Weinberg, who liked to pull stunts to promote the stamp, said he remembered thinking, "This is exactly what I would want if I could dream up a thing like this."
The story of the stamp, the handcuffs stunt and the struggle to shed the shackles was picked up around the world and in People magazine, which wrote that the steel was too thick for the firefighter's hacksaw and that Mr. Weinberg was finally liberated with the help of a police officer's key.
Mr. Weinberg died at his home in Kingston, Pa., said his daughter, Jan, who survives him along with his sons, John (who is known as Jack) and Robert.
Mr. Weinberg had collected stamps since he was a boy. Even before he bought a rug-cleaning operation in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., in the 1950s, he ran a stamp business there. For more than 70 years he published Miner's Stamp News, a weekly newsletter that listed the stamps in his inventory.
In the late 1960s, Mr. Weinberg was sure that inflation would follow the end of the Vietnam War, and he concluded that nothing would be a better hedge against it than stamps. He considered luxury investments like gold or diamonds too risky. So he formed a stamp-purchasing partnership with several investors from the Wilkes-Barre area -- one was a lawyer, another owned hotels, another was a furniture manufacturer -- who each put up $50,000.
He was so confident in the Inverted Jenny, the United States stamp from 1918 featuring a biplane mistakenly printed upside-down, that in one month in 1969 he bought two -- one for $29,000, and the other for $33,000. In 1970, at the auction at which he bought the 1-cent magenta, he bought another Inverted Jenny for $34,000. In 1971, he bought another for $31,000. Only 100 Inverted Jennys exist.
But none of the purchases brought the attention that the 1-cent magenta did, from the moment he bought it in a standing-room-only auction at the Waldorf Astoria. Mr. Weinberg went on to take the stamp to Philadelphia in 1976 for the nation's bicentennial, and also to Japan, India and Australia. He appeared on the game show "To Tell the Truth" and on Mike Douglas's television talk show.
"I was trying to introduce it to the world," he said, "and maybe find a buyer."
He did, in 1980: John E. du Pont, an heir to the du Pont chemical fortune, paid $935,000 for the 1-cent magenta at auction.
Mr. du Pont's estate sold the stamp in 2014 for $9.5 million. Mr. du Pont was convicted of third-degree murder but was declared mentally ill in the 1996 shooting of the Olympic wrestler David Schultz, a case fictionalized in the 2014 movie "Foxcatcher." Mr. du Pont died in prison in 2010.
Mr. Weinberg's stunt with the handcuffs was not the only one he orchestrated, though it did not pay off in the way he planned. On one occasion, he arranged for an armored car to meet him at a Manhattan bank where he kept the stamp in a safe-deposit box.
He intended to slip the magenta into his briefcase, climb into the armored car, ride to Kennedy International Airport and fly off with the briefcase on his lap. He drummed up news coverage by telephoning a television station, which sent a camera crew to the bank.
"It was uneventful," Mr. Weinberg recalled in 2015, "excepting that the armored car got lost on the way to the airport."
He rushed onto the plane with the stamp in his briefcase. Everything else he had packed for the trip -- in the luggage he checked at the gate -- was lost.

Full text:   Given that Donald J. Trump appears to have locked up the Republican nomination after spending little on television ads, it may be hard to explain to younger Americans how a single commercial made a difference in the 1984 presidential campaign.
The one-minute commercial commonly known as "Morning in America," created for President Ronald Reagan's re-election effort in 1984, is one of the most effective campaign spots ever broadcast. The ad's haze of nostalgia and optimism helped obscure Mr. Reagan's lingering political problems with the deficit and unemployment.
The scenes in "Morning" would have fit almost seamlessly into the 1950s sitcoms "Father Knows Best" or "Leave It to Beaver." One difference is that the ad is rendered in soft, pastel colors similar to those used in "The Natural," the Robert Redford baseball film also released that year.
Set to the music of sentimental strings, images include a paperboy on his bicycle, a family taking a rolled rug into a house and campers raising an American flag. The subtext is that after 20 years of social tumult, assassinations, riots, scandal, an unpopular war and gas lines, Mr. Reagan returned the United States to the tranquillity of the 1950s.
[Video: The 1984 ad for President Ronald Reagan's re-election effort. Watch on YouTube.]
At the start of the ad, the narrator's melodious voice says: "It's morning again in America. Today more men and women will go to work than ever before in our country's history." This wording, which reflected the growth of the American population in four years, distracts from the fact that unemployment remained higher (at about 7.5 percent) than it was when Mr. Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter, left office.
In fact, Mr. Reagan's party had been blamed for a punishing recession. Using the slogan "Stay the course," Republicans lost 26 House seats and seven governorships in the 1982 midterm elections.
It's true that by 1984, the severe inflation that helped Mr. Reagan defeat Mr. Carter in 1980 was down significantly, but under Mr. Reagan, the deficit had more than doubled. Although times were improving, the president was potentially vulnerable to attack for having failed to fully keep his 1980 pledge to restore the American economy.
Nancy Reagan, who was, as ever, deeply involved in the way her husband was presented to the world, disliked the pedestrian ads produced for his 1980 campaign, which appeared to bend over backward not to make Mr. Reagan, an ex-actor, look "too Hollywood." And in 1984 what came to be called Tuesday Team Inc. (named for Election Day) entered the picture.
Unlike earlier presidential campaigns that gave their accounts to existing advertising agencies, the Reagan campaign constructed its own shop with about 40 stars of the industry, starting with BBDO's Phil Dusenberry, who had been co-screenwriter for "The Natural" and had produced Michael Jackson as he hawked Pepsi.
The team was quartered in a rented suite, without windows, above Radio City Music Hall. According to one member, Tom Messner, writing last month in Adweek, the group was offered free offices in -- of all places -- the newly opened Trump Tower, but that was dismissed as "a little showy."
"Morning in America" and several other Reagan TV ads were written by Hal Riney of Ogilvy & Mather in San Francisco. Known for his skill at appealing to the emotions, he was determined to demonstrate that negative political ads were not the only kind that worked.
Riney had created a dreamlike 1970 spot for Crocker National Bank depicting a couple being married, to the sound of a song he had commissioned from the songwriter Paul Williams called "We've Only Just Begun." The song was soon made into a hit by a rising brother-and-sister duo called the Carpenters.
By Mr. Messner's account, Mr. Reagan's pollster, Richard Wirthlin, and other Reagan lieutenants briefed the Tuesday Team on the president's accomplishments over two days in Washington. At one point, the president popped in and said, "If you're going to sell soap, you ought to see the bar."
Mr. Riney told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2004 that the briefings were "a total waste of time" because it was obvious that the main commercial should address how Mr. Reagan had turned the country around after Mr. Carter. He wrote "Morning" and several other Reagan ads quickly, while drinking bourbon in a bar below his Ogilvy office -- by his own account he was a heavy drinker in those days.
Mr. Riney used his own resonant voice to narrate "Morning in America." A full quarter of the commercial is devoted to a small-town church wedding that is almost a dead ringer for the one in Mr. Riney's Crocker Bank spot. The faces in the ad are overwhelmingly white.
The commercial boasted that interest rates were about half those of 1980, and that about 2,000 families a day were buying homes. Then, over the wedding images, it said, "This afternoon, 6,500 young men and women will be married."
The number of weddings held per day is not quite the chief metric an economist would use to measure the health of a society, but reciting this statistic allows the announcer to say, "They can look forward, with confidence, to the future."
Then the payoff: "Under the leadership of President Reagan, our country is prouder, and stronger, and better. Why would we ever want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?"
What's missing from "Morning in America" is Mr. Reagan. His face appears in the commercial for only two or three seconds, at the end -- a still color photo on a campaign button, next to an American flag.
Why wouldn't Mr. Riney (who died in 2008) call more attention to a leader now often remembered as one of the most beloved Americans of the 20th century?
Only 10 months before his re-election campaign began, Mr. Reagan's Gallup Poll approval rating had dropped to 35 percent, equal to President Lyndon Johnson's at its nadir during the Vietnam War. By mid-1984, it had rebounded to the mid-50s, but this was not a spectacular figure.
What this commercial had to sell, therefore, was not so much the still controversial president as the notion that under his leadership, good times were returning to the United States. (Mr. Riney's approach must have been influenced by the 1976 commercials for President Gerald Ford, which had marching bands and cheerful young singers performing the catchy jingle "I'm Feeling Good About America.")
On the campaign trail, Mr. Reagan's opponent, Walter Mondale, sensing the power of "Morning in America," complained: "It's all picket fences and puppy dogs. No one's hurting. No one's alone. No one's hungry. No one's unemployed. No one gets old. Everybody's happy."
Thirty-two years later, the Reagan campaign of 1984 is largely remembered for that one commercial. Few would argue that it saved Mr. Reagan from defeat by Mr. Mondale, who ultimately carried only Minnesota -- his home state -- and the District of Columbia. But it captivated many voters and helped push many of Mr. Reagan's problems to the periphery. In today's fractured media universe, it is unlikely that a single paid TV spot will again approach that kind of influence.

Full text:   After racing ahead for many months, the American jobs machine cooled in April, as employers took their cue from other signs that economic growth was slowing by easing up on new hiring.
The 160,000 increase in payrolls in April reported by the Labor Department on Friday followed the best two-year stretch for the job market since the tech-fueled boom of the late 1990s.
The unemployment rate, which is tied to a separate survey of households, was unchanged at 5 percent.
"It's a soft report but it doesn't portend a turn in the labor market," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. "I'd be more concerned if there were weakness across the board, but there wasn't."
Late last month, the government reported that the economy barely expanded in the first quarter. But most experts say the gains in the labor market in recent months are a more reliable sign, suggesting that the economy will continue to expand for the rest of 2016, and that the pace of growth will pick up modestly from the stagnant start to the year.
April's slower but still steady pace of payroll growth could be a sign of things to come. With economists expecting the economy to grow at an annual rate of 1.5 to 2.5 percent for the balance of 2016, monthly job gains may fall from the 192,000 pace registered so far this year.
The latest jobs data is likely to leave the Federal Reserve waiting for further signs of a pickup in activity before moving ahead with any interest rate increases. Fed officials will see one more jobs report before their next meeting in June.
William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview on Friday that the latest government data demonstrated that the labor market continued to improve gradually, in line with the Fed's expectations.
"It's a touch softer, maybe, than what people were expecting, but I wouldn't put a lot of weight on it in terms of how it would affect my economic outlook," he said.
Mr. Dudley added that it remained a "reasonable expectation" that the Fed would increase its benchmark interest rate two times this year.
The Labor Department also revised downward its estimate of the number of jobs added in February and March by 19,000.
Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago, pointed to the strong gain of 67,000 jobs in the business and professional services category as additional evidence that the broader slowdown in hiring last month was not an ominous sign of trouble ahead.
"The quality of the jobs improved but the quantity did not," she said, adding that the health of this heavily white-collar sector helped explain why wage growth was also robust.
The 0.3 percentage point rise in average hourly earnings was the most positive sign of the economy's trajectory in Friday's report.
Until recently, wages had been a sore point throughout the nearly seven-year-old recovery, barely rising in real terms despite the big drop in the unemployment rate.
The change in earnings in April suggested that the upward tick in wages was not a fluke. Over the last 12 months, wages are up 2.5 percent, well ahead of the pace of inflation.
In addition to a tighter labor market, which has prompted some major employers to raise their wage floor, dozens of states and cities either have already carried out or are considering increases in the minimum wage. Combined, those forces are helping push up pay at the low end of the job market.
"We've hit a tipping point," Ms. Swonk said. "It's showing up in low-wage jobs, for waiters and waitresses, in retail and in leisure and hospitality."
"The good news is that we are re-engaging people who've been on the sidelines," Ms. Swonk added.
States including California, Colorado, Michigan and Massachusetts increased their minimum wages at the start of 2016. Maryland and the District of Columbia are set to enact raises on July 1.
At a news conference Friday at the White House, President Obama said he was pleased that the United States economy had added 160,000 jobs in April, though he cautioned that "the global economy, as many people here are aware, is not growing as fast as it should be."
"Here in the United States, there are folks out there who are still hurting," Mr. Obama said, "and so we've got to do everything we can to strengthen the good trends and to guard against some dangerous trends in the global economy."
With the race to succeed President Obama now moving from the primary phase into the general election campaign, the April jobs report contained fodder for candidates in both parties.
Democrats can point to the rise in wages as evidence that conditions are improving, but the slowdown in hiring, particularly among manufacturing industries, and a large drop in the number of Americans in the work force may add to complaints among blue-collar workers that they are being left behind.
The proportion of Americans in the labor force dropped last month to 62.8 percent from 63 percent in March, partly reversing a rebound that began last fall after the participation rate hit lows last seen in the 1970s.
Like the unemployment rate, participation in the labor force is measured in the Labor Department's household survey, which is separate from the survey of businesses that is used to calculate the change in payrolls.
Although the two tend to correlate over time, the household data is more volatile than the payroll survey, and April was no exception. It showed more than half a million people leaving the labor force.
For college-educated workers, many of them supporters of Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side, the already low jobless rate declined even further to 2.4 percent. The unemployment rate for Americans with a high school diploma, who have contributed to the crowds supporting the G.O.P. standard-bearer Donald Trump, was unchanged at 5.4 percent.
The unemployment rate for workers without a high school diploma increased slightly to 7.5 percent in April, continuing a rise from 6.7 percent at the end of 2015.
The payroll numbers and the unemployment rate tend to dominate the headlines, but the Federal Reserve also pays close attention to the participation rate.
While Mr. Dudley, the New York Fed president, left open the possibility of higher interest rates in June, economists predicted that April's softness might persuade Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, and her colleagues to remain cautious about future rate increases.
After the report, Barclays told clients in a note that the April data put a rate increase in June "off the table" and the that bank now expected only one interest rate increase by the Fed this year.
Some notable pockets of weakness remain in the nation's economy.
In the first three months of 2016, factories shed 47,000 jobs, hurt in part by a stronger dollar and weaker overseas demand. Manufacturing employment rose by 4,000 in April. The oil patch is still reeling from the impact of sharply lower energy prices, despite a recent rebound. Other commodity-based industries like metals and mining are also hurting.
Between January 2015 and March 2016, the mining and logging industry lost 170,000 jobs. In April, miners and loggers cut another 8,000 jobs.
Public sector employment unexpectedly fell by 11,000. And pacesetters with big gains in previous months, like retailers, hit the brakes on new hiring.
When approximately 40,000 Verizon workers went on strike last month, it was right in the middle of the week that government number crunchers analyze to gauge the strength of the job market.
Before the report, some economists predicted that the strike could have a modest impact on the numbers. Mr. Gapen, the Barclays economist, said he did not think that was the case, because the telecommunications industry did not register a big drop in employment.
In hot fields like health care, technology and professional services, employers are scrambling to find new employees. In Chicago, ContextMedia, which provides tablets and digital wallboards for doctors' offices, brought 25 new employees aboard in April. The company plans to add about 100 workers a quarter for the rest of 2016, said Iman Jalali, the company's chief of staff.
"We're trying to attract talent from across the country," he added. "We've got some of the best people in Chicago, but when you are growing so quickly, you need to keep growing the pool."

Workers Are Getting a Bit More of the Economic Pie

Abstract: A big part of the story is a steep decline in the profitability of the energy sector, reflecting a much lower price of oil and natural gas. The shift of national income toward shareholders and away from workers since the 1980s was driven in part by a decline in union power and a rise in shareholder-driven capitalism that made managers more ruthless than their predecessors in seeking to minimize salary expense.

Full text:   American workers are reaping fewer of the gains of a growing economy in the form of pay and benefits. Shareholders are reaping more in the form of corporate profits. That shift has been one of the most important economic stories of the last several decades, and it is the key to understanding stagnant wages for middle-class workers and a soaring stock market in the last quarter-century.
Here is what is less widely understood: That trend appears to be reversing itself.
It is early and the reversal may not last. And it certainly hasn't fully undone the shift underway since the 1980s. But the numbers are quite clear that in the last couple of years workers have claimed a bigger piece of the economic pie and shareholders a smaller one.
The evidence available so far in 2016 -- steady growth in wages and weak earnings for publicly traded companies -- suggests that the reversal is continuing this year.
At the start of 2013, for example, 61 percent of national income went to pay and benefits for workers. But by the end of 2015, that had risen to 62.6 percent. (That said, in the early 1990s, that figure was around 66 percent.)
If the proportion of national income going to workers in early 2013 had stayed constant, there would now be $251 billion a year less flowing into Americans' paychecks than is the case. That is about $1,900 a year per household.
At the same time, corporate profits' share of national income has fallen, from 14.2 percent in the middle of 2014 to 12.1 percent by the end of 2015. That translates to $328 billion less in annual corporate profits than there would be if the earlier proportion had held.
You can pick different numerators and denominators to get at the same concept -- using just wages and salaries instead of total compensation, for example, or dividing by gross domestic product instead of the related concept of national income -- but the same basic pattern reveals itself.
And there is plenty of other anecdotal information and data consistent with the shift. Among the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500, first-quarter earnings are on track to be 7.6 percent lower than a year earlier. Weak earnings growth, and lately an outright contraction in corporate profits, are a culprit in a stock market that has largely moved sideways for more than two years.
A big part of the story is a steep decline in the profitability of the energy sector, reflecting a much lower price of oil and natural gas. Total corporate profits were $64 billion lower in 2015 than in 2014. A fall in the profitability of the petroleum and coal products sector accounted for $40 billion of that.
There may be something broader going on that is holding back corporate profits beyond simply cheap oil. You might expect that the hit to profits in the energy sector caused by cheaper fuel would be counterbalanced by higher profits in sectors that use fuel, like airlines and trucking firms.
That is where the other side of the equation -- higher worker compensation -- comes into play. Part of the reason corporate profits are falling appears to be that companies are having to pay their employees more.
Hiring has been quite strong over three years, with millions of Americans getting jobs. That has pushed the unemployment rate steadily downward, to about 5 percent. Very gradually, a labor market that was very much tilted in favor of employers is tilting the other way.
That means companies are having to work harder to attract good employees. They do that by paying higher wages and salaries (up 10 percent in 2015 compared with 2013) and more generous benefits package (up 6 percent over the two-year period).
It is worth noting that this doesn't necessarily mean that pay is rising by that much for the typical worker. After all, the pay for chief executives and other highly paid people counts in those compensation numbers.
Still, paired with other evidence, it doesn't look as if this is solely a phenomenon of the highest-paid workers making more. For example, average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial private sector workers rose 2.56 percent in 2015 in a year of very low inflation. That number was only 1.69 percent in 2012, when inflation was higher.
It is hard to say definitively what has driven these trends, but here's a try:
The shift of national income toward shareholders and away from workers since the 1980s was driven in part by a decline in union power and a rise in shareholder-driven capitalism that made managers more ruthless than their predecessors in seeking to minimize salary expense. (That includes refusing to give raises and laying off employees.)
That long-term trend, along with a cyclical downturn during the 2008 recession and its aftermath, left workers with very little bargaining power and shareholders with the upper hand.
In the last two or three years, as the economy has firmed up, workers have regained some of that bargaining power they lost in the recession. But they have not, at this point at least, gained the power they lost over the last three decades.
In the meantime, workers celebrate getting a little bit bigger piece of the economic pie, and shareholders bemoan their smaller piece.
It would be better if the pie were bigger to begin with. If overall national income were rising rapidly (it decidedly isn't), there would be room for both workers and shareholders to be fat and happy. One of the great questions for the economic future is what it would take to make that happen.

Full text:   Not too long ago, Brazilians might have been counted as the most optimistic people in the world. From 2008 to 2013, as the United States and Europe grappled with the aftermath of a crisis wrought by blind trust in unfettered finance, Brazil's income per person grew 12 percent after inflation. Wages soared. The poverty rate plummeted. Even income inequality narrowed.
Brazil remained only a high-middle-income country, in the technospeak of the International Monetary Fund. But for the first time in forever, the eternal "country of tomorrow," as Brazilians often ruefully described their nation, saw itself instead as a rampant member of the emerging cohort of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) -- maybe even closer than China to making the jump into the ranks of the world's richest nations.
And then it didn't happen.
Between 2015 and 2017, the Brazilian economy is expected to shrink 8 percent, in the I.M.F.'s estimation. That is deeper than the contraction of the early 1980s, which began what in Brazil and much of Latin America is still known as the "lost decade."
Unemployment hit 11 percent in the first quarter. Brazilians are so angry that they are about to impeach their president. The development of Brazil into an advanced economy -- once tantalizingly within sight -- again seems more like an elusive mirage.
What gives?
Mistaken hopes inspired by high commodity prices are common in Latin America. With China insatiably buying Brazilian iron and soybeans, it was hard for policy makers not to feel invincible as rock-bottom interest rates in the United States pushed a wave of money into Brazilian bonds.
"Lula thought he was an economic genius," said José A. Scheinkman, a noted Brazilian economist now at Columbia University, about Brazil's previous president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who stepped down in January 2011.
The commodity boom, however, did not a new economic paradigm make. The hubristic belief that it had led to critical policy mistakes.
"The boom delayed other policies that were costly to implement: judicial reforms, tax reforms, education reforms, labor market reforms, opening up to foreign trade," said Alejandro Werner, who heads the Western Hemisphere department at the I.M.F.
When Dilma Rousseff succeeded Mr. da Silva as president, she doubled down on the populist alternative. Markets are overrated, she concluded. The kind of politically painful but economically beneficial reforms the I.M.F. likes are pointless. Better to develop the economy by the hand of the state.
Brazil's economy has long been notably closed to the world. Its average applied tariff of 10 percent, according to the World Trade Organization, is the highest among the BRICS. But that did not stop the Brazilian government from further increasing subsidies and protection for favored sectors, like the auto industry. The three federal development banks did so much subsidized lending that by last year they accounted for well over half of all lending in Brazil.
There is nothing inherently wrong with government action to spur the economy. Yet the Brazilian government did not know when to stop. Often, interventions smacked more of political opportunism than ideological resolve. Increases in the minimum wage -- a critical benchmark used to index wages, pensions and a host of prices -- were extremely popular. So were caps on regulated prices for gasoline and electricity, which kept the inflation rate from rising way past its official target.
"It was a classical mistake of political economy," said Rubens Ricúpero, a Brazilian economist and diplomat who was minister of finance in the mid-1990s. "They wanted to stay in power."
Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, dates the populist shift to 2006, when President da Silva was hit with a vote-buying scandal known as "mensalão."
"After that he became much more populist," she said. "He needed support not to be ousted from office."
The case for populism only intensified as Mr. da Silva fought to ensure the election of his anointed heir, Ms. Rousseff, and as she battled to ensure her own re-election in 2014, after the commodity boom had lost much of its steam. Ultimately, the strategy opened the way for her impeachment when it was discovered that the state-owned banks were in effect surreptitiously funding the government, hiding a growing budget deficit.
Even without the scandals and mistakes, Brazil would be facing rocky times. China's cooling appetite for Brazil's commodities and the gradual tightening of monetary policy in the United States were bound to slow the economy. But what turned the downturn into a crisis was bad policy making. When the foreign outlook dimmed, Brazil's economy was strangled by fast-rising public debt fed by billions in loans gone bad to former national champions.
Revelations of rampant corruption were hardly surprising, given the cozy relationship between corporate Brazil and a government dispensing contracts, subsidies, preferred loans and other protections.
What is the rest of the world to learn from Brazil's troubles?
"Lula walked back slowly to the old closed economic model," said Armínio Fraga, who headed the central bank in the 1990s, during Brazil's fairly brief flirtation with opening up its economy. "It worked while commodities and financial conditions were doing well but became unsustainable when that was over."
Brazil was not alone. Until the 1980s, governments all over Latin America flirted with similar policies of state control. More recently, Venezuela and Argentina spent much of the last 10 years increasing the government's hold on the economy.
One important lesson is that the choices faced by governments in Latin America and developing nations around the world do not necessarily pit free markets against policies to combat poverty and foster social inclusion. Brazil's anti-poverty strategy started in the 1990s, well before its turn toward state control. And most of Brazil's enormous subsidies over the last few years went to large corporations, not the poor.
"Businessmen all supported the interventions with the exchange rate and interest rates, the subsidized credit and the interventions in prices of electricity and gasoline," said Marcos Lisboa, who heads Insper, an educational and research institute in São Paulo. "They didn't support opening the country to trade."
Nor do Brazil's misfortunes amount to a wholesale indictment of the Latin American left. Mr. Ricúpero, the former finance minister, notes that Bolivia and Ecuador, run by left-leaning governments, exhibited more cautious economic management and avoided Brazil's fate.
"Not every government with a social inclination will necessarily do the same as Brazil," he said.
Brazil's downfall offers a more complicated lesson: Development is hard. And if Brazil's rise and fall offer lessons about government's inherent limitations, the Great American Meltdown of 2008 similarly offers a cautionary tale about allowing markets to run wild.
Avoiding turning inward is the biggest challenge. As Latin America has proved time and again, it is a recipe for low productivity growth. Relying on commodities has failed time and again, too. But even the successful export-led models -- Taiwan and South Korea most prominently -- no longer seem so useful in a world where much manufacturing will soon be done by robots.
But there are other common-sense recommendations to come out of such experiences: Invest in human capital, manage commodity bonanzas with caution, recognize that openness to foreign competition is necessary to develop.
As President Obama might put it, don't do stupid stuff. Easy, feel-good recipes -- especially those found wanting in the past -- will probably fail if you try them again. That goes for the United States, too. America's very own populist, Donald Trump -- offering walls and tariff barriers to his aggrieved supporters -- could learn something from the Brazilian experience. He probably won't.

Full text:   Stocks fell Friday as health care and technology companies continued to report weak first-quarter results, but late buying allowed them to avoid major losses.
Stocks opened lower and fell further throughout the morning, extending a downturn from the day before. That followed a rout in European indexes.
Late in the day, bond prices rose again, sending yields lower and pushing investors to buy utility and phone company stocks.
Dan Suzuki, senior United States equities strategist at Bank of America, said investors did not like what they were seeing in the results from technology companies. He said investors were turning to bondlike stocks, like phone and utility companies, and small- and midcap stocks, which struggled in 2015.
"Everything that was working through last year has been an underperformer this year, and vice versa," he said.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.51 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,065.30. The Nasdaq composite index lost 29.93 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,775.36, in its seventh consecutive decline.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined by 57.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,773.64. It was down as much as 178 points earlier in the day.
Health care companies had the biggest losses after several weak earnings reports. The biotech drug maker Gilead Sciences said its results were hurt by big discounts and rebates on its costly hepatitis C medicines, and its stock lost $8.79, or 9.1 percent, to $88.21. The biotech giant Amgen reported relatively solid results, but its shares fell $2.26, or 1.4 percent, to $158.30.
The health insurer Molina Healthcare slashed its full-year guidance because of higher medical costs in Ohio and Texas, expenses related to recent acquisitions, and pharmacy costs, especially in Puerto Rico. It plunged $12.46, or 19.4 percent, to $51.76.
Cepheid, a molecular diagnostics company, lost $6.86, or 19.4 percent, to $28.54 as analysts were disappointed with its revenue projections for the second quarter.
Tech stocks continued to slide. After its profit fell short of estimates, the electronic storage company Seagate Technology lost $5.13, or 19.1 percent, to $21.77. Western Digital, a hard drive maker, dropped $5.19, or 11.3 percent, to $40.87. Apple, which is in a deep two-week slide, fell a further $1.09, or 1.2 percent, to $93.75. Like the Nasdaq, Apple has fallen for seven consecutive days.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.84 percent from 1.82 percent. Utility companies made the biggest gains, as NextEra Energy added $1.11, or 1 percent, to $117.58.
While earnings hurt technology and health care companies, better results at consumer companies sent those stocks higher. Amazon said its revenue jumped 28 percent in the first quarter, and the company turned a far bigger profit than analysts had expected. The cloud-based Amazon Web Services performed well. Amazon shares rose $57.59, or 9.6 percent, to $656.59.
The consumer products maker Newell Brands gave a strong outlook for the year after its reported solid results in the first quarter, and its stock rose $2.12, or 4.9 percent, to $45.54.
Expedia, an online travel company, reported a bigger adjusted profit and greater sales than expected, and its stock added $8.86, or 8.3 percent, to $115.77.
Rovi, a digital television listing company, said it would buy the digital video recording company TiVo for about $1.1 billion in cash and stock. TiVo gained shares 56 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $9.98 and Rovi rose 27 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $17.62.
Stocks in Europe took big losses. Official data showed the eurozone economy rose by a surprising 0.6 percent in the first quarter, but investors were concerned that inflation slipped in April. France's CAC 40 fell 2.8 percent and Germany's DAX lost 2.7 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.3 percent.
The yen continued to gain strength, as it has done over the last few months. It jumped Thursday after the Bank of Japan held off on any new economic stimulus measures. On Friday the dollar fell to 106.37 yen from 108.01 yen. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday Friday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 1.5 percent and Seoul's Kospi gave up 0.3 percent.
Metals prices continued to rise. Gold advanced $24.10, or 1.9 percent, to $1,290.50 an ounce and silver rose 23 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $17.82 an ounce. Gold is trading at 15-month highs. Copper picked up 5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.28 a pound.
Benchmark United States crude lost 11 cents to $45.92 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 1 cent to $48.13 a barrel in London.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Heating oil fell 3 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $1.38 a gallon. Natural gas rose 10 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $2.18 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The euro rose to $1.1448 from $1.1354.

Full text:   By one measure, the economic crisis that has long ravaged Europe is finally over.
On Friday, the European Union released data showing that the overall economy of the 19 countries that use the euro advanced 0.6 percent over the first three months of the year, compared with the previous quarter.
That gain, equivalent to an annual rate of 2.2 percent, brought the eurozone's gross domestic product for the period -- the total value of goods and services produced -- to slightly above the previous peak reached in the early months of 2008, before the crisis emerged and Europe's core economy descended into a pair of crippling recessions.
"The long-awaited recovery may finally be consolidating," said Iain Begg, a research fellow at the European Institute of the London School of Economics.
Yet as milestones go, Europe's return to precrisis levels of economic activity came with so many qualifiers that any celebration seemed premature, at best, and at worst like a mockery for the tens of millions of ordinary Europeans who have far from recovered. New unemployment data on Friday showed that the eurozone jobless rate, while edging down slightly, remained above 10 percent -- more than twice the level in the United States.
"It's almost a lost decade," said Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist and a professor at Columbia University. "It's a remarkable testimony to the economic failure of the euro and the eurozone."
The strongest economies in the eurozone -- major exporters like Germany and the Netherlands -- have recovered more handily. But in the worst-hit countries -- Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Italy -- ordinary people continue to grapple with the consequences of deep job losses and wage cuts, which have slashed incomes.
In Italy, disposable income for the average household -- essentially, take-home pay -- shrank 4 percent from 2008 to 2014, according to European Union data. Over those years, Greek households lost 24 percent of their disposable income, and Cyprus suffered declines of 22 percent. At the same time, German households gained more than 15 percent.
So much time has passed with overall European fortunes frozen or even sliding backward that doubts pervade about the ability of the Continent to ever again achieve sustained robust growth. In a place that is home to some of the world's wealthiest countries -- founts of precise German engineering, Italian luxury goods and French gastronomical excess -- children have been born and raised to primary school age while commercial life around them has achieved practically no gains.
And there are few signs that things will improve soon. Major banks across the Continent remain reluctant to lend, starving even healthy businesses of capital needed to expand and hire. Concerns about the global economy -- especially the slowdown in China -- threaten to crimp Europe's export growth, which has been at the center of the recovery.
To be sure, Friday's preliminary data -- a new early-stage snapshot of growth released by the European Union -- showed the eurozone advancing during the first quarter at a stronger pace than the United States economy, which managed only a 0.5 percent annualized rate in the same period.
But clouding the eurozone growth data was another new figure on Friday, indicating that consumer prices in the currency union were down 0.2 percent in April. Low inflation, or even periodic falling prices in the eurozone, has been a persistent problem, a sign of economic stagnation that continues to resist efforts by the European Central Bank to raise inflation, spending and borrowing to healthier levels.
Many economists now discuss Europe's prospects with the grim vernacular long used to describe Japan. There, a real estate bubble in the 1980s gave way to a calamitous bust that left banks reeling. Decades of half-measures aimed at finessing the economy to better days kept the ship of state afloat but left it in the doldrums.
"Europe is just sort of hanging on," said Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund who is a professor at Harvard. "It's very much like Japan, where Japan chose not to grab the bulls by the horns. It's still a very rich country. It's stable, but it's in decline."
Even "hanging on" may amount to an aspiration. The terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have left Europe on knife's edge, with policy makers and investors cognizant that people with lethal intentions are no doubt plotting more. Refugees and migrants continue to stream toward the Continent, propelled by terrible conflicts in Libya, Syria and elsewhere. This has thrown another fraught and complex problem at European governments that have shown little mastery of coordinated action.
In Britain, voters face a June 23 ballot to decide whether their country ought to remain part of the European Union. If they opt for a so-called Brexit -- and polls have shown the numbers are close -- that will initiate a two-year period in which leaders in London and Brussels will need to negotiate a divorce.
No one really knows what will happen then, but a host of research institutions have issued reports warning of economic costs should a split ensue. An exit vote would also most likely reinvigorate separatist movements in Scotland and elsewhere, threatening the European Union with fragmentation. In the meantime, uncertainty reigns.
The United States engineered a faster and more vigorous recovery from the Great Recession via a burst of government spending and tax cuts, combined with aggressive central bank action. By late 2011, less than four years after the downturn began, G.D.P. was back to its precrisis level, reaching $15 trillion.
The eurozone, which generated [euro]2.48 trillion in economic activity during the first quarter, is only now on track to surpass its 2008 full-year gross domestic product. of just below [euro]10 trillion, or about $11.3 trillion.
It has been hobbled by the basic afflictions of its peculiar setup: The euro currency is a shared enterprise, yet the 19 national governments that now use it operate their own budgets, while having to abide by limits on borrowing.
In other countries, economic weakness generally pushes down the value of the currency, making goods cheaper on world markets relative to competitors' and lifting exports. But in the eurozone, all the countries are stuck with the same value for their currency, regardless of their individual troubles.
"The crisis began in the United States, yet the rigidities associated with the euro meant that it was the eurozone that wound up the big loser," Mr. Stiglitz said. "It's worth noting that, over that period, Japan, the rest of Europe and the United States all performed better. This is a euro disease."
Germany, which plays the dominant role in setting eurozone economic policy, has been unwilling to allow national governments to run larger deficits to stimulate their economies, while demanding that they enact policies that make it easier for employers to hire and fire. The result has been Continentwide austerity marinated in acrimony.
"The French and Italians have been shouting at the Germans, 'You should expand and then we'll all be better off,"' Mr. Begg said. "The Germans have been shouting back, 'No, you should sort out your mess and then we'll all grow together."'
The eurozone economy has made progress since the crisis hit, even if its size is roughly the same. Eight years ago, finance and construction made up a greater share of the economy than today, a reminder of the overbuilding that left banks tallying disastrous lending losses. Now, exports are more pronounced, a trend enhanced by the decline of the euro, which has surrendered 28 percent of its value against the dollar since the summer of 2008. This has made European goods cheaper on world markets.
But the ability of European businesses to continue to rack up export growth faces challenges. China, the European Union's second-largest trading partner behind the United States, absorbed roughly 10 percent of Europe's exported wares last year, according to the bloc's data. As China slows, that will most likely diminish its appetite for Europe's products.
"There isn't much help for the eurozone in the broader global economy," said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Beyond the worries of the moment, a rapidly aging population appears very likely to constrain Europe's fortunes. While Europe's high levels of productivity should continue to support a comfortable standard of living and a strong social safety net for much of its population, fewer people working means fewer goods being produced and services rendered.
"The potential growth rate in Europe is probably 1 percent," Mr. Kirkegaard added. "We shouldn't therefore expect growth to be much greater than it is today. This is, quite frankly, as good as it gets."

Full text:   The nation's gross domestic product advanced at a mere 0.5 percent annual growth rate during the first quarter after a mediocre increase for the final quarter of 2015, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday, suggesting that the economy is stalled.
But the job market, according to Labor Department figures released in recent months, appears to be at its healthiest point since the boom of the late 1990s.
Which picture is right?
On one side of the equation, hiring and wages -- of particular importance to the 95 percent of the labor force that already has a job -- are moving firmly in the right direction. On the other, the economy's expansion continues to be lackluster: The pace of growth in the first quarter was the slowest in two years.
Both yardsticks contain a measure of truth. And the explanation is the apparent lack of improvement in productivity -- the output of individual workers -- despite dazzling advances in Silicon Valley, America's technological frontier, and a continuing economic recovery that is nearing its seventh anniversary.
For now, at least, many businesses, are finding it more advantageous to hire more workers than to invest in new technology or equipment to increase output and meet growing demand.
In the short term, this could be seen as a positive, especially with millions of Americans just now coming back into the job market after being sidelined during and after the Great Recession.
But in the long term, this phenomenon threatens to undermine the nation's prosperity, said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.
"Economists view productivity growth and technological change as driving improvements in standards of living over time," Mr. Gapen said. "A permanent slowdown in productivity growth would suggest that living standards rise more slowly."
He noted that productivity had been increasing at an annual rate of about half a percentage point over the last five years. That is well below the Internet-driven 2.5 percent gains recorded annually in the second half of the 1990s, and below the more typical 1.5 percent rate of productivity gains in previous decades.
"We can tell stories about why it's so weak, but nobody really knows," Mr. Gapen said. ""I think productivity growth can rebound, but the fear is that it won't."
Whatever the answer, it's clear that businesses have grown much more wary of new investments recently, and the clearest evidence of that has emerged in the last two quarters.
Much of the recent downturn in business spending is a result of much lower prices for oil, metals and other commodities, and fears of a slowdown in China and elsewhere around the world that are putting a crimp on investment opportunities.
"It doesn't look like there's any danger of recession, but the global economy and commodities are weak," said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC. "The global commodity shock has affected growth in the U.S. in a way that was unexpected, especially in terms of the energy industry."
Still, Mr. Logan said, "The consumer is fundamentally sound, as is the housing market."
He added: "Things are O.K. domestically, with growth in sectors like leisure, health care and technology, and spending is moving along steadily."
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits last week rose by 9,000 to 257,000. Despite the increase, the number was slightly smaller than expected, and new jobless claims remained very close to lows last seen in the early 1970s.
The first-quarter results reinforced what has become something of an annual economic rite in recent years -- a weak first quarter, followed by optimistic predictions that a rebound is just around the corner. (The gross domestic product report on Thursday is the first of three estimates; subsequent revisions could move the number significantly higher or lower.)
In 2015, the economy barely grew early on, recovered its footing in the spring and summer, but finished the year with a mediocre growth rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter.
The optimists may be right that growth will pick up for the rest of 2016 as it did last year, but the trajectory of the economic recovery remains frustratingly uneven. And over all, the growth in the United States has been lackluster ever since the nation pulled out of recession in 2009.
After a shaky start to this year, the stock market has rebounded and energy prices have stabilized, providing some comfort to the oil industry, which has undergone big cuts in hiring and investment in Texas, Oklahoma and other oil patch areas.
Recession fears, which dominated the headlines and fixated traders on Wall Street three months ago, have largely faded. Volatility in Europe and Asian markets has also eased.
In the United States, after years of stagnation, wages are perking up.
New research released earlier this month by ADP, which compiles payroll data from hundreds of thousands of corporate clients, showed wages rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent last quarter for full-time employees who have been working for at least one year. In the last quarter of 2015, wages for this group rose 4.1 percent.
While ADP's figures show a bigger increase than similar government metrics for the entire working population, the basic message from the data is the same: As labor markets tighten, American workers are finally getting a raise.
"We have good momentum in terms of the job market," said Ahu Yildirmaz, ADP's head of research.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve policy makers put off any move to raise interest rates, in part because of the persistent weakness in growth. But in a statement after the meeting, they acknowledged crosscurrents in the economy.
"Labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed," the Fed concluded, adding that household income, consumer sentiment and the housing sector all looked reasonably healthy.
Despite the overall improvement, there is plenty of pain in some corners of the economy.
Factories shed nearly 50,000 jobs in February and March, wiping out all of the gains recorded last year. The proportion of Americans in the active labor force remains depressed by historical standards, and more than six million workers say they are in part-time positions because they cannot find full-time work.
But for the winners in the American economy, be they individuals or companies, there is a lot less to complain about these days.
"Since we launched four years ago, our business has been growing like a rocket ship," said Bayard Winthrop, chief executive of American Giant, which makes sweatshirts, T-shirts and other types of activewear at mills in North Carolina.
American Giant is focused on casual, comfortable clothes, and eschews stores in favor of direct sales through its website. "Made in U.S.A. really appeals to people," Mr. Winthrop said.
His company has more than 300 employees and "we are hiring sewers as fast as we can," Mr. Winthrop said. "Growth has not been our problem."

Abstract: [...]the HPV vaccine prevents most cases of cervical cancer, but even now, 40 percent of adolescent girls don't get the vaccination, along with 58 percent of boys (the vaccine protects boys from other, rarer cancers and can benefit their partners). The Title X national family planning program provides LARCs, cancer screenings and much more, and an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute found that Title X-supported clinics prevent three women a day from dying of cervical cancer -- and also prevent one million unplanned pregnancies a year and 345,000 abortions.

Full text:   What if we talked about gun violence, and discussed only bullet size?
To me, that seems akin to the presidential campaign discussion of women's health. Somehow in nine Democratic debates, not a single question was asked about women's health, and when the issue came up elsewhere it was often in the narrowest form, about abortion: Democrats proclaim a woman's right to choose, and Republicans thunder about the sanctity of human life.
Women's health goes far beyond that. It should be a national scandal that a woman dies of cervical cancer almost once every two hours. That about 70 percent of pregnancies to young, unmarried women are unplanned. That a woman dies every eight hours from domestic violence.
In each case, we know how to address these problems. But we're not doing it urgently enough.
It may seem, er, odd for a man to be raising the topic, but the lives of women shouldn't be a priority for women alone. Mark Twain once mused about where men would be without women: "They would be scarce, sir -- almighty scarce." Twain is right that we men have a stake in the status of women, for we are sons, husbands and fathers to women we love.
The shortcomings in women's health parallel those of men's health and children's health, and include a myopia about the importance of preventive and reproductive health. It's a tragedy that nearly a dozen women die a day of cervical cancer in the United States, many of them young women in the prime of life. This is utterly unnecessary, for cervical cancer can be detected early with screenings and then defeated, but many women just don't get screenings.
Likewise, the HPV vaccine prevents most cases of cervical cancer, but even now, 40 percent of adolescent girls don't get the vaccination, along with 58 percent of boys (the vaccine protects boys from other, rarer cancers and can benefit their partners).
When nearly a dozen women die a day of something so preventable -- far more than are killed by, say, terrorism -- you'd think we'd be urgently trying to save lives. In some ways we have made progress: Kudos to President Obama for making HPV vaccinations and cervical cancer screenings typically free.
But we're going backward when states close Planned Parenthood clinics that perform the screenings, without even ensuring that there are alternatives in place.
A second under-addressed area of women's health is family planning. A slight majority of American women will have an unplanned pregnancy at some point in their lives, and surveys show that American kids have sex about as often as European kids but have babies about three times as often as Spanish kids and eight times as often as Swiss kids. That's partly because of meager U.S. sex education, and partly because of a lack of access to contraception, particularly LARCs -- long-acting reversible contraceptives, like implants and IUDs.
The Title X national family planning program provides LARCs, cancer screenings and much more, and an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute found that Title X-supported clinics prevent three women a day from dying of cervical cancer -- and also prevent one million unplanned pregnancies a year and 345,000 abortions. That makes Title X one of the most successful anti-abortion programs, yet Republicans regularly try to defund it. After inflation, Title X now has less than one-third as much money as in 1980.
"Women's health" goes beyond the pelvis, so the conversation should include domestic violence. A woman is assaulted in the United States every nine seconds, and 20,000 calls a day are placed to domestic violence hotlines. When millions of women are beaten, threatened or stalked by current or former boyfriends or husbands, what is that but a women's health issue?
I'll never forget hearing from women in shelters about the gut-wrenching fear for themselves and their children that they constantly face -- often with little help from the authorities.
In each of these areas, we have solutions. Screenings and HPV vaccinations prevent deaths from cervical cancer. Ready access to LARCs hugely reduce unplanned pregnancies and abortions. Cracking down on domestic violence offenders, mandating treatment and taking guns from those under protection orders -- all these help. But we're not doing enough.
So let's broaden the conversation about women's health this political season, for the benefit of women and the men who love them.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, determined to move cautiously, said on Wednesday that the American economy still was not ready for higher interest rates.
The Fed said that the labor market continued to get stronger, yet it made the widely expected decision not to raise its benchmark interest rate, which remains close to zero, and it offered no suggestion that a rate increase was imminent.
In a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, the Fed painted a mixed picture of the American economy. "Labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed," the Federal Open Market Committee said. It noted similarly that incomes had climbed while household spending had slowed.
The case against higher rates is basically that it makes sense to err on the side of stimulus. By holding borrowing costs at low levels, Fed officials say, it will be relatively easy to respond to stronger inflation by doing less to encourage spending and borrowing. If the Fed raises rates prematurely, however, it will have little room to correct the error by doing more.
The central bank left itself room to maneuver, though, and the Fed's two-handed assessment of economic conditions appeared to confuse financial markets.
Investors initially bid up yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, suggesting they expected interest rates to rise more quickly than anticipated before the meeting. But then they reversed course and drove yields sharply lower. The 10-year yield ended the trading day down 4 percent at 1.85 percent.
Some analysts still think the Fed may raise rates at its next meeting, in June, particularly if other economic indicators show the same strength as job growth. Others, however, said they did not expect a rate increase until later in the year.
Over all, investors are betting against June, putting the chance of an increase around 20 percent, and the Fed on Wednesday made little effort to change minds.
"There was a distinct absence of teeing up a hike in June," economists at BNP Paribas wrote in an analysis. "Indeed, it is difficult to see how a hike could be delivered, despite reduced external risks, until the economy takes on a more positive tone."
TD Securities, which had predicted an increase in June, said it now expected none until September.
"Relax and enjoy your summer!" said Craig Bishop, lead strategist for the fixed income group at RBC Wealth Management, writing off a rate increase until November.
The Fed already had backed away from its December projection that it would raise rates four times this year. Officials in March predicted just two rate increases. But Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said this month that she did not regard the December increase as a mistake, and she and other officials have continued to suggest that more moves are likely this year.
"I said at the time and continue to feel that the economy had made very substantial progress," Ms. Yellen said at an event in New York.
Other officials, too, have cautioned against assuming too much caution.
"I do not see that the risks are so elevated, nor the outlook so pessimistic, as to justify the exceptionally shallow interest rate path currently reflected in financial futures markets," Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in New Britain, Conn., last week.
While the Fed's latest statement acknowledged the weakness of some recent economic data, it also noted a number of reasons that growth could gain strength.
"Much of the weakness in economic activity that manifested in recent data appears to have been downplayed in the statement and is in any case largely in the rear view as far as the committee is concerned," said Michael Dolega, a senior economist at TD Bank.
For example, there is a divide in the recent rounds of government data between the reported strength of job growth and the reported weakness of overall economic activity. The early estimates of job growth are historically more accurate, and the Fed's choice of language suggested Fed officials think the reported economic weakness may be overstated. The statement described job growth as improved but said economic growth "appears" to have slowed.
The Commerce Department is scheduled to report its initial estimate of first-quarter growth in economic activity on Thursday; the number is expected to be modest, perhaps little more than a 1 percent annual pace.
The statement also suggested that the Fed's concerns about global economic weakness had diminished. The Fed's last statement, in March, described global conditions as a headwind for domestic growth. The April statement said merely that the Fed continued to monitor global economic and financial developments.
The change may reflect better news from China, but the Fed still appears to be unusually attentive to global developments. One looming risk is the British referendum in late June on continued membership in the European Union.
On inflation, too, the Fed appears to be waiting for expected improvement.
Since the financial crisis, the economy has consistently fallen short of the Fed's annual inflation target of 2 percent. And some officials have expressed concern that recent declines in measures of inflation expectations may reflect a loss of confidence the Fed will hit the target in future years.
Some measures of expectations have shown signs of rebounding. One such measure compares two kinds of Treasuries, one of which increases in value to compensate investors for inflation. This comparison shows investors are demanding compensation for annual inflation of about 1.74 percent in five years, up from just 1.47 percent in late February.
When government data showed faster inflation at the beginning of 2016, Fed officials raised doubts about the accuracy of the data. They said the numbers reflected temporary distortions rather than a stronger trend. There is some evidence they were right. The most recent government data, through February, showed weaker inflation than the previous report.
Another batch of data, through March, is scheduled for publication on Friday. It is expected to show continued weakness. Yet the statement on Wednesday repeated the Fed's view that inflation will rebound as the effects of low oil prices and a stronger dollar gradually fade.
The problem facing the Fed, however, is the same one it has been facing for some time. It continues to predict better times tomorrow. And tomorrow never seems to come.

Abstract: (The numbers on rate of return come from a model built by The New York Times that is based on the Social Security Administration's work sheet to help people calculate benefits.

Full text:   Social Security is designed to ensure that no workers go penniless in old age and also as an equalizer between rich and poor. It is structured to give more generous retirement benefits to low-income people, given the taxes they pay during their working years.
For example, an American man who is consistently in the top 1 percent of earners -- making $2 million last year -- will, if he starts taking Social Security benefits at age 66 and lives to be 87, end up with more money than he and his employers paid into the system in taxes during his lifetime. In the language of finance, he would receive an inflation-adjusted "internal rate of return" of 1.07 percent.
By contrast, if a member of Mr. Moneybags's household staff, born the same year, made about $30,000 annually and also lived to be 87, he would receive a 2.57 percent return after inflation. That's quite a decent return -- a higher rate than any inflation-adjusted United States Treasury bonds pay, for example.
That's progressivity in action. Or rather, it would be if Mr. Moneybags and his gardener actually lived to the same age.
But in reality, a large body of research shows that the rich live longer -- and that the life span gap between rich and poor is growing. And that means that the progressive ideal built into the design of Social Security is, gradually, being thwarted. In some circumstances, the program can actually be regressive, offering richer benefits to those who are already affluent.
For example, for American men in the top 1 percent like our Mr. Moneybags, 87 really is a typical life span, according to research by the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and seven colleagues that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this month.
Alas, a gardener earning $30,000 a year is unlikely to live that long. Men in that income tier die, on average, at age 78. In this hypothetical case, that nine-year gap in expected life span radically shifts the relative financial return the two men would receive on their tax dollars.
If the gardener died at the age Mr. Chetty's research suggests is typical for men at that income level, he would lose about $115,000 in benefits, compared with what he would receive if he lived as long as the wealthy man. And he would earn a 0.92 percent rate of return on his tax dollars -- a bit lower than that earned by his much wealthier boss.
(The numbers on rate of return come from a model built by The New York Times that is based on the Social Security Administration's work sheet to help people calculate benefits. The data is for people born in 1954 who began their peak earning years in 1980 and worked for 35 years at a constant inflation-adjusted income. At most levels, poorer people still experience higher returns than the wealthy even adjusting for life span, though that could change if the life span gap keeps widening.)
That result wasn't obvious when Social Security benefits were designed. The benefits were intended to replace 90 percent of a person's first dollar of earnings but only 15 percent of their earnings over $5,157 a month (and nothing above the income cutoff of $9,875 a month), giving less affluent people a theoretical advantage.
But Social Security has always been designed as a social insurance program, not as an investment fund. Essentially, the people who die unusually young subsidize those who live unusually long lives, so if you look at the program on narrow return-on-investment grounds, a person who lives to 110 is getting a far better deal than people who die a month after they first draw benefits.
And because different groups of people have different life expectancies, some groups receive more value from every dollar of payroll taxes they and their employers pay into the system. Over all, women live longer than men and African-Americans die younger than whites.
The idea that differing life spans between rich and poor would reduce the progressivity of Social Security isn't new; the Brookings Institution economist Henry J. Aaron identified the problem in a 1977 paper. Research published in 2000 found that, with certain assumptions, the Social Security retirement system as a whole is regressive, or more favorable to the affluent than to the poor.
What is new: It is becoming overwhelmingly evident that the life span gap between rich and poor is widening. A study published this year by Barry Bosworth, Gary Burtless and Kan Zhang found that life expectancy for the bottom 10 percent of male wage earners turning 66 this year has risen 0.7 of a year compared with what was expected for their low-income counterparts 30 years ago. For the top 10 percent of male wage earners, however, life span rose 8.1 years in the same period.
The research from Mr. Chetty and his colleagues indicates that the richest 1 percent of Americans gained three years of life expectancy from 2001 to 2014 alone, while the poorest had almost no gain (0.3 of a year).
For anyone who believes that it's important for the Social Security program to remain progressive, the life-span shifts have big implications that are made more acute by the program's financial problems.
Money coming into the system each year isn't enough to pay benefits, and the Social Security Trust Fund is forecast to be depleted in 2034. That implies benefit cuts, tax increases or some combination or variation in the years ahead. As lawmakers consider Social Security's future, the lessons from the latest research on inequality and life span are pressingly relevant.
A popular idea among many fiscal centrists and conservatives is to fix the finances of Social Security by increasing the full retirement age. (It is currently 66 and on track to rise to 67, though retirees can take a reduced level of benefits at age 62 and higher levels up to age 70.)
But the life span differential suggests that such a change would fall heavily on the backs of the poor. It's true that on average Americans are living longer than they were in 1983, when the last major overhaul to the finances of the program was made.
"The way it's usually put is: Has the health status of people near retirement age improved across the board?" said Mr. Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "But for many people it has not. People who have done backbreaking work or physically demanding work were no more fit in 1984 than in 1964."
By contrast, he argued that raising the maximum annual income level on which Social Security taxes are paid, currently $118,500, would maintain long-term solvency while not putting more of a burden on the poor. That would effectively raise taxes for higher-income people. Another alternative might be to make the benefits structure more progressive, essentially reducing benefits for high-paid workers only.
That points to an important reality: The battles over Social Security aren't confined to merely technocratic questions. They also concern core issues about government and social justice, and in formulating answers, the new body of research on income and life span really matters.

Abstract: Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, is expected to argue on Thursday that the measures, which include paying banks to make loans, will be enough to avert a downward spiral of consumer prices that could be disastrous for growth and jobs. General Motors on Thursday will report first-quarter earnings that are expected to improve, primarily because of continued strong sales of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in its core North American market.

Full text:   This is what to expect from the week ahead:
Earnings to reflect how tech giants are coping.
For fans of tech stocks, this week is a cornucopia of earnings information. IBM kicks things off on Monday, followed by Intel and Yahoo on Tuesday, Google and Microsoft on Thursday and other companies throughout the week. That is a pretty diverse bunch of giants, but they share a common theme: How are they coping? IBM has suffered multiple tough quarters as people move from its high-priced services, while Intel is hoping its cloud computing data centers will make up for missing the smartphone boom. Google is starting to play catch-up in cloud services against Amazon. Microsoft, another cloud provider, has to move its old software businesses to the new computing system. Yahoo, which lost out to Google and others, is coping with something else entirely: On Monday, bids to buy all or part of the company are due. Quentin Hardy
Stanley and Goldman to declare quarter figures.
The last of the big banks will report their first-quarter earnings this week, with Morgan Stanley announcing its results on Monday and Goldman Sachs Tuesday. Both banks have set low expectations, in line with the lackluster profits and revenues that the other big banks declared last week. The other banks reported particularly weak results in their Wall Street divisions. That does not bode well for Morgan Stanley and Goldman, given that they are the most Wall Street-focused firms in the industry. Analysts will seek more information about the cost cuts that Morgan Stanley announced last quarter. Similar cuts may be in store at Goldman. Nathaniel Popper
Low rates and more jobs to impact housing data.
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report the latest data on new housing starts in March. After a 5.2 percent jump in February, the biggest monthly increase since September, construction growth is expected to have moderated but still rise slightly for the month. Buoyed by low-interest rates and steady jobs growth, the real estate market has been fairly strong, which is helping the economy even as other sectors like manufacturing soften. Nelson D. Schwartz
Apple and F.B.I. to testify before House panels.
A battle over encryption is heading again to Capitol Hill as Apple and F.B.I. officials appear before House members to defend their positions. In a hearing on Tuesday before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, Apple's general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and the F.B.I.'s executive assistant director for science and technology, Amy Hess, will testify on separate panels. The issue has pitted the technology sector against law enforcement in a broader debate over privacy and security. The F.B.I. has pushed for access to encrypted data in terrorist and other criminal investigations. Apple has fought back, saying some of the F.B.I.'s demands to decrypt technology would weaken its products' security and infringe on users' privacy. The company's court battle with the F.B.I. over a phone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attack was recently resolved, but the two parties continue to fight over the unlocking of an iPhone used in a New York drug case.

Latest earnings to determine future of UnitedHealth.
UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest health insurers, will be reporting its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Last year's profits suffered because the company said it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars selling individual policies under the federal health care law. UnitedHealth's chief executive said the company would leave the exchange if it could not make money. Investors will be watching for signs that the company has turned the business around -- or has plans to make good on its promise to exit the exchange. Reed Abelson
European Central Bank to defend stimulus clauses.
The European Central Bank will meet on Thursday in Frankfurt, but is not expected to make any changes to policy. At its last meeting in March, the bank's Governing Council announced a battery of stimulus measures aimed at raising inflation, which is near zero, back to the official target of below 2 percent. Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, is expected to argue on Thursday that the measures, which include paying banks to make loans, will be enough to avert a downward spiral of consumer prices that could be disastrous for growth and jobs.

S.U.V. and truck sales to boost G.M. earnings.
General Motors on Thursday will report first-quarter earnings that are expected to improve, primarily because of continued strong sales of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in its core North American market. Its performance in international divisions is expected to be uneven, with modest gains forecast in Europe and possibly weaker results in China. On Friday, G.M., the nation's largest automaker, will release compensation figures for 2015 for its senior executives, including Mary T. Barra, its chief executive and chairwoman. Bill Vlasic

Due date nears for Volkswagen's diesel plan.
Volkswagen faces a Thursday court deadline to present a plan to fix nearly 600,000 diesel cars in the United States that are polluting more than allowed. Some lawyers in the case were optimistic there would be a broad agreement to compensate Volkswagen owners and settle enforcement actions brought by state and federal governments. Other lawyers were more cautious, saying the settlement talks remained difficult. Last month Judge Charles R. Breyer for the Federal District Court in San Francisco said he would hold a trial this summer if Volkswagen is not able to reach a settlement. Jack Ewing
E.U. nations to attempt bailout deal with Greece.
Eurozone and European Union finance ministers will hold two days of meetings in Amsterdam starting on Friday. The bloc's 19 eurozone ministers are expected to seek an agreement with Greece on reforms in exchange for more bailout aid so that Greece can pay back debt that matures in July. Among the numerous issues that have held up agreement is the push by the International Monetary Fund to ease the repayment burden on Greece as a condition for helping to finance last year's 86 billion euro bailout, the nation's third in five years. The bloc's 28 finance ministers are also scheduled to discuss proposals requiring companies to disclose more data about their offshore arrangements. The proposals were announced in the wake of the Panama Papers, which exposed ways the rich and powerful use tax havens. James Kanter
Volkswagen to disclose update on emissions inquiry.
Volkswagen's supervisory board may disclose Friday some of the findings of an internal investigation on who was responsible for programming 11 million diesel cars, mostly in Europe and the United States, to evade emissions limits. The investigation is being conducted by the law firm Jones Day on behalf of the supervisory board. The damage to Volkswagen's reputation has been elevated by the company's failure, seven months after the fraud came to light, to explain the circumstances behind it. Jack Ewing
G.E.'s quarterly results to reflect its steady moves.
The big moves for General Electric are in the rearview mirror. Its post-financial crisis campaign of returning to its industrial roots and shedding much of its once-bloated finance arm is complete. On Friday, when G.E. reports its quarterly results, analysts will scout for signs of health in the industrial economy. Expect a mixed picture, with strong sales of jet engines and power generators strong and weak oil field equipment sales. Even if G.E. does well, the stock price may not respond. Its price-earnings ratio is high, Wall Street figures. Big moves stir excitement in a way steady execution does not. Steve Lohr

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices in the United States barely rose in March and underlying inflation slowed, economic data released on Thursday showed.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index gained 0.1 percent last month as a rebound in gasoline prices was partly offset by a drop in the cost of food. Medical care and housing costs also retreated in March after strong increases in the previous two months.
The price index fell 0.2 percent in February. In the 12 months through March, it increased 0.9 percent; in February, it advanced 1 percent.
The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, inched up 0.1 percent last month after two strong monthly readings. The increase in March in the core price index was the smallest since August and followed a 0.3 percent rise in February.
In the 12 months through March, the core index rose 2.2 percent after gaining 2.3 percent in the 12 months through February.
In a second report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 253,000 for the week ended April 9. That matched the level for early March, which was the lowest since November 1973.
Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 58 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.
The labor market has shown strength even though recent reports on trade, wholesale inventories, retail sales and business spending suggested that economic growth almost halted in the first quarter after posting a 1.4 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Last month, gasoline prices rose 2.2 percent after plunging 13 percent in February. Food prices fell 0.2 percent, and the cost of food consumed at home posted its largest decline since April 2009.
The core C.P.I. was restrained by housing and medical costs, as well as apparel. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence increased 0.2 percent after increasing 0.3 percent in February.
Medical care costs slowed their rapid ascent, gaining only 0.1 percent after shooting up 0.5 percent in February. Apparel prices fell 1.1 percent in March, in contrast to the previous month's 1.6 percent advance.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- When Venezuela's opposition took control of the National Assembly this year, lawmakers vowed to use their powers to steer the country far from the legacy of former President Hugo Chávez.
They pledged to free scores of political prisoners who were languishing in jails, and to give away public housing to the people who lived in it. The new lawmakers even said they would hold a vote to remove Mr. Chávez's handpicked successor, President Nicolás Maduro, and field their own candidate to run the country.
Yet time and again, the country's courts -- packed by leftist loyalists of Mr. Maduro only days before they handed over power -- have fiercely chipped away at the new legislature's efforts, leaving some here wondering whether Venezuela's lawmakers who are pushing for change have any real power at all.
Already, the courts have limited lawmakers' power to remove judges, overturned a law meant to stabilize the economy and ratified an emergency decree that was rejected by legislators on the grounds that it overstepped Mr. Maduro's authority.
But perhaps the biggest blow yet came on Monday night when the country's Supreme Court overturned the law that would have freed about 120 prisoners, many of them activists or opposition politicians jailed in antigovernment protests. The judges rejected the bill as unconstitutional.
"It's a clear strategy of the Maduro government to render the Assembly completely impotent," said Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research group. "It's a complete stalemate for them."
On Tuesday, opposition politicians voiced disbelief at the court's decision.
"Obviously this puts the government against the Constitution and against the people," Freddy Guevara, a legislator with the Popular Will party, said in an interview. "If the people voted for us, it's clear those who voted agreed with our agenda -- including this amnesty law."
The clash over the prisoners was one manifestation of an increasingly fierce conflict that has been playing out all year: Venezuela's leftist old guard still controls most of the government, and the opposition wields a large majority in its Congress.
One telling example has been the dueling threats by the president and lawmakers to remove one another from office. The Assembly is exploring a number of strategies against Mr. Maduro, from a popular recall vote to an effort to change the Constitution to cut his term short. Mr. Maduro recently embraced a proposal to write his own constitutional amendment that would end the lawmakers' terms.
"If I see it as the way to avoid the path to a coup and the co-opting of the National Assembly, then I myself will push for this," Mr. Maduro said last week to a group of supporters at the presidential palace.
The political clashes come against the backdrop of increasing economic uncertainty for most Venezuelans. The country has suffered from shortages of basic foods for more than a year and soaring inflation. Meanwhile, oil prices, the economy's main support, slumped this year and have stagnated since.
Water and power are in short supply. In a sign of the increasing desperation, Mr. Maduro went on television last week to declare three-day weekends for public workers for the next two months to save power. The president then urged women not to use blow dryers for the same purpose.
While the prisoner amnesty offered little to lessen these woes, it was seen as a bellwether of the Assembly's powers to eventually act in the country's larger crises.
Opposition officials say 120 people have been charged in cases stemming from their political views, including party leaders and former mayors. A large number of the arrests took place during a wave of protests in 2014, in which thousands of middle-class Venezuelans took to the streets in an effort to get Mr. Maduro to resign.
Perhaps the most high-profile arrest was that of Leopoldo López, the former mayor of a district in Caracas who headed the Popular Will opposition party. He was arrested after a speech during the protests and later sentenced to a 13-year sentence on charges like inciting violence.
The fate of the prisoners is a central point of tension between Venezuela and the United States. Last week, Assistant Secretary of State Roberta S. Jacobson, met with Mr. López's wife, Lilian Tintori, in Washington.
"The release of political prisoners in Venezuela is long overdue, I join with their families to call for their immediate release," Ms. Jacobson wrote on Twitter after the meeting.
Mr. Maduro and his supporters argue that those incarcerated are criminals, not political prisoners.
The president and his allies appear prepared for a long fight ahead in fending off the opposition through the country's courts. Before the new assembly was seated, leftists replaced 13 of the court's 32 justices with trusted jurists, ensuring that the court would remain loyal. The new court soon moved to block the election of four legislators from rural districts, denying the opposition a supermajority in the National Assembly.
Mr. Shifter at the research group said that if the Assembly finds the rest of the laws it passes this year overturned, it would strengthen the hands of hard-liners in the party who favor opposing Mr. Maduro by sending protesters into the street rather than fielding politicians in elections.
"That argument is going to be revived," he said. "The faction that wants to increase pressure at the streets is going to say 'I told you so. The ballot box strategy doesn't work."'

Abstract: First-quarter earnings reports started with results from Alcoa, the aluminum mining giant, after the closing bell on Monday.

Full text:   Stocks ended Monday's session mostly unchanged as investors awaited first-quarter company earnings.
Overseas markets gained as investors hoped for more stimulus in China, the world's second-largest economy behind that of the United States.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.61 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,041.99, and the Nasdaq composite fell 17.29 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,833.40.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 20.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,556.41.
First-quarter earnings reports started with results from Alcoa, the aluminum mining giant, after the closing bell on Monday. The company reported adjusted earnings of 7 cents a share, beating the loss of 2 cents a share that analysts had predicted.
This week, the nation's largest banks, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, will start reporting results.
Expectations are low for this earnings season largely because of the steep drop in the price of oil from a year ago, which has hurt the share prices of energy companies especially, and their profits.
Some investors have said they are looking to set aside this quarter's earnings results. Because many contend the price of oil has found a bottom, there is hope that earnings later this year will make up for expected weak performance in the first quarter.
Stock in Hertz Global Holdings, the car rental company, fell $1.12 or 11.5 percent, to $8.58 after it cut its full-year earnings forecast.
Yahoo shares rose 41 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $36.48 after news reports said The Daily Mail of Britain was interested in buying it. The Daily Mail confirmed the reports on Monday.
Overseas, investors were encouraged by data from China, which showed inflation remains tame there. That could provide a reason for Chinese officials to offer more monetary stimulus to keep their economy from slowing further. Asian and European markets closed mostly higher.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 stock index fell 0.4 percent, and the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia slipped 0.1 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi lost 0.1 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng gained 0.4 percent, and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.6 percent.
In Germany, the DAX gained 0.6 percent, and the CAC 40 in France added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain was down 0.1 percent.
Benchmark American crude oil rose 64 cents to settle at $40.36 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 89 cents to $42.83 a barrel in London.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly to 1.73 percent from 1.72 percent, as government bond prices in the United States were mostly unchanged. The dollar slipped to 107.89 yen from 108.16 yen. The euro was slightly higher at $1.1403.

Full text:   I.M.F. to hold talks on global economy prospects.
The International Monetary Fund will hold its annual spring meeting this week in Washington, D.C., an event that draws finance ministers, central bankers and international financiers from around the globe. One of the highlights will be Tuesday's release of the organization's updated forecasts on global growth. The fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, has already warned that the global recovery remains fragile and too slow. --Landon Thomas Jr.
European regulators to rule on trans-Atlantic data deal.
European privacy watchdogs will give their judgment on Wednesday about a new trans-Atlantic data agreement -- known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield -- that allows companies from Google to General Electric to move information between the two regions.
Many of Europe's regulators remain skeptical about the agreement, and if they rule that the deal does not meet Europe's tough privacy standards, it may cause headaches for global companies when handling people's personal information digitally. --Mark Scott
Big banks to report first-quarter profits.
Large American banks will begin announcing their first-quarter results this week, and the numbers are expected to be disappointing. JPMorgan Chase will report its earnings on Wednesday, followed by Bank of America and Wells Fargo on Thursday and Citigroup on Friday.
The first quarter is typically the strongest for Wall Street as clients seek to redeploy their capital, but all of the banks are expected to be hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.
Given the decline in oil prices, losses from loans made to energy companies will also be in the spotlight. Analysts will be seeking any indication that prospects have improved in recent weeks as market conditions have calmed down. --Nathaniel Popper
March retail sales to indicate spending confidence.
United States retail sales figures for March, expected from the Department of Commerce on Wednesday, may be an indicator of whether consumers are finally feeling confident enough to bolster their spending. Despite a robust recovery in the jobs market and a brightening economic outlook, retail sales have so far stayed relatively flat, as households remain cautious, especially with spending on goods such as electronics and apparel.
But a growing consumer confidence and the timing of Easter this year, which brought spring sales forward into late March, are likely to have translated into stronger numbers for the month. --Hiroko Tabuchi
House panel aims to complete Puerto Rico debt bill.
On Wednesday, the House Committee on Natural Resources will hold a hearing on a bill to give Puerto Rico the legal tools to restructure its $72 billion of debt. A current draft would put the island under a federal oversight board and let it reduce its debts in a court proceeding similar to bankruptcy. (The bankruptcy code specifically excludes Puerto Rico.)
The composition and powers of the oversight board, and certain details of the court proceeding, are up in the air, but committee members hope to resolve them on Wednesday, make final amendments on Thursday and send a finished bill to the floor of the House the next week. --Mary Williams Walsh
Slow growth expected in China's economy.
China's huge economy started the year with a whimper. The country is set to release a raft of economic data this week that is expected to show that growth continued to slow at a steady pace. On Wednesday, monthly trade statistics will probably reflect a continued weakening in global appetite for China's exports, as well as sagging demand at home.
On Friday, China will report economic growth for the first three months of the year that is forecast to come in at 6.7 percent -- its weakest quarterly expansion since early 2009. But that would be down only slightly from 6.9 percent growth in 2015, and it would be in line with the government's target for a 6.5 to 7 percent expansion in 2016. --Neil Gough
Spike in gas prices to play role in latest C.P.I. data.
The Labor Department on Thursday will release the latest Consumer Price Index data. Wall Street expects the government to report that prices rose 0.2 percentage point in March, largely because of a jump in the price of gasoline, after several months of declines. The core C.P.I. index, which doesn't include volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have risen by about 0.1 percentage point, a tame reading in terms of inflation and price pressures in the broader economy. --Nelson D. Schwartz

Continued hiring expected to affect consumer outlook.
On Friday morning, the University of Michigan will release its initial estimate of consumer sentiment in April. Economists are expecting attitudes to remain at fairly optimistic levels, rising to about 92 from the March reading of 91. Wall Street's rebound along with still-healthy hiring have helped to buoy the outlook of consumers, despite slow overall economic growth in the United States and volatility overseas. --Nelson D. Schwartz
Oil prices at stake in global exporters meeting.
Officials from major oil exporting countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, on Sunday to discuss a proposed freeze on output at current levels. The meeting will be watched closely for signs of whether the major producers can cooperate to bring balance back to the oversupplied market. Oil prices, which have recovered from their lows earlier this year, under $30 a barrel to about $40 a barrel for Brent crude, could come under pressure if the meeting ends in discord. --Stanley Reed

Full text:   Federal officials are expected to argue in court starting Monday that a large hospital merger in the Chicago area could hurt consumers and should be stopped. It would be the latest in a series of efforts by regulators to push back against a wave of consolidation among major health care providers.
But a frenzy of smaller transactions is also profoundly changing the landscape, many of which face little regulatory resistance.
The deals are often for a couple of doctors here, or a hospital there, making them too small to attract much attention. But as those deals add up, they are creating groups that in some cases dominate local or regional markets. And they are raising questions about whether the gaze of antitrust officials is directed in the right place.
"There's a lot of consolidation going on at a lot of levels," said Leemore S. Dafny, a former federal official who is a health economist at Northwestern University.
She added, "I don't think the antitrust laws are set up to stop it."
Doctors and hospitals are making the calculation that bigger is definitely better. Consolidation, they say, helps them better coordinate care and manage patients, making care more effective and less expensive.
Skeptics, however, say that the small combinations can eventually translate into higher costs. By gaining market share, they say, hospitals are able to charge more for their care and gain more influence about where patients are sent for lucrative services.
Regulators, meanwhile, are left with limited information about the smaller deals, including answers about whether they diminish competition, leading to higher prices and lower-quality care.
Dr. Farzad Mostashari, a former health official in the Obama administration, describes what is taking place as "creeping consolidation" -- being done at a pace that keeps it away from prying eyes.
"If you move slowly enough, maybe nobody will notice," he said.
Many of the smaller deals go unreported, leaving any tally of them incomplete. But at least 940 health care service transactions took place last year, up from about 480 in 2010, according to Irving Levin Associates, a research firm. This mix of deals, which involved groups like physician practices, hospitals and nursing homes, totaled some $175 billion.
Because of the consolidation, patients are more likely to be getting care from providers with formal ties to one another. The doctor who is employed by a hospital, for example, may send a patient for a CT scan at a facility owned by the same hospital. Patients may be discouraged from going to a provider outside a given network, either by their insurer or their doctor.
The combinations taking place include smaller hospital mergers, like one in Arizona in March, when two hospitals merged. The same month, Baptist Health, a small hospital group in Kentucky, said it planned to reach into Indiana to add another hospital. Neither of those deals has generated significant attention.
The difference in regulatory attention is particularly stark in Illinois.
The hospital deal in Chicago, between Advocate Health and NorthShore University HealthSystem, brings together two large systems, including hospitals and doctors' groups. It was announced in 2014 and involves more than 6,000 doctors. Advocate and NorthShore say they will promise not to raise their prices above inflation. They also say they plan to introduce a health plan that will be cheaper than comparable policies offered by the insurers in the market.
But the deal is being opposed by the Federal Trade Commission in a case expected to start Monday at the United States District Court for Northern Illinois.
"This merger is likely to significantly increase the combined system's bargaining power with health plans, which in turn will harm consumers by bringing about higher prices and lower quality," Deborah L. Feinstein, the director of the F.T.C.'s competition bureau, said in a statement in December.
The same sort of attention has not been paid to the growth of the state's largest independent physician group.
The company, DuPage Medical Group, started as an eight-doctor practice in the Chicago suburbs in the 1960s and then combined with other practices. In the last five years, it has made about 16 deals and doubled in size to 500 doctors.
Many of its acquisitions barely register -- eight specialists last month, two small physician groups in February, a handful of doctors joining at a time. But it has been enough that DuPage now has ambitions of going national. Late last year, it teamed up with a private investment firm to provide it with $250 million for its goal.
"We saw what was happening," said Michael A. Kasper, the chief executive of DuPage Medical Group. "There was going to be mass consolidation at the hospital and physician level."
As a bigger organization, he said, DuPage has more leverage with area hospitals. "There's no question we have a higher degree of influence because of our size," he said.
Several companies are also amassing doctors who specialize in fields like emergency medicine, trying to capture a sizable share of the physicians in that field and also expanding into related areas. In November, TeamHealth, which has about 16,000 doctors, bought IPC Healthcare, which specializes in care within the hospital, for $1.6 billion.
Federal Trade Commission officials have traditionally focused on deals known as horizontal combinations, when large hospital groups or physician practices merge in a local market. Last year, the agency and Idaho's attorney general prevailed in a case against St. Luke's Health System in Boise for buying the state's largest independent multispecialty group because it would control too many doctors.
The agency is also watching the addition of doctors into these big groups, Ms. Feinstein said. But making the legal case against so-called vertical combinations -- when a hospital buys doctors' groups or expands into related areas like imaging or outpatient surgery -- is not as straightforward.
These deals, experts say, can benefit consumers by making care more efficient. Integrated systems like Kaiser Permanente in California manage to combine the operations of hospitals, doctors' clinics and a health plan into a well-regarded system.
But the track record for others is not well known, and many make promises that never materialize into lower prices or better care.
"It's difficult to even understand the relationships between hospitals and doctors' practices," said Francine Lafontaine, a former F.T.C. official who is now at the University of Michigan. "We don't have a lot of clear research."
To keep track of what is going on in the market, Massachusetts now requires that any health care transactions be reported to a state agency. The agency has received notice of 57 deals since it began tracking them three years ago. A few other states are considering a similar reporting system.
But the expectation is that regulators will continue to have their hands full. The push toward new forms of payment and more coordinated care is pushing providers to enter these combinations, said Roger D. Strode, a health care lawyer for Foley & Lardner in Chicago.
"I don't see this abating," he said.

Full text:   Americans are angry. That's the sentiment that many believe is driving the 2016 election. They are angry because the rich are getting richer, the average guy is struggling and the government in Washington hasn't done anything to stop the trend.
But it may not be that simple.
Data on the nation's economic recovery, people's reactions to current economic conditions and their overall sense of satisfaction with life do not suggest Americans are angry. In fact, historical measures indicate people are about as happy and satisfied with the economy and with their lives as they were in 1983, when Ronald Reagan told us it was "morning again in America."
So why does it feel more like a 1 a.m. bar brawl?
The answer may have more to do with political parties than economics, or at least with the interaction of the two. Today's voters have sorted themselves and polarized into partisan groups that look very different than they did in the late 1980s. And members of each side like the other side less than before. Americans aren't annoyed only by the economy; they're annoyed with one another.
Objective economic conditions measured by the Federal Reserve suggest that the nation's recovery began in 2010, when gross domestic product started to expand, unemployment started to fall and real disposable income began to increase. By 2015, the misery index -- a combined measure of unemployment and inflation -- was about as low as it had been since the 1950s, meaning an active demand for goods and services along with low unemployment and inflation.
Most Americans seemed to appreciate this growth. Data on the Index of Consumer Sentiment, one of the longest-running measures of Americans' views of the economy, shows that by the end of 2015, consumer sentiment was as positive as it had been in the mid-2000s and mid-1980s. It was nearly identical to where it was at the end of 1983, when Mr. Reagan's re-election romp began to take shape.
Even breaking the consumer sentiment data down by income levels does little to buoy the argument that Americans were pessimistic. From 2009-2015, the average gap in economic satisfaction between the upper and lower thirds of the income distribution was 13.7 points, much lower than it was during the Reagan years (21.3) and lower than the gap during the administrations of the elder George Bush (14.7), Bill Clinton (16.7) and George W. Bush (18.4).
As we entered 2016, Americans of all income levels felt positively about the economy, though by some indicators many people had not recovered. The employment-population ratio and median household income, for example, began to recover only in 2015.
To get a sense of whether these economic factors were affecting the general mood of the nation in a way not captured by consumer sentiment, I examined one of the longest-standing measures of general happiness. Since 1972, the General Social Survey has asked people to "take things all together" and rate their level of happiness. The 40-year trend shows only modest changes -- and may actually suggest a small increase in happiness in recent years.
Describing Americans' mood as distinctively angry in 2015 elides this evidence. Americans were optimistic about the nation's economy and generally happy -- in fact, no less optimistic or happy than they had been historically.
But there was a sense in the fall and winter of 2015 of one change. Using analytic tools provided by Crimson Hexagon, I calculated the average monthly increase in the share of news articles about the 2016 election with the word "angry." Between November 2015 and March 2016, the share of stories about angry voters increased by 200 percent.
Some evidence suggests that the ire came from politics. When asked by pollsters about trusting the government, the direction of the country, American progress or the president, Americans were gloomier than their economic assessments might have predicted. Broken out by party, these pessimistic views reveal a growing partisan divide, one that's been distilling around racial attitudes for nearly two decades.
The increasing alignment between party and racial attitudes goes back to the early 1990s. The Pew Values Survey asks people whether they agree that "we should make every effort to improve the position of minorities, even if it means giving them preferential treatment."
Over time, Americans' party identification has become more closely aligned with answers to this question and others like it. Pew reports that, "since 1987, the gap on this question between the two parties has doubled -- from 18 points to 40 points." Democrats are now much more supportive (52 percent) of efforts to improve racial equality than they were a few decades ago, while the views of Republicans have been largely unchanged (12 percent agree).
That Democrats and Republicans have different views on issues is not surprising. But recent work by Stanford University's Shanto Iyengar and his co-authors shows something else has been brewing in the electorate: a growing hostility toward members of the opposite party. This enmity, they argue, percolates into opinions about everyday life.
Partisans, for example, are more concerned that their children might marry someone of the opposite party (vs. people in Britain today and the United States in 1960). They found partisans surprisingly willing to discriminate against people who are not members of their political party. We've entered an age of party-ism.
Writing in The Washington Post, Michael Tesler, a University of California, Irvine, political scientist, explained that because the growing partisan divide is partly fueled by racial attitudes, partisans (in Washington and in the electorate) also take increasingly opposite positions on many racially inflected controversies.
Some are political, like police misconduct. Others spill into areas we think of as more social than political, like sports, music and movies: about Academy Awards nominations, for example.
Democrats and Republicans like each other a lot less now than they did 60 years ago, in part because they have sorted into parties based on attitudes on race, religion and ethnicity. These attitudes and emotions have been activated in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Add to this the fact that the country is becoming less white and that nonwhites are disproportionately more likely to be Democrats, and an explanation for the anger emerges.

Abstract: Later on Tuesday will come two other economic indicators: the Institute for Supply Management's reading on nonmanufacturing activity in March, and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or Jolts, for February from the Labor Department. The survey on nonmanufacturing activity is expected to show a slight decline, while traders and the Federal Reserve will be eyeing the Jolts data to see if it tracks last week's jobs report and other recent positive indicators for the labor market. --

Full text:   Libor trial to begin for ex-Barclays employees.
Five former Barclays employees are expected in court in London on Monday as their trial begins over criminal charges that they conspired to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, a global benchmark interest rate known as Libor. --Chad Bray
Data expected on trade, manufacturing and labor.
On Tuesday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release the latest data on the country's trade balance in February. The strong dollar, along with weakness in Asian and European markets, has been hurting American exporters lately. Economists are looking for the net trade deficit to hit $46 billion, up from $45.7 billion in January, since imports increased slightly more than exports.
Later on Tuesday will come two other economic indicators: the Institute for Supply Management's reading on nonmanufacturing activity in March, and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or Jolts, for February from the Labor Department. The survey on nonmanufacturing activity is expected to show a slight decline, while traders and the Federal Reserve will be eyeing the Jolts data to see if it tracks last week's jobs report and other recent positive indicators for the labor market. --Nelson D. Schwartz
India's central bank to meet on monetary policy.
The Reserve Bank of India is scheduled to hold its bimonthly monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, after which its governor, Raghuram Rajan, will decide whether to change policy. (Technically, he alone decides, although he first consults his deputy governors; there is not a vote, as there is among members of the Federal Reserve in the United States, although introducing such a procedure is under consideration in India.)
There is some speculation that he might move to ease policy slightly in response to signs that inflation is well under control and the economy is growing strongly but, apparently, not at full capacity. But the details of how that easing might be conducted were unclear. --Keith Bradsher
New safeguard expected for retirement investors.
The Obama administration is expected to introduce a new rule on Wednesday that would require financial professionals to put their customers' interests ahead of their own when handling retirement money. The so-called fiduciary rule has been in the works for about five years.
Though the proposed regulation has faced strong opposition from the financial services industry, it has managed to survive because of strong support from the White House. The new rules are expected to save investors $40 billion over 10 years, according to estimates the administration released last April, when the rule was formally proposed. --Tara Siegel BERNARD
Fed to release details of policy meeting.
If the Federal Reserve were a traffic light, it would be yellow. The Fed did not raise interest rates at its most recent policy-making meeting in March, and it said future rate increases would probably come more slowly than previously expected. The Fed will provide some context for that sense of caution on Wednesday, when it releases an account of the March meeting.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, has explained that the Fed's economic outlook remains relatively upbeat, but that the central bank thinks rates need to remain a little lower to keep growth on track. The Fed also sees an increased risk that global economic problems will disrupt domestic growth. Some of Ms. Yellen's colleagues, however, have suggested that they are worried about moving too slowly. The account of the March meeting may shed light on these internal disagreements. --Binyamin Appelbaum
Revised rescue plan for Puerto Rico is expected.
Republican members of the House Committee on Natural Resources are expected to issue a revised plan on Wednesday for rescuing Puerto Rico from its financial crisis. A first draft, made public last Tuesday, elicited a range of responses -- from bondholders saying it would expose them to large losses that they could not accept, to top Puerto Rican officials saying the plan's federal oversight provision would infringe on the island's right to self-determination.
Representative Rob Bishop, the Utah Republican who is leading the drafting process in consultation with Democrats, said that he had issued the first draft "to encourage feedback," and that the revision process would involve "input from all stakeholders." --Mary Williams Walsh
E.C.B. to offer insights into stimulus measures.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank will provide clues to the thought process that led it to deploy a range of stimulus measures last month to avert deflation -- a downward price spiral that can be poisonous to growth and employment. The E.C.B. will publish an account of the March 10 meeting in which the measures were approved.
The account should provide insight into what future measures might be in the offing if inflation in the 19 countries of the eurozone remains near zero. In addition, Peter Praet and Benoît Coeuré, members of the E.C.B.'s executive board, will speak that day in Frankfurt at a conference of economists who study monetary policy. Mr. Praet and Mr. Coeuré are expected to explain the rationale for the decisions, which included offering to pay eurozone banks to lend money to businesses and consumers. --Jack Ewing
Current and former fed leaders to take the stage.
Fans of monetary policy -- and of monetary policy makers -- are in for a rare treat this week. The four people who have headed the Federal Reserve since 1979 will appear together for a group interview on Thursday evening at International House of New York. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's current chairwoman, will be joined by her three immediate predecessors: Ben S. Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Paul A. Volcker.
The topic? "How the chairs' philosophies and personal beliefs impact decision making with international implications." The event kicks off a new speaker series named for Mr. Volcker, who is also a former chairman of International House, a residence for young scholars from around the world. The bad news? Tickets cost $1,000. The really bad news? The event is sold out. --Binyamin Appelbaum

To Buy or Rent a Home? Weighing Which Is Better

Author: Tara Siegel Bernard

Abstract: Does that mean people who rent for extended periods, perhaps decades -- even a lifetime -- are forever at a disadvantage? "Arguing about whether rent versus buy is a better financial decision is like debating active versus passive investment strategies, hedge funds versus mutual funds, Apple versus Google," said Milo M.

Full text:   Rob Austin and his wife, Natalia, have a 10-month-old son, healthy incomes and plenty of cash in the bank for a down payment on a house. But they are happily renting a townhouse in Pasadena, Calif., with no plans to buy for now, given the frothy prices in their area.
"As long as there is such a disconnect, where a couple like my wife and me have to put down a gargantuan down payment and still have a large monthly payment to get into a decent, and not necessarily nice, house, that is a game we don't wish to play," said Mr. Austin, a 39-year-old business manager at a biotechnology company. "When home price-to-income levels come back to a more normal level, when that happens, then we will be the first to jump in. If that never happens, that is O.K."
More American households are renting, across all income levels and generations, for different reasons. But when homeownership is the centerpiece of the American dream, most of us have internalized certain ideals: Buying a home builds equity, putting you on the fast track to building wealth. Renting, by contrast, is essentially throwing money to the wind.
But with renters now accounting for 37 percent of all households, the highest level since the mid-1960s, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, more people may be renting for longer. Does that mean people who rent for extended periods, perhaps decades -- even a lifetime -- are forever at a disadvantage?
"Arguing about whether rent versus buy is a better financial decision is like debating active versus passive investment strategies, hedge funds versus mutual funds, Apple versus Google," said Milo M. Benningfield, a financial planner in San Francisco. "Somebody's going to be right in terms of higher returns in the future, but we can't know in advance who that will be -- and it will be tough to quantify how much risk was taken along the way."
The arguments in favor of ownership are persuasive, particularly for people who expect to stay in place for at least five to seven years but probably more. A mortgage acts like a forced savings plan, even if you're paying the bank hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest for the privilege of building equity. Call it the cost of enforcing a positive behavior.
Buying also generally protects consumers from rising rents, while traditional mortgage payments remain constant. Then, there is the fact that buyers are using borrowed money to purchase an asset that is likely to appreciate over a long period, though that can backfire as well (see housing market plunge, millions of underwater borrowers, circa 2008). Being able to call a place your own has a real, albeit intangible, value too.
How well any household will fare financially by buying or renting really depends on factors no one can predict. Other studies have found that renters who invest their down payment and any savings from renting as opposed to owning often come out ahead.
Either way, most financial professionals would caution against viewing a home purchase as an investment, particularly after factoring in the cost of maintenance, taxes, insurance and the high costs of buying and selling, though it's difficult not to.
It may be hard for people living in bubbly markets to believe, but, over all, home prices in the United States have risen just 0.37 percent annualized, after inflation, for the last 126 years, according to calculations by Robert J. Shiller, an economist who received the Nobel in economic science in 2013 and wrote the book on speculative bubbles, "Irrational Exuberance."
"Disregarding the special amenities that many people value in homeownership," Professor Shiller said, "it would be hugely better invested in the stock market."
And many people do accumulate substantial equity in their homes, which often becomes a cushy safety net in retirement. A study by the Harvard Joint Center found that, even after the housing crash, the median household who bought a home after 1999 still accrued significant amounts of wealth through 2013 (though whites gained more than African-Americans and Hispanics).
Christopher E. Herbert, managing director of Harvard's Joint Center, said he believed the results could be tied, in large part, to behavioral incentives. "The motivated savings up front and the forced savings over time," he said of accumulating a down payment and making mortgage payments.
There may also be something about many people who buy. As Mr. Benningfield pointed out, they may have other attributes that may contribute to their economic success.
Renting can still be financially advantageous under certain circumstances. Consider the work in 2012 by the academics Eli Beracha of Florida International University and Ken Johnson of Florida Atlantic University. They simulated a horse race between buyers and renters, and concluded that in many cases, renters came out ahead, at least during the eight-year stretches they studied.
Theoretical renters put their down payment in a portfolio that often consisted of more than 50 percent stocks (the professors created a portfolio that approximated the risk of owning a home), and continued to invest any savings from renting. But this assumes that there are savings from renting, which is not always the case, and that the renter is disciplined enough to actually set the money aside.
The authors' point, however, is that people often blindly believe that buying is usually the smarter option. "Most of the public drive to buy is without looking under the hood," Professor Johnson said.
Another study, from HelloWallet, a unit of Morningstar, came to similar conclusions in 2014 when comparing a hypothetical, moderate-income family that bought, with one that rented, in 20 major cities across the country. The study projects that median-income families, or those who earn about $50,000, will often end up with more net wealth if they rent versus own over the 10 years from 2013 to 2022.
But any number of variables can quickly shift that calculus, including the price of the home relative to the rent, whether the family is affluent enough to benefit from tax savings, and the time spent in the home.
"The longer you stay, the stronger the argument is for buying, all else equal," said Aron Szapiro, who conducted the analysis. But he also contends that the tax advantages of homeownership are often oversold, particularly to moderate-income households.
If you're trying to determine the right option, some guideposts may help. Mr. Szapiro, for example, found that in households with about $100,000 in earnings, net wealth typically rose more 10 years after buying a home than if they had rented -- but only if the annual rent was 6 percent or more of the purchase price. So it would pay to buy a $600,000 home when rent in the area was about $3,000 a month or more. (In a couple of places, including New York and Washington, he found that it made sense to buy when the cost of renting was a bit lower relative to home prices.)
William Bernstein, an investment adviser who has written several books for do-it-yourself investors, offered another rule of thumb: Never pay more than 15 years' fair rental value for any home, or 180 months of rent.
Why 15 years? By his calculations, someone paying more than 180 months of rent might potentially do better by investing in the market, after considering the costs of owning.
So if an apartment would rent for $4,000 a month, that means you shouldn't pay more than $720,000 ($4,000 x 180) for an equivalent property.
Perhaps easier to digest, Zillow advocates looking at how long it would take for buyers to break even, when compared with renters who invested their down payment of 20 percent and any savings in the stock market. Not surprisingly, buyers in places like Brooklyn, Washington and Los Angeles had to wait longer, at least four years.
Then there's what you feel in the pit of your stomach. To Mr. Austin, house prices in the enclave where he lives in Los Angeles feel as if they are in a bubble, the housing downturn a faded memory. "Many people we know," he added, "are tripping over themselves to buy right now."

Full text:   After years of economic desperation, American workers are finally regaining some of the ground they lost in the last decade's recession and the pallid recovery that followed.
Companies have been hiring in recent months at a pace not seen before in this century. Wages are rising faster than inflation. Joblessness is hovering near the low levels last reached in 2007 before the economy's downturn.
And perhaps most significantly, the army of unemployed people who gave up and dropped out of the job market is not only looking for work, but actually finding it.
The 215,000 jump in payrolls in March reported by the Labor Department on Friday capped the best two-year period for hiring since the late 1990s, while the proportion of Americans in the labor force -- which had been on a downward trajectory since 2001 and an even steeper slide since 2008 -- hit a two-year high.
"It's really a best-case scenario," said Michelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "I was particularly encouraged by the pickup in labor force participation."
The underlying strength apparent in the report for March reinforces growing evidence that the economy, despite a host of remaining ills, is now consistently moving in the right direction.
"This is close to a Goldilocks scenario," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. He noted that hiring and wage gains were healthy in March, but not so robust as to ignite inflation fears and tempt the Federal Reserve to move more quickly to raise rates and temper growth.
To be sure, the damage from the financial crisis and the severe recession it spawned is still not fully healed. Even with improvement of the past six months, the proportion of Americans in the labor force remains significantly below where it was when the recession began at the end of 2007.
"The labor force in the last few months has seen significant gains," said Claire McKenna, senior policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for lower-wage workers. "Things are moving in the right direction, but very slowly."
At the same time, while some of the highest-paid employees on Wall Street and at many leading companies have enjoyed big jumps in compensation, most workers have experienced only very modest wage gains, heightening worries about income inequality.
The American economy still faces fundamental headwinds that are not likely to abate soon -- like a persistent trade gap, low productivity and the long-term erosion of factory jobs that provide an economic lifeline to workers without a college degree.
In fact, the manufacturing sector was one of the few weak spots in the economy last month, losing 29,000 jobs.
But companies in the business of providing health care, leisure and hospitality and retailing each gained more than 40,000 jobs in March. And two very different sectors that pay well -- construction as well as professional and business services -- both added more than 30,000 jobs.
The overall unemployment rate rose to 5 percent last month, compared with 4.9 percent in February. But even that was a positive indication, analysts said, since it was the uptick in new entrants to the labor force that mostly accounted for the rise rather than job losses.
If anything, Friday's report portrays an economy gradually returning to a more normal trajectory, while so far avoiding the bubblelike excesses that prevailed in the late 1990s and just before the Great Recession in December 2007.
"The last two years have been the best since 1998 and 1999, and that's saying a lot," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm. "Those were boom years that we look back on very fondly, so to have that level of job growth again is pretty remarkable."
As a result, the economic backdrop of the presidential campaign is also starting to shift. Democrats note that unemployment has fallen sharply since President Obama took office; the jobless rate stood at 7.8 percent in January 2009.
Republicans have been citing stagnant wage growth, as well as the exit of many workers from the labor force in recent years. On the campaign trail, they also contend that Mr. Obama's stewardship of the economy has hobbled businesses in a web of excessive regulations.
But the steady expansion of the work force and the signs that a tightening labor market is finally translating into wage gains could ease some of the economic anxiety that has marked the primary season for Republican and Democratic candidates alike.
While some big companies have announced layoffs in recent months facing worries on Wall Street about profit margins, smaller firms are picking up the slack, especially in the technology sector.
"If you're a start-up, you're either growing or dying and we've been growing," said Adam M. Ochstein, the founder of the Chicago-based StratEx, which provides software that enables companies to automate human resources departments and cut down on paperwork.
StratEx hired two workers in March and plans to hire eight this month, bringing its overall work force to just over 80.
To lure software developers with three to five years under their belt, Mr. Ochstein has to pay about $100,000 a year. New hires for StratEx's help desk, who have been working for the same amount of time, command less than half that annually.
Until recently, the proportion of Americans either employed or actively looking for a job was falling. But it appears to have bottomed out at 62.4 percent in September 2015. The 63 percent participation rate is now back to where it was in February 2014.
Although it has been a modest improvement, it was enough to draw the attention of Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman. She termed the increase in participation "heartening" at a news conference last month.
"Wages and participation are where the rubber meets the road," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. "We will take our cue about the overall strength of the economy based on that."
Mr. Gapen, like many on Wall Street, urged the Fed to let the good times roll.
"Ms. Yellen is likely to see the March report as evidence that the Fed's policies are working and that their accommodative policies are helping to heal the labor market," he said. "So why push rates higher and potentially choke off that process?"

Full text:   Just when you thought Donald Trump couldn't say anything more shocking, he suggested that women who get abortions should be punished.
On MSNBC, he said abortion must be banned and then "there has to be some form of punishment" for women who manage to get abortions.
He declined to say what the punishment should be, dodging a question about whether it should be "10 years" in prison or something milder. But his comment raised the possibility of following the lead of countries like El Salvador, where women can be dragged off from a hospital to prison for getting an abortion. Indeed, rights groups say that women were wrongly imprisoned in El Salvador simply for having miscarriages.
Trump doesn't seem to have thought deeply about the issue -- what a surprise! -- and he departed from the mainstream anti-abortion position of targeting not women but abortion providers. As one person said on Twitter: "He's a walking cartoon parody of every leftist accusation against Republicans."
After the TV interview was over and the backlash had begun, Trump tried to back off his comment, saying in a statement, "The doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman."
Who knows where that leaves us!
One lesson is that Trump is an uninformed opportunist, but the episode does highlight two basic problems for the anti-abortion movement.
First, as long as the focus is on the fetus or on the claim of "protecting women," many in the public are sympathetic to the anti-abortion view. The moment the focus shifts to criminalizing women, sympathy shifts.
Anti-abortion activists have generally taken a savvy approach over the years by concentrating on extreme situations -- such as late-term so-called partial-birth abortions -- and on legislating obstacles that in practice reduce access: Of the 1,074 state restrictions on abortion put in place after Roe v. Wade in 1973, more than one-quarter were enacted since 2010, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
Many Americans are ambivalent on abortion. But Trump has now turned the attention back from the fetus to the woman. And remember that three in 10 American women get an abortion at some point in their lives.
Second, the data suggests that one of the most effective ways to reduce the number of abortions would be to increase the availability of publicly funded family planning. In 2013, publicly funded family planning prevented two million unintended pregnancies, including almost 700,000 abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
Yet Republicans try to defund Title X, the traditional family planning program in the United States. After inflation, its funding level is less than one-third what it was in 1980.
In truth, Trump's stance -- whatever it is -- would matter only if a more conservative Supreme Court revisited Roe v. Wade and some states were allowed to ban abortion altogether.
Moreover, medical abortion, achieved by taking two kinds of pills, is gaining ground on surgical abortion and is much more difficult to stop. In particular, one of the pills, misoprostol, is very cheap, has other uses and is at least 80 percent effective on its own in inducing an abortion early in pregnancy. The upshot is that early abortions will be increasingly difficult to prevent.
Trump's comments about punishing women are worth pondering because they reflect the logical conclusion of equating a fetus with any other human being.
This penalizing approach has been tried before and failed. A dozen years ago, I went to Portugal to cover such an effort. The police staked out women's health clinics, looking to arrest women who appeared likely to have just had abortions based on being pale or seeming upset. Some 48 women and a 16-year-old girl were prosecuted, along with accomplices such as husbands, boyfriends, parents and even a taxi driver who drove a woman to a clinic.
The women were humiliated on trial, their most intimate gynecological history revealed to the public. And the public was revolted. The women were all acquitted, and the public turned decisively in favor of abortion rights, by a majority of 79 percent to 14 percent.
"Forbidding abortion doesn't save anyone or anything," Sonia Fertuzinhos, a member of the Portuguese Parliament, told me at the time. "It just gets women arrested and humiliated in the public arena."
The episode left many Portuguese both anti-abortion and pro-choice. They were distressed by abortion, especially late in pregnancies, but they were aghast at the idea of prosecuting young women for making wrenching personal choices. I think many Americans feel the same way.
So maybe Trump, in his flip-flopping wavering about women's issues, can at least remind us of a larger truth. Whatever one thinks of abortion, criminalizing it would be worse.

Full text:   Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Tuesday that the United States economy remained on track despite a rough start to the year because the drag from weak growth in other countries was being offset by lower borrowing costs.
Ms. Yellen told the Economic Club of New York that the economy "had proven remarkably resilient," and that the Fed expected better days ahead. She said the Fed still intended to pursue a careful, patient course toward higher interest rates as the economy improved.
The cautious tone of her remarks, however, suggested no rate increase was likely at the Fed's next meeting, in April, shifting the eyes of Fed watchers to its subsequent meeting in June.
"I consider it appropriate for the committee to proceed cautiously in adjusting policy," Ms. Yellen said.
Stocks jumped and bond yields fell in the moments after the publication of Ms. Yellen's remarks, part of a now-familiar pattern in which markets celebrate signs of economic softness and Fed restraint because that means interest rates will stay lower for longer.
"The Fed chair is clearly in no hurry to undertake the next rate hike, in spite of the generally firmer tone of U.S. domestic data in recent weeks," Krishna Guha, head of the global policy and central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients. He said the remarks underscored that Ms. Yellen would rather move too slowly to raise interest rates and rein in the economy than too quickly.
The Fed, which raised its benchmark rate in December for the first time since the financial crisis, continues to debate the timing of a second increase.
The Fed's policy-making committee indicated after its most recent meeting, this month, that it now expected to raise rates by about half a percentage point this year.
That was half as much as the Fed had predicted at the beginning of the year.
Ms. Yellen attributed the deceleration on Tuesday to a judgment by Fed officials that somewhat lower rates were necessary to maintain steady growth.
"The committee in March did rethink to some extent the policy path that is appropriate to achieve an essentially unchanged outlook," Ms. Yellen said.
She described a dynamic in which slower growth in other nations, which tends to drag on domestic growth, had been offset by a loosening of financial conditions.
That is the way monetary policy is supposed to work -- markets anticipated the Fed's reaction to a weaker economic outlook, providing a jolt of stimulus before the Fed even had a chance to speak. The Fed then confirmed the market's expectations by announcing after its March policy meeting that it expected to raise its benchmark interest rate more slowly.
Ms. Yellen said the reaction showed that markets have internalized the Fed's mantra that its management of interest rates is "data dependent," meaning the Fed's predictions about the likely path of interest rates are contingent on the economy's actual performance.
"This mechanism serves as an important 'automatic stabilizer' for the economy," she said.
While the Fed's assessment of the economy's anticipated performance remains unchanged, Ms. Yellen said officials now saw more risks to that outlook.
Alongside the direct effects of slower global growth, she said she remained concerned about sluggish inflation and about the deterioration of inflation expectations.
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation rose by 1.7 percent through the 12 months that ended in January, a stronger pace than it managed the previous year. But Ms. Yellen said it was "too early to tell if this recent faster pace will prove durable."
Indeed, Fed officials predicted in March that inflation would subside somewhat in the coming months, attributing the higher readings in the latest inflation survey to unusual jumps in the price of some kinds of goods, most notably clothing.
The Fed regards the stability of inflation expectations as a mainstay of effective monetary policy. It wants inflation to be 2 percent a year and it wants people to believe inflation will be 2 percent a year, because expectations help to determine actual inflation.
Market-based measures of inflation expectations, however, are running well below 2 percent, while some survey-based measures also have drifted lower.
Ms. Yellen acknowledged these trends, a change from last year when Fed officials were largely dismissive. But she said the significance was "far from conclusive."
Fed officials continue to regard the decline in market-based measures as a result of pressures unrelated to expectations about inflation. And Ms. Yellen said that survey-based measures historically had fallen hand-in-hand with oil prices.
"Taken together, these results suggest that my baseline assumption of stable expectations is still justified," she said.
"Nevertheless, the decline in some indicators has heightened the risk that this judgment could be wrong," she added. "If so, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a more accommodative stance of monetary policy."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer spending in the United States barely rose in February, and inflation retreated. The report from the Commerce Department on Monday also showed that consumer spending in January was not as strong as previously reported, signaling that economic growth remained sluggish in the first quarter.
Consumer spending rose 0.1 percent as households cut back on goods purchases after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in January. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity, was previously reported to have increased 0.5 percent in January.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent. Given labor market strength and cheap gasoline, economists speculated that consumption had been hampered by a stock market sell-off at the start of the year that eroded consumer confidence.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the advance goods trade deficit widened to $62.9 billion in February, from $62.2 billion in January, rising for a fourth straight month as an increase in exports was offset by a gain in imports.
Inflation moderated last month. A price index for consumer spending dipped 0.1 percent, after nudging up 0.1 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the personal consumption expenditures price index increased 1 percent; it rose 1.2 percent in January.
Excluding food and energy, prices gained 0.1 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the so-called core personal consumption expenditures price index increased 1.7 percent after a similar increase in January.
"While the data from January and February may overstate any underlying firming, we do think that the trend in core inflation is picking up," said Daniel Silver, an economist at J.P. Morgan in New York.
That core index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. The slowdown in the monthly reading came after the Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, recently expressed skepticism over the sustainability of the gains in core inflation measures.
Consumer spending last month was held back by a 0.7 percent drop in purchases of goods. Spending on services rose 0.4 percent.
Personal income rose 0.2 percent after rising 0.5 percent in January. The slowdown in income growth is most likely temporary as anecdotal evidence indicates that a tightening jobs market is driving up wages.
In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said contracts to buy previously owned homes increased 3.5 percent in February to a seven-month high.

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- California lawmakers have reached a tentative deal to raise the state minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022, potentially signaling the biggest advance yet in a campaign to increase pay for low-income workers that has reverberated in the Democratic presidential contest and in cities across the country.
If approved, California would become the first state to adopt a $15 an hour minimum wage. A measure to impose a $15 statewide minimum wage in New York is under negotiation in Albany.
Under the tentative California deal -- which could be announced as soon as Monday -- the wage, which was raised to $10 an hour on Jan. 1, would increase incrementally to $15 over the next six years. Small businesses would have an extra year to comply.
Advocates for the higher wage hailed the California legislation, describing it as a major victory that would propel similar efforts nationally.
"This is a very big deal," said Paul K. Sonn, the general counsel to the National Employment Law Project, a national research and advocacy group on wages. "It would mean a raise for one of every three workers in the state."
The movement has gained traction in a dozen cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Last week, the mayor of Washington proposed raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2020.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is pushing for a $15 minimum wage in New York City by the beginning of 2019 and statewide by July 2021. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who has previously raised wages to $15 for state workers and fast-food employees, was attempting to broker a deal with the State Senate, which is led by Republicans who remain wary of the potential economic effect of the wage, particularly in long-suffering areas upstate.
The deal comes as raising the minimum wage has become a central point of contention in the Democratic presidential contest. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator running for the Democratic nomination, has made a $15 federal minimum wage a central plank in his campaign; it is now $7.25 an hour.
His opponent, Hillary Clinton, has called for a $12 federal minimum wage, but has said she supports efforts in some cities and states to pass a $15 minimum wage. She has resisted pressure to support a $15 federal minimum wage.
Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a Democrat, backed raising the minimum wage in 2013, when legislation passed increasing it to $10. He has since resisted efforts to raise it again, expressing concern that another increase could cost the state billions of dollars of wages and hurt the state's business climate.
Under the latest deal, the wage would increase to $10.50 at the beginning of 2017 and escalate steadily until reaching $15 by 2022.
The deal was outlined on Sunday by officials who had been briefed on the legislation and who requested anonymity to discuss a measure that had not yet been announced. Mr. Brown's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aides to lawmakers involved in the effort said they could not comment until a final deal was announced.
The tentative deal came after union leaders moved to take the issue to voters this November. An initiative to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2021, which would peg future increases to inflation, qualified for the ballot last week. Union leaders have the authority to withdraw the initiative, presuming they are satisfied with the new legislation.
"If a California minimum wage bill passes and is signed into law by the governor, we will take a careful look at it, and our executive board will decide what to do with our ballot initiative," said Steve Trossman, a spokesman for the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West.
The ultimate sweep of any New York legislation remains unclear. But Mr. Sonn said that if both these states act, as appears likely, it would have a dramatic effect, given their size.
"The scale of having both New York and California would reverse years of falling wages and result in very substantial wage growth for workers at the bottom," he said.

Abstract: The mayor's absence from cultural hot spots has caused consternation among arts patrons, who were accustomed to first-class treatment from Mr. de Blasio's predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, a philanthropist and champion of public art projects, including Christo's colossal "Gates" installation that festooned Central Park in fiery orange.

Full text:   Yes, he has seen "Hamilton."
But since his inauguration two years ago, Mayor Bill de Blasio has not visited the Museum of Modern Art. He has not attended a Nets or Knicks game. He has not been to the Guggenheim Museum, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the P.S. 1 art center in Queens, the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx or the Metropolitan Opera -- although he did see a movie at Lincoln Center once.
He has never visited the High Line, the renowned elevated park on the Far West Side of Manhattan. In 2014, he skipped a ceremony for the opening of its final portion. Instead, that day he drove six hours to Pittsburgh to attend a baseball game.
Asked recently when he last visited Central Park, the mayor replied, "I'll have to get back to you."
Mayors of New York have long considered themselves the city's cheerleaders in chief, making frequent appearances at its major institutions and promoting the world-class cultural offerings and only-in-New-York attractions that lure millions of tourists from around the world -- and persuade New Yorkers that it's worth putting up with tiny apartments and high rents just for a chance to live nearby.
Mr. de Blasio, by contrast, is more of a homebody who is protective of his privacy and prefers to spend downtime in his old Brooklyn neighborhood rather than out on the town. Uncomfortable in Gracie Mansion -- he often refers to the mayoral residence as a "hotel," and has complained to aides about feeling out of place in its halls -- he can frequently be found in Park Slope, exercising at his old gym and sipping cappuccinos at a beloved cafe.
The mayor's absence from cultural hot spots has caused consternation among arts patrons, who were accustomed to first-class treatment from Mr. de Blasio's predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, a philanthropist and champion of public art projects, including Christo's colossal "Gates" installation that festooned Central Park in fiery orange. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani alienated the cultural world when he threatened to cut off funding for the Brooklyn Museum over a provocative exhibition that incorporated elephant dung, but he was also an avid operagoer, requesting that Lincoln Center keep a seat free for busy days when he arrived after the first act. Mayor David N. Dinkins was a familiar figure at United States Open tennis matches in Flushing Meadows, Queens.
"Every mayor has a style, but part of being mayor is showing that you are a citizen of the city," said George Arzt, who served as a press secretary to Mayor Edward I. Koch, who made boosterism a trademark of his administration. "It's a city of restaurants, and museums, and other cultural opportunities -- being seen there gives a boost. If the mayor went to a Jackson Pollock show, people would say, 'Oh, I got to go to that show!"'
Big-city mayors rarely shirk this side of their duty: Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles often Instagrams his travels, showcasing local restaurants and attractions.
Still, with New York enjoying record-high tourism and record-low crime, some wonder: Does it matter how a mayor spends his free time?
City officials said this month that they were expecting 59.7 million visitors this year, breaking last year's record of 58.3 million, and that those visitors would generate an estimated $60 billion in economic activity and support about 360,000 tourism-related jobs -- numbers that would be the pride of any metropolis.
Fred Siegel, a historian who teaches at St. Francis College, said Mr. de Blasio did not have "an expansive view of the social life of the city." But he added that some New Yorkers simply might not care where their mayor goes.
"If the city's streets are functioning well, if crime is maintained, I think the mayor can get by without being a bon vivant," Mr. Siegel said.
>
So what does the mayor like to do?
Mr. de Blasio, who declined to be interviewed for this article, does have a cultural side, even if he does not always publicize it. He adored the Afropunk festival in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, telling his cultural affairs commissioner to ensure that the promoters retained their permit. He is a devotee of the 2008 musical "Fela!" -- he often urges its soundtrack upon aides -- and he attended a concert by the African singer Salif Keita at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He and his wife, Chirlane McCray, went to the New York African Film Festival at the Walter Reade Theater, and they had aisle seats at "Eclipsed," the new Lupita Nyong'o play on Broadway about sex slaves in Liberia.
"He's more 'Fela!' than 'Phantom,"' Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, said. "He's more 'Hamilton' than 'Hamlet."'
"He fits the New York demographic of a theatergoer, but not the deep-dive theater junkie who can sit through 'Long Day's Journey Into Night,"' Mr. Tompkins said. "He is paying attention to a different category of cultural institution in a way that I think is totally fine."
He also eats.
Bar Toto, a casual red-sauce spot in Park Slope, is half a block from the de Blasio homestead, and it is the mayor's go-to place for leisure and business meetings alike: His campaign fund has spent nearly $11,000 there since 2010.
Mr. de Blasio has also dined at old-school Delmonico's, the new-school Breslin, the Midtown Mediterranean spot Taboon, and Casa Lever, an expense-account stalwart where he and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ate. He attended the reopening of the Carnegie Deli. Some mornings, he and his wife stop by the Mansion diner, two blocks from Gracie Mansion, for omelets or oatmeal. John Philips, the owner, says that when there is a line, the mayor insists on waiting in it. "He's very courteous to our staff and to me personally," Mr. Philips said. "I can't say a bad word about him."
The mayor as sports fan is a role Mr. de Blasio has adopted with relish, if selectively. He watched the Rangers play in the Stanley Cup finals, and he dropped a ceremonial puck at the first Islanders game in Barclays Center. The mayor cheered on the Mets in the World Series, and he has visited Yankee Stadium several times, but for soccer games; his son, Dante, is a soccer fanatic. He also organized a parade for the national women's soccer team after they won the World Cup. A Red Sox fan, the mayor did attend a Yankees game -- once -- although his aides clarified that he stayed only for a few innings.
>
Now, past the midpoint of his first term, the mayor's cultural itinerary is starting to pick up.
In the last two weeks, Mr. de Blasio cut the ribbon at the opening of the Met Breuer building on the Upper East Side, declaring that "our identity as a city is caught up in the richness of our cultural life." He attended the premiere of a documentary film on gun violence. He went to the opening game of New York City F.C., the soccer team that plays at Yankee Stadium.
That was in addition to his recent Friday evening at "Eclipsed," where Mr. de Blasio kept a low profile, staying seated at intermission. Ms. McCray posted a photograph on Twitter of the first couple at the theater with the caption: "Two feminists out on date-night."
The mayor's recent excursions coincide with a broader retooling by his political team before an expected re-election bid. Mr. de Blasio is spending more time in parts of the city like Staten Island and Queens, which are not his traditional bases of support. The mayor's extensive travels -- he has been to Iowa, Israel and Italy, among other places -- had prompted grumbling; at one point last year, he had made more public appearances outside New York City than on Staten Island.
Tom Finkelpearl, the city's cultural affairs commissioner, recalled running into Mr. de Blasio at a Chaka Khan concert in Prospect Park. "He does love culture, understands the need, the financial and economic development need for culture," said Mr. Finkelpearl, whose department's budget has grown by more than 10 percent since Mr. de Blasio took office.
"But what I think is really wonderful is to hear him talk about the moral and spiritual need of culture in the community," Mr. Finkelpearl added. "I think people are confident he's going to be good for culture in the city, and continues to be good for culture in the city."
Mr. de Blasio is a proud social reformer and likes art with a moral purpose. He recently took time at news conferences to recommend the films "Spotlight" and "The Big Short," praising them for highlighting injustice. ("It makes your blood boil," he said of the latter.)
He also prides himself on a knowledge of pop culture, giving regular interviews to the hip-hop radio station Hot 97 and making a cameo on "The Good Wife," one of his favorite television shows. He attended the taping of the 40th-anniversary special for "Saturday Night Live" and has appeared as a guest with Seth Meyers, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah.
He has taken his son to the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, his aides said, and enjoys the Louis Armstrong House in Queens and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island. The mayor has attended official functions at the Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Carnegie Hall, and he watched Diana Ross perform at the renovated Kings Theater in Brooklyn.
In a statement emailed by aides, Mr. de Blasio said: "I appreciate the hidden and lesser known treasures of our city as much as I do its iconic offerings. I want to open up cultural windows to all New Yorkers, and the first lady and I have tried to do that by traveling across all five boroughs and experiencing and enjoying that which makes them unique."
Still, there are skeptics. Jordan Roth, a prominent Broadway producer, has griped about the mayor, saying it was "disappointing" that Mr. de Blasio had not attended more shows. Peggy Siegal, a prominent publicist, earned some notoriety when she told The Wall Street Journal -- in an article last spring about the mayor's absence at boldface events like the Met Gala hosted by Anna Wintour, the annual Costume Institute benefit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- that Mr. de Blasio had "disdain for the striving, successful New Yorkers."
"I seem to have hit on a sensitive nerve in the social scene of New York, by the mere fact that I received so many emails agreeing with the issue," Ms. Siegal recalled recently. She said that those in her world "would actually really like the mayor to come to these events."
"They like him," Ms. Siegal said. "He's a nice guy." (The mayor's office said he had not yet decided whether he would attend this year's Met Gala, which is on May 2.)
Mr. de Blasio's aides said that in addition to "Hamilton," he had seen "A Raisin in the Sun," "Rasheeda Speaking," "MotherStruck!" and a revival of Tom Stoppard's "The Real Thing." He attended Shakespeare in the Park on a night when Senator Chuck Schumer made a cameo. Recently, the mayor posted to Twitter that he wanted to see "Shuffle Along," a show, opening next month, about a landmark African-American musical from the 1920s.
Ken Sherrill, a professor emeritus at Hunter College, said the mayor -- who once said, "I'm not hired by the people to go to parades" -- was recalibrating his approach.
"I was watching the news last night, and I saw the mayor filling potholes," Professor Sherrill said. "For the first time, he seemed comfortable with the symbolic aspects of the job. I had always felt that he was not at ease."
"He is only lately coming to understand that the symbolic head-of-state activities are part of the job," he added, "that going to a park is not just for his pleasure -- it's for saying the parks are an important part of the city."
>
The mayor's interest in parks may be less relevant were it not for the outsize role Central Park has played in his administration.
Mr. de Blasio has spearheaded a widely opposed effort to ban the park's horse carriages, a pet cause of his political donors. Parks advocates cried foul when he proposed spending upward of $20 million in public funds for a private stable in the park, a plan that collapsed.
After the mayor failed to recall when he had last been to Central Park, his aides emailed a list of 10 ostensible visits there during his term. Several of the events did not actually take place inside the park, including visits to the Museum of Natural History and the inflation ceremony for floats in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which are on Central Park West.
In 2015, the mayor made only one bona fide Central Park visit: for CityFest, a Gospel-themed music festival. (He is, however, a devotee of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, where he and Ms. McCray were married under a pin oak tree.)
Mr. de Blasio has been scarce at other landmarks as well.
He did not ride the tram when visiting Roosevelt Island for a groundbreaking ceremony last year; Mr. Bloomberg, who also attended the event, took the tram.
In January, Mr. de Blasio hosted a news conference at the ferry terminal on Staten Island, to name a new ferryboat. Rather than ride a ferry, he was driven there in a sport utility vehicle. (An aide said the mayor needed privacy to make phone calls.) At the event, Mr. de Blasio could not recall his last ferry ride, although a reporter from The Staten Island Advance reminded him: October.
Told that Mr. de Blasio was driven to Staten Island, Bill Cunningham, a former spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, laughed. "You would think if you were going to name a ferryboat, you might ride on a ferryboat, but that's just the old advance man in me I suppose," Mr. Cunningham said.
Mr. Giuliani, in an interview, said that he could appreciate the pressures facing Mr. de Blasio, and that the mayor should not be faulted for taking time to relax in his old haunts, rather than hobnobbing around town. "It makes a lot of sense to me," Mr. Giuliani said. "Hey, Mayor Koch used to love to go down to the Village, because that was his old neighborhood."
Still, Mr. Giuliani, who was speaking from Warsaw, where he was traveling on business, said a mayor's presence at major attractions could be important. "People here in Poland may see a picture of the mayor in Central Park, and that makes them want to come to New York," he said.
"Even though he and I disagree philosophically, I have great empathy for the difficulty of his job," Mr. Giuliani said. "But you got to balance it. You do belong to the public, ultimately."

Full text:   WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Economic growth in the United States slowed in the fourth quarter, but not as sharply as previously estimated, with fairly strong consumer spending offsetting the drag from efforts by businesses to reduce inventory.
Gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 percent annual rate, higher than the previously reported 1 percent pace, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its third estimate of the nation's output.
G.D.P. growth was initially estimated to have risen at only a 0.7 percent rate but was later revised upward. The economy grew at a rate of 2 percent in the third quarter and expanded 2.4 percent for all of 2015.
The upward revision reflected a stronger pace of consumer spending than previously estimated.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose at a 2.4 percent pace and not the 2 percent rate reported last month. More consumption of services than previously estimated accounted for the revision.
The fairly solid pace of consumer spending underscores the economy's underlying strength and should further allay fears of a recession, which had led to a huge stock market sell-off early this year.
Spending is being supported by a tightening labor market, which is steadily lifting wages, and rising house prices. Gasoline prices around $2 a gallon are also helping to underpin household discretionary spending.
A moderately growing economy, combined with a strong jobs market and firming inflation, probably keeps the Federal Reserve on a path to gradually raise interest rates this year.
Inventory investment was revised lower in the fourth quarter. Still, inventories remain high relative to domestic demand.
Businesses accumulated $78.3 billion worth of inventory rather than the $81.7 billion reported last month. As a result, inventories subtracted 0.22 percentage point from G.D.P. growth instead of the previously reported 0.14 percentage point.
Estimates for G.D.P. for the first quarter, which will end March 31, are around a 1.5 percent rate. But with the inventory pile still large and shipments of capital goods ordered by businesses weak in January and February, the economy could slip.
There was some bad news in the latest report: Corporate profits fell for a second straight quarter as a strong dollar and cheap oil undercut the earnings of multinational companies.
Profits after tax -- after adjusting for inventory values and capital consumption -- declined at an annual rate of 8.4 percent. It was the biggest drop since the first quarter of 2014.
Profits from current production fell $159.6 billion, coming on the heels of a drop of $33 billion in the third quarter.
For all of 2015, profits dropped 5.1 percent, the largest decline since 2008, after slipping 0.6 percent in 2014.
Part of the drop in profits in the fourth quarter was a result of a $20.8 billion transfer payment related to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.
Profits from the rest of the world decreased $6.5 billion in the final three months of 2015 after sliding $23.1 billion in the third quarter.
Manufacturing profits declined $139.2 billion during the last quarter after decreasing by $4.1 billion in the July-September period. Profits in the petroleum and coal products sector tumbled $124.3 billion after rising $7 billion in the third quarter.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- As the gusher of oil money that underpinned the rise of President Vladimir V. Putin has dwindled in the price slump, the Kremlin has found ways to keep the economy chugging along, albeit at a reduced rate, spending down rainy day funds and cutting wages and pensions.
But the budget strains are worsening as the price decline grinds along, forcing the Kremlin to look for new sources of money -- freezing pensions, withholding wages, raising some taxes, selling off chunks of state-owned companies, even reportedly trimming military outlays.
Things have become so tight, insiders say, that the Kremlin is considering cracking open the one piggy bank that was always considered sacrosanct, one that carries long-term consequences for the Russian economy: taxing the funds that oil companies need to invest to ensure future oil production.
That move would be the oil industry equivalent of eating the seed corn. The longer the government keeps extracting cash from the crucial oil sector, the greater the damage to the country's future economic prospects, even if oil prices rebound.
"The situation is very serious," Mikhail I. Krutikhin, an energy analyst at the consultancy RusEnergy, said in a telephone interview. He estimates that Russia's oil production, now at a post-Soviet record high of 10.8 million barrels a day, will peak at some point next year and begin a long-term decline.
"The only question is the slant of this line," he said. "The oil companies are not investing at all in exploration of new deposits because profits on these projects will only come in 10 years. Nobody will invest in these projects."
This year, new taxes will cost oil companies about 200 billion rubles, or about $2.9 billion. But a far larger tax, reported by Russian news media to be up to $11 billion, is under consideration for the 2017 budget.
There is little doubt that Russia needs the money now, and that the oil companies provide an enticing target. Because they are paid in dollars but conduct their domestic business in the battered ruble, Russia's oil majors have lots of cash. While globally most oil companies are deep in the red, cash reserves industrywide in Russia remain at an estimated $90 billion, a deep and tempting pool for the strapped Kremlin.
But Mr. Putin, who personally oversees the energy industries, knows the dangers of taxing the companies too heavily and has long resisted the temptation. "Putin faces a dilemma," Mr. Krutikhin said.
The dilemma stems from the structure of Russia's oil tax system, which was designed for the state to capture the windfall of profits from high prices of oil and other commodities, rather than leaving them for the country's oligarchs.
The higher the price, the more Russia's oil companies are paid in taxes. At an oil price of $100 a barrel, for example, the companies were paying taxes of $74, according to Renaissance, a Moscow investment bank. When oil prices collapsed, the government took most of the loss in diminished tax receipts. With oil at $35 a barrel, the tax is about $17, leaving $18 a barrel for the companies -- not too much less than the $30 a barrel they made at the peak.
The average cost of producing and transporting a barrel of oil is about $15. Adding a tax of $17 a barrel, when oil is selling for $35, leaves a profit of only $3, a margin that rapidly shrinks as the tax rises, leaving little or nothing to show for an investment.
The quandary for the Kremlin is made worse by geology because oil deposits discovered and developed in Soviet times are nearing depletion. The country's oil future, like that of the United States, lies in offshore and shale projects that are more expensive to develop.
Given oil's outsize role in Russia's economy, it is no surprise that a fierce fight has erupted over tax policies. The powerful industry and its allies in the Ministry of Energy are resisting tax increases, while equally powerful factions in government want to raise taxes to maintain spending at current levels, not least on the military.
A study leaked from the Ministry of Energy, seen as allied with the oil industry, and published last week in the business daily Vedomosti, presented a doomsday scenario. Russia, the analysis predicted, could cease to be an oil power, with output plummeting to half the current level by 2035.
The Ministry of Finance, in contrast, has pressed for new taxes on the oil industry as Russia prepares a revised budget for 2016, which is due in June. Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, said the government was striving to keep the deficit within the legally required limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.
The ministry is considering foreign borrowing and privatizing shares in public companies, including in the national oil company, Rosneft, as an alternative to defense cuts or energy industry tax increases.
Even while piling up cash reserves, however, oil companies' investment rose at a rate of 11 percent, which was lower than inflation of 12.9 percent, last year. "The response from oil companies has been they will have to cut further into investment programs; otherwise, they will not be able to bring their books into balance," Mr. Tikhomirov said.
Lukoil, Russia's largest private oil company, trimmed spending last year on capital outlays to $9 billion, down $1.5 billion from the year before. Spending by Rosneft, the largest state company, also fell in dollar terms.
Russian companies have not broken ground on a major new field here since the Trebs and Titov, a complex of oil fields in northern Russia, was tapped in 2014 just as Western sanctions took effect and oil prices slumped.
Industry lobby groups have pushed back, so far as is possible in Russia's tightly coiled political system.
It would not be the first time oil entered a spiral of declining volumes and rising demands from the state. Short of cash in an oil price downturn in the late Soviet period, the Kremlin squeezed the oil industry. It was deprived of capital, at the time, for such things as imported machines.
Output in what is today the Russian Federation fell to about 8.8 barrels in 1991 from about 11 million barrels a day in 1988, according to "Collapse of an Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia," by a former prime minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, who argued that oil prices and not the arms race with the United States ended the Soviet Union.
A diminishing role for the oil industry is not so bad for Russia, politically or economically, Yevgeny G. Yasin, a former minister of economy, said in an interview. Russia should raise taxes on oil companies even if it diminishes the share of extractive industries in the economy in future years, and shift focus to other areas of Russian strength, such as education and science, he said. Instead, the revised budget proposes a 10 percent cut to nonmilitary outlays.
"The United States is successfully developing shale oil so that even if prices go up, it will only lead to more shale oil production" that would compete with new Russian output coming online years from now, Mr. Yasin said.
"If we want Russia to be a developed country, we should orient ourselves toward the innovation economy," he added.
"The fat years are over."

Full text:   INDIANAPOLIS -- The fuzzy video, shot by a worker on the floor of a Carrier factory here in the American heartland last month, captured the raging national debate over trade and the future of the working class in 3 minutes 32 seconds.
"This is strictly a business decision," a Carrier executive tells employees, describing how their 1,400 jobs making furnaces and heating equipment will be sent to Mexico. Workers there typically earn about $19 a day -- less than what many on the assembly line here make in an hour. As boos and curses erupt from the crowd, the executive says, "Please quiet down."
What came next was nothing of the kind.
Within hours of being posted on Facebook, the video went viral. Three days after Carrier's Feb. 10 announcement, Donald J. Trump seized on the video in a Republican presidential debate and made Carrier's move to Mexico a centerpiece of his stump speeches attacking free trade.
[Video: Carrier Air Conditioner (part of United Technologies) Moving 1,400 Jobs to Mexico Watch on YouTube.]
Jennifer Shanklin-Hawkins is one of those Carrier workers who listened to the announcement on the factory floor. After 14 years on the assembly line, she earns $21.22 an hour, enough to put her oldest son through college while raising two other children with her husband, a truck driver.
And when she saw Mr. Trump talking about Carrier on the news, all she could do was shout "Yessss!" at the TV. "I loved it," she said. "I was so happy Trump noticed us."
In living rooms and barrooms across Indianapolis, conversations with Carrier workers like Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins crystallize what has become an extraordinary moment in the American political and economic debate. As both political parties belatedly recognize the anxiety and deep-seated anger of blue-collar workers nationwide, the more-trade-is-good bipartisan consensus that has long held sway in Washington is being sundered.
What isn't evident in the video -- or in the furious debate it has spawned -- is that both the company and its soon-to-be former employees are reacting to the same transformative quarter-century of American economic policy aimed at lowering trade barriers and staying globally competitive.
"We have to look around the corner and see how this market will change in order to invest and stay in business for another 100 years," said Robert McDonough, a senior executive at Carrier's parent company, United Technologies. "You can blink and see your market position erode."
The rub is that the costs and benefits aren't distributed equally. Global trade has produced big gains for Americans, like more affordable goods -- clothes, computers, even air-conditioners -- and led to a more advanced economy.
At the same time, a chronic trade deficit and an overvalued dollar have caused factory jobs to dry up, contributing to a deep divide between the political and economic elite and the rest of the nation. Perhaps a clash was inevitable.
Consider the case of Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins. While she says she won't be voting for Mr. Trump and considers him a racist, she applauds his message on trade. She says she plans to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who similarly blasts free trade, but from the left. The two populist candidates may be political opposites, but when it comes to the downside of globalization, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump are speaking to her with one voice.
In fact, many Carrier workers here say that it was not so much Mr. Trump's nativist talk on illegal immigrants or his anti-Muslim statements that has fired them up. Instead, it was hearing a leading presidential candidate acknowledging just how much economic ground they've lost -- and promising to do something about it.
Mr. Trump has repudiated decades of G.O.P. support for free trade, calling for heavy tariffs on Mexican-made goods from the likes of Carrier. This has helped put him within arm's reach of the Republican nomination.
Opposition to trade deals has also galvanized supporters of Mr. Sanders, helping him unexpectedly win the Michigan Democratic primary this month. At the same time, it has forced his rival Hillary Clinton to distance herself from trade agreements she once supported, like the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 deal with Mexico that is an important part of President Bill Clinton's political legacy.
Exit polls after the Michigan primary , for example, showed that a clear majority of both Republican and Democratic voters believe international trade costs the American economy more jobs than it creates.
Nicole Hargrove, a 14-year Carrier worker, said she was an undecided voter and was uncomfortable with Mr. Trump's attacks on immigrants, particularly Mexicans. "But I'd like to turn him loose on the financial world," she said. "Maybe if Carrier had to pay more to bring stuff in, they'd think twice about moving jobs out."
Mark Weddle, 55, started work at Carrier 24 years ago and earns $21 an hour running a machine that makes heat exchangers. "I have two brothers-in-law from Mexico," he said, explaining why he disagrees with Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant stance.
But when it comes to Carrier, "we've all worked our butts off," he said. "And now they're going to throw us under the bus? If Trump will kick Carrier's ass, then I'll vote for him."
That's pretty much what Mr. Trump has threatened to do. At rally after rally, to rapturous crowds, he vows to impose a 35 percent tax on Carrier products from Mexico. Then, the laugh line: "I want to do this myself, but it is so unpresidential to call up Carrier."
And Mr. Trump vows not to take Carrier's calls until it agrees to change course. "As sure as you're here, they will call me up within 24 hours," he promises, and say to him, "'Sir, we've decided to stay in the United States."'
It is powerful talk.
The relentless loss of American manufacturing jobs, however, goes back nearly half a century, driven largely by forces beyond the control of any president. The advances of technology, the diffusion of industrial expertise around the world, the availability of cheap labor and the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse would have disrupted the nation's industrial heartland even without new trade deals.
Nor are tariffs likely to bring many of these jobs back, said David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., who is one of the country's foremost specialists on the pluses and minuses of free trade. "We don't have silver bullets," he said.
"When I learned about the impact of trade agreements, the theory was that workers would be 'released' into the labor market and hired back at slightly lower salaries," Mr. Autor said. "That's not what happened. And no amount of cheaper air-conditioners will make these workers whole."
'Pretty Cool Working There'
On a rainy Thursday afternoon this month, after their 6 a.m.-to-4:30 p.m. shift, a dozen Carrier workers gathered at Sully's Bar & Grill to talk about the decades they had spent at the low-slung, beige-and-white factory across the street.
The group was diverse: black and white, male and female, old and young. And until the announcement of the eventual shutdown, most of them said they had loved working for Carrier, assembling furnaces and fan coils, hard as the work could be.
The workers in the Indianapolis factory are represented by the United Steelworkers union. As has been the case in the auto industry, the union agreed in 2011 to a two-tier wage system in which new hires were paid less than veteran employees.
"I'm more skilled with my hands than I am with my brain," said Robin Maynard, half joking. He holds two associate degrees, oversees a team of 15 and has worked at Carrier almost 24 years. "But I like working with my hands."
Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins emphasized that she, too, enjoyed her work, despite having little flexibility when it came to setting hours. "I missed football games, graduations, you name it," she said.
Her shifts can run 10 hours a day, six days in a row during summer and fall, when her line is busy, and mandatory overtime can total 20 hours a week. The pay, benefits and pension plan are all good, but it wasn't just the money that kept her on the assembly line, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins said.
"It's pretty cool working there," she said, describing how she carefully puts together "tubular mixers," batches of rods that control the air flow in Carrier furnaces. "And when you do it for 60 hours a week, people are like family."
It is painstaking work: Bend the rods, or force them into place, and the line can come to a halt, prompting a tongue-lashing from a supervisor. Despite that, like many of the 12 million American factory workers, Ms. Shanklin-Hawkins says the nation's leaders have simply lost respect for people who make things.
"They didn't even thank us for our work," she said. "It was wrong."
Indianapolis is far better off than many other cities in and around the Rust Belt. For the most part, it has successfully made the transition to an economy powered by services like health care, logistics and banking. The city's unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, below the national average of 4.9 percent.
But many of the new jobs don't pay nearly as well as Carrier does. Next to the 49-year-old Carrier plant is an Amazon warehouse that opened in 2011, but with salaries there averaging just over $15 an hour, that's a lot less than the $20 or more an hour Carrier workers typically earn.
Indiana politicians, who granted Carrier tax breaks and other incentives, are furious at the company and want their money back. They are also angry because Carrier's parent, United Technologies, is a major military contractor that receives $5.6 billion annually from the federal government.
"That's financed by the taxpayers they just fired," said Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana. "They are trying to be the ultimate free rider."
Carrier has said it will return public money in cases where the company has not kept its commitments to invest. But that's small change for United Technologies, a company with sales of $56 billion annually, more than Walt Disney, Coca-Cola or Goldman Sachs. And, in any case, it won't bring the jobs back.
Carol Bigbee, 59, has worked at Carrier for 13 years. Her 32-year-old daughter has a college degree and the kind of job that many economists say is the future in postindustrial America -- she works in a medical lab. The only problem, Ms. Bigbee said, is that her daughter's hourly pay is one-third less than her own pay at Carrier.
"I think it will be extremely hard to find a job that pays $22 an hour," Ms. Bigbee said. "You have to be really blessed to find a job that pays that kind of money." The few manufacturing jobs left require math tests, something she says she worries she could not pass.
The first layoffs won't begin until 2017, and the final shuttering of the factory isn't expected to happen until 2019, giving employees time to prepare. In addition, United Technologies has offered to cover the cost of at least four years of additional schooling for Carrier workers. But that's cold comfort to people who can't afford not to work or those, like Ms. Bigbee, who are near retirement.
She will be 60 in May, making retraining impractical. "If I were in my 40s, I'd go back to school," she said.
'A Really Tough Decision'
As Ms. Bigbee and her co-workers were talking over beers and Tequila Sunrises at Sully's in Indianapolis, executives from United Technologies were hosting a gathering of their own in New York City -- at the Plaza Hotel, a property that was once owned, as it happens, by Donald Trump.
That meeting was part of "investor day," an annual ritual for many Fortune 500 companies in which management sits down with analysts and shareholders and tells them why their company's stock is a good buy. Carrier's message: Moving jobs south of the border is a major part of the company's strategy to increase profits.
"We've shifted an abundant part of our manufacturing footprint to relatively lower cost countries, about two-thirds," said Mr. McDonough, president of the climate, controls and security division of United Technologies. "Still, there's some opportunity there."
Manufacturing products in lower-cost locales isn't new for Carrier, which has had operations in Monterrey, Mexico, since 1969, decades before Nafta's passage.
But Akhil Johri, the chief financial officer, noted that recent factory consolidation was among the reasons Carrier's management is eyeing a list of targets for future cuts. "They are painful" but are necessary "for the long-term, competitive nature of the business and shareholder value creation," he said. "We feel good about being able to execute on that."
United Technologies faces pressure from investors hungry for earnings growth in an economy that's only modestly growing at home, and falling in important overseas markets like China and the Middle East. Although the company's stock has vastly outperformed benchmarks in the last few decades, the shares have badly trailed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the most recent five years.
Wall Street is looking for United Technologies to post a 17 percent increase in earnings per share over the next two years, even though sales are expected to rise only 8 percent. Bridging that gap means cutting costs wherever savings can be found, as Mr. McDonough suggested at the meeting with analysts.
Still he rejected the notion that pressure from Wall Street, or corporate greed, or even trade policy, had prompted the factory move to Monterrey. "This was a really tough decision," he said. "This will have a real impact on folks we care about and this community. We're an American company, but we compete globally."
Staying competitive, raising profits and investing are among the reasons 400 white-collar jobs in areas like engineering and marketing will remain in Indiana.
"Our company, with American workers," he added, "builds a heck of a lot of stuff in the U.S."
'A Healthy Environment'
Less than a three-hour drive south of Laredo, Tex., where the mountains meet the desert scrub near Monterrey, lies one industrial park after another. That's where Carrier and many other American manufacturers have built gleaming factories.
Outside Carrier's plant on Hermenegildo Galeana Street in the suburb of Santa Catarina, a worker named Antonio Arroyo has nothing but positive things to say about his job, much like his colleagues in Indianapolis until last month. "The atmosphere is relaxed, a healthy environment," he said. "Even the temporary workers are constantly trained."
As in the United States, the day shift starts around 6 a.m. and finishes about 4 p.m., with a break for lunch. Temporary workers, who have contracts lasting from three to six months, earn 163 pesos a day, or $9.40. Permanent workers make 330 pesos for a day's work, or $19.
Hourly salaries in Indianapolis range from $15 to $26 an hour, as they do up the road in Huntington, Ind., where an additional 700 United Technologies jobs will be transferred to Mexico as well.
United Technologies is not hurting like the American automakers or steel giants who lost billions when they were caught short by up-and-coming Japanese and South Korean competitors in the 1970s and 1980s. But the company says it fears it could end up in a similar situation if it doesn't make sure it is among the most efficient manufacturers in the world.
Over all, United Technologies earned nearly $7.6 billion last year, and $2.9 billion of that came from the climate, controls and security division that includes Carrier. Those profits aren't under pressure; in fact, margins in the unit have steadily expanded in recent years.
But that's not good enough, said Howard Rubel, a senior analyst at Jefferies, who notes that United Technologies has vowed to cut at least a half-billion dollars in costs annually for the next few years. "The stock hasn't done well," Mr. Rubel pointed out.
United Technologies' board cut the bonus of its chief executive, Gregory J. Hayes, by nearly half for 2015. Still, with a total compensation package of $5.7 million, he made more last year than Carrier's factory workers could earn in several lifetimes. But in corporate boardrooms and country clubs, that's not the point.
"It's embarrassing," said Mr. Rubel. "The stock didn't do well, and he got dinged. And whether it's the board or personal pride, no one wants that."
Back in Indiana, smaller bonuses for top executives are the last thing state Representative Karlee Macer wants to hear about these days. Her district includes the Carrier plant, and for all their grit and noise and physical strain, manufacturing jobs aren't like many other positions available to Americans who lack a college degree, she said. For one thing, they pay more, giving the children of factory workers other options if they so choose.
"My family has all been factory workers, including my grandmother, who came home with burn marks from welding," she said over breakfast across the street from the Indiana Statehouse. "Is everybody who is not a white-collar worker supposed to earn $12 an hour?"

Full text:   When Shirley Temple was around 12 and about to star in the 1940 film, "The Blue Bird," she received a 9.54-carat Fancy Deep Blue diamond ring from her father that she kept until she died in 2014.
Now that ring -- in its original Art Deco-inspired setting -- is coming up for auction at Sotheby's Magnificent Jewels sale in New York on April 19.
The ring, for which Temple's father paid $7,210 in 1940 -- roughly $122,000 today, with inflation rates -- has an estimate of $25 million to $35 million.
"Shirley Temple helped to lift America's spirits out of the Great Depression, and served her country in many capacities throughout the remainder of her life," Frank Everett, sales director of Sotheby's New York jewelry department said in a statement, adding that the ring recalled "a time when she was nothing short of the biggest movie star in the world."

Full text:   United States stocks rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and indicated that it would raise rates more gradually than it had envisioned last year.
The market had been lower before the Fed released its statement, which highlighted strength in hiring and housing but weakness in exports and concerns over slower global economic growth.
The Fed now expects to raise interest rates two times this year instead of four.
Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist for UBS Wealth Management Americas, said the Fed and the markets now seemed to have the same view on interest rate increases, and that meant the market might be a little less volatile.
"It probably eases investors' minds that we're unlikely to see a rate increases in April, and it probably takes June off the table," he said.
Lower rates help lift economic growth by reducing borrowing costs and reducing the risk associated with expanding businesses or starting new ones. Lower rates also make stocks look more attractive to investors.
Stocks are now on track for their fifth straight week of gains, and the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at their highest levels of the year.
The Dow gained 74.23 points Wednesday, or 0.4 percent, to 17,325.76. The S.&P. 500 index rose 11.29 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,027.22. The Nasdaq composite index rose 35.30 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,763.97.
Oil prices rose nearly 6 percent and pushed energy shares sharply higher.
Crude rose after a group of major energy-producing nations said they would hold more talks next month about a freeze in oil output levels. A deal -- far from a sure thing -- could help relieve a supply glut that has depressed prices.
Benchmark United States crude rose $2.12 to settle at $38.46 a barrel in New York. Brent crude rose $1.59, or 4.1 percent, to settle at $40.33 a barrel.
Energy companies were the top-performing sector in the market. Devon Energy gained $2.13, or 8.8 percent, to $26.22 Southwestern Energy rose 67 cents, or 9.3 percent, to $7.90. And Oneok added $1.79, or 6.5 percent, to $29.51.
After the Fed's decision, bond prices rose sharply and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.91 percent from 1.97 percent. The euro rose to $1.12 from $1.11 late Tuesday. The dollar fell to 112.55 yen from 113.11 yen.
Mining and materials companies and technology stocks, which would all benefit from a weaker dollar, also traded higher. Newmont Mining rose $1.18, or 4.5 percent, to $27.55 and Alcoa added 58 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $9.74. Apple rose $1.39, or 1.3 percent, to $105.97 and Microsoft gained 76 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $54.35.
Metals prices were little changed. Gold lost $1.10, to $1,229.30 an ounce. Silver decreased 4 cents, to $15.22 an ounce. Copper remained at $2.23 a pound.
Shares of Peabody Energy, the largest coal mining company in the United States, plunged after it said it was delaying an interest payment and might have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The stock sank $1.82, or 45.4 percent, to $2.19.
Stocks have been rising in recent weeks on mounting evidence that the United States economy remains in good shape over all despite the shaky state of other major economies.
That trend continued on Wednesday as the Labor Department said core inflation, which does not include energy and food prices, rose further. It is up 2.3 percent over the last year, its biggest 12-month gain since May 2012. Overall inflation fell in February because of lower gas prices, and it is up just 1 percent in the last year.
The Fed has been looking closely at inflation as it considers raising interest rates. Though one of the Fed's main goals is to prevent runaway inflation, it wants to see inflation rise more than it has in recent years to make sure the economy is healthy enough to handle higher rates.
Separate reports showed construction of new homes increased further in February, but applications were weak again, a sign of future trouble.
United States factories made more machinery, appliances and computers in February. It is the second straight monthly increase and a sign manufacturing is improving.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 1 cent, to $1.42 a gallon. Heating oil gained 5 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $1.23 a gallon. Natural gas rose 2 cents, to $1.87 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The German DAX gained 0.5 percent and the British FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. The CAC 40 in France fell 0.2 percent.
Asian stocks were also uneven. Japan's benchmark, the Nikkei 225, fell 0.8 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.2 percent while the Shanghai composite index rose 0.2 percent.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Underlying inflation in the United States increased more than expected in February as rents and medical costs maintained their upward trend.
Other data on Wednesday showed that the housing market continuing to strengthen last month and that manufacturing stabilized.
New projections from the Federal Reserve showed policy makers expected to make two rate increases by the end of the year, half the number forecast in December. The combination of stirring inflation, a steady housing sector and tightening labor market have raised the probability of a rate hike in June.
"It looks like the Fed remains really cautious, they are not prepared to move before June at the earliest. Today's numbers, especially the inflation report, is a warning that the days of no price pressures are behind us," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.3 percent last month after a similar gain in January.
That lifted the so-called core C.P.I. 2.3 percent in the 12 months through February, the largest increase since May 2012. That index advanced 2.2 percent in January.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts increased 5.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.18 million units last month, the highest level in five months.
Groundbreaking activity had been held back by adverse weather. While the rebound in housing starts offered a lift to growth estimates for gross domestic product in the first quarter, that was offset by a drop in utilities output as temperatures warmed up in February.
First-quarter growth is forecast around a 2 percent annual rate, an acceleration from the 1 percent rate logged in the final three months of the year.
In a third report, the Federal Reserve said industrial production declined 0.5 percent as mining and utilities tumbled. Industrial production rose 0.8 percent in January. But manufacturing output increased 0.2 percent last month, after spiking 0.5 percent in January.
The rise in factory output added to manufacturing surveys in suggesting that the downturn in the sector, which accounts for 12 percent of the American economy, had probably run its course. Factories have been hit by dollar strength and lower oil prices.
"The overall outlook for the U.S. industrial sector is beginning to look a little better," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief United States economist at TD Securities in New York.
The housing sector is being supported by a strengthening labor market, which is encouraging young adults to leave their parents' homes. But builders cannot keep up with the demand for housing because of a shortage of lots and skilled labor, which is driving rents higher in major metropolitan areas.
The second month of broad increases in the core C.P.I. was driven by a 0.3 percent increase in rents, which followed a similar gain in January.
Medical care costs rose 0.5 percent after advancing by the same margin in January. Prescription drug prices rose 0.9 percent, while the cost of hospital services increased 0.5 percent. Apparel prices rose by the most in seven years.
The second straight month of increase in apparel prices is surprising because retailers have been giving big discounts to clear unwanted merchandise from their warehouses.
Consumers also paid more for new motor vehicles and used cars and trucks. But a 13 percent drop in gasoline prices, which offset both the increase in core C.P.I. and a 0.2 percent gain in food prices, led to the overall C.P.I.'s 0.2 percent decrease in February. The index was unchanged in January.
Last month's drop resulted in the C.P.I.'s 1 percent increase in the 12 months through February, slowing after a 1.4 percent rise in January.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve has once again pared its plans for raising interest rates, citing the weakness of the global economy as a reason for greater caution about the prospects for domestic growth.
The Fed's policy-making committee voted not to raise its benchmark rate at a meeting that ended on Wednesday, although general expectations at the beginning of the year were for an increase this month. And it pulled back sharply from a December prediction that the rate would rise by one percentage point this year. Fed officials now expect to raise rates by just half a percentage point this year.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said the central bank remained relatively optimistic about the domestic economy, which she said had shown no signs of damage from the wobbles of financial markets or from weak global growth. But she said that prudence dictated caution.
"What you see here is a virtually unchanged path of economic projections and a slightly more accommodative path" for monetary policy, Ms. Yellen told a news conference on Wednesday.
The Fed's prolongation of its stimulus campaign pleased investors. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose sharply when the Fed made its announcement, and closed up 0.56 percent for the day. After a rough start to the year, the major stock gauges have nearly recouped their losses.
The Fed entered the year planning to raise its benchmark rate about one percentage point, most likely in four quarter-point increments. Officials backed away from those plans after financial conditions tightened in January because of concerns about the health of the global economy.
Officials said they were waiting to assess the impact of market turmoil on the broader economy.
On Wednesday the Fed made clear that its plans had been delayed but not derailed. It issued a relatively upbeat assessment of economic conditions and affirmed plans to raise rates gradually.
"Economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments in recent months," the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making committee, said in a statement at the conclusion of the scheduled two-day meeting.
The statement did not clarify the timing of the Fed's next move. The committee next meets in April and June. Analysts and investors do not expect another rate increase until June.
Ms. Yellen gave two principal reasons that the Fed was now planning to move more slowly.
First, while the United States has outpaced other developed nations in recent years, Ms. Yellen said weak global growth posed a continuing threat.
Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, argued in a recent speech that the Fed might be constrained in its ability to raise rates at a time when other major central banks are still engaged in aggressive stimulus campaigns. Ms. Yellen, asked about this assessment, acknowledged that such policies can weigh on domestic growth, for example by strengthening the dollar, which reduces demand for American goods overseas.
Second, Ms. Yellen said, financial markets are doing some of the Fed's work. Tighter financial conditions, like increased borrowing costs faced by some corporations, are the effective equivalent of Fed rate increases.
There was one dissent on Wednesday. Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted to raise rates by a quarter-point. The statement did not explain her reasons; she has said in recent speeches that higher rates are appropriate given the strength of domestic growth.
Some analysts agree. "We remain of the view that the data will in due course force the Fed to raise rates faster than they or the markets expect," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "Denial only works up the point where the data are unambiguously telling the opposite story; that point is not far off."
Fed officials, however, predicted the pace of rate increases would slow in coming years. Their median estimate is that the Fed's benchmark rate will hit 3 percent by the end of 2018.
The plans for a slower climb are not a result of a change in the Fed's economic outlook. Officials at the central bank still expect the economy to expand at an annual rate of about 2 percent, and they still expect inflation to rise gradually, remaining below a 2 percent annual pace until 2018.
Some economists see evidence that inflation is beginning to gain strength. Prices rose 1.7 percent in the 12 months through January, according to the latest reading from the Bureau of Economic Analysis -- the Fed's preferred gauge -- bringing the central bank closer to its goal of 2 percent annual inflation.
"We may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the inflation rate," Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, said in a speech last week.
But Ms. Yellen on Wednesday played down this evidence. She said price increases in some areas, such as clothing, had been "unusually high" in recent reports and might not signal a trend.
"I haven't yet concluded that we have seen any significant uptick that will be lasting," she said.
Fed officials predicted that inflation this year would be 1.2 percent. That is lower than the government's most recent estimate of 1.3 percent through the 12 months ending in January, implying that the Fed expects inflation to rise more slowly.
"The main message from the Fed today is that it is too early to worry about inflation," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
The Fed also indicated that it saw room for improvement in the labor market. The median forecast by Fed officials is for the unemployment rate to fall to 4.5 percent in 2018, from the December median forecast of 4.7 percent.
Ms. Yellen cited persistently weak wage growth as one reason.
Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco argued in a recent analysis that weak wage growth was not an indicator of labor market slack. Instead, they said, the makeup of the labor force is shifting as older, higher-paid workers are replaced by younger, lower-paid ones.
Ms. Yellen nonetheless described herself as "somewhat surprised that we're not seeing more of a pickup in wage growth."
She said other labor market indicators also suggested the economy had yet to fully absorb the surplus of workers. The share of part-time workers who want full-time jobs remains high. And the share of adults participating in the labor force has increased in recent months as people who had stopped looking for work resume searching or move into new jobs.

Fed Strategy for Key Rate Is Delayed, Not Derailed

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials will gather in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday to debate whether a bumpy start to the year is now in the rearview mirror, clearing the way for higher interest rates.
The Fed is not likely to raise rates this week, but the steady growth of the domestic economy -- despite the wobbles of financial markets and the weakness of other developed nations -- is strengthening the hand of officials who say that higher rates are necessary to maintain control of price inflation.
It seems increasingly clear that the Fed's plans to spend 2016 gradually raising its benchmark interest rate have been delayed, not derailed.
The challenge now confronting Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, is forging a consensus among Fed officials about how soon to resume the march begun in December, when the Fed raised rates, by 0.25 percent, for the first time since the financial crisis.
Some Fed officials still emphasize caution, arguing there is little risk in moving slowly. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, has been particularly vocal in warning that the weakness of the global economy could weigh on domestic growth.
"We should not take the strength in the U.S. labor market and consumption for granted," Ms. Brainard said in a speech last week. "Given weak and decelerating foreign demand, it is critical to carefully protect and preserve the progress we have made here at home through prudent adjustments to the policy path."
But other officials are antsy about inflation. Prices rose 1.7 percent in the 12 months through the end of January, according to the latest reading from the Fed's preferred gauge. The modest uptick brings the Fed closer to its goal of 2 percent annual inflation for the first time in years.
"We may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the inflation rate," Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, said in a speech last week.
Fed officials predicted in December that they would raise the benchmark rate by about one percentage point over the course of 2016, most likely in four quarter-point increments. The Fed was widely expected to make the first of those increases this week. But when markets started gyrating, Fed officials hit the brakes, offering reassurances that they would not make any big decisions until things calmed down.
Financial conditions tightened early in the year as investors pulled back from riskier loans and demanded higher interest rates. The effect by the end of January was the equivalent of the Fed raising rates by one percentage point, according to economists at Goldman Sachs.
But the tightening has almost completely reversed. The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 10 percent of its value during the first six weeks of the year, has rebounded and is now down just 1 percent this year. Indeed, some analysts say the Fed overreacted and should have preserved the option of a rate increase in March.
"We get that when it comes to monetary policy, concerns about market stability and global headwinds have trumped the resilience in the U.S. economy," said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets. "But even here, there has been considerable improvement."
But analysts do not expect the Fed to surprise investors, who have written off the chances of a policy change this week. Instead, most are looking for the Fed to signal that rate increases will resume in the coming months.
The Fed's next scheduled meetings are in April and June.
Wage growth remains slow, which some Fed officials see as evidence that employers are still finding an abundance of candidates for available jobs. Such slack in the labor market might suggest the Fed should persist in its stimulus campaign.
In a recent analysis, however, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco argued that the weakness of wage growth reflected a shift in the composition of the work force as relatively high-paid baby boomers retire and companies hire younger, cheaper workers.
"Sluggish wage growth may be a poor indicator of labor market slack," the analysis concluded. "In fact, correcting for worker composition changes, wages are consistent with a strong labor market that is drawing low-wage workers into full-time employment."
Job growth has outpaced economic growth, which remains relatively weak. But that, too, has waned in the minds of Fed officials as a reason to extend the central bank's stimulus campaign. There is a growing consensus that job growth is relatively fast because productivity growth is relatively slow. The output of each worker, in other words, is rising more slowly, so employers need more workers at any given level of economic growth.
Ms. Brainard suggested last month that the Fed might be limited in its ability to raise rates at a time when other major central banks are pressing ahead with stimulus campaigns. The divergence tends to amplify the impact of rate increases, for example by increasing the value of the dollar and restraining exports.
"Predictions that U.S. monetary policy would chart a notably divergent path have been tempered by powerful crosscurrents from abroad," Ms. Brainard said at a conference in New York.
The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate last week to zero from 0.05 percent, a largely symbolic move, and announced that it would increase its purchases of government bonds and begin to buy corporate bonds. It also announced a pair of measures to encourage bank lending: increasing the penalties on money that banks keep on deposit with the E.C.B. and, for the first time, paying banks what amounts to a small fee to make loans.
The central banks of Japan and China are also continuing to pump money.
Economists at Goldman Sachs, however, concluded in a recent analysis that the current differences among the major central banks were not "unusual or implausible" by the standards of recent decades.
If the economic fortunes of the United States continue to diverge from those of other developed nations, it is likely that the Fed's path will diverge, too.

Full text:   Viacom meeting expected to be short and free of conflict.
A looming power struggle. A salacious court battle. A shareholder suit. A 45 percent drop in the share price over the last year. Viacom has had no shortage of strife but the entertainment company's annual meeting on Monday is expected to be an exception. That's when Viacom shareholders will vote on whether to re-elect the company's 11 directors. Despite the turmoil at Viacom, it is a foregone conclusion that all the directors will keep their jobs. And if last year's meeting is any indication, the meeting will be short: Last year's lasted only about 15 minutes. --Emily Steel
SXSW's tech-focused week closes with Silicon Valley executives.
The "interactive" tech-focused week of South by Southwest, the digital media conference held annually in Austin, Tex., will continue into the early part of this week. Closing sessions include Steve Chen, a co-founder of YouTube; Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder; and The New York Times's tech columnist Farhad Manjoo in conversation with Stewart Butterfield, chief executive of Slack, the richly valued enterprise-collaboration software company. The music portion of the festival begins on Tuesday and will include established and up-and-coming acts from around the world. --Mike Isaac
Leaders of self-driving car projects to testify at Senate hearing.
Driverless cars are the focus of a Senate hearing on Tuesday on the opportunities of and potential concerns about autonomous vehicles. The Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation will hear from several commercial leaders in the field, including Google X's director of self- driving cars, Chris Urmson; Mike Ableson, a G.M. vice president; and Joseph Okpaku, a Lyft vice president. Mary Louise Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University, will also testify. The afternoon hearing will "explore the appropriate role of government in promoting innovation including removing unnecessary hurdles," the committee said in a release. --Cecilia Kang
Auto sales and gas prices expected to explain slower spending.
Retail sales for February, due from the Department of Commerce on Tuesday, are expected to show a slight slowdown in spending. That headline sales figure was probably hurt by lower automobile sales and cheaper gas prices, which translate to lower receipts at the pump, economists say. Excluding spending on autos and gas, spending probably logged modest gains, after a 0.6 percent jump in January.
Overall, the sales figures will probably show that consumer confidence in the economy remained robust amid a tightening job market and a rise in wages over the period. --Hiroko Tabuchi
Steady interest rates expected in Japan, U.S. and Britain.
This is a week of central bankers' meetings, starting with the Bank of Japan on Tuesday. The bank is not expected to make a change in interest rates after taking the aggressive step in January of cutting rates below zero to stimulate an economy long in the economic doldrums. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve officials will announce their decision. They are also not expected to make any changes.
But with the American economy steadily growing, the trajectory of interest rates in the United States is up, and the Fed may indicate when it will follow up on its last rate increase in December.And on Thursday, the Bank of England is also expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged. The rate there has been at a record low of 0.5 percent since March 2009. --Phyllis Messinger
Food and energy costs aside, consumer prices should tick up.
On Wednesday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will report the latest data on consumer prices in February. As anyone who has filled up their tank recently knows, gas prices are down, and lower energy costs are expected to result in a 0.2 percentage point drop in the Consumer Price Index for last month.
Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, however, the C.P.I. is expected to rise by 0.2 percentage point. Either way, the data is expected to suggest inflation remains tame, with a year-over-year rise in the core C.P.I. of just over 2 percent.--Nelson D. Schwartz
More profits possible for Lufthansa, despite greater competition.
Lufthansa is expected to report higher profits for 2015 on Thursday, bolstered by fuel-cost savings as oil prices fell. But the German flag carrier continues to face a long list of serious challenges, including heightened competition on both short- and long-haul routes and tense relations with labor unions as it restructures and places more emphasis on Eurowings, a low-cost subsidiary. --Nicola Clark
Wall Street's primary regulator to address oversight of big banks.
The financial crisis of 2008 and a string of scandals at large banks since then have revealed the challenges of regulating giant financial institutions. On Friday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Wall Street's primary regulator, is scheduled to hold an invitation-only conference that will focus on efforts to supervise large and complex banks. The New York Fed was criticized for failing to spot the risks in the banking system before the financial crisis.
Since then, though, the New York Fed's president, William C. Dudley, has tried to overhaul the regulator's supervisory division and he has called on bankers to clean up the ethical culture of their firms. Mr. Dudley will give opening remarks and senior regulators from the United States and Europe will contribute to panel discussions. Up for discussion are subjects like the costs of regulation and the effectiveness of supervision.--Peter Eavis
Ex-employees of Deutsche Bank and Barclays expected in court.
Six former employees of Barclays and Deutsche Bank are expected back in court in London on Friday ahead of their trial next year on criminal charges that they conspired to manipulate the euro interbank offered rate, a benchmark interest rate known as Euribor. --Chad Bray

Oil-producing countries, especially ones like Russia, with relatively undiversified economies, base their budgets on oil prices not falling below a certain threshold.

Full text:   FOR the past half-century, the world economy has been held hostage by just one country: the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Vast petroleum reserves and untapped production allowed the kingdom to play an outsize role as swing producer, filling or draining the global system at will.
The 1973-74 oil embargo was the first demonstration that the House of Saud was willing to weaponize the oil markets. In October 1973, a coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia abruptly halted oil shipments in retaliation for America's support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The price of a barrel of oil quickly quadrupled; the resulting shock to the oil-dependent economies of the West led to a sharp rise in the cost of living, mass unemployment and growing social discontent.
"If I was the president," Secretary of State Henry Kissinger fumed to his deputy Brent Scowcroft, "I would tell the Arabs to shove their oil." But the president, Richard M. Nixon, was in no position to dictate to the Saudis.
In the West, we have largely forgotten the lessons of 1974, partly because our economies have changed and are less vulnerable, but mainly because we are not the Saudis' principal target. Predictions that global oil production would eventually peak, ensuring prices stayed permanently high, never materialized. Today's oil crises are determined less by the floating price of crude than by crude regional politics. The oil wars of the 21st century are underway.
In recent years, the Saudis have made clear that they regard the oil markets as a critical front line in the Sunni Muslim-majority kingdom's battle against its Shiite-dominated rival, Iran. Their favored tactic of "flooding," pumping surplus crude into a soft market, is tantamount to war by economic means: the oil trade's equivalent of dropping the bomb on a rival.
In 2006, Nawaf Obaid, a Saudi security adviser, warned that Riyadh was prepared to force prices down to "strangle" Iran's economy. Two years later, the Saudis did just that, with the aim of hampering Tehran's ability to support Shiite militia groups in Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere.
Then, in 2011, Prince Turki al-Faisal, the former chief of Saudi intelligence, told NATO officials that Riyadh was prepared to flood the market to stir unrest inside Iran. Three years later, the Saudis struck again, turning on the spigot.
But this time, they overplayed their hand.
When Saudi officials made their move in the fall of 2014, taking advantage of an already glutted market, they no doubt hoped that lower prices would undercut the American shale industry, which was challenging the kingdom's market dominance. But their main purpose was to make life difficult for Tehran: "Iran will come under unprecedented economic and financial pressure as it tries to sustain an economy already battered by international sanctions," argued Mr. Obaid.
Oil-producing countries, especially ones like Russia, with relatively undiversified economies, base their budgets on oil prices not falling below a certain threshold. If prices plunge below that level, fiscal meltdown looms. The Saudis expected a sharp reduction in oil prices not just to hurt the American fracking industry, but also to hammer the economies of Iran and Russia. That in turn would weaken their ability to support allies and proxies, particularly in Iraq and Syria.
The tactic had been brutally effective in the past. This was the grim scenario that confronted the shah in 1977 when the Saudis flooded the oil market to rein in Iran's influence. The 1977 flood was not the sole cause of the Iranian revolution, but it certainly was a factor: The shah's rule was destabilized just as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini mounted his offensive to replace a pro-Western monarchy with a theocratic state. In that sense, the oil markets fueled the rise of political Islam.
The price of oil also helped end the Cold War. Then, like Russia today, the Communist superpower was a global energy producer heavily reliant on revenues from oil and gas. In 1985-86, the Saudis' decision to flood the market -- which some believe was encouraged by the Reagan administration -- led to a collapse in prices that sent the Soviet economy into a tailspin.
"The timeline of the collapse of the Soviet Union can be traced to Sept. 13, 1985," wrote the Russian economist Yegor Gaidar. "On this date Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the minister of oil of Saudi Arabia, declared that the monarchy had decided to alter its oil policy radically."
Today, in Russia, fully half of government revenue comes from oil and gas. Even if oil returns to $40 a barrel -- it twice fell below $30 earlier this year -- that depressed price still creates "a dangerous scenario," according to Mikhail Dmitriev, a former Russian deputy economic minister. Inflation in Russia hit double digits last year; its sovereign wealth fund, which bails out struggling Russian companies, is depleted; and factory closings are fueling labor unrest.
Unhappily for President Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's fiscal crisis has coincided with his military interventions in eastern Ukraine and Syria. If Russia's economy worsens and Mr. Putin feels cornered, he may look for ways to distract the Russian people with more rally-round-the-flag provocations, as well as induce panic in the oil markets about supplies and gin prices back up.
Future shock has already arrived for oil producers like Venezuela, whose economy has been gutted by lost revenues from oil, which makes up 95 percent of its export earnings. With inflation predicted by the International Monetary Fund to reach 720 percent this year, Venezuela has become a financial zombie state -- a harsh reminder of what can happen to countries that rely so heavily on a single unstable commodity price. President Nicolás Maduro is at the mercy of the markets that, every day, nudge his tottering regime nearer the abyss.
Another oil producer, Nigeria, is running out of money, hobbling President Muhammadu Buhari's campaign against the Islamist Boko Haram insurgents in the northeast. The plunge in oil prices has also shaken Central Asia, where Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have expressed interest in emergency bailouts from the I.M.F. and other lenders.
In the Middle East, reduced oil revenues have restricted Iraq's ability to wage war against the Islamic State. Persian Gulf oil producers like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates estimate collective losses of $360 billion in export earnings in the past year. Such a big budgetary hole poses problems with maintaining order at home while fighting wars in Syria and Yemen, and propping up cash-strapped allies like Egypt.
And then there is Saudi Arabia itself.
All the evidence suggests that Saudi officials never expected oil prices to fall below $60 a barrel. But then they never expected to lose their sway as the swing producer within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Despite wishful statements from Saudi ministers, the kingdom's efforts last month to make a deal with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar to restrict supply and push up prices collapsed.
The I.M.F. has warned that if government spending is not reined in, the Saudis will be bankrupt by 2020. Suddenly, the world's reserve bank of black gold is looking to borrow billions of dollars from foreign lenders. King Salman's response has been to promise austerity, higher taxes and subsidy cuts to a people who have grown used to state largess and handouts. That raises questions about the kingdom's internal cohesion -- even as the king decided to shoulder the burden of regional security in the Middle East, fighting wars on two fronts. Has there ever been an oil state as overleveraged at home and overextended abroad?
Meanwhile, by concluding the historic nuclear agreement, Iran is getting out from under the burden of economic sanctions. It will not be lost on Riyadh that this adds another oil producer to the world market that it can no longer control.
The instability and economic misery for smaller oil-producing states like Nigeria and Azerbaijan look set to continue. But that's collateral damage. The real story is how the Saudis have been hurt by their own weapon.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Faced with a eurozone economy stubbornly resistant to revival, the European Central Bank on Thursday went where no central bank -- at least no major one -- had gone before.
It said it would effectively pay commercial banks money to borrow central bank funds.
The offer, one of a half-dozen measures the central bank announced on Thursday, means banks that participate would pay back less at the end of the four-year loan than they borrowed. It's the same as if your bank offered you a no-interest loan, plus a free toaster as a bonus.
Banks will qualify for the money only if they lend it on to consumers and businesses. And there are other conditions. The money cannot be used for mortgages, for example.
The step represented a significant escalation of the E.C.B.'s efforts to get banks to lend more money, apply a jolt to the eurozone economy and head off the threat of a destructive decline in prices known as deflation.
The barrage of other measures included an increase in the purchases of government bonds and other assets. The purchases will rise to 80 billion euros, or about $88 billion, a month, up from the current level of [euro]60 billion. In another unprecedented step for the eurozone, the central bank will begin buying corporate bonds as part of the monthly asset purchases.
The spending is meant to pump more money into the laggardly eurozone economy.
The central bank also cut its benchmark interest rate, the main refinancing rate, to zero, from 0.05 percent.
And it lowered its deposit rate -- the interest commercial banks receive for their holdings at the E.C.B. -- to minus 0.4 percent, from minus 0.3 percent. By charging banks more to keep deposits at the central bank and less to borrow from it, Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, and his colleagues hope to make it less attractive for commercial banks to hoard cash.
Whether the broad and even radical set of measures will have an effect, only time can tell. But their sheer scope underscores the challenges that Mr. Draghi is up against in trying to formulate monetary policy with so many forces working against sustained economic growth in Europe.
Those negative forces include a drop in demand for eurozone exports from emerging countries like China, unstable financial markets, and a decline in confidence among consumers and business managers.
Together, those drags on the economy of the 19-country eurozone are a reason the bloc's unemployment rate is more than double that of the United States, and why eurozone growth has lagged the American rebound in recent years.
Mr. Draghi on Thursday noted widespread criticism that central banks had become powerless in the face of economic trends. "The best answer to this is being given by our decisions today," Mr. Draghi said. "We have shown that we are not short of ammunition."
But the unexpected sweep of Thursday's announced steps was also seen as a sign that the E.C.B. was more worried than analysts thought about the risk of deflation.
"This has all the hallmarks of the E.C.B. having thrown the kitchen sink at the problem," Patrick O'Donnell, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said in a statement.
Experts said that paying banks to lend has never been tried by one of the world's major central banks. In theory, Sweden has such a rate, but banks there have not taken advantage of it because they already have more funds than anyone wants to borrow.
The whiff of desperation in Thursday's moves helped explain why stocks gave up initial gains after Mr. Draghi's remarks. And the euro rose against the dollar -- a potential drag on eurozone exports -- after he said that rates would not be cut further.
In normal times, commercial banks earn interest on money parked at the central bank, and pay money to borrow. That convention will now be reversed, at least in some cases.
The new approach, being paid to lend, will apply to a special program that allows banks to borrow money for four years, provided they lend the money on to consumers and businesses.
Initially banks will pay zero percent interest, the new main benchmark rate. But if the commercial banks meet certain criteria, they will get a bonus of 0.4 percent annually on the value of the loan after two years, applied retroactively.
Theoretically, banks would be able to refinance up to 30 percent of their loan books under this new arrangement.
One of the eurozone's enduring problems is a dangerously low inflation rate. Despite the bank's stimulus measures to date, inflation in the 19 countries of the eurozone has been stuck near or below zero for more than a year.
The inflation rate, which had been slightly positive, was minus 0.2 percent in February, according to official figures.
Falling prices are a symptom of slow growth. They also hurt borrowers, whose loan payments become more onerous if there is no inflation. Moreover, a broad, sustained decline in prices can become self-fulfilling and difficult to reverse, which is why economists fear it so much.
As recently as December, the central bank had forecast an inflation rate of 1 percent for 2016. On Thursday, Mr. Draghi said the forecast was now for 0.1 percent for this year.
The bank's forecast calls for inflation to revive, rising to 1.3 percent next year and 1.6 percent for 2018. That would still be less than the official target of below, but close to, 2 percent.
The central bank last hit the target in 2013.
There has been considerable debate among economists about whether the central bank measures have done any good. There are also risks. For example, negative interest rates on central bank deposits could hurt bank profits even as many lenders are struggling with bad loans or other troubled assets.
The new, extraordinarily favorable terms announced Thursday on money borrowed from the central bank may help to counteract the drag on lenders' profits, though Mr. Draghi said that was not the goal.
It was almost exactly a year ago that the E.C.B. set eurozone precedent by buying government bonds and other assets. The program, similar to one begun in the United States much earlier, has not been enough to bring eurozone growth back to where it was before the global financial crisis of 2008.
The money-printing program, known as quantitative easing, has helped keep the euro relatively weak against the dollar, despite Thursday's upward blip in the currency. Over time, the slow slide is good for European exporters. And Mr. Draghi has argued that it has made it easier for banks to lend.
On Thursday, he defended the central bank's stimulus efforts so far, saying that without them the eurozone would have already incurred "disastrous deflation."
But he also called on eurozone governments, as he has often done, to do their part to stimulate the economy by taking measures to raise productivity and by making changes to improve the business environment. Those steps, he said, should include more spending on infrastructure.
Mr. Draghi also appeared to take pleasure Thursday in defying critics who said the E.C.B.'s Governing Council suffered from internal disagreements that prevented it from aggressively stimulating the economy.
As far as the measures announced Thursday were concerned, he said, "The majority in favor has been overwhelming."

Full text:   The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits has reached its lowest level since October, suggesting sustained strength in the labor market.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week that ended March 5.
"The labor market continues to be the light shining through the foggy state of the global economy," said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Federal Reserve said rising stock prices and home values had pushed the net worth of United States households higher in the fourth quarter, a sign that families, particularly wealthy ones, were on solid footing before a sell-off in stocks roiled global markets this year.
The increase added $1.64 trillion to the total wealth of American families, putting it at $86.8 trillion, the report showed.
Growth in United States consumer spending accelerated last year as the jobless rate fell and wage increases picked up, but the outlook has been clouded this year by worries over the health of the global economy.
Thursday's data on net worth suggests the solidifying financial footing would help people weather falling prices for their financial assets.
Jobless claims are being watched for signs of labor market weakness after the recent sell-off in stocks. But so far, the labor market seems to be healthy. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 242,000 jobs in February, and the unemployment rate held at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.
Recession fears have also been soothed by strong consumer spending at the start of the year, as well as signs of some stabilization in the troubled manufacturing sector. A tightening labor market and firming inflation could encourage the Federal Reserve to continue gradually raising interest rates this year.
"A data-dependent Fed should be focused on these developments," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. The Fed is, however, not expected to raise borrowing costs at its meeting next week.
Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a figure associated with healthy labor market conditions, for a year -- the longest run since the early 1970s. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,500, to 267,500 last week, the lowest since late October.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 32,000, to 2.23 million in the week that ended Feb. 27. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,500, to 2.25 million.

Abstract: The stock market has been climbing for three weeks as reports on hiring, retail spending and manufacturing suggest the U.S. economy is strengthening. Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of Oppenheimer Funds, said he was optimistic that the bull market would extend its run because modest economic growth means little inflation and no need for the Federal Reserve to move too quickly to reverse its stimulus policies.

Full text:   Stocks rose Wednesday on the seventh anniversary of the bull market as crude oil resumed its climb from a 13-year low.
The gains were modest as investors await key policy decisions from Europe's central bank on Thursday and from the Federal Reserve next week.
Energy companies rebounded from big drops the day before, gaining 1.5 percent.
The stock market has been climbing for three weeks as reports on hiring, retail spending and manufacturing suggest the U.S. economy is strengthening. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index is up 9 percent from its mid-February low.
"People are becoming more optimistic and markets are recovering," said Seth Masters, chief investment officer at AB Bernstein. The hope is that "monetary authorities are committed to doing what it takes and not derail it."
The Nasdaq composite increased 25.55 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,674.38. The S.&P. 500 climbed 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,989.26.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 36.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,000.36.
The gains were broad, with nine of 10 industry sectors of the S.&P. 500 rising. The jump in crude sent several energy companies soaring. Chesapeake Energy climbed 8 percent, Devon Energy rose 7 percent and Newfield Exploration rose 6 percent.
The S.&P. 500 has tripled since bottoming out at 676.53 seven years ago during the financial crisis. The bull market is the third-longest of the 11 since World War II, according to research firm S&P Capital IQ.
Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of Oppenheimer Funds, said he was optimistic that the bull market would extend its run because modest economic growth means little inflation and no need for the Federal Reserve to move too quickly to reverse its stimulus policies.
"We believe this will be one of the longest economic expansions, and thus one the longest bull markets, we have experienced," he said. "Easy money still rules."
The Federal Reserve meets next week, but most investors do not think it will raise short-term interest rates it controls from near zero. It raised them for the first time in nine years in December.
At the end of its policy meeting on Thursday, the European Central Bank is widely expected to announce more efforts to stimulate the 19-country eurozone. Possible moves include another cut in the deposit rate for funds from commercial banks to even further below zero. The hope is that will get banks to stop holding onto their money and lend more.
The European Central Bank also could increase its bond-buying program to pump more money into the region's economy.
Among U.S. stocks making big moves Wednesday, Air Transport Services jumped $1.96, or 17 percent, to $13.73 after turning in solid results and saying it will operate an air transport network for Amazon. Pet-food company Blue Buffalo Pet Products rose $4.19, or 23 percent, $22.75 after posting strong earnings.
Chipotle Mexican Grill fell $18.06, or 3 percent, to $506.63. The restaurant chain closed a Massachusetts store after a local health board said an employee there tested positive for norovirus. The agency also found two other suspected cases.
The closure follows a series of food scares that sickened customers at its restaurants around the country. Chipotle stock is down 23 percent in the past 12 months.
In Europe, Germany's DAX and Britain's FTSE 100 were each up 0.3 percent. The CAC-40 in France rose 0.5 percent. The three indexes each fell nearly 1 percent the day before.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.8 percent while South Korea's Kospi rose 0.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent.
Prices for industrial and precious metals ended mostly lower. Gold slipped $5.50 to $1,257.40 an ounce, silver fell two cents to $15.37 an ounce and copper gained one cent to $2.23 a pound.
In energy trading, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose $1.79, or 5 percent, to $38.29. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gained $1.42, or 3.6 percent, to $41.07 a barrel.
Wholesale gasoline rose 8.3 cents to $1.471 a gallon, heating oil rose 3.3 cents to $1.233 a gallon and natural gas rose four cents to $1.752 per 1,000 cubic feet.
U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.88 percent from 1.83 percent.
The euro was flat at $1.1002. The dollar edged up to 113.36 yen from 112.61 yen.

Full text:   When Bill de Blasio was running for mayor on a starkly liberal platform in 2013, some of New York's business leaders feared the city's economic well-being was doomed.
"There was definitely something in the ether," said Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor whom Mr. de Blasio recruited from Wall Street. "'The lefties are taking over.' 'This is not a pro-business mayor.' 'They're going to ruin the economy.' I heard a lot of that myself."
It did not help that Mr. de Blasio was hoping to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire and a darling of business elites.
But as Mr. de Blasio settles into the second half of his four-year term, the opposite has happened. Even amid national and global concerns about teetering economies, New York City has rarely been in better financial shape. Indeed, the city added more jobs in Mr. de Blasio's first two years in office -- 248,000 -- than in any two-year period in the last half-century, according to data released last week by the State Labor Department.
Along with the steady increases in employment, the wages of workers in the city have risen at a fast pace over the last two years, helping them cope with the dizzying cost of living. Residential and office construction are booming. Tourism is at a high.
Of course, a roaring real estate market has left many New Yorkers struggling to pay for housing and has fed a homelessness problem that has bedeviled Mr. de Blasio.
Still, by virtually any measure, the city continues to do better than the rest of the country in rebounding from the financial crisis, economists said.
"For the first time in this recovery, workers generally are enjoying the benefits of the recovery full-on," Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said. "In the rest of the country we're not quite there yet."
Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, inherited a city that had already begun recovering impressively under Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent whose businesslike approach to running New York was heralded as helping to rescue it from the depths of the recession.
As a result, Mr. de Blasio's "tale of two cities" speeches on the campaign trail and talk of raising taxes to finance social programs frightened corporate leaders, said Kathryn S. Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, an influential group that includes most of the city's biggest employers.
"Contrary to fears in the business community when the mayor first took office, the city economy has continued to do very well," Ms. Wylde said.
Mr. de Blasio still scares corporate executives with some of his liberal ideas, Ms. Wylde added, like raising the minimum wage. "But that is a matter again of occasional differences on political rhetoric and, frankly, there's much less of that than many of them feared," she said.
Before Mr. Bloomberg's three terms in office, from 2002 through 2013, business leaders did not typically expect mayors to become deeply involved in economic matters beyond tending to the city's budget, Ms. Wylde said.
"What we expect from mayors is they encourage private-sector economic activity and they don't screw it up," she said. Appraising Mr. de Blasio's performance so far, she said, "It's obvious he has not screwed it up."
In fact, the city has a record number of jobs (4.2 million) and a record number of employed residents (four million), and attracted a record number of tourists last year (58.3 million). The share of the city's population that is employed is at its highest level -- 58 percent -- in at least four decades.
In the early years of the recovery, the bulk of the hiring was in lower-paying fields like retail and health care. But it has broadened to all sectors, including Wall Street, construction and even manufacturing.
Wages, too, have begun to surge, and not just for white-collar workers at the upper end of the pay spectrum, said James Parrott, chief economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed research group. Mr. Parrott said that average wages for workers at all levels of pay had risen faster than inflation in the last two years, after being flat for the previous three years.
"This last five or six years has been the most sustained period of job growth in the city," he said. "You'd have to go back to the '50s or early '60s to see anything like that."
Anthony C. Roman Jr. is one of the newest beneficiaries of the city's growing prosperity. After months of searching for a job, he started on Friday in the marketing department of Bareburger, a fast-growing restaurant chain founded in Astoria, Queens.
Armed with a degree in food studies from the New School, Mr. Roman, 25, said he had still found it difficult to land a job because of "an oversupply of highly educated people" seeking work in his industry.
"There's a lot of energy" in the city's economy, but he said he would call it "not necessarily a boom, but a bloom."
Though Mr. Roman and his fiancée, who works in finance, now have jobs that pay well, he said they each planned to continue living with their parents until their wedding.
"When you look at the financial commitment of renting," he said, "it's just a huge drain on any kind of hope or future that you have in the short term."
Soaring commercial rents in the city have posed a problem for Bareburger, said Euripides Pelekanos, one of the company's founders. Bareburger is opening restaurants as far away as Tokyo and Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, but Mr. Pelekanos said he gave up looking for a location in Harlem because landlords were asking too much.
Mr. Pelekanos said he had no trouble finding students and actresses to hire as servers, but the intense competition among restaurants was making it hard to staff the kitchens. Another burger chain, he said, tried to poach Bareburger's hostesses and cooks.
As for his sentiments about City Hall, Mr. Pelekanos said he opposed Mr. de Blasio's push for a minimum wage as high as $15 an hour.
"I don't think he fully understood the impact on local businesses, on small businesses," Mr. Pelekanos said, adding that such an increase would force restaurants to raise prices and reduce staffing.
Mr. de Blasio has forged ahead, embracing the "Fight for $15" movement and promising that all city government employees would earn at least $15 an hour by the end of 2018 (the current statewide minimum is $9).
Helping to raise the wages of the city's lowest-paid residents is a priority for his administration, said Ms. Glen, who was an executive at Goldman Sachs before leaving for City Hall.
Mr. de Blasio tamped down some fears about his liberal bent last year when he overhauled the city's corporate tax system and reduced tax rates for small businesses, Ms. Wylde said.
The mayor may not have won over all of the doubters yet, Ms. Wylde said, but he had scored points with them by being "very fiscally responsible," referring to the mayor's budgeting process and the contracts his administration had reached with unions.
Mr. de Blasio has also sought to diversify the economy and encourage job creation beyond Manhattan. Since Mr. de Blasio took office, employment has risen faster in the other boroughs as the city's unemployment rate has steadily declined, to 5.3 percent in January, from 8 percent in January 2014.
The robust economy has helped people like Mulu Amlesom, a 36-year-old Bronx resident who bounced through a series of office jobs before returning to college to pursue a nursing degree. But after completing her studies, she said, she spent several months trying to find work at a hospital.
She was ready to leave New York before she enrolled in a training program financed by the city's Small Business Services Department and a health care industry partnership. When Ms. Amlesom completed the training in late 2014, she was hired into a full-time position at Mount Sinai Beth Israel in Manhattan that pays more than $70,000 a year.
Referring to the condominium she and her husband own in the High Bridge neighborhood, Ms. Amlesom said, "Now we can actually pay the mortgage."

Abstract: Investors are anxious about a policy meeting of the European Central Bank on Thursday as inflation across the 19-country eurozone has fallen back below zero. The Bank for International Settlements, which helps coordinate monetary policy around the world, warned on Monday of a "gathering storm" as central banks run out of room to stimulate their economies.

Full text:   Stocks wavered throughout the day on Monday but managed to eke out modest gains as oil prices rose.
Investors bought drillers, refiners and other energy companies as the three-week rise in crude continued. Six of 10 industry sectors in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased, helping the index extend its winning streak to a fifth day.
The ride up was bumpy, though, and the gains were slight. The S.&P. 500 increased just 0.09 percent -- its smallest uptick in seven weeks.
"Today's volatility is mostly about a little profit-taking and taking a pause after such a strong advance in recent days," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital.
The S.&P. 500 edged up 1.77 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,001.76. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, gave up 8.77 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,708.25. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 67.18 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,073.95.
Shares of consumer products and technology companies fell. The chip maker Micron Technology fell 30 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $11.58.
With no big American economic or earnings announcements, news from abroad appeared to drive much of the trading.
The price of iron ore jumped 17 percent on news over the weekend that China planned to run up its deficit to stimulate its economy. China is the world's largest buyer of this raw material for steel, and mining companies soared on the news. Cliffs Natural Resources rose 54 cents to $3.43, a gain of 19 percent.
Investors are anxious about a policy meeting of the European Central Bank on Thursday as inflation across the 19-country eurozone has fallen back below zero. Most investors expect further stimulus from the central bank, possibly including a cut in deposit rates further into negative territory.
The Bank for International Settlements, which helps coordinate monetary policy around the world, warned on Monday of a "gathering storm" as central banks run out of room to stimulate their economies.
European markets were mostly lower. The CAC-40 of France and the FTSE 100 of Britain each lost 0.3 percent. The DAX of Germany dropped 0.5 percent. In Asia, the Nikkei of Tokyo retreated 0.6 percent, and the Hang Seng of Hong Kong shed 0.1 percent. The Kospi of Seoul advanced 0.1 percent.
Benchmark United States crude added $1.98, or 5.5 percent, to settle at $37.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, rose $2.12, or 5.5 percent, to settle at $40.84 a barrel in London.
The 10 biggest gainers in the S.&P. 500 were drillers and other energy-related companies. Murphy Oil rose $2.99, or nearly 13 percent, to $26.69.
Wholesale gasoline rose 6.1 cents, to $1.39 a gallon; heating oil rose 6.1 cents, to $1.22 a gallon; and natural gas rose 2.4 cents, to $1.69 per 1,000 cubic feet.
United States government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.9 percent from 1.88 percent on Friday. The euro rose to $1.1011 from $1.10, and the dollar fell to 113.36 yen from 113.94 yen.
Precious and industrial metals futures ended mixed. Gold fell $6.70 to settle at $1,263.20 an ounce. Silver slipped 6 cents, to $15.63 an ounce; and copper rose a penny, to $2.28 a pound.

Full text:   Here's a proposition for you: Hand over your money. I'll skim some off the top, hold it for a while and return whatever is left in a year or two.
Until a few years ago, that's the kind of offer a gangster might have made. In the world as we've known it, if you lend someone your cash you expect to receive something -- typically, interest -- in return.
But something radically different is afoot today. It's called negative interest -- and it is an inversion of the traditional relationship between lenders and borrowers.
"It's all upside down," said Kathy A. Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. "Negative interest is hard to even think about. Our whole financial system is built the other way, on positive interest rates. This is mind-boggling."
Negative rates have been spreading through important sectors of high finance in Europe and Asia. They are not being offered in a systematic way to retail investors, as far as I know, but Bloomberg found last month that more than $1.1 trillion worth of German bonds and about $4.5 trillion in Japanese government debt carried negative interest, and more than $7 trillion in bonds over all had negative yields. Central banks, which have helped engineer the arrival of negative interest rates, are buying some of these bonds themselves, but private investors are doing so, too, accepting probable losses.
The central banks have been going negative to stimulate their relatively weak regional economies and raise inflation levels, which have been perilously low. They hope negative rates will accomplish these goals in three ways. First, the central banks want commercial banks to lend more money at very low interest rates. Second, they want commercial bank customers to borrow more, spend more and save less.
There is a third reason, which central bankers rarely enunciate in public: Negative interest rates tend to drive down the value of a country's currency, making its exports cheaper and more competitive in global markets.
That may be very good for a single country but when several of them do it and a currency war erupts, there is a real danger of uncontrolled economic shock and concomitant pain around the world. Preventing such a war was on the agenda of the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers meeting in Shanghai last week, but no significant agreement was reached. The dollar is likely to continue to strengthen, and the possibility of future conflict over interest and currency exchange rates is a risk for people who aren't directly exposed to negative rates.
In the United States, Federal Reserve officials say they might use negative interest rates in a future crisis, but they don't expect to install them here anytime soon. Nonetheless, global markets are tightly linked, and negative rates in Europe and Asia are already influencing financial markets here, in that way affecting the lives of ordinary people.
The effects have been mixed: Negative rates on foreign debt have helped keep a wide range of interest rates in the United States unusually low, which translates into good deals for borrowers and bad for ones for lenders, including major banks, whose profit margins have been compressed. For older people trying to live on their bond investments, low rates result in paltry income and painful choices.
The unusual conditions defined by negative interest rates also complicate matters for the Federal Reserve, which has begun to raise short-term rates in the United States, only to see longer-term rates decline. That unexpected development is occurring partly because below-zero rates in European and Japanese bond markets have created greater demand for American bonds, raising their prices and driving down yields, which move in an opposite direction. Negative rates have not been common for very long and their consequences aren't entirely understood.
Still, grasping the basics of how negative rates work and how they may be affecting the United States is important for anyone with money in the markets.
Consider that if you deposit your savings with a bank that has negative interest rates, the longer the bank holds your money, the less you will have in your account. The flip side of this is marvelous: The longer it takes to repay a negative-interest-rate mortgage, the less you owe, even if you pay nothing. In short, negative rates can make saving money seem foolish, while borrowing can become epically attractive. (The European banks generally have not deliberately passed negative rates on to retail customers, but negative-interest-rate mortgages cropped up temporarily in Denmark for some people lucky enough to have had adjustable rate mortgages.)
Negative rates appeared during the global financial crisis in 2008, when yields on some United States Treasury bills fell below zero for brief periods. That happened because so many panicky people wanted to buy Treasuries that their prices soared and their yields dropped into negative territory. In essence, investors were willing to lose a small amount of principal in exchange for the safety. Those negative interest rates were a sign that the financial world was in trouble.
Today's negative rates are not a short-term market anomaly. To the contrary, central banks in Europe and Asia have made negative interest rates part of their official tool kit. The European Central Bank; the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark; and, last month, the Japanese central bank have all deliberately set at least some short-term rates below zero -- effectively penalizing commercial banks for depositing funds with them, and giving them a strong incentive to move their money elsewhere.
Negative rates abroad have caused another problem for the United States, and, perhaps, created an opportunity.
They make it difficult to determine why interest rates in the United States are so low -- much lower than would be expected if the American economy were truly healed from the last recession. Those low rates are a bit of a puzzle given the Fed's stated intention of continuing to raise short-term rates.
But interest rates here make much more sense when compared with negative rates in European and Japanese bonds. Bond markets are global, and those negative rates abroad are among the factors depressing interest rates in the United States, Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer for Guggenheim Partners, said in a recent commentary. Further declines in German rates are likely to lead to declines in American rates as well, he said, even if the Fed intends to push rates higher.
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said in an interview that while these risks were real, barring an unforeseen shock, it was probable that the American economy would continue to strengthen. And if that happens, current American interest rates -- particularly those for inflation-indexed bonds called TIPS -- have been set low. TIPS may be a good investment now because their pricing assumes that the inflation rate will be only about 1.4 percent a year for the next five years -- and, if an economic recovery is in place, inflation is bound to move higher than that, giving investors a tidy profit.
A riskier bet could be made with investments in the domestic stock market, which would be likely to rebound significantly if it turned out that despite negative rates abroad, the economy was robust in the United States, he said. "We would see a rally in a range of risk assets," he said. "There would be some real money to be made." The possibility of significant losses was high, too, he said.
Conservative, risk-averse investors find themselves in a hard place. As long as interest rates remain negative for the bonds of major countries like Germany and Japan, it will be difficult for American bond yields to rise much. The safest investments, like 10-year Treasury notes, are providing extraordinarily low yields -- only about 1.9 percent. Junk bonds, with higher yields, are risky when the economy is under stress, Ms. Jones of Schwab says. "We're pointing our clients toward a middle ground -- investment-grade corporate bonds," she said. They provide a modicum of safety and somewhat better yields than government bonds do.
That's not a happy situation. But in some respects it is an upside-down world. Sometimes the best you can do is hold on to your money.

Abstract: "Working people in states like Michigan and Ohio feel the lousy manufacturing job loss and growing trade deficit with China, even if Wall Street and D.C. do not," Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement.

Full text:   With anxiety about the economy bubbling up on Wall Street and at campaign rallies around the country, the government reported on Friday that employers added 242,000 workers in February, a hefty increase that highlighted the labor market's steady gains.
"We've got a real strong job market going," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. "It does suggest that fears about a U.S. recession have been greatly overdone."
Four years ago, at this point in the last presidential election cycle, the jobless rate was 8.3 percent and the economic recovery was in a relatively early stage. Then, worries centered on rising gas prices, deep consumer debt and government layoffs.
Now, the recovery is in its seventh year, the unemployment rate has dropped sharply to 4.9 percent and the private sector has chalked up 72 months of uninterrupted job gains, the longest streak on record. Oil prices may still be causing ulcers, but this time it is primarily producers who are feeling the pain, because prices have plunged.
The shadow on the otherwise positive Labor Department report was that wages fell 0.1 percent in February, a disappointment after January's promising 0.5 percent increase. That put the yearly growth in wages at 2.2 percent, only modestly ahead of the inflation rate. The average length of the workweek declined by 0.2 hours last month.
Despite the setback on wages, Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at Standard & Poor's, was upbeat about the economy's prospects this year. "We're back in the saddle again," she said, noting that the heavy snowfall that hit the Northeast last month apparently did little to curtail hiring in retail sales and food services.
Given the slowdown in China and a herky-jerky stock market, Wall Street has been betting that the Federal Reserve will put off any interest rate increase at its next meeting later this month. William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, expressed caution this week, saying: "I have marked down my growth outlook very modestly."
Economists said the Fed was still likely to remain in a holding pattern, but the strong jobs report would at least give its policy makers plenty to talk about and increased the chances that it would decide to raise borrowing costs in April or June. As Mr. Tannenbaum put it: "This number will certainly spice up the Fed's discussion."
A broader measure that includes people too discouraged to search for work or who are making do with a part-time job because they cannot find a full-time one fell 0.2 of a percentage point, to 9.7 percent.
Perhaps the most encouraging sign in the monthly statistics was evidence that people who had long been sidelined were being lured back to the job market. The overall share of Americans in the labor force ticked up 0.2 of a percentage point to 62.9 percent.
"That has been the shadow hanging over all the other labor force statistics," Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic policy at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, said of the stubbornly low participation rate.
Despite the improved economic picture, there is still plenty of distress and anger, emotions that have helped spur the success of the Republican presidential front-runner, Donald J. Trump, and rallied many Democrats behind the underdog Bernie Sanders's attacks on inequality and Wall Street cronyism.
Part of the reason is the unevenness of the recovery. Fortunes have diverged depending on where people live, their education and skill levels and what industry they work in.
"We are seeing job growth across a range of industries, but we're also seeing a polarization in the labor market," said Tara Sinclair, chief economist for the job site Indeed.
There has been vigorous demand for hospitality and service workers, often at low wages. But the higher total job count masks losses in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing and energy, better-paying industries that tend to be dominated by blue-collar white men who have been particularly battered by shifts in the American economy.
The mining industry, for example, continues to bleed jobs, with a loss of 19,000 in February, while manufacturing lost 16,000.
"Working people in states like Michigan and Ohio feel the lousy manufacturing job loss and growing trade deficit with China, even if Wall Street and D.C. do not," Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement. "If you're wondering why there's so much interest in political insurgencies among both Democrats and Republicans this year, here's your answer."
And while employment has been advancing at a robust pace for more than two years, many workers continue to complain about low pay, or jobs beneath their skill levels.
"Why do we have this persistent gloom about the economy, when you have below-average unemployment rates?" asked Neera Tanden, president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. "It is really a product of anxiety about what we call the middle-class squeeze, the ability of your income and wages to keep up with the staples of a middle-class life."
"If you look at many Trump voters, they generally are people who have not been winning economically for a long time as the country is diversifying," Ms. Tanden said. Whites without a college education provide the core of support for Mr. Trump.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and now president of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy research organization, agreed that stalled incomes were a persistent source of dissatisfaction. "Getting wage growth up more rapidly is the key thing," he said.
Still, if steady job growth continues and wages pick up in response to a tighter labor market, it could change views about the economy and influence the political dynamic. In previous elections, the direction of the economy in the months leading up to the vote has been perhaps the single most important factor affecting whether Americans opt for continuity or change.
The brisk hiring since the Affordable Care Act went into effect also serves to undermine the Republican argument that the measure has stripped millions of jobs from the economy.
"Our businesses have created jobs every single month since I signed that 'job killing' Obamacare bill," for a total of 14.3 million private sector jobs, President Obama told reporters at the White House.
Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor, underscored the point. "There's an undeniable Eeyore caucus out there of fear-mongers and fact-deniers who want people to believe there is no job creation," he said.
Certainly, the law is spurring job creation in the health care industry, with 38,000 jobs added in February.
Edward Fleischman, chief executive of the Execu/Search Group, a professional recruiting firm based in New York, said he had seen outsize demand for health care professionals, including urgent care physicians, nurses, therapists and technicians. "A lot of that has to do with Obamacare," he said.
Mr. Fleischman, whose firm opened three new offices last year, added that hiring -- particularly for digitally adept workers -- had been strong across the board.
Friday's report is the first of three estimates of February's job creation by the Labor Department. Revisions for December and January showed a total of 30,000 more jobs than previously reported.
William Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., contrasted the palpable dissatisfaction of many voters with the record of unbroken job creation. "This is one of those times when the economic cycle has hit a weird political cycle," he said.

Full text:   Stocks wobbled to the finish Friday but managed a fourth consecutive day of gains after the U.S. government said employers added more jobs than expected in February.
Mining companies made the biggest gains as metals prices climbed.
The jobs report showed that construction, retail and health care companies are still hiring more workers. Energy companies also rose with the recovering price of oil. Stocks fell back from an afternoon peak as investors sold telecommunications companies, which have been the best-performing sector of the market this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 6.59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,999.99. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 9.60 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,717.02.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 62.87 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,006.77.
The Labor Department said employers added 242,000 jobs last month. Consumer demand was solid, and the government also said employers hired more people in December and January than it had previously estimated. More people also looked for work.
This week, stocks rose after reports on hiring, construction spending and manufacturing suggested that the U.S. economy was doing fairly well. Kate Warne, investment strategist for Edward Jones, said she expected continued growth.
"The worries that we've been hearing recently about the economy sliding into recession aren't warranted," she said. Combined with low inflation rates, she said that's good news for investors.
Metals and energy prices kept climbing on the continued signs of life for the economy. Gold, which is trading at its highest price in a year, rose $12.50, or 1 percent, to $1,270.70 an ounce. Silver jumped 55 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $15.69 an ounce and copper rose 7 cents, or 3 percent, to $2.27 a pound.
The price of U.S. oil jumped $1.35, or 3.9 percent, to $35.92 a barrel. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oils, rose $1.65, or 4.5 percent, to $38.72 a barrel in London.
Oil prices climbed about 10 percent this week and have risen for three weeks in a row, which hadn't happened since May. Brent crude is now higher than it was at the beginning of the year, although U.S. crude is still lower.
Those gains helped copper mining company Freeport-McMoRan gained 63 cents, or 6.9 percent, to $9.74. Aluminum producer Alcoa edged up 10 cents to $9.57.
Energy stocks also kept rising. Drilling rig operators did the best as investors were pleased they keep closing rigs to cut costs. Transocean climbed $1.88, or 17.4 percent, to $12.71. Ensco rose $1.43, or 13.1 percent, to $12.36.
The market has now erased most of its losses after a painful start to the year. But investors keep buying utility and telecom stocks, which are considered safe bets when the market is troubled. And the price of gold has surged to its highest levels in more than a year.
While stocks have risen the last three days, the gains were small and came in choppy trading.
Ms. Warne said investors still feel uneasy about problems ranging from shaky economies outside the U.S., low oil prices, and uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and what effect that will have on the economy.
"I think we're going to continue to see a lot of market volatility," she said.
AMC Theaters, owned by the Wanda Group of China, is buying Carmike Cinemas in a deal worth $1.1 billion, including debt, that will create the biggest movie theater chain in the world. Carmike climbed $4.14, or 16.4 percent, to $29.25.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.87 percent from 1.84 percent late Thursday.
Michael Fredericks, portfolio manager for BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund, noted that bond yields had recovered along with stocks over the last few weeks. "There was just a huge amount of pessimism" about economic growth, he said.
A handful of companies rose and fell as quarterly earnings kept trickling out. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, an information technology products and service company, reported better-than-expected results from its first quarter as a publicly-traded company. Its stock surged $1.84, or 13.5 percent, to $15.44.
Handgun maker Smith & Wesson rose $1.65, or 6.5 percent, to $27.05 after its profit and sales surpassed Wall Street estimates. Smith & Wesson also raised its profit and sales projections for its current fiscal year.
Tax preparer H&R Block tumbled after its quarterly profit and revenue disappointed investors. The company said people are filing their taxes later and refunds are taking longer to process as efforts to fight tax fraud increase. The stock dropped $5.14, or 15.6 percent, to $27.76.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The immediate headlines out of the latest jobs numbers -- that growth was solid and the unemployment rate unchanged in February -- would seem to be not terribly exciting. But there's some great news beneath the surface: Americans are returning to the work force in the largest numbers in many years.
The American work force, according to the Labor Department's survey of households, rose by a whopping 555,000 people in February. Over the last three months, that number totals 1.52 million, the highest it has been in 16 years. In other words, this winter a lot more people have been either working or actively looking for work.
That's good. The proportion of Americans in the labor force plummeted during the 2008 recession and its aftermath. That was partly because of demographic forces, like baby boomers retiring.
It was also caused by millions of Americans who saw little opportunity and became disengaged from the workplace, their incomes suffering, their skills atrophying and the nation's economic potential diminishing in the process.
But there is evidence that in the last few months that trend has started to reverse. The proportion of the adult population in the labor force and the proportion of the population with a job are both up half a percentage point since September. For the first time in years it's fair to say that these changes are decisively pointed in the right direction.
Just last summer, as the United States expansion entered its seventh year with booming job growth, there was reason to doubt that an improving job market would ever start to pull people in who had become detached from the labor force. After all, if seven years of job growth wasn't enough to make more people enter the work force, what would be?
We still don't know for sure how much more room there is to grow. Presumably most people who dropped out of the labor force around retirement age are out of the work force for good, no matter how many job opportunities present themselves. But the data in 2016 will help us find out how much room for expansion there really is in labor force participation.
There is some interplay between the growth in the number of workers and the most disappointing signal in the February jobs numbers, which was a step down in average hourly earnings. Over the last year, this number has risen 2.2 percent, which amounts to a modest rise in pay for American workers thanks to very low inflation. But it hardly suggests the kind of booming economy indicated by the low unemployment rate.
What seems to be happening is the pool of "shadow workers," who have been employable but were not looking for work, has kept a lid on wage increases. We've been able to keep up strong job growth without strong wage gains because there are still a lot of people who are not working and not formally looking for a job, but who are available to take one when the opportunity arises.
As 2016 unfolds, which of these forces will prove more powerful? If the labor force keeps growing at the gangbusters pace of the last three months, all those new entrants will keep the downward pressure on wages. On the other hand, it might take higher wages to keep pulling people out of their homes and into the workplace.
But here's the wild card. All this assumes the strong rate of job creation -- 242,000 positions added in February, plus positive revisions to previous months -- doesn't get undone by an era of Federal Reserve interest rate increases and volatile global markets.
For the first couple of months of the year, the big story in the job market has been rising participation. The question for the months ahead is how long that can persist absent stronger wage growth -- and whether the momentum driving job growth is strong enough to persist despite ever-present risks.
The evidence from the February numbers points in both directions for the Fed, as it decides how quickly to raise interest rates. The solid rate of job creation will give the central bank confidence that the recovery is proceeding reasonably robustly and that higher interest rates make sense.
On the other hand, the combination of the sharply rising size of the labor force and flat wage growth support the idea that there is plenty more slack in the job market and that inflation isn't an imminent risk. That suggests the Fed could wait longer before raising rates again to see whether potential workers are becoming so scarce that wages start rising sharply, creating pressure on inflation.
That's why the rising labor force isn't just good for the millions of people who have an income that they wouldn't otherwise, but also because their existence can allow the Fed to be more patient about waiting for wages to pick up.
For now, the thing to do is celebrate the 1.5 million Americans who are in the labor force who weren't in November -- and to look for evidence of how many more people like them are out there, ready to work, as they increasingly have the opportunity.

Full text:   BEIJING -- China's military budget will rise by 7 percent to 8 percent this year, less than the double-digit increases that have been the norm for years, a senior official said on Friday. But the official gave no sign that Beijing would soften its stance on disputes in the South China Sea, and she renewed China's warnings to the United States not to intervene there.
Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for China's legislature, the National People's Congress, declined to say exactly how much military spending would rise. But she said the increase -- to be revealed Saturday at the start of the annual legislative session, which will approve the budget and other government plans -- would be relatively modest.
"This year, China's military budget will continue rising, but more slowly compared to the previous few years," Ms. Fu said at a news conference in Beijing. "It will be between 7 and 8 percent."
Last year, the People's Liberation Army's official budget grew 10 percent to about $136 billion, and in 2014 it grew 12.2 percent. Between 2005 and 2014, China's official military budget grew an average of 9.5 percent annually, after adjusting for inflation, according to a Pentagon estimate.
An increase of 7 percent to 8 percent from the 2015 budget would suggest that China's military spending this year could reach about $147 billion. However, if actual spending in 2015 proved to be higher than the initial budget projection, then this year's increase would start from that higher base.
A single-digit increase for 2016 is in keeping with the government's standard formula for the annual military expenditure to be in line with gross domestic product plus inflation, said Dennis J. Blasko, a retired United States Army lieutenant colonel and the author of "The Chinese Army Today."
"This is consistent with the way the economy has been going, and that's the way the military budget has been determined for the last 20 years," Mr. Blasko said. "The whole point is not to overburden the economy with military expenditures."
He said Chinese leaders were also aware that throwing large amounts of money at the military, as the Soviet Union did, is not the way to modernize the military. "They look at the example of the Soviet Union, which flushed billions down the drain on the military, and that was the reason for its collapse," Mr. Blasko said.
Ms. Fu on Friday defended China's activities in the South China Sea, where it is in a dispute with the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighbors over rival claims to islands. Beijing has been turning reefs and outcrops in the sea into man-made islands with military outposts, but it says that its intentions are peaceful. Last month, China installed surface-to-air missiles on Woody Island, about 250 miles southeast of Hainan, a Chinese island province.
Ms. Fu accused the United States of provoking public ire in China by sending naval ships close to islands claimed by Beijing. "This is extremely irritating to Chinese people, who feel disgusted," she said.
"American actions and statements now leave people feeling that it's provoking tense emotions, and it makes people put a big question mark over American motives," Ms. Fu said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The economy was expanding in most of the country in January and February, helped by gains in consumer spending and home sales. But headwinds from falling oil prices and a strong dollar held back some sectors, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday.
The Fed's latest survey of business conditions in its 12 regions found moderate gains in most regions. Two areas -- New York and Dallas -- described activity as flat. The Kansas City region, hurt by weakness in energy and farming, reported a modest decline.
The Fed survey, known as the Beige Book, will be discussed at the central bank's next meeting on March 16 and 17. Most economists expect the Fed to leave a crucial interest rate unchanged.
The Fed found that while consumer inflation was holding steady, wage growth varied considerably, from flat to strong. The central bank is hoping that rising employment will increase pay, which has lagged since the current recovery began in mid-2009.
Buttressing that view of a resilient labor market was a separate report by the payroll processor ADP that said United States businesses added a healthy 214,000 jobs last month, up from a revised 193,000 in January.
"The labor market is healthy," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "This is very good news, particularly in the context of the turmoil in the financial markets in the past several months."
Fed officials believe that rising wages will help lift inflation closer to the Fed's target of around 2 percent a year. Inflation has been running below that for the last three years.
Manufacturing was feeling the effects of the stronger dollar, which hurts United States exports, and slowing activity in important United States markets like Europe and China. Manufacturers also complained about cutbacks in demand coming from weakness in the energy sector.
Manufacturing contacts in eight districts -- Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco -- all reported "significant headwinds" because of sluggish demand from energy companies. Many districts said manufacturers were also being hurt by the strong dollar and weaker global outlook.
According to ADP, manufacturers shed 9,000 jobs in February, the first time the sector had cut payrolls since October.
Most economists believe that the economy, which slowed to growth of just 1 percent in the October-December quarter, will rebound to growth of around 2 percent in the current January-March quarter.
The Fed approved its first rate increase in nearly a decade at its December meeting, choosing to wait and see how global market turbulence at the beginning of the year and weaker United States exports affect the overall economy. Many analysts believe that the Fed will increase rates only twice this year and will not move until June.
The Fed survey was based on data collected before Feb. 22.
The ADP report, which covers only private business and often diverges from official figures, comes out two days before the government's official jobs report.
Economists surveyed by the data firm FactSet predict that American employers -- including government -- added 195,000 jobs last month, up from 151,000 in January. They expect that the unemployment rate remained at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The federal Medicare program and private health insurers waste nearly $3 billion every year buying cancer medicines that are thrown out because many drug makers distribute the drugs only in vials that hold too much for most patients, a group of cancer researchers has found.
The expensive drugs are usually injected by nurses working in doctors' offices and hospitals who carefully measure the amount needed for a particular patient and then, because of safety concerns, discard the rest.
If drug makers distributed vials containing smaller quantities, nurses could pick the right volume for a patient and minimize waste. Instead, many drug makers exclusively sell one-size-fits-all vials, ensuring that many smaller patients pay thousands of dollars for medicine they are never given, according to researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who published a study on Tuesday in BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal.
Some of these medicines are distributed in smaller vial sizes in Europe, where governments play a more active role than the United States does in drug pricing and distribution.
"Drug companies are quietly making billions forcing little old ladies to buy enough medicine to treat football players, and regulators have completely missed it," said Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering and a co-author of the study. "If we're ever going to start saving money in health care, this is an obvious place to cut."
The researchers analyzed the waste generated by the top 20 selling cancer medicines and concluded that insurers paid drug makers $1.8 billion annually on discarded quantities and then spent about $1 billion on markups to doctors and hospitals.
Some non-cancer drugs also generate considerable waste, including Remicade, an arthritis drug sold by Johnson & Johnson for which an estimated $500 million of the drug's $4.3 billion in annual sales comes from quantities that are thrown away, researchers found. But such non-cancer drugs were not included in the study's estimates of total waste.
In one example, the study said that in the United States Takeda Pharmaceuticals sells Velcade, a drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma and lymphoma, only in 3.5-milligram vials that sell for $1,034 and hold enough medicine to treat a person who is 6 feet 6 inches tall and who weighs 250 pounds. If a patient is smaller, then a quantity of the precious powder is thrown away.
Lena Haddad, 53, of Germantown, Md., who has been living with multiple myeloma for four years, now gets a weekly dose of 1.8 milligrams of Velcade. On a recent day at Ms. Haddad's doctor's office in Bethesda, Md., a nurse, Patricia Traylor, took a vial of Velcade from a large drug cabinet. She injected a syringeful of saline into the vial and shook it, pushed a needle into the vial and withdrew about half the contents. Then she threw out the vial with the remaining medicine.
"You can't use the remainder for the patient the next time she comes in or use it on another patient, so it has to be discarded as waste," Ms. Traylor said.
Safety standards permit nurses to use drug leftovers in other patients only if used within six hours and only in specialized pharmacies.
Told that she was using only about half of the drug that was purchased, Ms. Haddad said she was shocked.
"No wonder my premiums keep going up," she said.
Medicare and many private insurers charge patients drug co-payments of as much as 20 percent, which can add up to tens of thousands of dollars annually for the latest drugs; much is spent on cancer medicines that patients never receive, according to the study.
Dr. Dixie-Lee Esseltine, vice president for oncology clinical research at Takeda, wrote in an email that the pharmaceutical firm "worked closely with the F.D.A. to establish the Velcade vial size of 3.5 mg to ensure that one vial of Velcade would provide an adequate amount of the drug for a patient of almost any size."
Velcade is sold in Britain in both 1-milligram and 3.5-milligram vials.
Takeda is expected to earn $309 million this year on supplies of Velcade that are discarded, an amount that represents 30 percent of the drug's overall sales in the United States, the cancer researchers estimated. If Takeda provided an additional vial size of 0.25 milligram, waste would be slashed by 84 percent, also reducing Velcade's sales in the United States by $261 million annually, the researchers calculated.
"You have these incredibly expensive drugs, and you can only buy them in bulk," said Dr. Leonard Saltz, who leads the pharmacy and therapeutics committee at Memorial Sloan Kettering and was a co-author of the study. "What's really interesting is they're selling these drugs in smaller vials in Europe, where regulators are clearly paying attention to this issue."
Christopher Kelly, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency objected to companies' proposed vial sizes only if it believed that an excessively large volume of medicine "could lead to medication errors or safety issues due to inappropriate multiple dosing."
In other words, as long as nurses are not tempted to do anything but discard additional quantities, the drug agency is fine with extra-large, one-size-fits-all packaging. Congress has not given the drug agency the authority to consider cost in its decisions.
"Companies propose the vial sizes that they would like to market," Mr. Kelly said.
Rising drug prices have been a concern for many years, and high initial prices and subsequent increases are an industrywide phenomenon. The last 10 cancer drugs approved before July 2015 have an average annual price of $190,217, and major drug makers routinely increase the prices of big sellers 10 percent or more each year, far above the rate of inflation.
The industry explains that high prices are needed to fund research, but companies such as Pfizer and Merck spend just 17 percent of their revenues finding new drugs, according to their financial statements. Far more goes to marketing and profits.
For decades, cancer doctors largely ignored the issue of pricing, but as their patients became impoverished, some began to speak up. In 2012, Dr. Bach and Dr. Saltz wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times announcing that their hospital would not purchase a new cancer drug that was twice as expensive as but no more effective than an existing medicine. The maker of the drug slashed its price.
Dr. Bach and Dr. Saltz say they have since become concerned that prices of new cancer medicines have almost no connection with their lifesaving potential. Dr. Bach recently unveiled a complex calculator of drug value.
But there was nothing complex about measuring the value of a drug that was thrown away, Dr. Saltz said, since the value to the patient was zero.
The two doctors have proposed that the government either mandate that drug makers provide medicines in enough vial sizes to minimize waste, or mandate that drug makers refund the government for wasted quantities.
Dr. Saltz first noticed the problem of waste when he was considering adding Keytruda, a new drug for metastatic lung cancer and melanoma, to the hospital's list of drugs to be used on patients. Although a 150-pound patient would need 136 milligrams of the drug, Dr. Saltz noticed that Merck, its manufacturer, sold the medicine only in 50-milligram vials -- ensuring waste.
"I thought that was really cynical," Dr. Saltz said in an interview. "And then it got worse."
In February 2015, Merck introduced 100-milligram vials and stopped selling Keytruda in 50-milligram vials, ensuring far larger amounts of waste. The company still sells 50-milligram vials of the drug in Europe.
Pamela L. Eisele, a Merck spokeswoman, said the company hoped to persuade the F.D.A. to approve a fixed dose of 200 milligrams of Keytruda for all patients, higher than the dose presently given to nearly all patients. In studies given to the drug agency, there was no evidence that the higher dose was more effective, Ms. Eisele said, but the fixed dose "will eliminate wastage."
Since the extra medicine does nothing to help patients, Dr. Bach said that the company was advocating that waste be injected into patients rather than thrown away.
Under its present dosing, Merck would earn $2.4 billion over the next five years from discarded quantities of Keytruda, half of which would result from switching to 100-milligram vials, the researchers estimated.
Some cancer drugs have little waste.
Treanda, which is used to treat leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals, is packaged in four separate dosages so only 1 percent of the drug is wasted, on average.
But 18 of the top 20 cancer medicines are sold in just one or two vial sizes, so on average 10 percent of the volume of cancer drugs purchased by doctors and hospitals is discarded, the researchers say.

Abstract: Shares of the drug and medical device company Endo lost $11.13, or 21 percent, to $41.81 after it said it would wind down its Astora women's health business and was setting aside $834 million to cover costs from possible product liability lawsuits over vaginal mesh implants, which have been linked to thousands of injuries. Natural gas prices skidded 4 percent to $1.71 per 1,000 cubic feet, the lowest level since March 1999.

Full text:   Late-day selling sent stocks in the United States to a loss Monday and erased nearly all of the market's gains for the month.
Weak earnings for drug companies pushed health care stocks lower, and energy shares fell as natural gas plunged.
Investors lost enthusiasm after two straight weekly gains. Health care stocks fell the most as the drug makers Endo International, Mylan and Mallinckrodt all slumped. Oil prices rose, but natural gas hit a 17-year low. Banks lost ground, partly because investors are worried about their potential losses on loans to energy companies.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 15.82 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,932.23. The Nasdaq composite index fell 32.52 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,557.95.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.47 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,516.50.
The loss on Monday pushed the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq to their third monthly loss in a row. The Dow eked out a gain of 0.3 percent for its first positive month since November.
John Manley, chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Fund Management, said investors were nervous. "Why not sell first and ask questions later?" he said.
Shares of the drug and medical device company Endo lost $11.13, or 21 percent, to $41.81 after it said it would wind down its Astora women's health business and was setting aside $834 million to cover costs from possible product liability lawsuits over vaginal mesh implants, which have been linked to thousands of injuries.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals shares slid after the company withdrew its financial forecasts. The stock gave up $14.85, or 18.4 percent, to $65.80. Stock in Mallinckrodt declined $4.21, or 6.1 percent, to $65.03.
With stocks on shaky ground, precious metals prices improved. The price of gold climbed nearly 11 percent in February. Gold is seen as a safe investment when the market gets rough, and Steven Dunn, the head of ETF Securities' United States division, said investors were now more worried about the global markets than they had been in several years.
"When there is turmoil in the world, people do come back to gold as sort of that safe port," he said.
The price of gold rose 1 percent Monday to $1,233.90 an ounce. Over the last two weeks gold has traded near its highest price in a year.
Benchmark United States crude oil rose 97 cents, or 3 percent, to $33.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the global benchmark, gained 87 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $35.97 a barrel in London.
Natural gas prices skidded 4 percent to $1.71 per 1,000 cubic feet, the lowest level since March 1999. In a research note, Commodity Weather Group said it expected a "super warm pattern" to start in about a week. That will lead to less demand for heat as the winter ends.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.05 a gallon, and heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.08 a gallon.
Policy makers at a weekend meeting of the Group of 20 rich and developing countries promised to use "all tools" at their disposal to bolster weak global growth, but they didn't announce any specific moves.
Some relief emerged with the news that China's monetary authorities had cut the amount of deposits that banks have to keep in reserve at the central bank. That should free up cash for banks to lend. The government also guided the renminbi lower.
Germany's DAX slipped 0.2 percent, while the FTSE 100 index of British shares remained almost unchanged. The CAC-40 in France rose 0.9 percent. The yen's strength weighed on Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225, which fell 1 percent. The Shanghai composite index tumbled 2.9 percent after the renminbi's decline.
Stock markets in Europe were helped somewhat by news that inflation across the eurozone turned negative in February as consumer prices fell. The euro fell because traders expect further monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank at its meeting on March 10.
In other metals trading, silver prices edged up 21 cents to $14.90 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.13 a pound.
Bond prices rose, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 1.74 percent from 1.76 percent. The euro fell to $1.0879 from $1.0938 and the dollar fell to 112.72 yen from 113.92 yen.

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- For the first time, tickets to Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California will cost more during holidays and some weekends -- up to 20 percent more -- than during slower periods, as the bursting-at-the-seams parks seek to spread out demand.
The Walt Disney Company unveiled its long-expected move to demand-based pricing in a blog post on Saturday. The seasonal changes, which take effect on Sunday, affect the two theme park resorts differently and apply only to single-day tickets and not the multiday packages that the majority of vacationing families buy, particularly at Disney World.
At Disneyland, located in Anaheim, Calif., which attracts roughly 17 million visitors annually, single-day tickets now cost $99. Starting on Sunday, the park will charge three different prices based on the calendar. "Value" tickets, for Mondays through Thursdays during weeks when most schools are in session, will drop to $95. "Regular" tickets (most weekends and many summertime weeks) will climb to $105. "Peak" tickets (most of December, spring break weeks, July weekends) will cost $119.
At Disney World in Orlando, Fla., which includes four major theme parks, the price changes are more complex, because they vary by park. At the most popular Disney World park, the Magic Kingdom, which handles nearly 20 million visitors annually, single-day prices will remain at the current level, $105, for value periods. Prices will rise to $110 for regular periods, and to $124 for peak.
Disney tends to increase ticket prices once a year -- recently, at well above the rate of inflation -- and it always prompts a degree of consumer outrage. But in pure economic terms, Disney's price increases have been modest considering the soaring demand, analysts say. During the company's last financial quarter, which ended on Jan. 2, domestic park attendance rose 10 percent from a year earlier, setting records. Attendance in the final quarter of 2014 rose 7 percent from the same period in 2013.
Overcrowding during holidays, particularly at the Magic Kingdom, has become enough of a problem -- endless lines for rides do not make for "the Happiest Place on Earth" -- that Disney had little choice in moving to a demand-based ticket-pricing structure, analysts say.
"In addition to expanding our parks, we are adopting seasonal pricing on our one-day ticket to help better spread visitation throughout the year," a statement from the company said. "Multiday tickets, annual passes and visiting during nonpeak periods also provide our guests with options and savings." A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the statement.
The company's blog post emphasized expansion efforts on both coasts, including a new "Frozen"-themed attraction at Epcot and a major "Avatar"-themed area at its Animal Kingdom park. Major "Star Wars"-themed additions are also in the works. The largest proportion of days at both Disneyland (46 percent) and Disney World (49 percent) fall in periods designated as regular; peak days account for 27 percent of the year at Disneyland and 29 percent at Disney World.
Demand-based pricing, which is commonly used in the lodging and airline industries, has already been adopted by other theme park operators in the United States, including Universal Studios, which will unveil a major Harry Potter-themed expansion of its Los Angeles park next month. Movie theaters and sports teams are also experimenting with similar pricing efforts.

Grappling With What Greenspan Would Do

Abstract: Perhaps most famously, in October 1987, the morning after the stock market crashed, the Fed offered this one-sentence statement: "The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the nation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system."

Full text:   Suppose a visitor from the future comes and tells you these facts about the financial markets in the year 2030: The stock market has fallen sharply, as have the price of oil and investors' expectations for interest rate increases over the next couple of years.
You would probably assume that the economy was heading down the tubes and in real trouble, quite possibly moving toward a recession.
A different visitor from the future arrives and tells you of this state of the world in 2035: The jobless rate is below 5 percent, and employers are hiring at a rapid clip and giving workers their biggest raises in years. Service industries that account for a large percentage of the economy are growing nicely, and consumers are spending money at a steady pace. Everything is just fine.
You've surely already guessed that both these descriptions apply to the United States in 2016, with big implications for businesses of all stripes and for the presidential election. But the tension -- between a miserable few months in the financial markets and generally solid economic data -- also exposes one of the thorniest questions with which policy makers at the Federal Reserve must grapple.
Should they believe market data or economic data? Bloomberg or FRED? That is, should they rely on the information that appears on the financial data terminals many Fed officials keep on their desks, or on economic indicators conveniently collected in the Federal Reserve Economic Data database?
If it's market data, then Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, and her colleagues should forestall any further interest rate increases indefinitely and perhaps reverse their quarter-point increase in December and entertain instead more radical easing measures. If it's economic data, they should feel comfortable proceeding with pushing interest rates higher.
But beneath that question lies an even harder one. Can Ms. Yellen wean the economy off what is often called "the Greenspan put?" And should she?
The Greenspan put is the idea -- much disputed within the halls of the Fed, but taken for granted in much of the financial world -- that the central bank will forever stand willing to intervene to keep markets from falling too much. Greenspan is, of course, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, and a put is an options contract that insures against decline.
Perhaps most famously, in October 1987, the morning after the stock market crashed, the Fed offered this one-sentence statement: "The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the nation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system."
It did the trick. The market stabilized, and the United States economy kept growing for four more years. Eleven years later, when a crisis in emerging markets seemed to threaten the booming American economy, the Fed cut interest rates three times, successfully containing the damage. When the dot-com bubble was collapsing in 2001, it did the same, less successfully.
In each case, Fed officials argued that they were not focused on trying to prop up the market for its own sake, but were trying to keep the economy on an even keel despite market turmoil. When the stock market drops, Americans are less wealthy and so would be expected to spend less money, and capital is more expensive for businesses, which would tend to make them less inclined to invest.
While headlines tend to focus on the stock market during periods of turmoil, these episodes usually involve a lot more happening in the financial world beneath the surface, like the interest rates on riskier bonds spiking relative to those of safer bonds, and the drying up of credit availability. In effect, the Fed cut rates in these episodes not to try to bail out investors in the stock market, but to offset these effects for ordinary consumers and businesses.
That's the line you'll hear from Fed officials, anyway. The challenge is that, in practice, this behavior looks an awful lot like the Fed stepping in to bail out the stock market -- so much so that financial markets tend to price in lower future interest rates whenever there is a drop in the stock market, as has happened in the early weeks of 2016.
The Fed started the year with signals that it would most likely raise its short-term interest rate target four times in 2016. After an approximately 10 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- but steady economic data -- futures markets now suggest only one rate rise is the most likely outcome. In other words, markets seem to believe that the Greenspan put has become the Yellen put.
It's not without basis, at least from historical analysis of the Fed's behavior. A 2011 study by Pamela Hall of the Swiss National Bank found that a model to describe Fed policy from 1987 to 2008 was more accurate when it included a reaction to asset declines than if it used purely economic indicators.
And to the degree that the Greenspan put is real, and continues, it raises difficult questions.
It might seem great to keep markets from falling too much, but that can create complacency and just encourage investors to take greater risk -- creating much more damage when the bubble ultimately pops. This arguably is part of what happened in the 2008 financial crisis: that years of Greenspanian work to keep markets from plummeting had made the entire financial system brittle and overleveraged.
There's a simpler moral case against central banks propping up falling markets, which is that it implies a government entity using public resources to keep a predominantly wealthy investor class from losing money. The interests of Wall Street and Main Street don't always align.
There are some hints that the Yellen Fed is reluctant to react to the latest palpitations in markets. On Tuesday, the Fed vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, noted that there had been episodes in which markets tumbled but no broader slump ensued.
"If the recent financial market developments lead to a sustained tightening of financial conditions, they could signal a slowing in the global economy that could affect growth and inflation in the United States," Mr. Fischer said in a speech at an energy conference in Houston. "But we have seen similar periods of volatility in recent years -- including in the second half of 2011 -- that have left little visible imprint on the economy, and it is still early to judge the ramifications of the increased market volatility of the first seven weeks of 2016."
The challenge, as Mr. Fischer suggested, is to decide which type of market move this really is.
Is it more like mid-2007, when turmoil in financial markets was the early warning of a recession that wouldn't begin until the end of that year? Or is it more like 1998, when the Fed cut rates in response to market turmoil that never caused economic ripples on United States shores?
He and Ms. Yellen will show their conclusions through their actions -- and in the process send a signal to Wall Street about whether, a decade after Mr. Greenspan left office, his approach to the job persists.

Abstract: Much as President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the United States and Britain down a more conservative path, leaders like Mr. Morales made a commitment to diminishing inequality that is expected to remain even as governments come and go. No case is more extreme than Venezuela, where years of government controls over the economy and reliance on a booming oil industry diminished agricultural production to the point that the country was importing its meat, milk and rice.

Full text:   COBIJA, Bolivia -- When Evo Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, took office a decade ago, he vowed to put this impoverished town in the Amazon Basin on the kind of pedestal often reserved for a capital city.
He filled its coffers with profits from the country's natural gas industry. He even seized large estates and handed them to new arrivals like Tania Chao, 19, whose family received a house when it came to Cobija with nowhere to live.
Yet when Mr. Morales asked Ms. Chao to vote for him last week, in a referendum to let him run for a fourth term, she did not feel that she could return the favor. The president had improved the town, she said, but he had been in office for longer than most people had lived in Cobija.
"It's time to find someone else to continue what he did," she said after the referendum, which Bolivians rejected.
Latin American leftists like Mr. Morales have suddenly felt their longevity ebb as a tide rises against them.
But is the wave of discontent a rejection of the left? Or is it something more personal, aimed at the outsize leaders themselves, not necessarily at the ideas they have promoted?
In Venezuela, former President Hugo Chávez's movement lost by a landslide in recent elections. In Argentina, the left-wing allies of former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner could not hold onto her office.
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, a populist educated in the United States, abandoned an effort to seek another term. Corruption accusations and economic woes have left President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil battling impeachment proceedings. But while longstanding leftist leaders and their movements may be faltering, their policies have taken a lasting hold in Latin America.
Much as President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the United States and Britain down a more conservative path, leaders like Mr. Morales made a commitment to diminishing inequality that is expected to remain even as governments come and go.
"No leader in Latin America today can afford not to focus on inequality and go back to the neoliberal formulas of the 1990s," said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy institute in Washington. "Whatever criticism you might have of the leaders of the left, they put their finger on the legitimate grievance of Latin Americans: that they had been excluded from the political system."
For some of the opponents now taking power, the question is not about razing the leftist models, but about making repairs and adjustments to them.
No case is more extreme than Venezuela, where years of government controls over the economy and reliance on a booming oil industry diminished agricultural production to the point that the country was importing its meat, milk and rice.
Then came the perfect storm when oil prices sank last year, creating triple-digit inflation and food shortages. In parliamentary elections, leftists were wiped out after 16 years of control.
The opposition rose by criticizing government subsidies, but its plan focuses on cutting them for the wealthy and stabilizing them for the poor. President Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez's successor, agreed to raise the price of gasoline, reducing a subsidy seen as benefiting the car-owning wealthy. No one has suggested making changes that could harm the poor.
Argentina's new president, Mauricio Macri, has enacted sweeping changes that have shifted the country to the center-right, including shrinking the state payroll and reducing electricity subsidies.
But Mr. Macri has maintained price control strategies intended to shield people from inflation. He also extended a child benefit program that was the cornerstone of Mrs. Kirchner's social policy.
"Macri, as well as the rest of Latin America, now understands that it's necessary to maintain and improve the social agenda," said Alejandro Grisanti, a former Latin America economist at Barclays Capital.
Here in Bolivia, many point out that while Mr. Morales was blocked from running in the next election, no successor could undo his work in Cobija.
This small Amazonian rubber port became a laboratory for Mr. Morales's project to bring the government to the country's poor periphery. The portion of Cobija's annual municipal budget from national gas taxes increased to $40 million today from $1.2 million in 2006, the year Mr. Morales took office, and helped underwrite a public university and a large solar plant in a place where there had been cows, jungle and dirt roads.
"I don't know why other governments never sent any resources here before," says Luis Adolfo Flores, the governor of Pando, the state that includes Cobija, and a member of Mr. Morales's Movement Toward Socialism party.
Twenty years ago, Alipio Rodríguez Suárez, 74, lived in an isolated patch of jungle next to a river. Now he has hundreds of new neighbors and an asphalt road with a median in front of his house.
He also receives pension under a program established by Mr. Morales. He says the modest $36 a month covers his bills. "I can be retired now," he said. "My parents worked in the rubber industry until they died."
The population here has doubled to 47,000 in 10 years, an increase that includes many indigenous Aymara and Quechua people who relocated. Storefronts have opened with facades that reflect indigenous traditions. Government workers are now learning Cabibeño, an Amazonian language.
The elevation of indigenous culture -- one of Mr. Morales's trademarks -- has had a lasting effect, residents say.
"The mentality of the people has changed," said Juan Carlos Arequipa, a taxi driver in Cobija. "None of us thought we would have a satellite," he said, referring to Bolivia's Túpac Katari 1 satellite, built and launched by the Chinese in 2013 and named after an indigenous leader. "We have the ability to do great things."
Yet Mr. Shifter, of the policy institute, said that development had backfired on Mr. Morales, raising expectations in an electorate that became more critical of him, especially as his presidency dragged on.
"He became a victim of his own success," Mr. Shifter said. "People now have pride and demands."
Corruption allegations surround the president. On Friday, the authorities arrested Gabriela Zapata Montaño, with whom Mr. Morales had a child out of wedlock. Ms. Zapata, who was the director of a Chinese company that received millions in government contracts, was under investigation in connection with peddling favors, the authorities said.
Similar complaints surfaced in Cobija, where the Evo Morales School sits empty, a $650,000 project that was never completed because a developer vanished after receiving government money. Only half of the first story was built, and vines are growing on the exposed rebar.
On Thursday, protesters here blocked a road, demanding that the city provide water, gas and electricity to a neighborhood they had created after seizing land. Mr. Morales once supported such takeovers but had not supported these people, and they wanted to know why.
"We are in the middle of a city, and we have no lights," said María Estera, a 61-year-old teacher.
Finally an organizer said the government had relented and would begin installing electricity.
"We will have lights by 6 p.m. tomorrow," he said to cheers.
The protest broke up.
"We have learned from Evo how to do this, and we can use it against them," one of the demonstrators said. "When he was a peasant, this was the strategy that he used."

Full text:   The Federal Reserve may be guilty of sharing too much information.
In contrast to its behavior under previous leaders, the Fed under Janet L. Yellen, the current chairwoman, and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, has sought to clarify its intentions by publishing long descriptions of policy-making deliberations, convening regular news conferences and releasing quarterly rounds of economic forecasts by senior Fed officials.
It is a remarkable reversal for an institution that once viewed public confusion as an asset.
But a new paper by a group of economists argues that the Fed's efforts in recent years to speak more clearly about its plans for monetary policy are imbuing investors with false confidence and setting up markets for disruptive disappointments when those plans change.
The Fed should stop talking about the likely timing of policy moves and instead encourage investors to focus on the evolution of economic conditions, according to the paper, presented on Friday at an annual monetary policy conference hosted by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Amir Sufi, a University of Chicago professor and one of the five authors, said that investors were now reacting more strongly to the Fed's pronouncements than to the publication of key economic indicators like the government's monthly jobs report.
"The meetings themselves are generating big movements in interest rates," Mr. Sufi said. "My personal interpretation is that that is a little bit worrisome."
The Fed is trying to find its way in a new world. It is raising interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. It is also raising rates for the first time since fully embracing the idea -- now conventional wisdom among central bankers -- that clarity is a central element of effective monetary policy.
Shaping the expectations of investors enhances its control over interest rates, and thus the broader economy. But there is no consensus about the best way for a central bank to speak clearly.
Mr. Sufi and his collaborators argue the Fed is sharing the wrong information. The Fed sets policy based on its expectations for the economy and a set of informal rules about the best way to meet its goals of moderating inflation and maximizing employment. Economists call those informal rules a "reaction function."
The Fed's prediction in December that it expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by about one percentage point in 2016 combined these two elements.
The paper argues that it would be better for the Fed to draw a clearer distinction between its expected economic outlook and its desired policy. That way, investors who disagree with the Fed's economic forecasts can plug in their own forecasts to predict the Fed's reaction if the Fed's forecast is incorrect.
Instead, the news media and investors tend to latch on to the projected timetable, encouraging too much equanimity about the course of policy, only to be surprised when changes in economic conditions produce changes in the Fed's plans.
"The Fed has relied much too heavily on time-based forward guidance," said Frederic Mishkin, a professor of economics at Columbia University and a former Fed governor, who presented the paper. The other authors were Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase; David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley; and Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
An audience heavily seeded with Fed officials greeted the paper with skepticism.
After the 2007-08 financial crisis, the Fed was able to increase the effect of low interest rates by predicting that rates would remain low for years to come. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, compared that kind of date-based guidance to a sledgehammer that was no longer needed, and he noted that the Fed already had moved away from offering such specific predictions.
Now the Fed faces the opposite challenge: An environment in which it must convince investors that it does not know where rates will be next year.
But being vague may not be the best way to communicate uncertainty.
Mr. Williams said the Fed needed to be simple and explicit because "the public has limited bandwidth." Mr. Williams, who is fond of communicating through T-shirts, then produced a customized shirt emblazoned with that message.
Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor, noted the difficulty of talking about the future "without referring to time." He suggested the paper's distinction between date-based guidance and data-based guidance was artificial. The Fed, he said, is inherently in the business of providing both kinds of information.
Narayana Kocherlakota, the former president of the Minneapolis Fed who is now a University of Rochester professor, suggested that neither side in the debate was right and that the Fed might want to seek other counsel.
There is an "idea that economists are necessarily going to be great at communication," he said. "Many non-economists tell me that's wrong."

Consumer Spending Rose 0.5% in January

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer spending rose solidly in January and underlying inflation picked up by the most in four years. The upbeat data on Friday added to reports on manufacturing and employment that have suggested economic growth gained at the start of the year.
The economic growth outlook was further bolstered by steady consumer sentiment in February despite recent stock market turmoil.
"Consumers revved it up a notch and inflation quickened as well at the start of the year," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "Consumers are sending a strong message that the economy is on the right track for continued growth this year."
In addition on Friday, the Commerce Department said that gross domestic product increased at a 1.0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter as businesses were less aggressive in their efforts to reduce unwanted inventory. The economy was previously reported to have grown at a 0.7 percent pace in the quarter.
The agency also said consumer spending increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since March, as households ramped up purchases of a range of goods and the return to normal winter temperatures lifted demand for heating. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity, rose by an upwardly revised 0.1 percent in December.
A price index for consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in December. In the 12 months through January, the personal consumption expenditures price, or P.C.E., index rose 1.3 percent, the largest increase since October 2014. The index advanced 0.7 percent in December.
Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3 percent. That was the largest increase since January 2012 and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December.
The so-called core P.C.E. price index increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months through January, the largest rise since July 2014. The core P.C.E., the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in December.
Separately, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 91.7 February after slipping to a reading of 90.7 early in the month. It was slightly down from January's reading of 92.
In January, consumer spending was supported by a 0.5 percent rise in income as the labor market continued to tighten. That was the largest increase since June and added to a 0.3 percent rise in December.
Wages and salaries shot up 0.6 percent also as minimum wage increases came into effect in some states. Wages and salaries increased 0.2 percent in December.
The Commerce Department said businesses accumulated $81.7 billion worth of inventory in the fourth quarter, rather than the $68.6 billion reported last month. The largest contributors to the upward revision to inventory investment were retail trade and mining, utilities and construction.
As a result, inventories subtracted only 0.14 percentage point from G.D.P. growth, instead of the previously reported 0.45 percentage point. The bigger inventory build is bad news for first-quarter G.D.P. growth, as it means businesses will have little incentive to place new orders, which will continue to hold down production.
"The weaker drag from inventories in the fourth quarter means that any rebound in the first quarter could be slightly more modest than we previously expected," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. "Nevertheless, it still appears that first-quarter G.D.P. growth is on track to rebound to a very healthy 2.5 percent annualized or higher, which should dampen any concerns about an imminent recession."

Full text:   If prediction markets (and most hardheaded analysis) are to be believed, Hillary Clinton, having demonstrated her staying power, is the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination. The Republican race, by contrast, has seen a lot of consolidation -- it's pretty much down to a two-man race -- but the outcome is still up for grabs.
The thing is, one of the two men who may still have a good chance of becoming the Republican nominee is a scary character. His notions on foreign policy seem to boil down to the belief that America can bully everyone into doing its bidding, and that engaging in diplomacy is a sign of weakness. His ideas on domestic policy are deeply ignorant and irresponsible, and would be disastrous if put into effect.
The other man, of course, has very peculiar hair.
Marco Rubio has yet to win anything, but by losing less badly than other non-Trump candidates he has become the overwhelming choice of the Republican establishment. Does this give him a real chance of overtaking the man who probably just won all of South Carolina's delegates? I have no idea.
But what I do know is that one shouldn't treat establishment support as an indication that Mr. Rubio is moderate and sensible. On the contrary, not long ago someone holding his policy views would have been considered a fringe crank.
Let me leave aside Mr. Rubio's terrifying statements on foreign policy and his evident willingness to make a bonfire of civil liberties, and focus on what I know best, economics.
You probably know that Mr. Rubio is proposing big tax cuts, and may know that among other things he proposes completely eliminating taxes on investment income -- which would mean, for example, that Mitt Romney would end up owing precisely zero in federal taxes.
What you may not know is that Mr. Rubio's tax cuts would be almost twice as big as George W. Bush's as a percentage of gross domestic product -- despite the fact that federal debt is much higher than it was 15 years ago, and Republicans have spent the Obama years warning incessantly that budget deficits will destroy America, any day now.
But not to worry: Mr. Rubio insists that his tax cuts would pay for themselves, by unleashing incredible economic growth. Never mind the complete absence of any evidence for this claim -- in fact, the last two Democratic presidents, both of whom raised taxes on the rich, both presided over better private-sector job growth than Mr. Bush did (and that's even if you leave out the catastrophe of Mr. Bush's last year in office.)
Then there's Mr. Rubio's call for a balanced-budget amendment, which, aside from making no sense at the same time he is calling for budget-busting tax cuts, would have been catastrophic during the Great Recession.
Finally, there's monetary policy. Republicans have spent years inveighing against the Fed's efforts to stave off economic disaster, warning again and again that runaway inflation is just around the corner -- and being wrong all the way. But Mr. Rubio hasn't changed his monetary tune at all, declaring a few days ago that it's "not the Fed's job to stimulate the economy" (although the law says that it is.)
In short, Mr. Rubio is peddling crank economics. What's interesting, however, is why. You see, he's not pandering to ignorant voters; he's pandering to an ignorant elite.
Donald Trump's rise has confirmed something polling data already suggested, namely, that most Republican voters don't actually subscribe to much of the party's official orthodoxy. Mr. Trump has said the unsayable on multiple issues, from declaring that we were deceived into war to calling for higher taxes on the wealthy (although his own plan does no such thing). Each time, party insiders have waited to see his campaign collapse as a result, and each time he has ended up paying no political price.
So when Mr. Rubio genuflects at the altars of supply-side economics and hard money, he isn't telling ordinary Republicans what they want to hear -- by and large the party's base couldn't care less. He is, instead, pandering to the party's elite, consisting mainly of big donors and the network of apparatchiks at think tanks, media organizations, and so on.
In the G.O.P., crank doctrines in economics and elsewhere aren't bubbling up from below, they're being imposed from the top down.
What this means, in turn, is that Mr. Rubio's consolidation of establishment support isn't a testament to his good sense. In fact, it's almost the opposite, a reward for his willingness to echo party orthodoxy even, or perhaps especially, when it's nonsense.
So don't let anyone tell you that the Republican primary is a fight between a crazy guy and someone reasonable. It's idiosyncratic, self-invented crankery versus establishment-approved crankery, and it's not at all clear which is worse.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials threw up their hands in January, deciding that they could not decide whether market turmoil would impede domestic economic growth.
The Fed in recent years has issued an assessment of its economic outlook after each meeting of its policy-making committee, but that assessment was missing from the statement after the most recent meeting in January. An official account, published on Wednesday after a standard three-week delay, makes clear that Fed officials simply did not know what to say.
"Most policy makers thought that the extent to which tighter conditions would persist and what that might imply for the outlook were unclear, and they therefore judged it was premature to alter appreciably their assessment of the medium-term economic outlook," the meeting account said.
It was the first time since March 2003 that the Fed declined to characterize the risks to its outlook, according to Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.
The Fed is unlikely to raise its benchmark interest rate while this confusion persists, suggesting that investors are right to discount chances of a rate increase at the Fed's next meeting, in March. But according to the account, Fed officials remain optimistic that the market turmoil will not leave a lasting mark, indicating that rate increases could resume this year.
"Lack of agreement on the balance of risks puts the committee into a 'wait-and-see' posture," said Kevin Logan, the chief United States economist at HSBC. "In our view, it is nearly certain that the committee will not be raising the federal funds rate at the March or April meetings. It is not likely that enough time will pass before those meetings take place for the uncertainty surrounding the international economic and financial market situation to clear up."
Fed officials probably wish they hadn't scheduled a meeting for late January, given the convulsions in financial markets caused in part by falling oil prices and broader concerns about the health of the global economy. Officials worried that investors were tightening financial conditions, raising interest rates for riskier borrowers while plowing money into safe havens like Treasuries.
Domestic economic data also has been inconsistent. The growth of gross domestic product slowed in the fourth quarter even as the economy continued to add jobs in large numbers. Incomes are rising but household and business spending has slackened somewhat.
And the persistent sluggishness of inflation provided one more source of uncertainty. The Fed maintains an official expectation that inflation will rise as job growth continues. Yet the continued decline of oil prices and the dollar's strength are delaying any such rebound, and some Fed officials noted worrying signs that people's expectations for future inflation also were eroding.
Some officials thought the costs and benefits of the forces roiling the global economy, taken together, would have a surprisingly small effect on the domestic economy. Lower stock prices are draining wealth from households, but falling oil prices put money right back into the same pockets. Moreover, those officials continue to expect faster growth later this year.
"It might prove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate hike," Patrick T. Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said on Tuesday at the University of Delaware. But, "I believe as we move into the second half of the year with economic activity growing at trend or slightly above trend, the unemployment rate below its natural rate, and price pressures starting to assert themselves, policy can truly normalize."
Others, however, thought tighter financial conditions already had increased risks to the economic outlook. Several Fed officials, according to the minutes, argued that "waiting for additional information regarding the underlying strength of economic activity and prospects for inflation before taking the next step to reduce policy accommodation would be prudent."
Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and one of the 10 voting members of the policy-making committee this year, said on Tuesday that recent economic developments meant the Fed should wait before raising rates again.
"In my own view, if inflation is slower to return to target, monetary policy normalization should be unhurried," he said at Colby College in Waterville, Me. "A more gradual approach is an appropriate response to headwinds from abroad that slow exports, and financial volatility that raises the cost of funds to many firms."
According to the account, few officials felt confidence in their assessments. It was easy enough to leave rates unchanged, but they still had to say something. So the Fed professed honest bewilderment. "Most participants indicated that it was difficult to judge at this point whether the outlook for inflation and economic growth had changed materially," the account said.
Mr. Feroli of JPMorgan Chase described the minutes as downbeat, emphasizing economic risks like the impact of tighter financial conditions. "The effects of these financial developments, if they were to persist, may be roughly equivalent to those from further firming in monetary policy," the account said.
Yet in keeping with the Fed's uncertain mood, the account also echoed recent comments by the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, suggesting that investors had overreacted and could reverse themselves. "The large magnitude of changes in domestic financial market conditions was difficult to reconcile with incoming information on U.S. economic developments," it said.

Full text:   The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, says that some eurozone banks "face challenges" but that the system is more resilient because of stronger oversight after the global financial crisis.
Mr. Draghi said on Monday that thanks to new supervision at the European Union level, banks were in a position to reduce the amount of bad loans burdening their finances "in an orderly manner over the next few years."
He made his comments at a meeting of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels, a week after significant swings in the stock prices of major European banks, including Deutsche Bank and Société Générale.
Mr. Draghi said some banks faced challenges from litigation and restructuring costs as well as from soured investments.
"Clearly, some parts of the banking sector in the euro area still face a number of challenges," he said.
Seeking to identify loans that had little hope of being repaid, the European Central Bank carried out a wide-ranging check of bank finances in 2014. Mr. Draghi said the check had forced banks to take steps to strengthen their finances.
Still, Europe moved more slowly than the United States to clean up bank finances after the financial crisis. Banks are critical to the economy because they supply the credit needed for companies to expand.
The recent sharp drops in stock prices reflect fears that banks might be exposed to risks from countries and companies that have an outsize dependence on the production of commodities. Prices have dropped because of fears about the health of the global economy.
Mr. Draghi said the situation was amplified by perceptions that banks might have difficulty adjusting to an economy with lower growth and interest rates. Low interest rates, in part a result of central bank policies, have squeezed bank earnings by narrowing the difference between the rate at which they borrow and the rate at which they lend.
The European Central Bank is expected to discuss whether to expand its stimulus measures at its next meeting on March 10.
Mr. Draghi said there were "a variety of instruments" that the central bank could employ if policy makers decided more stimulus measures were needed. It could increase its 60 billion euros in monthly bond purchases with newly printed money, a step aimed at driving down already low interest rates and raising inflation that remains too low at 0.4 percent.
He expressed some frustration with the extent to which governments had not used budget policy to help the economy at a time of economic weakness -- or had not taken pro-growth steps to cut regulation.
He urged governments that were in better shape financially to spend more on public investment, which would help growth, and to avoid excessive taxation.
Monetary policy from the central bank has been "the only truly stimulative policy over the past four years," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   When you lend somebody money, they usually have to pay you for the privilege.
That has been a bedrock assumption across centuries of financial history. But it is an assumption that is increasingly being tossed aside by some of the world's central banks and bond markets.
A decade ago, negative interest rates were a theoretical curiosity that economists would discuss almost as a parlor game. Two years ago, it began showing up as an unconventional step that a few small countries considered. Now, it is the stated policy of some of the most powerful global central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.
On Thursday, Sweden's central bank lowered its bank lending rate to a negative 0.5 percent from a negative 0.35 percent, and said it could cut further still; European bank stocks were hammered partly because investors feared what negative rates could do to bank profits. The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, acknowledged in congressional testimony Wednesday and Thursday that the American central bank was taking a look at the strategy, though she emphasized no such move was envisioned.
But as negative rates -- in which depositors pay to hold money in bank accounts -- become a more common fixture, there are many unknowns about what these policies mean for finance, for the economy and even for the definition of money.
These are some of the key questions, and, where we have them, the answers.
So how do negative interest rates work?
It depends. In the cases of interest rate targets set by central banks like the E.C.B. and Swedish Riksbank, they set a negative target rate for banks, and banks in turn pass it along to their customers. The E.C.B., for example, currently has a negative 0.3 percent rate, meaning that when banks deposit money at the central bank overnight, they pay for the privilege.
Banks have different ways of passing the negative rates on to depositors, often framed as fees for keeping money in an account, which is basically negative interest rates by another name.
Bond markets reflect these negative rates, too, including for longer-term government debt. For example, if you bought a two-year Swiss government bond on Thursday, you would have needed to pay a price that resulted in a yield of negative 1.12 percent. Even 10-year Swiss bonds have a negative rate, a sign markets expect below-zero rates to persist in Switzerland for many years to come.
Generally companies that borrow money are viewed as riskier than governments, so they have to pay higher interest rates. Therefore negative-rate corporate debt is still rare. But it has happened, including with corporate bonds issued by the Swiss food giant Nestle.
But don't people just withdraw cash rather than pay to deposit it at their bank or buy a government bond that will give them back less than they paid?
You'd think, right? This was exactly why economists had long thought that negative interest rates were impossible. It helps explain why central banks first turned to other tools, including quantitative easing, when they saw a need to ease monetary policy despite interest rates that were already near zero.
But it looks as if the convenience of keeping money in a bank account is worth a small negative interest rate or fees for most consumers and businesses, at least at the only slightly negative rates currently in place. Storing and providing security for cash may be more expensive than a small bank charge.
When initial experiments in Switzerland and Sweden didn't result in mass withdrawals from the banking system, larger central banks in need of easier money moved gingerly in the same direction. They'll stop when either their economies start to grow or they see more concrete evidence that negative rates are doing more harm than good.
How is this supposed to help the economy?
Pretty much the same way it always is supposed to help the economy when a central bank cuts rates. Lower rates encourage business investment and consumer spending; increase the value of the stock market and other risky assets; lower the value of a country's currency, making exporters more competitive; and create expectations of higher future inflation, which can induce people to spend now.
We have decades of experience with central banks trying to manage the economy by, for example, cutting bank rates to 2 percent from 3 percent when there is an economic downturn. The shift to negative rate policies is, hypothetically at least, the same, but with a starting point of rates already around zero.
So does it work?
It's hard to say with any certainty yet. At a minimum, it seems to have an effect of lowering the value of a currency, which makes export industries very happy. It's less clear whether it can help create sustained economic growth, particularly when the hard-to-calculate downsides are factored in.
What are those downsides?
The global financial system is built on an assumption of above-zero interest rates. Going below zero could cause damage to the very architecture by which money and credit zoom through the economy, and in turn inhibit growth.
Banks could cease to be viable businesses, eliminating a key way that money is channeled from savers to productive investments. Money market mutual funds, widely used in the United States, could well cease to exist. Insurance companies and pension funds could face their own major strains.
In a speech last year, Hervé Hannoun, then the deputy general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, even argued that this could "over time encourage the use of alternative virtual currencies, undermining the foundations of the financial system as we know it today."
Is the Federal Reserve going to do this in the United States?
Janet Yellen doesn't think so. But in two days of congressional testimony this week, she also didn't rule it out.
For one thing, the United States economy, and particularly its labor market, looks to be in stronger shape than that of many others around the world. So the Fed expects to be in interest-rate raising mode this year (though exactly how fast is very much in question). But even if the economy does take a turn for the worse, there's no certainty that negative rates are the path the Fed would take.
There is a question of whether that would even be legal. It's not clear if the language of the Federal Reserve Act allows negative bank rates (J.P. Koning, a financial commentator, runs through the legal issues here). Ms. Yellen said in testimony this week that the legality of negative rates "remains a question that we still would need to investigate more thoroughly."
She also said that "it isn't just a question of legal authority."
"It's also a question of could the plumbing of the payment system in the United States handle it?" she said. "Is our institutional structure of our money markets compatible with it? We've not determined that."
Financial markets do not now price in meaningful odds of negative rates in the United States. Want one modest clue that negative rates can't be ruled out, though? In its annual stress test of major banks, the Fed asked the firms to figure out what would happen to their finances in a "severely adverse" scenario that included a sharp rise in unemployment and a rate of negative 0.5 percent rate on short-term Treasury bills -- in other words, what you'd expect to see if there were a recession and the Fed cut rates well below zero.
Ms. Yellen noted that the rates on Treasury bills could go negative even in the absence of a policy shift by the Fed, as has happened a few times in the past.
So what are some of the weird things that could happen in a world in which negative rates become routine?
The policies in Europe and Japan are still relatively new and involve rates only slightly below zero. But if the policies become long-lasting, or negative rates go much lower, there are a lot of mind-bending ways it could affect routine transactions.
For example, would people start prepaying years' worth of cable bills to avoid having money tied up in a money-losing bank account? How about property taxes? Would companies and governments put in place new policies prohibiting people from paying their bills too early?
Or consider this: Many commercial transactions now take place with some short-term credit attached -- for example, a company that gets a 60-day grace period to pay bills from its suppliers. Would that flip, and suddenly suppliers would prohibit upfront payment and insist that their customers wait 60 days to pay?
Might new businesses sprout up that allow people to securely store thousands of dollars in bundles of $100 bills, or could people buy physical objects as stores of value that the banks can't charge a negative interest rate on?
"Negative interest rates in Japan is blowing my mind," said Jose Canseco, the provocative retired baseball player not normally known for his economic musings, on Twitter. And the truth is, he's not the only one.

Abstract: LET'S say you were persuaded by my argument in last week's Retiring column -- contrary to the advice offered by most financial experts -- that you should not reduce your exposure to the stock market as you grow older. Yet Mr. Buffett, the most renowned investor of our time, established a trust for his wife that puts 10 percent of his bequest in short-term government bonds with the remainder invested in a broad-based stock index fund.

Full text:   LET'S say you were persuaded by my argument in last week's Retiring column -- contrary to the advice offered by most financial experts -- that you should not reduce your exposure to the stock market as you grow older. Or you're at least willing to listen to this contrarian advice.
But now what? Whatever your age, how much of your investments should be in equities? Should it be 30 percent? 60 percent? 90 percent?
No less an authority than Warren E. Buffett has stated that 90 percent is the right answer. That's a level of investment in stocks that many investors, not just older ones, find dangerously uncomfortable, particularly when the stock market is as volatile as it has been lately. Yet Mr. Buffett, the most renowned investor of our time, established a trust for his wife that puts 10 percent of his bequest in short-term government bonds with the remainder invested in a broad-based stock index fund.
But even Mr. Buffett's advice may be too conservative. Indeed -- except for known, near-term financial obligations like a large tax bill that you might owe on April 15 or a down payment on a house you're buying in the next few months -- the best asset allocation, nearly all the time, is 100 percent stocks.
You may wonder if I put my money where my mouth is. I do. As long ago as the late 1970s, I was investing 95 percent to 100 percent of my liquid assets in common stocks. This didn't change even when I ran the bond department at my old firm during the 1980s. And it remains true today.
If one of my clients happened to ask me what I thought their proper asset allocation should be, I would tell them that, despite my job, I was almost 100 percent invested in stocks myself. I even suggested that they take away the money we were managing and turn it over to our firm's equity money managers.
Many investors simply cannot stomach the volatility that a 100 percent equity portfolio entails. Perhaps that is why Mr. Buffett tempers his advice and suggests "only" 90 percent stocks. (In his heart of hearts, I suspect, Mr. Buffett is probably a 100 percent kinda guy.)
And, so, what I actually say to people who ask my advice is this: Put as much money into the stock market as you can stand. One hundred percent is best, but even if you are very risk-averse, allocate at least 75 percent to stocks.
There are reams of data showing the superior performance of the stock market over many generations. In the last 90 years, according to Morningstar, stocks have outperformed long-term Treasury bonds, on average, by 4.4 percentage points a year. They have done even better against intermediate- and short-term Treasuries, 4.8 and 6.6 percentage points.
That kind of performance edge (compounded) really adds up. Let's say you invest some money in stocks halfway through your working career (say, at age 45) and spend those particular savings halfway through your retirement (say, at age 75). If your investment does 4.4 percentage points better per year than the next person's, you will have more than three and one half times as much money to spend as they will.
Looking at rolling 30-year periods, stocks have always outperformed Treasury bills and intermediates, and have only rarely underperformed long-term Treasuries. Even for periods as short as five years, stocks have done better than the various fixed-income categories 71 to 76 percent of the time.
Of course, "past performance," as we are constantly reminded, "is not necessarily indicative of future results." And that's true: For a variety of reasons, I believe you should not expect a broad portfolio of stocks to outperform bonds by as much in the future as they have in the past.
Historical experience certainly doesn't resolve all the questions. The great economist Paul Samuelson wrote: "We have only one history of modern capitalism. Inferences based on a sample of one must never be accorded sure-thing interpretations."
He was exaggerating to make his point -- countering those who would claim they have a large and statistically unassailable sample size simply because they have 90 years of consistently superior stock market performance. All that data, after all, covers only 15 business cycles, merely three generations and as Professor Samuelson said, just "one history of modern capitalism."
So, is there some other justification besides the reams of data? Are there sound reasons to believe that it is necessarily true that stocks will win over the next generation and the one after that? Yes.
My argument for full equity exposure rests not only on their historical and empirical superiority but their logical superiority. Consider this:
Money invested in a United States total stock index fund will be used to buy shares of thousands of companies in dozens of industries. At this writing, every $2 million represents an ownership interest of approximately one ten-millionth of almost the entire United States economy.
Economic potential never drops because knowledge -- the main source of per capita growth -- always rises. Technology (knowledge embedded in machines) gets better because we invest in research and development and never (at least intentionally) replace a good machine with an inferior one. Moreover, the capability of the average worker (knowledge embedded in our brains) keeps rising because average educational and training levels continue to rise.
As a consequence, the intrinsic value of your equity investments rises over time. This isn't true for every single company, but it is surely true for all companies taken collectively.
The economy, of course, does not grow every quarter or year. Just six and a half years ago, we emerged from the 11th recession since World War II. But the potential of the economy always grows, which is why after virtually every recession, the economy attains heights never reached before.
To be sure, the path of equity market valuation is far more erratic than the economy -- stocks often require a number of stock market cycles to attain new inflation-adjusted highs -- but the long-term trend is inevitably rising.
Inevitable? O.K., perhaps I'm exaggerating a bit. None of this has to happen. Theoretically, we could (collectively) choose to substitute inferior technologies for superior ones. Inferior technologies sometimes "win" because of superior marketing (think V.H.S. vs. Betamax), but that is the rare exception, not the rule.
It is also plausible, given that American educational levels are so high, that they could stop improving, or even slip. But that is not really conceivable on a worldwide basis -- at least for many generations -- since the developing world is so far behind.
But what if the absolute worst happened? A pandemic of epic proportions, a nuclear holocaust or the Earth is hit by an asteroid?
Yes, your stocks will collapse but your bonds will be worthless, too. If there is no functioning modern economy, the government will not be able to pay its debts. And if you're still around, you'll have bigger things to worry about.
The upshot is this: Both the historical record and logic argue very strongly for stocks over bonds. Yes, stocks are more volatile, but if you recognize that the "investment horizon" is always long and always receding into the future, your best bet is to put virtually all of your liquid assets into the stock market.

Abstract: Even under its current president, Mario Draghi, who came to power in late 2011, the central bank was unable to mount a stimulus program comparable to the Fed's until March of last year -- as the members of the bank's Governing Council, coming from various eurozone countries, argued over when or whether to take action. Wild swings in the share prices of Deutsche Bank and other large European lenders have raised fears of another banking crisis.

Full text:   Europe is still trying to crawl back to where it was in 2008.
That was the subtext of the economic data for the eurozone published on Friday.
The 19-country eurozone, the core of Europe's economy, grew at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the last quarter of 2015. But total economic output remained just slightly lower than when the global economic crisis began, in 2008.
Since then, much of the rest of the world, including the United States, has bounced back, however fitfully. But the eurozone as a bloc has been weighed down by huge numbers of problem loans held by its banks, a shortage of credit and a reluctance of governments to make politically unpopular economic changes. More recently, an influx of immigrants has heightened political tensions and further shaken the eurozone's unity.
And yet many of the eurozone's problems are a result of policy missteps -- or policies that simply could not be executed because of the fragmented nature of a loose affiliation of 19 countries that share a currency but each have their own taxing and spending regimes.
After the financial crisis, the centralized United States economy took only until the third quarter of 2011 to surpass its previous peak at the end of 2007. That was largely because the federal government quickly stepped in to clean up the commercial banks. And the central bank -- the Federal Reserve -- kept interest rates low and embarked on an unprecedented program of huge stimulus spending to revive the American economy.
Many eurozone governments, however, responded to the crisis by cutting spending, engaging in austerity economics that thwarted growth.
Along the way, the European Central Bank, under its previous president, actually raised interest rates before reversing course. Even under its current president, Mario Draghi, who came to power in late 2011, the central bank was unable to mount a stimulus program comparable to the Fed's until March of last year -- as the members of the bank's Governing Council, coming from various eurozone countries, argued over when or whether to take action.
All of this has added up to growth so feeble that the eurozone economy is still not as big as it was five and a half years ago. And unemployment is a stubbornly high 10.4 percent -- more than twice the jobless rate of the United States.
Europe's failure to climb back provides one more reason to be nervous about the global economy. The eurozone is still not strong enough to compensate for problems elsewhere, like in China, where there is the risk of a slowdown. The longer it takes for Europe -- the United States' largest trading partner -- to make up lost ground, the greater the risk the region will be trapped in the same kind of long-term stagnation that afflicts Japan.
Adjusting for inflation, the countries sharing the euro currency produced goods and services valued at 2.465 trillion euros, or $2.788 trillion, in the last three months of 2015. That brought the eurozone close to -- but still short of -- the [euro]2.471 trillion that it produced in the first quarter of 2008.
The eurozone could, finally, hit a new high during the first quarter of 2016 if it manages another quarter of growth as strong as the last quarter of 2015. But that is by no means a certainty.
Some unsettling recent trends raise the risk that the eurozone could even slip back to recession. Wild swings in the share prices of Deutsche Bank and other large European lenders have raised fears of another banking crisis. Voters in some countries, like Portugal, have rebelled against economic overhauls that are intended to allow faster growth but that often mean less job security in the short term.
Even if the eurozone does recover its previous economic strength soon, the wealth will not be divided equally. A closer look at the numbers released on Friday by Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, shows that the eurozone is divided into two kinds of countries.
There are those that have recovered the lost economic ground, like Germany and Denmark.
And there are those that have not recovered and are not likely to soon, like Spain, Italy and -- above all -- Greece. All three of these countries are substantially poorer than they were in 2008. Greece's economy is only three-quarters the size it was then.
Spain has recently become the fastest-growing large country in the eurozone as it has bounced back from a banking crisis caused by a housing bubble.
But Spain still has a lot of catching up to do. Spanish unemployment is still almost 21 percent, and overall economic output remains well below what it was in 2008.
Pilar Cabañeros, 44, who comes from Barcelona, said she is feeling better about her own situation because she now lives in Britain, which is not in the eurozone and where the economy is doing fairly well.
But in Spain, which she visits often, "I don't think people are positive about the economy," Ms. Cabañeros said. "Definitely not."
The diverging fortunes of the eurozone countries have political consequences.
The northern countries like Germany preach debt reduction, while the southern countries like Italy plead for more spending on public works to create jobs. The two groups have also differed on measures to prevent future crises. For example, Germany has objected to plans to create a eurozone fund that would protect depositors in the event of a banking crisis. The conflicts have threatened the unity of the eurozone.
"When economic forces diverge in what is supposed to be a common enterprise, that creates political unrest," said Thomas F. Cooley, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
Mr. Cooley, who tracks eurozone growth on a blog he maintains with Peter Rupert, an economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said the explanation for the eurozone's slow growth was fairly simple.
Fearing a political backlash, governments have been reluctant to take steps that may cause short-term pain while helping long-term growth, like loosening rules that make it difficult for companies to hire and fire.
The countries that have made changes tend to be the ones whose economies have performed the best. They include Germany, where unemployment has fallen throughout the crisis and is now at 4.5 percent. Britain, which uses the pound currency and has tried to keep its economy somewhat buffered from the eurozone's, also has a relatively low jobless rate, 5.1 percent, which is comparable to the unemployment rate in the United States.
France has recovered the ground it lost since 2008 but just barely. The Socialist French government has been reluctant to take on labor unions and make changes to work rules that critics say hobble entrepreneurship.
There are some positive signs in Europe. On much of the Continent, credit is cheap because of stimulus measures taken by the European Central Bank. Low fuel prices have left people with extra money they can spend on other goods and services.
One of the biggest bright spots is consumer spending, which has rebounded and helped make eurozone growth better than it would otherwise be.
"The interest rates on my loans have gone down, the purchasing power has gone up, there is confidence again," said Jocelyn Assor, 36, who was helping to raise funds for a French H.I.V. advocacy group outside the Les Halles shopping mall in central Paris.
Experts used to argue whether the eurozone would suffer a lost decade like Japan. There are some similarities. For example, Europe and Japan both have aging populations, with more people depending on pensions and fewer young people in the work force. Both were slow to clean up their banks.
Europe's demographic problems are not as severe as Japan's, Mr. Cooley of New York University pointed out. But, he asked: "Is this Europe's lost decade? They're struggling with a lot of the same things."

Abstract: A sharp rebound in oil prices and an encouraging report on retail sales helped lift the stock market to its first gain since late last week. The sector is the worst performing part of the market this year because investors expect that low interest rates around the world will sap bank profits, but bank stocks rallied 4 percent Friday.

Full text:   U.S. stocks ended a down week on a high note Friday, ending a five-day losing streak on the strength of energy and financial companies.
A sharp rebound in oil prices and an encouraging report on retail sales helped lift the stock market to its first gain since late last week. Still, the major U.S. indexes ended the week down about 1 percent and remain down more than 8 percent for the year.
"It's a relief to see after several very ugly days in a row, but I wouldn't hang my hat on it and say the worst is over," said Rob Eschweiler, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 313.66 points, or 2 percent, to 15,973.84. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 35.70 points, or 2 percent, to 1,864.78. The Nasdaq composite added 70.67 points, or 1.7 percent, to 4,337.51.
Stocks have been in a slump since the beginning of the year on concerns that growth in China, which has been the engine of the global economy in recent years, is slowing far faster than expected. Plunging oil prices and low inflation have added to the market's jitters that the global economy is sputtering.
Those worries also helped drive the stock market lower in recent days, and continued to batter stocks in Asia. Japan's main stock index lost nearly 5 percent Friday. But the downbeat trend in the U.S. took at least one day off as investors were encouraged by retail sales and a rally in European stocks.
A surge in oil prices put investors in a buying mood early on. A day after sinking to its lowest level since May 2003, benchmark U.S. crude climbed $3.23, or 12.3 percent, to close at $29.44 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, gained $3.30, or 11 percent, to $33.36 a barrel in London.
The oil rebound sent the S.&P. 500's energy companies 2.6 percent higher. Marathon Oil was the best performer in the sector, rising 48 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $7.49.
"Oil, which has been one of the most fickle, most volatile series that everybody's watching, is having a nice day," said Tim Dreiling, regional investment director for the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank.
Financial shares led the day's advance. The sector is the worst performing part of the market this year because investors expect that low interest rates around the world will sap bank profits, but bank stocks rallied 4 percent Friday.
JP Morgan Chase climbed $4.42, or 8.3 percent, to $57.49, while Citigroup added $2.56, or 7.3 percent, to $37.54. Bank of America rose 79 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $11.95.
Deutsche Bank surged 12.1 percent after the bank offered to buy back more than $5 billion in bonds in a display of financial strength. The stock gained $1.87 to $17.38.
Traders also welcomed a report from the Commerce Department indicating a modest gain in retail sales last month. The data, which came in ahead of expectations, suggested that consumers kept shopping despite sharp drops in stock prices.
The positive sales report and recent jobs data showing a pickup in wage growth suggest the economy is holding up better than Wall Street thinks, Mr. Eschweiler said.
"It solidifies our view that the markets are pricing in a significantly higher probability of recession than what we think the fundamentals currently dictate," he said.
Encouraging quarterly results from some companies also helped lift the market. Wynn Resorts surged 15.8 percent after the casino operator reported better-than-expected quarterly results Thursday. The stock gained $9.45 to $69.14.
Groupon vaulted 29 percent after the online daily deal service's latest quarterly profit and revenue topped Wall Street estimates. The stock added 65 cents to $2.89.
Some companies didn't fare as well, however. Activision Blizzard slid 7.9 percent after the video game company' reported weaker-than-anticipated quarterly revenue Thursday. The stock was one of the biggest decliners in the S.&P. 500 index, losing $2.40 to $28.12.
Pandora Media slumped 12 percent a day after the Internet radio company's fourth-quarter profit fell short of estimates and the company didn't comment on rumors that it's looking to sell itself. The stock lost $1.09 to $8.
In Europe, Germany's DAX was up 2.5 percent, while France's CAC 40 was up 2.5 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 3.1 percent.
In Asia, Japan's main stock index fell sharply, leading other Asian markets lower. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plunged 4.8 percent after earlier sinking as much as 5.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.2 percent. South Korea's Kospi gave up 1.4 percent and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.2 percent. Shares in New Zealand and Southeast Asia also fell.
Markets in China and Taiwan were closed all week for Lunar New Year holidays and will reopen on Monday.
A day after surging 4.5 percent, gold fell $8.40, or 0.7 percent, to $1,239.40 an ounce. Silver was flat at $15.79 an ounce. Copper, an industrial metal that will often rise and fall along with investor's optimism about the global economy, rose 2 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.03 a pound.
In other energy trading in New York, wholesale gasoline jumped 10 cents, or 10.8 percent, to close at $1.04 a gallon, while home heating oil climbed 9 cents, or 9.2 percent, to close at $1.07 a gallon. Natural gas fell 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $1.97 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.74 percent from 1.66 percent late Thursday.
In currency markets, the dollar rose to 113.26 yen from 112.27, while the euro fell to $1.1255 from $1.1330.

Full text:   MEXICO CITY -- The voluble talk-show host Andrea Legarreta broke from her routine of celebrity chatter and household tips recently to give her television viewers an impromptu lesson in global economics and the Mexican peso.
"The world economy has to do with what is going on with the Chinese economy, ob-vious-ly," Ms. Legarreta, the host of the popular morning program "Hoy," said, knowingly drawing out the last few syllables.
With growth slowing in China, she added, "this generates nervousness in the whole world."
Her co-host, Raúl Araiza, chimed in: "One of the effects in Mexico is that the dollar costs just a bit more than it did."
Never fear, Ms. Legaretta answered: "Just because the dollar goes up, that doesn't mean the price of everything we buy goes up. Do you want to know why?"
Then she muddled through an explanation of exchange rates and cheaper exports, only to trail off with an admission that she was still confused. But in the end, Ms. Legaretta and Mr. Araiza agreed, Mexicans should not worry about the tumbling peso unless they hanker for expensive imports.
Their misplaced primer on international competitiveness invited ridicule on social media. In response, Ms. Legarreta tried to deflect blame. In a letter posted on Twitter, and later removed, she wrote she had just said what "the advertisers want to share."
But her breathless introduction to economics did nothing to soothe Mexican consumers' worries: The peso has fallen more than 30 percent against the dollar over the past year, with an especially sharp drop this week.
In Mexico, where currency collapses have led to triple-digit inflation and deep recessions, the peso's tumble creates rising anxiety.
"For many generations in Mexico, a weaker peso has generally been associated with a crisis," said Alonso Cervera, the managing director for Latin America economics at Credit Suisse. "Not everyone understands that the causes are external."
One of those causes is the fall in oil prices, which saps market confidence in oil exporters like Mexico. The government here relies on oil revenues to finance part of the budget, and the price drop has already forced budget cuts. Last week the president of the central bank, Agustín Carstens, insisted that more cutbacks were needed to avoid "a much longer and more painful adjustment process."
Still, analysts say the economy is better protected than in the past. Public debt is manageable and the central bank sits on healthy foreign reserves. Unlike many of the emerging market economies that have also watched their currencies struggle against the dollar, Mexico's economy grew a modest 2.5 percent last year, and is expected to grow again this year.
"There are many forces at play and it is very difficult to disentangle them," said Gabriel Lozano, the chief Mexico economist for J.P. Morgan, who argues that the Mexican economy shows many signs of strength. "You have a lot of buffers."
But public jitters can cause consumers to delay purchases and investments, putting brakes on the economy. To stave that off, officials have struggled to find the right language to project calm.
"It's a fact that we're experiencing a moment of great uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets," Mexico's finance secretary, Luis Videgaray, said in a recent radio interview. "In the face of that, governments have to act like the Mexican government has been doing, with full responsibility, with early measures to protect economic stability and that way protect the most important thing -- which is to protect the economy of Mexican families."
The greatest worry is that a weaker peso will generate inflation as higher import prices are passed on to consumers.
The Mexican economy's link to the United States is among the strongest in the world, with almost $1.5 billion in trade crossing back and forth across the border every day.
That means wherever one looks here, the effect of higher-priced American products is creeping in.
"The price of apples went up from one day to the next," said Moi Gregorio, 33, the manager of a juice stand in Mexico City who blends apples from Washington State with other fruits grown in Mexico into his fresh juices. "If the price of the dollar stays like this, I won't have any choice but to raise the price."
For now, merchants are swallowing the cost increases. "The price of chicken has been going up every day since September," said Edgar Hernández, 35, manager at a market counter that sells fresh poultry.
Perhaps the Mexican-raised chickens eat imported animal feed, he speculated. Whatever the reason, "I can't raise my price to the customer."
The price of cotton imported from the United States is a problem for LeRoy Laboratories, a national company that makes bandages and other medical supplies, said Armando Lezama Laguerenne, 48, who works in sales and training for the company.
Rather than pass on the full price increase to consumers, the company is trying to reduce costs and raise productivity, even if that means cutting some jobs, he said.
For now, Mexico's inflation rate is stable, well below the central bank's 3 percent target.
And a cheaper currency is a blessing to some parts of the economy, like tourism. Other services are prospering, too.
"I have been drawing up budgets for foreigners nonstop" since the fall, said Carlos Llergo, a producer for Arre Lulú, which provides production services for companies that shoot advertisements in Mexico.
"Even when the peso wasn't so cheap, they came for the locations or the well-qualified technicians," Mr. Llergo said. "Now that it's cheaper and they make more money, they are in heaven."
Avelino Rodríguez, managing partner for The Lift, another production services company, said that the cost of shooting a Corona beer ad recently was 10 percent under budget because of the peso's fall.
But a cheap peso on its own is not enough to assure business, he said. Spain, Portugal, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil are all competitors -- and their currencies have fallen, too.
One of Mexico's most successful industries faces a similar challenge.
"Yes, we are more competitive, but so are all the emerging markets that make auto parts," said Oscar Albin, the executive president of the National Autoparts Industry.
Mexican factories sold some $85 billion in parts last year. "If we all have the same advantage, then it stops being an advantage," he said.
On top of that, many components, like steel, plastic and fabric for seats, are priced in dollars.
It is not just pricing that has given Mexico an edge, Mr. Albin said, "It's the productivity that makes us competitive."

Abstract: [...]his solution is more congressional oversight -- and he was one of the few non-Republican senators to vote for a bill, sponsored by Rand Paul, that called for "audits" of Fed monetary policy decisions. [...]Wall Street isn't the only source of malign pressure on the Fed, and in the actually existing U.S. political situation, such a bill would essentially empower the cranks -- the gold-standard-loving, hyperinflation-is-coming types who dominate the modern G.O.P., and have spent the past five or six years trying to bully monetary policy makers into ceasing and desisting from their efforts to prevent economic disaster.

Full text:   Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign famously focused on "the economy, stupid." But macroeconomic policy -- what to do about recessions -- has been largely absent from this year's election discussion.
Yet economic risks have by no means been banished from the world. And you should be frightened by how little many of the people who would be president have learned from the past eight years.
If you've been following the financial news, you know that there's a lot of market turmoil out there. It's nothing like 2008, at least so far, but it's worrisome.
Once again we have a substantial amount of troubled debt, this time not home mortgages but loans to energy companies, hit hard by plunging oil prices. Meanwhile, formerly trendy emerging economies like Brazil are suddenly doing very badly, and China is stumbling. And while the U.S. economy is doing better than almost anyone else's, we're definitely not immune to contagion.
Nobody really knows how bad it will be, but financial markets are flashing warnings. Bond markets, in particular, are behaving as if investors expect many years of extreme economic weakness. Long-term U.S. rates are near record lows, but that's nothing compared with what's happening overseas, where many interest rates have gone negative.
And super-low interest rates, which mainly reflect market forces, not policy, are creating problems for banks, whose profits depend on being able to lend money for substantially more than they pay on deposits. European banks are in the biggest trouble, but U.S. bank stocks have fallen a lot, too.
It looks, in other words, as if we're still living in the economic era we entered in 2008 -- an era of persistent weakness, in which deflation and depression, not inflation and deficits, are the key challenges. So how well do we think the various presidential wannabes would deal with those challenges?
Well, on the Republican side, the answer is basically, God help us. Economic views on that side of the aisle range from fairly crazy to utterly crazy.
Leading the charge of the utterly crazy is, you won't be surprised to hear, Donald Trump, who has accused the Fed of being in the tank for Democrats. A few months ago he asserted that Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed, hadn't raised rates "because Obama told her not to." Never mind the fact that inflation remains below the Fed's target and that in the light of current events even the Fed's small December rate hike now looks like a mistake, as a number of us warned it was.
Yet the truth is that Mr. Trump's position isn't that far from the Republican mainstream. After all, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, not only berated Ben Bernanke, Ms. Yellen's predecessor, for policies that allegedly risked inflation (which never materialized), but he also dabbled in conspiracy theorizing, accusing Mr. Bernanke of acting to "bail out fiscal policy."
And even superficially sensible-sounding Republicans go off the deep end on macroeconomic policy. John Kasich's signature initiative is a balanced-budget amendment that would cripple the economy in a recession, but he's also a monetary hawk, arguing, bizarrely, that the Fed's low-interest-rate policy is responsible for wage stagnation.
On the Democratic side, both contenders talk sensibly about macroeconomic policy, with Mr. Sanders rightly declaring that the recent rate hike was a bad move. But Mr. Sanders has also attacked the Federal Reserve in a way Mrs. Clinton has not -- and that difference illustrates in miniature both the reasons for his appeal and the reasons to be very worried about his approach.
You see, Mr. Sanders argues that the financial industry has too much influence on the Fed, which is surely true. But his solution is more congressional oversight -- and he was one of the few non-Republican senators to vote for a bill, sponsored by Rand Paul, that called for "audits" of Fed monetary policy decisions. (In case you're wondering, the Fed is already audited regularly in the normal sense of the word.)
Now, the idea of making the Fed accountable sounds good. But Wall Street isn't the only source of malign pressure on the Fed, and in the actually existing U.S. political situation, such a bill would essentially empower the cranks -- the gold-standard-loving, hyperinflation-is-coming types who dominate the modern G.O.P., and have spent the past five or six years trying to bully monetary policy makers into ceasing and desisting from their efforts to prevent economic disaster. Given the economic risks we face, it's a very good thing that Mr. Sanders's support wasn't enough to push the bill over the top.
But even without Mr. Paul's bill, one shudders to think about how U.S. policy would respond to another downturn if any of the surviving Republican candidates make it to the Oval Office.

Full text:   The president of South Sudan appeared to take a major step on Thursday toward ending a disastrous civil war that began more than two years ago in the young African nation -- reappointing his political rival as first vice president.
The decree by the president, Salva Kiir, reported on state news media, fulfills an important condition of a peace agreement reached last August but repeatedly violated. It basically restores Mr. Kiir's rival and civil war adversary, Riek Machar, to the position he had held until 2013, when he was dismissed by Mr. Kiir in a crisis that led to escalating violence, ethnic mayhem, mass displacement and widespread hunger.
The world's newest country, with vast natural resources including oil, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 and was the beneficiary of widespread largess and good will. Its descent into chaos in December 2013 created one of the globe's biggest humanitarian crises outside the Syria conflict.
Mr. Kiir, who is from the Dinka ethnic group, and Mr. Machar, a Nuer, have been under intense diplomatic pressure, including the threat of United Nations sanctions, to reach a reconciliation.
As of Thursday night, it remained unclear how quickly -- or even whether -- Mr. Machar would accept Mr. Kiir's decree and return to the South Sudan capital, Juba, to take up his restored post. Mr. Machar, who has been staying in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where the peace agreement was negotiated, has repeatedly questioned the sincerity of Mr. Kiir's statements about his desire to resolve the conflict.
"What is important would be an announcement by Machar himself that he is ready to go to Juba," said Daniel Bekele, the Africa director at Human Rights Watch. "If Machar is going back to Juba, that would be a step in the right direction in de-escalating tensions."
Others expressed skepticism, pointing out the history of mistrust and broken pledges between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar.
"On the face of it this is a positive gesture toward implementing the agreement, but whether this is going to be sufficient to bring about long-term advancement and stability has yet to be seen," said Johnnie Carson, a veteran American diplomat specializing in Africa and now a senior adviser at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington.
Mr. Carson said both South Sudanese leaders "have been partners in the past, and have worked together, and have fallen out, so the real question is how deep is the level of sincerity and how long will this partnership last."
Mr. Machar was deeply angered when Mr. Kiir changed the structure of the government in December, dissolving the nation's 10 regional states and creating 28 new ones in what appeared to be a move to secure more power. Mr. Machar said the change undermined the peace agreement, which called for the formation of a transitional government of national unity.
The decree restoring Mr. Machar to his former position came a little more than a week after the African Union issued a report painting an especially grim picture of the civil war's effects, with little sign that the conflict was winding down.
"There is limited consolidation of peace, a worrying economic decline and violence ongoing," the report said. "The economy is in particularly dire straits, with foreign reserves rapidly diminishing, growing inflation and rapid depreciation of the national currency."
Last month the United Nations said in a report prepared by its South Sudan and its human rights office in Geneva that the conflict had devolved into a murderous struggle between government and opposition forces, with widespread atrocities committed by both sides.
"The scale, intensity and severity of human rights violations and abuses have increased with the continuation of the hostilities," the report said, citing large-scale killings, attacks aimed at children and an "unprecedented level" of sexual violence, including gang rape and sexual slavery.

Full text:   What if the bazooka is shooting blanks?
Since the financial crisis, it has been gospel for many investors that some combination of actions by central banks -- bond buying, bold promises or flirtations with negative interest rates -- would be enough to keep the global economy out of recession.
But investors' distress over the latest volley by a major central bank, the surprise decision on Thursday by the Swedish central bank to lower its short-term rate to minus 0.50 percent from minus 0.35 percent, has heightened fears that brazen actions by central bankers are now making things worse, not better.
Global stock markets sank, the price of oil plunged to a 13-year low and investors fled to safe haven instruments like gold and United States Treasury bills.
Markets generally embrace conviction and run away from indecision -- which is what many see in the policy making of some of the large central banks these days.
The Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, for example, has been criticized in the past for prematurely raising rates, and Thursday's rate cut was opposed by two bank deputies.
At the European Central Bank, Jens Weidmann, the head of the powerful German Bundesbank, remains at odds with the president, Mario Draghi, in terms of how loose the central bank's policies should be.
And in the United States, the Federal Reserve is seen by some market participants to be wavering in its commitment to higher rates in light of the market turmoil.
Speaking to Congress, Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, sought to dispel the notion that interest rates might be headed anywhere but up.
"We will meet in March, and our committee will carefully deliberate about what impact these developments have had," she said, referring to turmoil in the markets.
On Thursday, the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 1.2 percent, after falling as much as 2.3 percent earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.6 percent to 15,660.18. Earlier, European stocks declined sharply. Stocks in Frankfurt closed down 2.9 percent and stocks in London fell 2.4 percent.
Japanese markets continued the sell-off on Friday, with the Nikkei 225 index down as much as 5.3 percent midday.
The price of crude oil slipped to $26.21. Gold rose to $1,247.90 an ounce, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.66 percent, from 1.67 on Wednesday.
The move by the Swedish central bank was intended to counter the dual threat of deflation and an appreciating currency, which poses a threat to the country's export-driven economy.
But many investors saw the rate cut as smacking of desperation and the latest sign that global central bankers are moving toward a round of competitive devaluations -- also known as currency wars -- as a way to stimulate their economies.
"What central bankers are doing now feels like a Jedi trick," said Albert Edwards, global strategist for Société Générale in London. "Everyone is in a currency war and inflation expectations are collapsing."
In other words, drastic steps by central bankers in Europe, Japan and China to keep their currencies weak and exports strong may not only be counterproductive in terms of stimulating global growth -- someone has to buy all those Chinese and Japanese goods -- but has other consequences as well.
Negative interest rates, for example, are not only bad for bank profits and lending prospects, they can also make savers more fearful, hampering the central aim, which is to get people to spend, not hoard.
All of which can lead to a global recession.
A perma-bear like Mr. Edwards is always in possession of a multitude of negative economic indicators to prove his thesis, which, in his case, is a fall of 75 percent in the S.&P. 500 from its peak last summer.
Some are obvious and have been highlighted by most economists, like the increasing interest rates on corporate bonds in the United States -- both investment grade and junk.
But he also pointed to a recent release from the Fed that showed that loan officers at United States banks said that they had been tightening their loan standards for two consecutive quarters.
"You tend to see that in a recession," Mr. Edwards said.
His prediction of a so-called deflationary ice age is still considered a fringe view of sorts, although he did say that a record 950 people (up from 700 the year before) attended his annual conference in London last month.
Still, the notion that the global economy has not responded as it should to years of shock policies from central banks is more or less mainstream economic thinking right now.
Within the International Monetary Fund, which has been regularly downgrading global forecasts over the last year, economists have begun to express concern that the growth problems of large emerging markets like China, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa are going to persist for the long term.
Increasing levels of debt and the inability of governments in these countries to put in place long-lasting reforms, especially at the private sector level, will keep growth rates much lower than they should be.
That could mean that this convergence with developed economies that emerging market bulls have long predicted could face quite a long delay and perhaps, in some cases, not even materialize.
The well-known bond investor William H. Gross of Janus Capital took up this theme in his latest investment essay, arguing that there was no evidence to show that the financial wealth (and increased levels of debt) created by a long period of extra-low interest rates would spur growth in the real economy.
As proof, he cited Japan's persistent struggles to grow despite near-zero interest rates; subpar growth in the United States; and emerging market problems in China, Brazil and Venezuela.
"There is a lot of risk in the global financial marketplace," Mr. Gross said in an interview on Thursday. "It is incumbent on me to focus on safe assets now."
For the time being at least, investors seem to agree. Over the last few days they have been pouring money into exchange-traded funds that track gold stocks and United States Treasury bills.
Riskier securities like emerging market stocks; European banks, where fears over bad loans are growing; and high-yield corporate bonds have suffered.
Low oil prices, cheap Chinese exports and negative interest rates may smell like recession to some, but economists with a more optimistic bent see these trends as a tremendous gift to the consumer.
Charles Dumas, the chief economist for Lombard Street, an independent research house based in London says that consumers in Europe and the United States will not hoard their gains but instead spend them on houses, cars and other items.
"This idea that consumers are not spending is just wide of the mark," Mr. Dumas said. Perhaps the full effect won't be felt immediately, he added, but over time it will.
The world's central bankers certainly hope he is right.

Abstract: Federal officials and many scientists agree that most of the nation's 53,000 community water systems provide safe drinking water.

Full text:   In Sebring, Ohio, routine laboratory tests last August found unsafe levels of lead in the town's drinking water after workers stopped adding a chemical to keep lead water pipes from corroding. Five months passed before the city told pregnant women and children not to drink the water, and shut down taps and fountains in schools.
In 2001, after Washington, D.C., changed how it disinfected drinking water, lead in tap water at thousands of homes spiked as much as 20 times the federally approved level. Residents did not find out for three years. When they did, officials ripped out lead water pipes feeding 17,600 homes -- and discovered three years later that many of the repairs had only prolonged the contamination.
The crisis in Flint, Mich., where as many as 8,000 children under age 6 were exposed to unsafe levels of lead after a budget-cutting decision to switch drinking-water sources, may be the most serious contamination threat facing the country's water supplies. But it is hardly the only one.
Unsafe levels of lead have turned up in tap water in city after city -- in Durham and Greenville, N.C., in 2006; in Columbia, S.C., in 2005; and last July in Jackson, Miss., where officials waited six months to disclose the contamination -- as well as in scores of other places in recent years.
Federal officials and many scientists agree that most of the nation's 53,000 community water systems provide safe drinking water. But such episodes are unsettling reminders of what experts say are holes in the safety net of rules and procedures intended to keep water not just lead-free, but free of all poisons.
The Environmental Protection Agency says streams tapped by water utilities serving a third of the population are not yet covered by clean-water laws that limit levels of toxic pollutants. Even purified water often travels to homes through pipes that are in stunning disrepair, potentially open to disease and pollutants.
Although Congress banned lead water pipes 30 years ago, between 3.3 million and 10 million older ones remain, primed to leach lead into tap water by forces as simple as jostling during repairs or a change in water chemistry.
"We have a lot of threats to the water supply," said Dr. Jeffrey K. Griffiths, a professor of public health at Tufts University and a former chairman of the E.P.A.'s Drinking Water Committee. "And we have lots of really good professionals in the water industry who see themselves as protecting the public good. But it doesn't take much for our aging infrastructure or an unprofessional actor to allow that protection to fall apart."
Both researchers and industry officials say problems extend well beyond lead. Many potentially harmful contaminants have yet to be evaluated, much less regulated. Efforts to address shortcomings often encounter pushback from industries like agriculture and mining that fear cost increases, and from politicians ideologically opposed to regulation.
Rules and science are outdated. The E.P.A.'s trigger level for addressing lead in drinking water -- 15 parts per billion -- is not based on any health threat; rather, it reflects a calculation that water in at least nine in 10 homes susceptible to lead contamination will fall below that standard.
And while political leaders upbraid the E.P.A. and state regulators for laggard responses to crises in Flint and elsewhere, they have themselves lagged in offering support. Adjusted for inflation, the $100 million annual budget of the E.P.A.'s drinking water office has fallen 15 percent since 2006, and the office has lost more than a tenth of its staff.
States are equally hard hit. In 2013, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators said federal officials had slashed drinking-water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees. "The cumulative effect of the resource gap has serious implications for states' ability to protect public health," the group stated.
As Flint's water crisis surfaced last fall, Congress was considering the E.P.A.'s effort to clarify its regulatory powers over tributaries and wetlands -- the streams that supply water to a third of Americans.
Both houses passed legislation to block a new Clean Water Act regulation, the Waters of the United States rule, that aims to assert authority over those waters, which the Supreme Court had questioned in 2001 and 2006 rulings.
And Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, denounced the rule as a federal power grab.
President Obama vetoed that legislation last month, but more than two dozen states have sued to block the rule. Among their arguments: It would hurt business.
An E.P.A. spokeswoman said Friday that the agency hoped to propose strengthened regulation of lead in drinking water in 2017, something the agency's administrator, Gina McCarthy, said was needed in a speech this month in Flint. She pledged then to start "a national conversation about this country's water infrastructure" and resources for states.
Ms. McCarthy has also issued a new policy calling for federal regulators to take a more active role in the face of public health crises.
A Core Problem: Old Lead Pipes
In 2011, the water authority in Brick Township, N.J., an oceanside settlement of 75,000 people, tested tap water in a small sample of homes for lead, as the E.P.A. requires be done periodically. It discovered two homes in which the level exceeded the agency's limit of 15 parts per billion, well short of the number that required remedial steps.
But in the next mandated test, three years later, it found that 16 of 34 homes exceeded the limit -- one of them by a dozen times. The growing use of road salt in recent winters, it turned out, had raised chloride levels in the river from which Brick drew its water. Undetected, the chloride corroded aged lead pipes running to older homes, leaching lead into tap water.
The town has since added an anti-corrosion agent to its water, but some residents remain wary.
"Why didn't somebody in the water company realize with all the snow we've had in those years that something was going to affect the water?" asked Jeff Brown, 73, whose 1960s-era ranch home was built when lead was allowed in water lines and plumbing. "I hope they've learned a lesson."
The authorities in Brick say the water now meets federal standards. But that is cold comfort to Mr. Brown. "I'm never reassured when they tell you what's in federal guidelines," he said. "Who sets the standards?"
Brick is but one example of how lead contamination can elude rules and authorities, potentially for years.
"We need an aggressive program to get rid of lead service lines, starting with an inventory so we know where they are," said Lynn Thorp, the national campaigns director for Clean Water Action, an advocacy group. "Water systems need to up their game and take this problem more seriously."
Both scientists and advocates say the rules governing contamination from lead pipes are ridden with loopholes. For example, the E.P.A.'s lead rule requires water systems to test in only a small number of homes with lead pipes -- 50 to 100 for large systems -- and intervals between testing can stretch to three years.
Water systems use various protocols for tap water tests, and rules allow ordinary homeowners to conduct them unsupervised, raising questions about their consistency. Officials must disclose contamination and take remedial action only if tests show more than 10 percent of sampled homes exceed the standard. Advocates say that lets utilities declare their water safe even if contamination is uncovered.
"Over the last decade we've learned that the testing routines did not detect true risk from lead, that there are forms of lead that we're not testing for and that testing was too infrequent," said Dr. Griffiths, the former chairman of the E.P.A.'s Drinking Water Committee. "It's hard to see how the status quo in lead testing for water is adequately serving the public."
In December, the Drinking Water Committee endorsed recommendations by an advisory group to strengthen the lead rule in several critical areas. The group said water systems should bolster their anti-corrosion efforts and test more often to ensure that they are working. It called for the E.P.A. to set a standard for lead in drinking water based on its effect on people's health, likely below the current level, and to require water systems to tell homeowners and public-health officials whenever it is exceeded.
Yanna Lambrinidou, who was on the advisory panel, is an adjunct assistant professor of science and technology studies at Virginia Tech, whose experts first disclosed the scope of Flint's lead problem. She dissented from the group's recommendations, arguing that they did not go far enough.
A study for the American Water Works Association, she noted, found that samplings of water that had been sitting in lead pipes had unacceptable lead levels in as much as 70.5 percent of water systems.
The advisory group also urged the E.P.A. to require water systems to eventually replace all lead pipes, but it did not address the main obstacle to that goal: cost. At $5,000 per pipe, by one estimate, that would consume between $16.5 billion and $50 billion -- and that is but a fraction of the $384 billion in deferred maintenance the E.P.A. says is needed by 2030 to keep drinking water safe.
Erik D. Olson, head of the health and environment program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: "You think our roads and bridges aren't being fixed? The stuff underground is just totally ignored. We're mostly living off the investment of our parents and grandparents for our drinking water supply."
Some systems have gone ahead despite the cost. In Lansing, Mich., not 60 miles from Flint, the Board of Water and Light has replaced 13,500 lead lines since 2004, part of a $42 million project that has only 650 pipes to go. Some residents used to fight the intrusion on their property, said Richard R. Peffley, the utility's general manager.
Since the Flint crisis, he said, "there's been no resistance."
A Hidden Problem: Unregulated Chemicals
The biggest hole in the drinking-water safety net may be the least visible: the potential for water to be tainted by substances that scientists and officials have not even studied, much less regulated.
The E.P.A. has compiled a list of 100 potentially risky chemicals and 12 microbes that are known or expected to be found in public water systems, but are not yet regulated. In the last 15 years, it also has required water systems to test for 80 additional contaminants to see whether they merit regulation.
So far, it has decided to place limits on just one, perchlorate, a salt found in rocket propellants and explosives. And what an arduous decision it has been: The E.P.A. began tests for perchlorate in 2001 and resolved to regulate it in 2011, but does not expect to publish its proposed rule until March 2017.
There are thousands of other chemicals, viruses and microbes that scientists like Dr. Griffiths say the agency has not begun to assess. The scientists say they can make educated guesses about the potential for harm, and most are harmless or exist in vanishingly small amounts. But they also admit they can be blindsided.
"We just don't have enough research to tell us," said Rebecca D. Klaper, a professor of freshwater science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. "This suite of 100 things might be in the water, but you have to have methods and standards developed to measure these things. Unless you have a preconceived notion of what you're looking for, you don't know what's there."
Toledo, Ohio, shut down its drinking water for three days in 2014 after microcystin, an unregulated toxin produced by algae-like bacteria clogging Lake Erie, tainted its supplies. Microcystin and related toxins, which can cause liver damage and have killed animals, have since been added to the list of potentially dangerous contaminants.
Another example: Many water systems draw from rivers loaded with nitrates, the product of fertilizer runoff and sewage overflow. But researchers were long unaware that removing nitrates from finished water can leave behind a toxic byproduct, nitrosamines, the cancer-causing chemical found in cooked bacon.
The soup of contaminants in many water sources holds other possibilities for trouble. The E.P.A.'s latest list of potentially risky substances includes some variants of estrogen, compounds from birth-control pills and other pharmaceuticals that are already linked to sexual changes in fish. Individually, they probably pose little risk to humans. Together, Dr. Klaper said, the risk may or may not be greater.
"How do you look at the long-term impact of these trace chemicals?" she asked. "That's what we're trying to wrap our heads around. The research that could determine whether anything is a problem is very complicated."
Ultimately, water problems in Flint and elsewhere suggest a failing in society's concept of water, said Henry L. Henderson, the Midwest program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"We see safe and sufficient water as a human right," he said. "It needs to be approached as a public service matter, not a private commercial commodity."
Cost considerations drove the decision to switch Flint from Lake Huron water to Flint River water, unleashing the lead problems. But water, Mr. Henderson said, has to be more than a matter of the bottom line.
"It doesn't just come out of the wall," he said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The contrast between the improving health of the labor market and the weakness of other economic indicators poses a challenging quandary for the Federal Reserve.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, and other officials have said the Fed must raise its benchmark interest rate as job growth continues to prevent higher inflation down the road. The strength of the January jobs report -- including faster wage growth -- suggests the Fed's policy-making committee still could raise rates as soon at its next meeting in March.
But the Fed would be betting on a theory. Inflation remains low, growth has slowed and the impact of global economic problems and financial market volatility is unclear. If the Fed presses ahead, it could undermine the economy just as things are getting good for the vast majority of Americans.
"My message to the Fed regarding this recent, long-awaited acceleration in wages is 'Love it and leave it alone,' " said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who previously served as the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. "If we want working people to benefit from the expansion, the last thing you'd want to do is tap the brakes -- especially given the absence of inflationary pressures."
The Fed raised its benchmark rate in December for the first time since the financial crisis. It had held rates near zero for seven years to encourage borrowing and risk-taking. Ms. Yellen, speaking after the announcement, said the Fed planned to raise rates gradually, reducing those incentives because the economy no longer needed quite as much help.
She will speak publicly for the first time since then on Wednesday when she testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. In the intervening two months, the economic outlook has deteriorated. Financial conditions have tightened and the dollar has gained strength, weighing on American exporters and delaying any rebound in inflation.
The January jobs report, however, reflects considerable strength in other parts of the economy. Stronger wage growth is particularly likely to grab the Fed's attention, suggesting that employers are finally being forced to compete for workers by raising pay. In a high-profile example, Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, has said that it plans to increase hourly pay rates for most of its employees later this month.
The Fed is less likely to worry about the slower pace of job creation in January, as officials have predicted that slower population growth would weigh on job creation. In keeping with those expectations, the unemployment rate still fell to 4.9 percent.
One reason the Fed is focused on job growth is that it may be a more accurate reflection of the strength of the underlying economy. In the fourth quarter of 2015, for example, the government estimated the economy added 279,000 jobs a month, but that output increased at a rate of just 0.7 percent.
Jason Furman, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in an analysis on Friday that the output figures probably reflected some measurement error. "This illustrates the importance of focusing on a wide range of indicators -- especially labor market data, which tend to be less noisy -- in assessing the health of the economy," he said.
One wing of the Fed sees an undiminished case for raising rates.
Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and one of the 10 Fed officials voting on the direction of policy this year, said this week that the Fed "should continue the gradual adjustment of moving rates higher to keep them aligned with economic activity and inflation."
She also played down concerns about the economic impact of recent market volatility. "While taking a signal from such volatility is warranted," she said, "monetary policy cannot respond to every blip in financial markets."
Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and another voter, said on Thursday in New York that it was "premature" to change her economic outlook.
"At this point, solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll growth, and healthy growth in real disposable income, suggest that underlying U.S. economic fundamentals remain sound," Ms. Mester said. "Until we see further evidence to the contrary, my expectation is that the U.S. economy will work through the latest episode of market turbulence and soft patch to regain its footing for moderate growth."
Other Fed officials, however, say the volatility has given them pause.
William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a close adviser to Ms. Yellen, said in an interview with Market News International this week that he was worried about the economic impact of jittery markets.
"If those financial conditions were to remain in place by the time we get to the March meeting, we would have to take that into consideration in terms of that monetary policy decision," Mr. Dudley said.
And Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been particularly outspoken in warning that global pressures will weigh on domestic growth, told The Wall Street Journal this week that "recent developments reinforce the case for watchful waiting."
Investors, oddly, have walked away from this debate feeling confident that the Fed will not raise rates in March. Indeed, asset prices tied to expectations about the future level of short-term interest imply only about a 50 percent chance of any rate increase this year.
That contrasts sharply with the Fed's own prediction in December that it planned to raise rates by about one percentage point in 2016, most likely in four discrete steps.
Many analysts have taken a more measured position, predicting that the Fed is less likely to move in March, but that it will still raise rates two or three times this year.
Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said on Friday he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, instead of three times, and to start in June, instead of March.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the continuation of low inflation probably meant Fed policy makers would hesitate at their next session.
"Were the meeting held tomorrow, we still think the Fed would stay on hold -- primarily because of concerns about inflation and inflation expectations," he said. "But it would be an uncomfortable hold."

Full text:   More and more news headlines and stock market analysts' reports have started predicting, or at least insinuating, that a recession could be near in the United States.
I've been skeptical; the economy may not be great, but I've had a hard time envisioning how economic turmoil in countries like China and Brazil and supercheap oil could somehow combine to drag down the mighty United States economy. That's why my October article on the economic outlook ended not with any bold conclusion, but with the "shruggie" emoticon.
But after thinking about it some more and talking with some people on the pessimistic end of the spectrum, I think I have a handle on how the economy could end up in a substantially worse place by the end of the year.
Here's that narrative.
What we're dealing with isn't just a run-of-the-mill economic slowdown in emerging markets, but the reversal of a 15-year cycle in which capital has flowed into emerging markets year after year while debt grew. Now that's reversing, and we're seeing a version of Warren Buffett's maxim that "you only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out."
In other words, now that capital is going out rather than coming in, we're seeing just how much of the growth in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America since 2000 has been driven by a credit bubble and how much is real, durable economic activity. (Read my colleague Peter Eavis on the bad loans in question.)
This will put those countries' economies under pressure. Global investors will discover more poorly run companies and weak governmental structures than they had generally assumed existed during the emerging markets boom, when an influx of foreign money masked those problems.
The steep drop in oil prices is both a cause and effect. For oil-producing countries (in the Middle East, certainly, but also the likes of Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria), falling oil prices mean a drop in revenue and a lot of stress on major oil companies. And the slowdown in economic activity across global emerging markets reduces demand for oil, creating a vicious cycle.
That isn't the only vicious cycle at work here. The weakening of emerging economies causes their currencies to fall relative to the dollar. Now that should help their exporters, but in the current moment it can make the debt crisis worse. Every tick the Chinese renminbi, the Indonesian rupiah or the Brazilian real goes down against the dollar makes it harder for the countries' companies to repay their debts. Then you get further retrenchment.
But our story of how the United States might fall into recession isn't done. Exports to these emerging economies are a small enough piece of overall American G.D.P. that it would take an all-out collapse to move the dial on United States growth. And the energy sector in the United States expanded a lot in the last few years, but oil and gas extraction still accounted for only 730,000 jobs in December, in an economy with 143 million of them.
So in normal times, an emerging market panic, a drop in oil prices and a strengthening dollar shouldn't matter much for the United States. In 1998, for example, all of those things were happening, yet growth roared ahead in 1999.
But if there's a recession in 2016, it will be because of two crucial differences in the economy.
First, the starting point for the United States and other advanced economies was much stronger then. From 1996 to 1998, the United States economy grew an average of 4.3 percent a year; from 2013 to 2015 the rate was less than half that, 2.1 percent. A much smaller hit to growth would be more likely to put us in recessionary territory now than in the late 1990s.
That lower economic starting point could already be having some psychological impacts that slow growth. Perhaps the weak underlying condition of the United States economy is a reason consumers are largely putting their savings from lower energy prices into increased savings rather than buying stuff. In the late 1990s they felt more confident, and thus cheaper oil was more of an economic boon. If you're a corporate chief executive making plans to expand your business, surely similar dynamics apply.
Second, the Federal Reserve is in a radically different spot than it was in the 1990s. The central bank's job is to act as a shock absorber for the economy to try to maintain growth without significant inflation.
It was better positioned and more inclined to play that role in 1998. From September through November of 1998, the Fed cut its main target interest rate three-quarters of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent because it worried that tumult in financial markets during that summer would halt the United States expansion.
Now, it's not clear that the Fed has the ability or the will to be a shock absorber for the economy in the same way. That same interest rate is now in the range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent, which means an interest-rate cut of the same amount would put the Fed in the uncharted territory of negative interest rates. Depositors end up paying the bank. That's already happened to the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.
There would be some reluctance to do that, for a few reasons. It would be an embarrassing admission that December's interest rate increase was a mistake. And some Fed officials believe the central bank has been too willing to take action that boosts financial markets but has unclear benefits for the economy itself.
So the story of a 2016 United States recession is this: Tumult in emerging markets and the commodities sectors creates both real and psychological hits to an economy that is already growing sluggishly. Policy makers lack either the tools or the will, depending on your view, to take action to contain the damage. And so what should be relatively small hits to the economy are enough to suck the United States into a contraction.
If you like, add the possibility that there is a major unforeseen shock out there that makes all of this worse. Think of it this way: The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks helped ensure that an economic slowdown set off by the popping of a technology bubble would become a recession. But the attacks alone probably wouldn't have led to a recession if they had happened in 1999.
Your guess is as good as mine on the odds that this series of events will happen. (The jobs report on Friday could soothe such jitters or heighten them.) But this much is clear: When an economy is already vulnerable, as the United States looks to be in 2016, it takes less to tip it over the edge than when it is strong. Sorry, but not every economic story has a happy ending.

Abstract: Even as substantive legislation in Washington remained largely bogged down by bitter partisan mistrust, some of the leading thinkers on opposite sides of the ideological divide -- experts on the right who have advised Republican policy makers alongside left-leaning scholars who have Democrats' ear -- came together to champion an increase in the minimum wage. The scholars made note of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's recent assessment that the Obama administration's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 and index it to inflation would provide higher pay to 16 million to 24 million workers and lift a million people out of poverty -- at a cost of 500,000 jobs over three years and a slight uptick in consumer prices.

Full text:   If you have been paying any attention to America's paralyzed politics, you are not going to believe this.
Even as substantive legislation in Washington remained largely bogged down by bitter partisan mistrust, some of the leading thinkers on opposite sides of the ideological divide -- experts on the right who have advised Republican policy makers alongside left-leaning scholars who have Democrats' ear -- came together to champion an increase in the minimum wage.
They didn't stop there. In a report published in December, they also recommended attaching a job requirement to the food stamp program, to compel poor people to work. They strongly endorsed marriage, as well as birth control.
They called for increasing the earned-income tax credit for adults without children. They also proposed more federal investment in early childhood education and community colleges. They defended a common core in education.
To pay for it all, they recommended culling corporate boondoggles and individual tax expenditures that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, like farm subsidies and the mortgage interest tax deduction. And they urged reducing Social Security benefits for affluent Americans.
These folks do not often agree. The group included Robert Doar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Lawrence Mead of New York University, who believe that welfare should come with stiff work requirements to discourage dependency. They sat across from Sheldon Danziger of the Russell Sage Foundation and Jane Waldfogel of Columbia University, who believe in a cash safety net of last resort, at least for families with children.
"Everybody had to swallow very hard to put their name on that," acknowledged Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute, who was part of the 15-member group.
It is easy to dismiss the exercise as a futile effort to find a minimum common denominator between disparate opposites. The report is not likely to make its way into legislation any time soon. But, the experts hope, the next administration might turn its attention to poverty and find a set of viable ideas on the shelf.
The collection of proposals -- from promoting strong and stable families to improving the quantity and quality of work -- actually adds up to a coherent approach to improving an anti-poverty strategy that has fallen far short of its goals.
This raises a tantalizing prospect. Is it possible that combating America's entrenched poverty -- the deepest among advanced industrialized nations -- may have finally become salient enough for the left and right to break through the ideological gridlock?
"The report took us longer than we thought," Mr. Danziger told me. "But everybody agreed that even though there were things in it we didn't like, the package together would be better than the status quo."
A dose of skepticism is probably wise. Preserving the bipartisan balance -- drafted over the course of 14 months, with New York University's Jonathan Haidt in the role of ideological mediator -- required a lot of vagueness that would never survive the rough and tumble of the real political arena. Touchy subjects like race were mostly left off the table. And though bipartisanship may have committed both sides to work from the same facts, it did nothing to alter how each side weighed them.
Consider the call to increase the minimum wage. The scholars made note of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's recent assessment that the Obama administration's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 and index it to inflation would provide higher pay to 16 million to 24 million workers and lift a million people out of poverty -- at a cost of 500,000 jobs over three years and a slight uptick in consumer prices.
Conservatives still found the costs too high and the benefits insufficiently compelling. Most of the income gains would benefit the nonpoor, they argued. And what if the budget office underestimated job losses? What if fixing the minimum wage to inflation brought other costs?
This debate was a "clear example of how values can influence the reading of research evidence," the report admitted candidly.
Nonetheless, in the service of a deal, those on the right and the left held their noses and agreed to "recommend an increase below what the administration has proposed, but still large enough to substantially improve the rewards associated with work among the less-skilled."
The two sides will never entirely agree, of course, partly because they view the causes of poverty from such different angles.
To the left, deprivation is caused mostly by factors beyond the control of the poor. These include globalization that undercut good jobs previously within the reach of the less educated, an educational system segregated by race and class, lack of parental resources, discrimination, excessive use of prison.
Experts on the right, by contrast, put a lot of the weight on personal responsibility, often faulting the bad choices of the poor. And government support, by providing the poor with an income with few strings attached, has made their choices worse.
Yet common ground does exist. Understanding the causes of poverty has improved over the last few decades, helping push solutions through the ideological fog.
Many liberals are still skeptical that encouraging marriage will do much to help the poor, but most have come to accept that the children of intact families have a better shot in life. Some conservatives have come to acknowledge that though the push to tie work requirements to public assistance may have made sense in the booming 1990s, the approach might require adjustments to fit the present, less dynamic economy.
This opens up opportunities for deals. Conservatives want those on government aid to get a job? Liberals will agree, provided there is a guarantee that jobs are available and that there is a safety net for those at the very bottom who simply cannot work.
"If we require more work as a condition of receiving public benefits, we should support policies expanding work availability to those who need it," the report states.
Progressives, Mr. Danziger told me, placed more weight on the part of the report that calls for "ensuring jobs are available." Conservatives, by contrast, preferred the bit that mentioned "raising work levels among the hard-to-employ."
This is the way deals are made. "This is modest," Mr. Danziger argued. "If we had a system where people were not fearful of the Tea Party or of unions, you could get 60 percent of the House and 60 percent of the Senate to agree."
There is another hurdle that may be even harder to overcome: money. The report's "close tax expenditures" approach to financing useful proposals has become the standard Hail Mary pass. But given all the interests with a stake in the present tax system, it never seems to muster much support.
As Mr. Strain put it, "it's impossible to deny that conservatives want to spend less money than liberals." Indeed, when House Speaker Paul D. Ryan proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit, he favored paying for it by cutting funds for other anti-poverty efforts.
Still, it is worth seeking a deal. If the Democrats retain the White House while the Republicans maintain their grip on Congress, neither party will be able to dominate Washington policy making. For the poor, a compromise along these lines would be a lot better than doing nothing.

Abstract: (In both Iowa and New Hampshire, the unemployment rate is currently under 4 percent.) The foreign policy picture is grim in certain ways, but America isn't trapped in a casualty-heavy quagmire the way we were in 2004, when Democratic voters played it safe with John Kerry and George W. Bush won re-election.

Full text:   ONE of the puzzles of the 2016 campaign, unexpectedly defined by the ascent of a billionaire reality TV star and a septuagenarian Vermont socialist, is why now? Yes, voters are angry, yes, they're exhausted and disgusted and cynical about everything. But why is everything boiling over in this particular cycle, in this presidential campaign?
Consider: The economic picture is better than it was in 2012, when Republican primary voters settled for Mitt Romney and an incumbent president was re-elected pretty easily. (In both Iowa and New Hampshire, the unemployment rate is currently under 4 percent.) The foreign policy picture is grim in certain ways, but America isn't trapped in a casualty-heavy quagmire the way we were in 2004, when Democratic voters played it safe with John Kerry and George W. Bush won re-election.
As Michael Grunwald argued recently in Politico, the worst-case scenarios of the post-Great Recession era haven't materialized. Obamacare is limping along without an imminent death spiral, and health care costs aren't rising as fast as feared. The deficit has fallen a bit, and inflation is extraordinarily low. The stock market is wobbly, but we haven't had a double-dip recession.
On the cultural front, out-of-wedlock births are no longer rising. Abortion rates have fallen. Illegal immigration rates are down.
The state of the union isn't all that one might hope, but it could clearly be a whole lot worse.
So what are Trumpistas and Bern-feelers rebelling against?
One answer might be that they're fed up with exactly this -- the politics of "it could be worse," of stagnation and muddling through. They aren't revolting against abject failure, or deep and swift decline. They're rebelling against decadence.
Now it may sound absurd to cast a figure like Donald Trump, the much-married prince of tinsel and pasteboard, as a scourge of decadence rather than its embodiment.
But don't just think about the word in moral or aesthetic terms. Think of it as a useful way of describing a society that's wealthy, powerful, technologically proficient -- and yet seemingly unable to advance in the way that its citizens once took for granted. A society where people have fewer children and hold diminished expectations for the future, where institutions don't work particularly well but can't seem to be effectively reformed, where growth is slow and technological progress disappoints. A society that fights to a stalemate in its foreign wars, even as domestic debates repeat themselves without any resolution. A society disillusioned with existing religions and ideologies, but lacking new sources of meaning to take their place.
This is how many Americans, many Westerners, experience their civilization in the early years of the 21st century. And both Trump and Bernie Sanders, in their very different ways, are telling us that we don't have to settle for it anymore.
With Trump, the message is crude, explicit, deliberately over the top. Make America Great Again. "We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with the winning."
But it resonates because the diagnosis resonates -- especially with older Americans, who grew up amid the post-World War II boom, the vaulting optimism of the space age, the years when big government and big business were seen as effective and patriotic rather than sclerotic and corrupt. Trump is offering nostalgia, but it's not a true reactionary's lament. He wants to take us back to a time when the future seemed great, amazing, fantastic.
Likewise Sanders, except that in his case the glorious future is more midcentury Scandinavia than space age America. After Obamacare became law it seemed to many people that the welfare state project was basically complete, that the future of American liberalism mostly involved tweaking entitlements around the edges to keep them solvent. But Sanders is telling liberals, younger liberals especially, that the heroic age of liberalism isn't over yet, that they can have a welfare state that's far more amazing and fantastic than the one their forefathers constructed.
The fact that both of these messages -- Trump's "Make America great again" and Bernie's "Why not socialism?" -- involve essentially recycled visions of the future is a sign of how hard it is for a decadent society to escape the trap of repetition.
But more important, the fact that both men are promising the implausible or the impossible -- and the fact that Trump is openly contemptuous of our ragged republican norms -- is a reminder that there are worse things than decadence, grimmer possibilities for the future than drift and repetition.
The disappointment and impatience that people feel in a decadent era is legitimate, even admirable. But the envy of more heroic moments, the desire to just do something to prove your society's vitality -- Invade Iraq to remake the Middle East! Open Germany's borders! Elect Trump or Sanders president! -- can be a very dangerous sensibility.
There are pathways up from decadence. But there are more roads leading down.

Full text:   The American economy finished the year on a flat note, much as it started 2015, stoking concern about its vulnerability in the months ahead to turmoil in China and elsewhere in the global economy.
But most economists expect activity to rebound as the year unfolds and continue to grind out steady but hardly spectacular growth.
Over all, the economy expanded at an annual rate of just 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Commerce Department said Friday.
It could have been worse: Ahead of the report, a few economists on Wall Street predicted that the economy might have contracted last quarter, while others forecast no growth.
As it turned out, the slowdown was brought on by anemic sales of durable goods like cars and appliances, a weaker trade picture caused by the stronger dollar and falling business investment and shrinking inventories. But consumer spending overall was healthy, and services held up better, underscoring how domestically driven sectors are faring much better than industries that depend on overseas demand.
For all of 2015, the economy grew 2.4 percent, identical to the tempo recorded in 2014 and considerably better than the 1.5 percent gain for 2013.
"There is noise from quarter to quarter, but we're still in that 2.5 percent growth environment," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
"This year is going to look a lot like the past couple of years," said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. "Growth in 2016 will be good but not great."
He predicted that steady hiring and falling unemployment would prompt better wage gains than most Americans have seen so far in the six-and-a-half-year-old recovery.
"We will see workers getting more of the benefits from economic growth in 2016," he said. "Together with rising wages, more hiring will allow consumers to continue to spend, and that will be more than enough to power through weakness from trade and the stronger dollar."
Despite the lackluster numbers for gross domestic product, by other yardsticks the economy looks considerably healthier.
The unemployment rate now stands at 5 percent and most experts forecast that it will keep falling. Employers added an average of nearly 300,000 positions a month in October, November and December.
The real estate market, the principal investment asset for most American families, has held up well, despite the recent sell-off on Wall Street and turmoil in overseas markets.
And last month, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, a sign that policy makers think the economy is strong enough to withstand a gradual tightening of monetary policy over the next couple of years.
On Wednesday, the Fed held off on another interest rate increase after a two-day meeting, but in a statement, officials indicated they would weigh another increase when policy makers next meet, in March.
While the muted report was not a surprise, it will most likely influence the way the Fed thinks about future rate increases, Mr. Clemons predicted.
"I think this takes another rate hike off the table for the first half of 2016," he said. "The continued improvement in the labor market allows the Fed to think about raising rates, but the lack of inflation means they're not required to act. They can have their cake and eat it, too."
Other economists, though, are still looking for at least one rate increase during the first half of the year, possibly as early as March.
Friday's report is the first of three estimates the Commerce Department will make for growth in gross domestic product, and as more data comes in, the figure could be revised. The next estimate will be released on Feb. 26.
In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan survey of consumer confidence showed a slight drop in sentiment from the initial estimate for January, but the outlook remained healthy by historical standards.
One headwind for the economy has been a slower accumulation of inventories, which reduced growth by nearly half a percentage point last quarter. After big increases in goods at warehouses and on store shelves lifted growth in the middle of the year, "there was some payback in the fourth quarter," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm.
"That affects top-line growth but doesn't really say so much about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy," he added.
Looking ahead, Mr. Behravesh expects the economy to expand at a rate of about 2.5 percent in the first half of 2016, with the unemployment rate continuing to fall and companies delivering higher pay increases to help hold on to employees and attract new workers in a tighter labor market.
"I think it's entirely possible we could see unemployment fall to 4.5 percent by the end of the year," he said.
Still, expectations for the coming quarters have been drifting lower as weaker data for the fourth quarter of 2015 has accumulated in recent weeks.
Big business has been noticeably cautious to invest, despite healthy profits in many industries. The strong dollar and weakness in Asia and Europe have hurt many manufacturers, commodity producers and other exporters, especially in the Midwest.
At the same time, the plunge in oil prices has prompted drastic cuts in spending on energy exploration and production, creating another negative for business.
Steel companies and other manufacturers that supply metal pipe and other equipment to drillers have felt the chill as oil prices dived below $30 a barrel this month. Crude has rebounded slightly, and the American benchmark now stands at about $34 a barrel.
One mystery for economists has been why lower oil prices have not done more to stimulate more consumer spending.
One explanation is that Americans are saving a substantial portion of the windfall at the gas pump or using it to pay down debt, which ultimately benefits the economy even if it represents a drag in the short term.
Another possibility is that consumers remain skeptical about how long gasoline prices will stay below $2 a gallon on average, the lowest they have been since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008.
Nonetheless, consumer demand rose at a decent rate, 2.2 percent last quarter, to provide some forward motion. Government spending also helped.
"There are definitely problem areas," Mr. Behravesh said, "but consumer spending, housing and the nonenergy parts of capital spending are still fairly solid."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve entered 2016 with a fairly straightforward plan to gradually increase its benchmark interest rate so long as job growth remained strong.
On Wednesday, it indicated that the plan remained intact. In a statement issued after a meeting of its policy-making committee, the Fed said that it was worried about weak global growth and wobbly financial markets, but it made clear that it still expected to raise interest rates "gradually."
The Fed did not raise its benchmark rate at this meeting, pausing as expected after increasing rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis. But the statement suggested officials were weighing a second increase as soon as its next meeting in March.
"I still think they are going to raise rates in March," said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at PNC Bank. "I don't want to oversell it, but I think that while what goes on overseas has an impact on the U.S. economy, what's much more important is what goes on domestically."
In response to the Fed announcement, equity markets fell broadly on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.1 percent to close at 1,882.95. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 2 percent.
The Fed decided to start raising rates in December after a seven-year stimulus campaign because officials judged the economy was gaining strength. Low interest rates encourage borrowing and risk-taking, contributing to faster growth. Officials said they expected to raise rates by about a percentage point in 2016 to gradually reduce those incentives.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said after the December announcement that "the economic recovery has clearly come a long way, although it is not complete."
The new policy statement suggested that the Fed's confidence in the economic outlook had since deteriorated.
In December, it described the chances of faster and slower growth as "balanced." This time, the Fed reserved judgment. "The committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook," the statement said.
The Fed noted that some economic measuring sticks were doing well, like continued job growth, more spending by businesses and consumers and the revival of the housing market.
On the other hand, it said domestic economic growth apparently slowed in the final months of 2015. Equity markets have fallen sharply in January, erasing wealth and weighing on confidence, while the dollar continues to gain strength, limiting demand for American exports.
Forecasters estimate the economy expanded at an annual rate below 1 percent in the last three months of 2015. The government will publish a preliminary estimate on Friday.
The weakness and the risk that things will get worse have persuaded some analysts that the Fed is unlikely to raise rates again until the summer, or perhaps even later.
"Based on the state of the economy today, we believe the bar has become insurmountable for a follow-up rate hike in March," Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote on Wednesday. Ms. Zentner noted that investors were betting against a March increase, based on the price of assets tied closely to short-term interest rates, and she said it was significant that the Fed had made little effort to alter those expectations.
But Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, cautioned this month that market expectations were overly pessimistic. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and, like Mr. Fischer, a close adviser to Ms. Yellen, also suggested in a mid-January speech that investors were leaping to conclusions.
"In terms of the economic outlook, the situation does not appear to have changed much since the last F.O.M.C. meeting," Mr. Dudley said in the speech, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making committee.
Mr. Dudley also emphasized the Fed's focus on job growth. Officials expect inflation to increase as labor market conditions improve. They are raising interest rates before that happens because monetary policy exerts a gradual influence on economic conditions, and they are concerned that inflation will begin to rise too quickly. Mr. Dudley said that when the Fed needed to regain control of inflation, it generally ended up causing a recession.
One question mark for the Fed is the impact of global weakness on the domestic economy.
Some officials see little evidence that slow growth in the rest of the developed world, and problems in China and other developing nations, will interfere significantly with domestic growth. The United States, after all, is by far the largest consumer of its own goods.
Others, however, argue that the risks are being understated. The divergence between the United States and its major trading partners has increased the value of the dollar, reducing demand for exports like manufactured products and farm goods. Worries about global growth have unsettled equity markets, taking a bite out of household savings.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said it made sense for the Fed to avoid coming to a conclusion in Wednesday's statement.
"The current uncertainty over the global outlook and what it means for the U.S. economy is not easily susceptible to measurement," he wrote, adding the Fed might go ahead with another rate increase in March, but was more likely to wait until June. "We think this language buys them time."
The Fed also is wrestling with the persistent sluggishness of inflation, both a symptom of the broader weakness of the economy and an economic problem in its own right.
The Fed aims to keep prices rising at about 2 percent a year, but it has consistently fallen short since the recession that lasted from the end of 2007 to the middle of 2009. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, which excludes food and energy prices because they are volatile, rose 1.3 percent during the 12 months through November, the most recent available data.
Public expectations about future inflation also are eroding, a problem because those expectations help to shape reality. People who expect prices to rise more quickly may press for higher wages, which can lead to higher prices as businesses compensate for payroll increases. That pressure may now be flowing in the opposite direction. A regular consumer survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found expectations of inflation in three years' time had declined to 2.8 percent from 3.3 percent over the last two years.
The Fed reiterated Wednesday that it wanted to see "actual and expected progress" toward its 2 percent goal as it considers further interest rate increases. But the central bank also said it remained confident that inflation would begin to rise "as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further."
Wednesday's decision to hold rates steady, in a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent, was made unanimously by the 10-member committee. The Fed said everyone was able to attend the meeting in person despite the weekend snowstorm in Washington.

Full text:   CIUDAD MIRANDA, Venezuela -- Twenty thousand people live in this concrete bastion built by President Hugo Chávez. He gave them the keys, and they gave him their votes.
There was one thing Mr. Chávez promised but never handed over en masse, though: the property titles that would allow his supporters to sell their homes and cash out.
But now that Mr. Chávez's old adversaries have taken over Venezuela's Parliament, they are adopting the tactic and doing it one better. They want to give away the deeds to hundreds of thousands of homes that Mr. Chávez and his movement built -- and win the loyalties of the nation's poor for years to come.
The handover is as big as just about any of the Socialist-inspired giveaways Mr. Chávez ever orchestrated, and it comes with an incongruous twist. For years, the opposition cried foul over Mr. Chávez's tendency to use the spoils of Venezuela's oil wealth to hand out housing, calling it an obvious ploy to buy votes.
Now the new leaders are drawing from the same populist playbook that they made their name criticizing, a telling sign that the strategy of winning trust through government largess has not gone away.
"The opposition is trying to imitate the popular aspects of Chavismo," said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, referring to Mr. Chávez's political movement.
Having taken power in the National Assembly this month for the first time in 16 years, Mr. Chávez's opponents quickly carted away the portraits of him from the Capitol, drafted a proposal to free politicians jailed by the government and even threatened to recall President Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez's loyal successor.
But the country's disastrous economy is adding to the pressure on the lawmakers to do something popular. The International Monetary Fund is expecting inflation of 720 percent a year in Venezuela, and rampant food shortages create hourslong lines at stores. The price of oil, the country's lifeblood, has collapsed. With Mr. Maduro in the presidency, the legislature has no control over economic policy.
And so the lawmakers have turned to the hundreds of thousands of homes that Mr. Chávez and his followers built.
The question of who controls the titles to the homes goes well beyond a one-time giveaway. Mr. Chávez, who died of cancer in 2013, turned petroleum dollars into concrete, setting off an experiment of moving Venezuela's poor from slums into high-rises. Mr. Maduro has followed in his predecessor's footsteps, but even governments before Mr. Chávez's courted voters with homes.
"It gets at the heart of what the economic model should be in Venezuela," said David Smilde, a sociologist at Tulane University who lives in Caracas, the capital. "Should it be about poor people deciding what to do with their own property, or should it be about the government ultimately making the decisions?"
Julio Borges, the legislator who is drafting the law, argues that the homes will give capital to the poor for the first time, drive activity to help ease Venezuela's economic crisis, and let the poor determine their own fates from now on.
"People had been treated like they were children," he said. "With this law you can make a sale and give an inheritance, something you can't do now."
Maduro supporters see any proposal to transfer the titles as snake oil, a blatant attempt to claim credit for a vast store of homes built as public property.
"We gave people dignified housing," said Darío Vivas, a legislator in Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party. "Julio Borges and the opposition haven't built one home."
Mr. Vivas argued that the government had already delivered on its promise to hand over property titles, a position widely held by leftists. But many experts countered that if the government ever gave deeds to the homes, it was most likely only in a few cases and that most residents do not have titles.
In a fiery State of the Union address before legislators this month, Mr. Maduro vowed to do what he could to block his opponents' work.
"You will have to topple me first to approve a privatization law," he said to the applause of leftists.
Here in Ciudad Miranda, about an hour's drive from Caracas, Coromoto Carmona, 40 and unemployed, looked out a window that was laden with bars. She told the story of how she got her home here and how it has become a place where she feels trapped.
Ms. Carmona lost her first home in a deadly mudslide in 1999 and spent five years bouncing between government-run shelters. In 2004, she received a thrilling call from the government: She would attend a meeting at Mr. Chávez's presidential mansion, La Casona, where he would personally award her a new home.
She moved into her two-bedroom home with nine members of her family. But problems soon emerged. Ms. Carmona realized there were no places to buy groceries, few schools and no public spaces for residents. These days, there is water for only four hours once a week.
Mr. Chávez's government had promised her and others the titles to their homes. But Ms. Carmona received only a laminated piece of paper saying she was allowed to live there. If she leaves, it is unclear if she will be able to find anywhere else to live.
"It's like jail here," she said.
Franco Micucci, an architect who worked on Ciudad Miranda, says its social problems are not unique and will be as much a challenge to Venezuela's new leaders as they were to Mr. Chávez's movement. He says that he and colleagues originally drew up plans for public spaces and services like schools and grocery stores for residents at Ciudad Miranda. But the government built only the homes.
"I'm not surprised residents want to leave that place," he said. "Me and many architects were optimistic," but in the end "Ciudad Miranda is like 'Ciudad de Dios,"' he added, using the Spanish name for "City of God," a Brazilian film about the drug-ridden slums of Rio de Janeiro.
Residents of Ciudad Miranda say the area is now run by armed gangs, known locally as colectivos, that are aligned with Mr. Maduro's party. Despite losing its majority in the legislature, the president's party won in Ciudad Miranda.
Yoni Iriarte, a 26-year-old opposition activist, said he was threatened during a get-out-the-vote campaign by members of colectivos who surrounded him on motorcycles.
"They told me, 'The government will take away your house,"' he said. Other residents in the neighborhood, including Ms. Carmona, reported receiving similar threats.
Mr. Iriarte said that being granted the title to his house would allow him to vote freely.
"If there is no blackmail of the government revoking my home, then I can vote for whomever I want, no matter who happens to be president at the time," he said.
Ricardo Hausmann, a Harvard economist who worked for the government in the 1990s, sees other benefits, too.
By creating homeownership for Venezuela's poor, lawmakers would create capital for those who did not have it, something that could lead to long-term social mobility.
"Having property rights means you have an asset, you are empowered," he said, referring to past projects that did the same with Argentine public housing. "The effects are huge: You save, you invest, you improve your home."
Mr. Rodríguez, of Bank of America, was more cautious. He cited land redistribution plans after the Mexican Revolution in which peasants were given the titles to small plots and eventually the ability to sell them. In the end, many of the plots were bought up by big owners, something he says might happen with the Venezuelan apartments.
"If you allow people to sell without restrictions, you can create new problems," he said.
Marquesa Alcendra, 68, wants to sell. After losing her house to a mudslide and bouncing for years between temporary shelters -- and even, for a time, an unfinished skyscraper called the Tower of David that was occupied by squatters -- she was given a home in Ciudad Tiuna, a housing project that Mr. Chávez erected in a vast Caracas military base.
At first glance, the high-rises look idyllic: new towers with two-bedroom apartments, elevators and common areas. Outside, residents played a game of pickup soccer with a group of workers from China who are executing contracts for a raft of new buildings under construction.
Yet Ms. Alcendra says the only place to buy food is a black market store that sells basic goods for far more than the government-controlled prices. She has boarded up her windows, fearing robbery. And though soldiers from the base guard the entrance to the complex, she says it is her neighbors whom she fears.
"My life was better before," she said.
Not everyone feels this way, not least the most loyal supporters of Mr. Chávez, who retains a cultlike following even after his death almost three years ago.
"I went from living in a slum high on a hill 500 stair steps up, where we only had access to water once a month, to here where I have everything," said Daniel Velázquez, an activist showing off his home built in a government housing project in Bellas Artes, Caracas's downtown museum district.
"Here I have services -- like water, electricity and a phone," he said. "Everyone always talks about how much their life has changed since moving here."
In the other room, his wife, Ana, cooked arepas in a kitchen with pans neatly hung on the wall. She was not interested in the opposition's plan to give her a title to the home.
"It is like they are trying to make us forget about Chávez," she said. "Like how they took down his pictures in the National Assembly. But they can't make us forget him. They can't take down the hundreds of buildings he built."

Abstract: In November, C. Fred Bergsten, former head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued that the euro and Japanese yen were sharply undervalued against the dollar, and urged policy makers to pursue a rerun of the deal struck by the Reagan administration and America's chief trading partners at the Plaza Hotel in New York in 1985, when they agreed to coordinate their actions to weaken the value of the dollar.

Full text:   Just the other day I got an email in which Ron Paul, libertarian icon, former member of Congress from Texas and father of the Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, eagerly proclaimed that his "final prediction of a dollar collapse is about to become reality."
The email was a bit extreme, perhaps, with references to the hyperinflation of Weimar Germany, Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe and the Book of Genesis. But Mr. Paul's dire premonition fits within an overarching Republican proposition that the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve are relentlessly undermining the American economy.
Other, more serene analysts have also predicted a weak dollar. Martin Feldstein, who was a top economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, argued some five years ago that the country's large trade deficit and ultralow interest rates, coupled with sales of United States assets by international investors and changes in the Chinese economy, would push the dollar down over coming years.
They were exactly wrong. The dollar's rise, which started virtually the day Professor Feldstein made his prediction in 2011, shows little sign of abating. It amounts to only the third instance of such consistent appreciation since Richard Nixon took the United States off the gold standard in 1971.
The American economy might just be bumbling along, but it is doing substantially better than the rest of the advanced industrial world. "It is quite natural," said Barry Eichengreen of the University of California, Berkeley, "that the currency of the country whose economy is least bad should have the least worst currency."
But with many developing economies in a tailspin, commodity prices and stock markets tumbling sharply around the world, could a rising dollar damage a fragile economic order?
Many economists argue it is mostly a good thing. A strong dollar should help Europe and Japan overcome their deeper economic weaknesses by making their products cheaper on world markets -- an overall positive for global growth. The strengthening of the dollar, Olivier Blanchard, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, told me, "is a fundamentally healthy process."
But there are reasons to be cautious. A strong dollar will squeeze American manufacturers, which have otherwise benefited from falling energy prices and rising wages in China. That will weigh on growth in the United States and further suppress inflation, which is already well below the Fed's target.
Stanley Fischer, the Fed vice chairman, said in a speech in November that, according to the central bank's models, a 15 percent rise in the dollar could cumulatively trim almost 2.5 percentage points off gross domestic product after three years, if its rise did not turn around and it was not offset by easier monetary policy or more public spending. And it could reduce 2015 inflation by as much as half a percentage point.
This has prompted some calls for corrective action. In November, C. Fred Bergsten, former head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued that the euro and Japanese yen were sharply undervalued against the dollar, and urged policy makers to pursue a rerun of the deal struck by the Reagan administration and America's chief trading partners at the Plaza Hotel in New York in 1985, when they agreed to coordinate their actions to weaken the value of the dollar.
And the effects in the United States are not the principal worry.
Federal Reserve officials can get cranky when foreigners criticize their policies. The Fed was accused of starting a "currency war" when quantitative easing sent the dollar sharply lower. Now it is criticized when interest rates and the dollar are going up.
And yet the critique, articulated most forcefully by Raghuram Rajan, the governor of India's central bank, has merit. That's because these swings, even when justified by the needs of the American economy, can induce enormous volatility around the world.
Superlow interest rates in the United States sent money streaming into emerging markets, where returns were higher, leading them to amass lots of dollar debt. An appreciating dollar makes this debt more difficult to manage, especially as the prices of the commodities these countries export fall.
Policy makers in developing countries can remember the last two times the dollar went through periods of sharp appreciation. There was the first half of the 1980s, when Latin America fell into what is remembered today as the "lost decade," and the second half of the 1990s, when much of Asia ended up underwater. The memories aren't pleasant.
The added factor today is the new role of China in the global economy, since it is now a significant presence, with a currency that is no longer as insulated from outside forces as it was in the previous two episodes.
The dollar's appreciation has rekindled populist attacks against Beijing, from Senator Chuck Schumer's repeated accusations of currency manipulation to Donald Trump's promise to levy a 45 percent tax on imports from China.
The attacks are wrong. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund no longer deems China's currency, the renminbi, undervalued. Actually, China's currency has been mostly rising along with the dollar against the currencies of its other trading partners, squeezing an already slowing economy.
Beijing is in a pickle. Last summer, the Chinese government tried Washington's prescription: to let market forces play a bigger role in determining the exchange rate. But then the renminbi fell, producing the expected populist complaints from the United States. What's more, Chinese savers dashed to send their money out of the country, frightened that the currency could be on the cusp of a long slide.
The rising dollar "complicates policy management," in China, said Eswar S. Prasad, a former head of the I.M.F.'s China division who teaches at Cornell University. "If the renminbi were to drop by a couple of percentage points, the implication would be that the central bank wants a much cheaper currency, which would lead to more capital outflows."
Professor Prasad, like most economists, says he believes the dollar's gain is benign. "The United States is the only country whose currency can appreciate like this without its economy suffering badly," he said. "This is something of a blessing for the world."
And yet he allows for a kink in the analysis.
Remember the financial crisis, visited upon the world by the American housing market and its banks? Despite being at the center of the disaster, the dollar didn't weaken but instead strengthened. Gripped by abject fear, investors could think of nowhere else to run.
The dollar has gone haywire before. In the two years before the Plaza Accord, it continued to soar even after the Fed chairman at the time, Paul Volcker, relaxed his grip on interest rates. The misalignment led to devastation in the Rust Belt, helped lay the groundwork for the Japanese bubble and fostered enormous trade imbalances.
Today perhaps it is safe to say the dollar is driven mostly by natural forces that should reverse when growth picks up elsewhere in the world. But in this choppy world economy it would be foolhardy to ignore one of the main forces driving financial flows through history: irrationality.

Abstract: Even with that big gain, however, its shares are down 10 percent over the last 12 months. 3M, which makes industrial coatings and ceramics, reported a greater profit and also beat analysts' expectations. When yields on longer-term bonds like the 10-year bond fall toward the yield on short-term bonds, it signals that investor expectations for future growth have dimmed.

Full text:   Stocks jumped on Tuesday as the price of oil made another abrupt reversal, this time rising almost 4 percent after having fallen sharply the day before.
Energy stocks climbed along with the price of oil, and Chevron and Exxon Mobil made major gains.
Strong fourth-quarter results from the beleaguered wireless provider Sprint gave telecom stocks a lift.
Quarterly earnings also sent other stocks higher, including the Post-it Notes maker 3M; Procter & Gamble, which makes Crest toothpaste; and the luxury handbag maker Coach.
The Dow Jones industrial average increased 282.01 points, or 1.8 percent, to 16,167.23, its best day since early December. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 26.55 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,903.63. The Nasdaq composite index added 49.18 points, or 1.1 percent, to 4,567.67.
The price of United States crude rose $1.11, or 3.7 percent, to close at $31.45 a barrel in New York. It fell almost 6 percent on Monday. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, rose $1.30, or 4.3 percent, to $31.80 a barrel in London. Despite the rebound, United States crude is down almost 18 percent this month.
Exxon Mobil shares were up $2.72, or 3.7 percent, to $76.70, and Chevron shares rose $3.23, or 4 percent, to $84.12.
The shares of Weight Watchers International soared 20 percent after a new commercial starring Oprah Winfrey aired, in which she says she has lost 26 pounds using the weight-loss company's plan.
Ms. Winfrey bought a 10 percent stake in Weight Watchers in October, and since then the stock is up more than 90 percent.
Procter & Gamble reported a larger profit in the fourth quarter as it raised prices and cut costs. Shares of the maker of Pantene shampoo, Crest toothpaste and Charmin toilet paper added $1.96, or 2.6 percent, to $78.81.
Coach reported a greater profit than analysts had expected, and its stock rose $2.98, or 9.8 percent, to $33.33. Even with that big gain, however, its shares are down 10 percent over the last 12 months.
3M, which makes industrial coatings and ceramics, reported a greater profit and also beat analysts' expectations. Shares rose $7.21, or 5.2 percent, to $144.78.
Huntington Bancshares agreed to buy a competitor, FirstMerit, for $3.4 billion. The deal would create the largest bank in Ohio, and the companies would have about $100 billion in combined assets. FirstMerit shares added $2.82, or 18.3 percent, to $18.19, and Huntington shares lost 75 cents, or 8.5 percent, to $8.05.
Sprint, the fourth-largest wireless provider in the United States, posted a smaller loss in its third quarter and said its aggressive promotions attracted more users. The company raised its outlook for the year.
Sprint's stock rose 47 cents, or 18.7 percent, to $2.99. The stock, which hit a nominal low last Wednesday, has been on a wild ride the last few days, jumping almost 15 percent on Friday and then falling 12 percent on Monday, when Sprint said it had cut about 2,500 jobs since last fall, or 8 percent of its staff.
Other telecom stocks also rose on Tuesday. Shares of Verizon Communications gained $1.22, or 2.6 percent, to $48.25.
While the market made broad gains and undid most of Monday's losses, it is still down substantially this year, and there are signs investors have big worries about the global economy.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2 percent from 2.01 percent, and the yield on the two-year Treasury note dipped to 0.84 percent from 0.86 percent. In the last week the yields on those two bonds have gotten closer than they've been since June 2008, a sign that investors are concerned about economic growth.
"Fear is the biggest driver," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist for Janney. Mr. LeBas said investors were also anticipating weaker inflation and thought the Federal Reserve would be more cautious about raising interest rates because the market has experienced so much turmoil this month.
United States government bonds become more popular with investors when the economy looks shaky because the government is extremely likely to make good on its debt. Investors are willing to accept lower interest payments when they are concerned about safety.
When yields on longer-term bonds like the 10-year bond fall toward the yield on short-term bonds, it signals that investor expectations for future growth have dimmed.
The CAC 40 in France rose 1.1 percent, and the DAX in Germany went up 0.9 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain gained 0.6 percent. Asian markets, however, were hammered by Monday's slide in oil prices, which can signal weak demand. The Shanghai composite dropped 6.4 percent to finish at 2,749.78, the lowest since December 2014. The Nikkei 225 in Japan lost 2.4 percent to 16,708.90.
Gold rose $15.50 to $1,121.70 an ounce, and silver gained 31 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $14.564 an ounce. Copper increased 1.9 cents to $2.158 a pound.
The price of gold has risen 5.8 percent this year. Only 13 stocks in the S&P 500 have made a bigger gain.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 1.7 cents to $1.047 a gallon, and heating oil gained 3.2 cents, or 3.5 percent, to 96.8 cents. Natural gas added 2.2 cents to $2.18 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The euro edged up to $1.0857 from $1.0853, and the dollar rose to 118.43 yen from 118.28 late Monday.

Full text:   IT has become part of the accepted history of our time: The bursting of the housing bubble was the primary cause of a financial crisis, a sharp recession and prolonged slow growth. The story makes intuitive sense, since the economic crisis included a collapse in the prices of housing and related securities. The movie "The Big Short," which is based on a book by Michael Lewis, takes this cause-and-effect relationship as a given.
But there is an alternative story. In recent months, Senator Ted Cruz has become the most prominent politician to give voice to the theory that the Federal Reserve caused the crisis by tightening monetary policy in 2008. While Mr. Cruz (who is an old friend of one of the authors of this article) has been criticized for making this claim, he shouldn't back down. He's right, and our understanding of the great recession needs to be revised.
What the housing-centric view underemphasizes is that the housing bust started in early 2006, more than two years before the economic crisis. In 2006 and 2007, construction employment fell, but overall employment continued to grow, as did the economy generally. Money and labor merely shifted from housing to other sectors of the economy.
This housing decline caused financial stress by sowing uncertainty about the value of bonds backed by subprime mortgages. These bonds served as collateral for institutional investors who parked their money overnight with financial firms on Wall Street in the "shadow banking" system. As their concerns about the bonds grew, investors began to pull money out of this system.
In retrospect, economists have concluded that a recession began in December 2007. But this recession started very mildly. Through early 2008, even as investors kept pulling money out of the shadow banks, key economic indicators such as inflation and nominal spending -- the total amount of dollars being spent throughout the economy -- barely budged. It looked as if the economy would be relatively unscathed, as many forecasters were saying at the time. The problem was manageable: According to Gary Gorton, an economist at Yale, roughly 6 percent of banking assets were tied to subprime mortgages in 2007.
It took a bigger shock to the economy to bring the financial system down. That shock was tighter money. Through acts and omissions, the Fed kept interest rates and expected interest rates higher than appropriate, depressing the economy. This point is easy to miss because the Fed lowered interest rates between September 2007 and April 2008. But raising rates is not the only route to tighter money.
Between late April and early October, the Fed kept the interest rate over which it has most direct control, the federal funds rate, at 2 percent. But when the economy weakens, the "natural" interest rate -- the rate that keeps the economy on an even keel -- falls. By staying in place, the Fed's target interest rate was rising relative to that natural rate. The gap between expected interest rates and the natural rate was rising even more. Fed officials spent the late spring and summer of 2008 warning that rates would have to rise to combat inflation. Futures markets showed a sharp increase in expected interest rates.
Market indicators of expected inflation fell sharply that summer, a sign that the economy was getting weaker and monetary policy tighter. Nominal spending showed the change. After growing for years at a relatively steady rate, it began to drop.
In their early August meeting, some Fed policy makers nonetheless anticipated that they would raise rates soon. Inflation expectations and nominal spending kept falling. In mid-September, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Fed refused to cut interest rates further, citing the risk of inflation. (To his credit, Chairman Ben Bernanke subsequently admitted that not cutting rates then was a mistake.) It did not cut rates until weeks after the crisis had become undeniable.
It was against this backdrop of tighter money that the financial stress of 2007 turned into something far worse in 2008. With nominal spending falling at the fastest rate since the Depression, households, businesses and banks all had incomes lower than they had expected. That made servicing debts and paying wages harder than expected. It also lowered asset values, since those were premised on expected streams of future income.
And, of course, the crashing economy made the housing crisis worse, too. That's why the standard account of the crisis took hold. It's true, after all, that housing fell and then, along with the economy, plummeted. Untangling cause and effect is tricky. But the timeline is a better match for the theory that the Fed is to blame. The economy started to tank not right after housing began to fall, but right after money tightened.
We could have had a decline in housing without a Great Recession. That's what we went through for two years. What we could not have had without a Great Recession was a decline in nominal spending. If it had cut rates faster, or merely refrained from talking up future rate increases, the Fed might have kept that decline from happening or at least moderated it. Australia had a housing boom and debt bubble, too, but kept a steadier monetary policy. The consequence was a mild correction, but nothing like our Great Recession.
It took decades for the Fed's responsibility for the Great Depression to be widely accepted and it may take that long for most people to see its responsibility this time around. The Fed of 2008 feared inflation too much and recession too little. It placed too little weight on market expectations about future conditions and on how its behavior affected those expectations. If these mistakes go unrecognized, they could well be repeated.

Abstract: The wage picture looks even worse. Since January 2009, inflation-adjusted private sector wages across the economy have risen by 2.5 percent.

Full text:   A FEW days ago, I visited the shiny headquarters of the Peterson Institute for International Economics on "think tank row" in Washington -- basically, the locker room of the Team Globalization and Free Trade cheering squad.
I was there to take part in a discussion of an old friend's outstanding book on the subject, Steven R. Weisman's "The Great Tradeoff: Confronting Moral Conflicts in the Era of Globalization."
After praising Steve's book, I emphasized that I had paid attention in economics class and understood that globalization incontrovertibly has benefited not only the world but also the United States. That's in part because trade permits Americans to buy goods at lower prices; the added purchasing power helps our economy expand faster.
But I soon pivoted to my experience working in the Obama administration on the auto rescue, an experience that had seared into me the sense that intermingled among the many winners from globalization were a substantial number of losers.
So far, so good. Then I went rogue and uttered two blasphemous words: "Ross Perot." He had a point, I said heretically, when he campaigned in 1992 against the landmark North American Free Trade Agreement, saying that it would result in a "giant sucking sound" of jobs headed south to Mexico.
A cool breeze drifted toward me.
As I looked out at my audience, I realized that the room was filled with winners -- folks who, from all appearances, earned their livings from intellectual labor. Neither their jobs nor their wages were in jeopardy as countries ranging from Vietnam to Colombia became more competitive with us.
I pressed on.
Last year, according to the recent figures, our nation added 2.65 million new jobs. Just 30,000 of them were in manufacturing. So much for the widely trumpeted renaissance of Made in America.
At first glance, the automobile industry looks to be in better shape. From the depths of the crisis in 2009 through 2013, employment in the auto manufacturing sector in the United States rose by 23 percent, to 690,000 from 560,000.
That sounds pretty good, I said, except that employment in the Mexican auto sector rose to 589,000 from 368,000 during the same period, an increase of 60 percent. I'm happy that 221,000 more Mexicans got jobs, but let's be honest: Absent open borders, many of those jobs would have been in America.
The wage picture looks even worse. Since January 2009, inflation-adjusted private sector wages across the economy have risen by 2.5 percent. In the fields of education, health and information, they are up by more than 3 percent. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, pay has fallen by 0.8 percent, and in the auto sector, by 12.7 percent.
"Last point," I said to the 100 or so guests: Average manufacturing compensation costs (includes wages and benefits) in the United States in 2012 were $35.67 per hour; in Mexico, they were $6.36 per hour. "And American auto executives will tell you that the productivity they get in Mexico is at least as good as what they get in the United States."
My central argument was not that we should close our borders or retreat from the world; it was that we need to be sensitive to the losers and try to help. The point -- well illustrated in Steve's book -- is that globalization is not only an economic matter but also a moral one.
Presently, the institute's blunt director, Adam Posen, used his final moments to shut me down, declaring that the "fetishization" of any industry was "immoral." The problem of manufacturing is technology, he declared flatly.
Blaming technology is a common refrain from economists who hate the thought that globalization is not the world's unambiguous salvation.
Sorry, Adam, I thought silently, having been afforded no time to respond. If technology were the source of manufacturing workers' woes, productivity would be rising sharply, which it surely isn't (notwithstanding claims by some economists that official statistics have been understating efficiency gains).
"Don't blame the robots for lost manufacturing jobs," read the headline in a blog post last spring by two scholars at the venerable Brookings Institution.
I have never forgotten a powerful article I read in Foreign Affairs in 2007 that called for huge tax redistribution, both as a moral matter and as a mechanism for ensuring political support for free trade. (The authors were hardly left-wing shills -- one had served in the administration of President George W. Bush.)
That still sounds like the right idea to me.
It's not only morally wrong to fail to help those on the losing end of globalization, but it will also end badly politically, as the ascendant candidacy of Donald J. Trump illustrates.

Abstract: The efforts seemed unnecessary: Since 2013, tens of thousands of Egyptians have been jailed, including journalists and secular activists; the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood is in exile or in prison; and many ordinary Egyptians say they are too weary, or fearful, to take to the streets again.

Full text:   CAIRO -- The few dozen protesters seemed to emerge from nowhere, surging down a narrow street and waving a four-finger salute that identified them as likely supporters of Egypt's outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.
"Down with the tyrant!" they chanted against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
After 10 minutes, three bursts of fireworks signaled to the protesters to disperse. "We are being followed," said one man as he scurried down the street in Cairo's Shubra al-Kheima neighborhood.
Barely a minute later, young men on motorbikes roared down the street, giving chase. They cornered one protester and started beating him.
That was how some Egyptians marked the fifth anniversary on Monday of the start of the uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak: A handful of flash protests, like the one in Shubra al-Kheima, sought to harness the commitment of the embattled opposition; Mr. Sisi's government and its strong-arm supporters proved they were even more determined.
Thousands of police officers patrolled the streets of Cairo and public squares, and a crackdown by security forces leading up to Monday's anniversary saw civil society activists rounded up, art houses closed and the administrators of opposition Facebook pages detained.
The efforts seemed unnecessary: Since 2013, tens of thousands of Egyptians have been jailed, including journalists and secular activists; the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood is in exile or in prison; and many ordinary Egyptians say they are too weary, or fearful, to take to the streets again.
The only permitted demonstration took place at Tahrir Square, the focal point of the popular uprising against Mr. Mubarak in 2011, where a few hundred government supporters gathered on Monday in chilly winter weather to wave Egyptian flags and cheer for Mr. Sisi, one of Mr. Mubarak's former generals. Instead of battling the police, as people had done five years ago, they took selfies with officers and presented them with roses.
Several people said that, after years of wrenching political turmoil, they were grateful for the stability that Mr. Sisi had brought. "We were sad about the destruction that was taking place," said Sawsan Hasan, a grandmother who traveled 140 miles from Minya, south of Cairo, to the capital with eight of her family members. "Things are starting to get better."
Other Egyptians in Tahrir Square noted the chaos shaking Arab countries like Syria and neighboring Libya, and railed against perceived Western meddling in Egypt. Several people accused President Obama of secretly supporting the Muslim Brotherhood -- a claim that is frequently aired on Egyptian television.
(Western human rights groups, for their part, say the Obama administration is too indulgent of Mr. Sisi, and the United States should use the $1.3 billion in annual aid to Egypt to encourage political reforms.)
On the fringes of the Tahrir crowd, a small, quiet group had assembled not to celebrate or protest, but to commemorate the bitter disappointments of the 2011 uprising. "I left my flag at home because the demands of the revolution have not been met," said a man who could only identify himself as Bakr before the police moved him along.
There was a small act of protest by one government critic in Tahrir: Sanaa Seif, 21, whose brother is in jail for violating Egypt's harsh protest laws, walked through the square wearing a sweatshirt that read, "It is still the January revolution."
Despite the government's anxiety, the anniversary on Monday passed largely without serious violence. Local news media reported that two people had been killed by security forces in a raid on an apartment in a Cairo. Across the country, police broke up several small protests, mostly led by the Muslim Brotherhood, and officials said they had defused a bomb in the port city of Alexandria.
Five years after the protests that ended his three-decade long rule, Mr. Mubarak remained in his hospital room at the Maadi Military hospital in a Cairo suburb. The legal basis for his stay there is unclear, with him having completed a three-year prison sentence.
Political analysts say Mr. Mubarak's release could embarrass Mr. Sisi, but the president's most immediate challenges are economic. Egypt's weak economy is suffering from inflation, high unemployment and a declining tourist sector crippled by attacks from Islamist insurgents.
By midafternoon Monday in Tahrir Square, the police had decided that they had enough and, forming a human chain, they gently cleared the square by calling out in Arabic "Yalla" -- "Let's go."

Abstract: On Friday, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said the bank had a lot of options to raise inflation, and was determined and willing to act. The company expects its earnings per share to fall this year even though it's selling credit-card accounts tied a co-branded credit card it offers with Costco.

Full text:   Stocks made their biggest gain in more than a month on Friday as oil prices surged again, lifting energy stocks. Tech stocks also climbed as Apple shares had their best day since August.
Energy companies soared as the price of American benchmark crude jumped 9 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 210.83 points, or 1.3 percent, to 16,093.51. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had its best day since early December, gaining 37.91 points, or 2 percent, to 1,906.90. The Nasdaq composite index made its biggest gain since September, adding 119.12 points, or 2.7 percent, to 4,591.18.
The markets rose this week for the first time in four weeks as the prospect of economic stimulus in Europe helped put investors in a buying mood after a dismal beginning to the new year. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index had its best day in four months as investors hoped the Bank of Japan would also step in. Both factors strengthened the dollar.
The gains were a hairpin turn from Wednesday's action, when stocks nose-dived along with energy prices.
While the two-day surge may have investors hoping the worst is behind them, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said he still thinks the S.&P. 500 will slide to around 1,800 before a real recovery comes. "It's going to continue to be a struggle," he said. "Everyone will be convinced we're heading for recession. Everyone will be convinced we're in a bear market."
There was little trace of that view on Friday. American crude rose $2.66 to $32.19 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, rose $2.93, or 10 percent, to $32.18 a barrel in London. The United States oil has climbed 21 percent over the last two days and has recovered about half its losses from earlier in the year.
The pipeline operator Kinder Morgan rose $1.46, or 10.5 percent, to $15.34 after it jumped 16 percent Thursday. Williams, another pipeline company, added $3.70, or 23.1 percent, to $19.74, while Devon Energy gained $1.45, or 6 percent, to $25.63.
Jeffrey Currie, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said energy prices had fallen so far that the industry was making real cuts in production. "We are now at a price level that is creating real fundamental change," he said.
Low energy prices are good for many industries and consumers, but investors have become anxious that they foretell a big slowdown in the global economy. Mr. Currie said it would take a long time for the market to recover, but he noted that energy prices were down because of a supply glut, not because demand was collapsing.
Shares of Apple, which have lost about a quarter of their value in the last six months, rose $5.12, or 5.3 percent, to $101.42. Microsoft gained $1.81, or 4 percent, to $52.29. Facebook added $3.78, or 4 percent, to $97.94 and Alphabet rose $18.79, or 2.6 percent, to $745.46.
On Friday, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said the bank had a lot of options to raise inflation, and was determined and willing to act. On Thursday, he suggested the central bank would consider more stimulus at its meeting in March.
The CAC 40 in France added 3.1 percent and the German DAX rose 2 percent. The FTSE 100 was up 2.2 percent in Britain.
The Nikkei 225 index in Japan rose 5.9 percent. Earlier this week, the index entered a bear market, meaning it was down 20 percent from a recent peak. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 2.1 percent, and in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng added 2.9 percent. The Shanghai composite index in mainland China rose 1.3 percent.
Telecommunications and utilities stocks also rose and turned positive for the year. Both were up 1 percent while the other eight industrial sectors in the S.&P. 500 are still much lower in 2016. Last year, the S.&P. 500 utility index fell 8 percent and telecom stocks fell 2 percent.
Mr. Paulsen of Wells Capital Management said investors turned to utilities and telecom stocks when the market became volatile. Companies in those industries pay relatively large dividends, which means their prices are more stable and the stocks behave almost like bonds. "They are just the most conservative sector of the stock market," he said.
The credit card company American Express continued to experience fallout from its negative outlook for 2016 and 2017 issued late Thursday. The company expects its earnings per share to fall this year even though it's selling credit-card accounts tied a co-branded credit card it offers with Costco. That relationship is ending. Its stock fell $7.58, or 12.1 percent, to $55.06, its biggest loss in almost seven years.
The gold and copper producer Freeport-McMoRan tumbled 39 cents, or 9.1 percent, to $3.94. Its shares have dropped 42 percent in 2016 after huge plunges the previous two years. The company has struggled as metals prices have fallen, and its decision a few years ago to invest in oil and gas came shortly before those prices also buckled. Schlumberger, the largest oil-field services company in the world, said on Thursday that it cut 10,000 jobs in the fourth quarter after eliminating some 20,000 earlier in 2015. But the company simultaneously said it would buy back $10 billion of its stock. The shares rose $3.7, or 6.1 percent, to $65.20 on Friday.
In other energy trading, wholesale gas added 5.3 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $1.084 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 9.8 cents, or 10.9 percent, to 99.6 cents a gallon. Natural gas inched up to $2.139 per 1,000 cubic feet.
United States government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.06 percent from 2.03 percent a day earlier. The price of gold fell $1.90 to $1,096.30 an ounce and silver fell 3.7 cents to $14.06 an ounce. Copper rose 0.6 cents to $2.003 a pound.
The dollar rose to 118.78 yen from 117.50 on Thursday. The euro weakened on the prospect of further stimulus from the European Central Bank. It fell to $1.0791 from $1.0875.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- When a new government-backed investment fund opened five years ago, Moscow wanted to send a simple message: Russia was ready to take the politics out of business.
Authorities signed up a high-powered board of international advisers to oversee its activities, a group that included American private equity executives like David Bonderman of TPG and Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group. In a video on the fund's site, Mr. Bonderman emphasized that the investments in Russia would be "transparent and make commercial decisions, not political decisions."
After the United States and Europe slapped Russia with sanctions over the Ukraine conflict, many board members distanced themselves. And recently, the fund has faced an uncomfortable spotlight over a big investment to a politically connected company. Late last year, the Russian Direct Investment Fund made a $1.75 billion loan to Sibur, a giant petrochemical company with close ties to the Kremlin.
Such concerns have long clouded the investment landscape, that politics play a heavy hand in business. And they have only intensified with the current economic malaise, as the government struggles to deal with weak oil prices and Western sanctions.
One of Sibur's major shareholders, Gennady N. Timchenko, has decades-long ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Timchenko is under United States sanctions as a member of the "inner circle."
Another big owner, Kirill N. Shamalov, is the son of Nikolai T. Shamalov who has similarly received sanctions for his connection to Mr. Putin. Kirill Shamalov is also widely reported in Russian and Western news media to be the son-in-law of Mr. Putin.
"When the economic crisis deepens, and this floats to the surface, it could be a serious blow to Putin," Stanislav A. Belkovsky, a political analyst, said of lending to a figure linked to Mr. Putin's family.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund defends the Sibur deal, saying it follows the fund's investment guidelines. The chief executive, Kirill Dmitriev, in a written statement, characterized the loan as commercially motivated and issued "in line with our established practices."
Mr. Putin, like many Russian officials, refuses to discuss his family or reveal family business activities. Mr. Shamalov has declined to confirm or deny whether he is married to the younger of Mr. Putin's two daughters; a representative for Mr. Shamalov did not respond to written questions. Sibur said in a statement that the company would not comment on "speculation" that a shareholder is a son-in-law of the president and said that shareholders in any case had no role in negotiating financing.
Mr. Shamalov's company, Ladoga Management, declined in a statement to say whether he is a son-in-law of Mr. Putin, asserting that, "like every other person, Kirill Shamalov has the right to privacy."
"The Soviet tradition was the relatives should not be in the public eye," said Mr. Belkovsky, the political analyst.
Former President Dmitri A. Medvedev established the fund in 2011 with the explicit goal of restoring confidence in Russia's investment climate.
Mr. Medvedev wanted to attract overseas investors to the country's companies, and tried to entice them by matching state funds with private capital. The partnership with the state, the theory went, would reduce the investors' worries about the risk of nationalization and arbitrary regulation.
To further shore up support, the fund rounded up prominent investors to serve on the advisory board. Along with the TPG and Blackstone executives, the fund recruited Leon Black of Apollo Global Management; Richard M. Daley, the former mayor of Chicago; Kurt Björklund of Permira; and Chinese and Middle Eastern fund managers.
By lending their names to the fund's advisory board, these financial heavyweights were supposed to ensure that money did not flow to political pet projects. The first wave of deals focused on bread-and-butter investments in companies building out Russia's infrastructure and catering to the middle class.
In a typical investment, the fund and BlackRock in 2012 together poured $50 million into a chain of private hospitals called Mother & Child. With more Russians watching movies, the fund also invested $100 million into a multiplex business, along with Baring Vostok Capital Partners, a Russian private equity company.
But western players backed away after the sanctions targeted the fund's parent bank, Vnesheconombank, a major Russian state-owned bank, in response to Russia's intervention in the eastern Ukraine war. Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Bonderman withdrew their names from the published list of advisers in 2014.
Blackstone and TPG declined to comment about the Russian fund.
With Russia's economy slowing and funding drying up, the government allowed the Russian Direct Investment Fund to tap into the resources of the National Welfare Fund, a sovereign wealth fund that is part of the country's pension system.
In two deals, the Russian Direct Investment Fund helped invest about $800 million of this pension system money into companies building electrical power lines and expanding broadband Internet access to rural areas.
An even bigger investment with Sibur soon followed.
In December, the fund disclosed an investment totaling $5.05 billion for Sibur to build a petrochemical factory in the Siberian city of Tobolsk, to make precursor chemicals for plastics and synthetic rubber.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund and foreign investors, including unspecified Middle Eastern sources and two German funds that tie financing to the export of German industrial goods, raised $3.3 billion. Such moves fulfilled the fund's mandate to raise private sector capital.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund also arranged the $1.75 billion loan from the National Welfare Fund. It was structured as below-market-rate bonds sold to the sovereign wealth fund.
"You can see the conflict of interest here," Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, a former deputy speaker of the Russian Parliament, said in a telephone interview. The National Welfare Fund, he said, is legally obliged to cover pension system deficits like those existing in Russia today because of the oil price slump. Pensions this year will decline relative to inflation.
"The president controls the resources in these funds," Mr. Ryzhkov said, "and if his son-in-law is a part owner of this company, there is a conflict."
Sibur is one of Russia's largest petrochemical companies, processing the country's rich supplies of oil and natural gas into plastic, synthetic rubber and other goods. From an industrial policy perspective, the company's activities help diversify Russia's economy by creating value-added products from its resources.
In a statement announcing the funding, Mr. Dmitriev, the Harvard-trained chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a former Goldman Sachs banker and McKinsey & Company consultant, praised the loan to Sibur as "a milestone in Russian industry and infrastructure development."
But the connection to Mr. Putin has attracted attention, in part because of the veil of secrecy that surrounds his family.
At a news conference on Dec. 17, Mr. Putin faced questions about his two grown daughters. As usual, he declined to disclose details about his family. He denied that his daughters were involved in business, and offered few clues about their activities.
A journalist from RBC, a Russian newspaper that has investigated Mr. Shamalov's business dealings, asked Mr. Putin whether his daughter, born Yekaterina Putina, has been living in Russia under the assumed name of Katerina Tikhonova.
Earlier, RBC reported on a sprawling development project on land partly owned by Moscow State University run by a woman named Katerina Tikhonova, 29, who had been seen in public with Mr. Shamalov. Later, a Russian blogger, Oleg Kashin, identified Ms. Tikhonova as Mr. Putin's daughter in a post called "It's Her." Reuters and Bloomberg both detailed the couple's wedding.
Mr. Putin declined to answer questions about his family at the conference.
"I read, of course, on the Internet and in some other publications about Yekaterina Tikhonova, just as I've read things about other possible relatives and daughters at different times," Mr. Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript. He said his daughter is living in Russia, but declined to say whether she is Ms. Tikhonova.
"I am proud of them," he said, speaking of his two daughters.
"They are taking just first steps in their careers, but already achieved successes," he added. "They are not in business or politics, and are not sticking their nose into anything."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- It has been a truism of the American economy for decades: When oil prices rise, the economy suffers; when they fall, growth improves.
But the decline of oil prices over the last two years has failed to deliver the usual economic benefits.
As oil prices have fallen to levels not seen since 2003 -- sagging below $27 a barrel on Wednesday before rebounding to about $30 on Thursday -- many experts now say they do not expect lower prices to bolster the domestic economy significantly in 2016.
"We got this wrong," John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told an audience in Santa Barbara, Calif., this month.
Lower oil prices historically were a cause for celebration in the developed world, including the United States. The effect was akin to a tax cut for consumers who could fill their gas tanks for less money. And since much of that oil was imported, the windfall was generally larger than the damage to domestic oil producers.
Every dollar gained by consumers was a dollar lost by producers, but when the dollars were lost by foreign producers, the American economy should have benefited.
But this time is different. The losses from lower prices are larger and quicker than expected as energy companies cut back on investment and lay off workers, while the gains are smaller and slower to materialize, as consumers save some of their windfalls.
Economists at JPMorgan Chase, who predicted last January that lower oil prices would add about 0.7 of a percentage point to the economic growth rate in 2015, now estimate that lower prices might have shaved 0.3 of a percentage point off the growth rate.
This year, JPMorgan predicts that lower prices will help expand economic activity by just 0.1 of a percentage point, while economists at Goldman Sachs said they expected an impact "around zero."
The decline of oil prices is causing other problems, too. It has contributed to the correction in global equity markets; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 10 percent this year. And lower prices are weighing on inflation, jeopardizing the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates by about one percentage point this year.
"I think the Fed has to take seriously the possibility that we could enter into another economic downturn, and it urgently needs to make contingency plans for that scenario," said Andrew T. Levin, an economics professor at Dartmouth and a former adviser to the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. "There's a feedback between financial markets and the economy. You might think markets are irrational, but even if they are, that spills over into the real economy."
Many other economists doubt that the United States is on the verge of a recession, as job growth and consumer spending remain healthy. But most now concede that the vast expansion in domestic oil and gas drilling in recent years has changed the way energy prices affect the economy.
The losses among energy producers reflect the unexpectedly sharp downslope after the recent boom in domestic oil and gas extraction.
The industry's share of capital spending bounced around below 5 percent a year from 1985 to 2005. But new techniques, notably fracking, drove that share above 10 percent in 2012 and 2013, according to calculations by Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
Now the industry's share of capital spending has fallen back to 5 percent.
"The world has changed and what we saw was different" from the Fed's predictions, said Mr. Williams, the San Francisco Fed president. He said fracking operations were easier to set up and shut down than other kinds of extraction, so the industry's response to falling prices was quicker than analysts had expected.
And there is little sign of an imminent reversal. The price of oil -- as measured by a benchmark barrel of West Texas Intermediate -- has fallen to below $30 from more than $105 in mid-2014.
The International Energy Agency said this week that steady production and falling demand could send prices lower. "Unless something changes, the oil market could drown in oversupply," the agency said.
In the United States, increased production of oil and gas also has reduced reliance on imports, so a larger share of the dollars consumers saved at the pump came at the expense of domestic oil and gas producers, offsetting a larger share of benefits.
Only 27 percent of the petroleum consumed in 2014 was imported, the lowest share since 1985, according to the United States' Energy Information Administration.
Moreover, those benefits were smaller than many expected as Americans saved a slightly larger share of their incomes last year. Since mid-2014, personal savings rose by about $120 billion, an amount roughly equal to the savings at the pump, according to Capital Economics.
Interestingly, a study of credit card spending by the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that people spent much of the gas windfall on more gas.
The problem, in other words, may have been that people were slow to increase spending from other sources of income.
Some analysts see evidence that consumers are saving because they are scared, or still struggling to pay down high levels of debt. Others, however, are more optimistic. They argue that consumers hesitated initially because they weren't sure lower prices would last, but that spending will increase as lower gas prices endure.
"Lower oil has an immediate negative impact on the energy sector and the positive effects on the rest of the economy only appear with a lag," Mr. Slok, the Deutsche Bank economist, wrote in a recent analysis. "The conclusion is therefore that we have the worst behind us."
Consumer spending has started to rise more quickly, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, noted in a speech last week, describing it as "mild evidence" that falling prices are lifting domestic growth.
"For the macroeconomy as a whole, the relatively low crude oil prices the U.S. is enjoying today are likely a bullish factor," Mr. Bullard said in Memphis.
But Mr. Bullard added that lower prices might be causing a different, longer-term economic problem by contributing to the erosion of inflation expectations.
The Fed aims to keep prices rising about 2 percent a year. It also seeks to maintain public confidence that it will meet that goal, which it regards as critical because expectations play an important role in determining the pace of inflation.
But inflation has generally remained well below the Fed's goal since the financial crisis, and evidence is growing that expectations are falling too. A survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that consumer expectations of inflation in three years' time had declined to 2.8 percent from 3.3 percent over the last two years.
The Fed acknowledged that decline for the first time in its most recent policy statement. Just a few weeks ago, investors put the chances above 50 percent that the Fed would raise rates again in March, judging by the prices of assets closely tied to short-term interest rates. But now that probability has fallen below 30 percent.
Michael Feroli, JPMorgan's chief economist, is among those no longer expecting the Fed to raise rates in March. "This change in our Fed call is more about inflation than growth," Mr. Feroli wrote this week.
The Fed will provide its own update after its policy-making committee meets on Jan. 26 and 27.

Full text:   Soon after midday on Wednesday, panic selling seemed to be seizing the United States stock market.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 500 points, and all the fears that have driven this year's declines -- including concerns that the world economy is slowing -- seemed as potent as ever.
Then investors' mood changed.
Buyers rushed in, sending the Dow up over 400 points. What could have been a rout ended up being just the sort of down day that investors have had to get used to this year.
The Dow closed off 249 points, or 1.56 percent, to 15,766.74. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader benchmark, fell 22 points, or 1.17 percent, to 1,859.33. The Nasdaq composite index ended barely changed, 5.26 points lower, or 0.12 percent.
And after spiking, the Vix index, which measures investors' expectations of volatility and is known as Wall Street's fear gauge, tumbled.
To some, the turnaround felt a little like the sort of cathartic turning point that can signal a bottom on the markets -- at least for a time.
"The noon swoon today looked to me to be consistent with sort of important lows that I've seen over the years," said Douglas A. Kass, a founder of Seabreeze Partners Management. "You had panic, fear and immobility on the part of many investors."
The main reason that the analysts gave for their tempered optimism is that the global economy does not appear to be in as poor a shape as the stock market is suggesting. In other words, while many countries, including China and its $10 trillion economy, still face stiff challenges, the United States stock market now appears to already reflect such risks, these analysts say.
"It feels like we are discounting too much bad news ahead," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "On these sort of days, you want to go and look at how the economy is doing, and it appears that the financial markets are overreacting."
In recent years, global stocks have at times sold off sharply without a clear, cataclysmic trigger. Instead, the cause has been concern that the global economy is faltering. In 2011 and 2012, Europe was the source of most fears. Then last year, China started to unsettle global markets, especially after its shock currency devaluation in August.
Still, investors have in recent years jumped back into the market after they have concluded that the world economy is not sliding into recession and that the global financial system is not about seize up as it did in 2008.
The markets, however, will have to rise by quite a lot to recover their recent losses.
The S.&P. 500 has slid 9.03 percent so far this year and is now 12.74 percent below the nominal high that it reached last year. After adjusting for inflation, the stock market is lower than it was in 1999.
And some markets are still flashing warning signals.
On Wednesday, for instance, investors sought the safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, slipped to 1.99 percent, from 2.06 percent, the first time it has closed below the 2 percent threshold since October.
The tumbling price of oil has also persuaded investors to be cautious. Cheaper oil reduces costs for companies and consumers. But a falling oil price could also be a signal that companies require less oil, which in turn could be an early signal that the world economy is on the verge of decelerating.
And on Wednesday, oil prices resumed their slide; the price of a barrel of crude oil reached the lowest level since May 2003. Crude oil was down 6.7 percent, to settle at $26.55 a barrel in trading for February futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Royal Dutch Shell warned on Wednesday that it expected its profit for the fourth quarter of 2015 to be about half of what it was in the comparable period a year earlier.
In addition, traders see no signs of the oil glut easing, as Iran has permission to sell into the world markets now that sanctions have been lifted as part of a nuclear deal.
European stocks ended sharply lower on Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 index was down 3.3 percent. The FTSE 100 in London closed the day down 3.46 percent. London stocks are now down more than 20 percent from their April high: a level analysts generally regard as a bear market.
Stocks in Japan closed 3.7 percent lower, bringing the Nikkei 225's total decline since its near-term high in June into bear market territory, too.
In addition to worries about China, investors have also grown concerned that economic overhauls in Japan championed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, called Abenomics, are faltering. Despite Mr. Abe's pledges to increase economic growth, which were accompanied by a huge program of monetary easing carried out by the central bank, the Japanese economy continues to dip in and out of recession.
The trading action in the United States stock market contained some unexpected moves. Shares of Twitter, which have plunged in recent weeks, surged on takeover rumors, leaving the stock up 4.13 percent for the day.

Full text:   HANOI, Vietnam -- Soon after becoming the American ambassador to Vietnam in 2007, Michael W. Michalak approached Nguyen Tan Dung, the country's new prime minister, at a gala dinner and mentioned that human rights were among the American government's highest priorities in Vietnam.
"You could see his face just freeze," Mr. Michalak, now the senior vice president of the U.S.-Asean Business Council, recalled with a chuckle. Mr. Michalak quickly told Mr. Dung that he wanted to toast his health and make a friendly suggestion: The caterers should serve American beef at the next such diplomatic event.
"He just cracked up, and we started drinking vodka," Mr. Michalak said. "And ever since then, at every one of these dinners, he always would make sure to have a shot of vodka with me."
On Wednesday, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party is to convene its national congress, which meets every five years to select the country's top leaders. And Mr. Dung, a charismatic prime minister who favors closer ties with the United States, is battling to succeed Nguyen Phu Trong, a conservative apparatchik looking to stay on in the party's top job of general secretary, according to several analysts, diplomats and business leaders.
The outcome of these congresses is usually settled months in advance, but a protracted spat between factions loyal to Mr. Dung and Mr. Trong has resulted in last-minute maneuvering. Whoever comes out on top could determine the future of Vietnam's carefully calibrated strategic balance between China, its ideological ally and main trading partner, and the United States, which the party elite increasingly considers an important counterweight against growing Chinese influence in the region.
Mr. Dung, who is finishing his second term as prime minister, won praise among Vietnamese for denouncing China's decision to move an oil rig into disputed waters near Vietnam's coast in May 2014, and he is considered a champion of market-oriented policies who has developed warm personal relationships with top American officials.
By contrast, Mr. Trong, the party's general secretary since 2011, appeared reluctant to criticize China in the oil rig dispute, and he is seen as a more forceful proponent of the state's role in the economy and defender of the party's monopoly on power. But he also steered Vietnam into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an American-led trade agreement among a dozen Pacific Rim nations that excludes China.
"If the conservative faction emerges the winner at this party congress, the U.S. may find that it would need to do even more trust-building with Hanoi" than it has done lately, said Phuong Nguyen, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
"Trade and investment ties are expected to still forge ahead if the TPP is ratified," she said, but she predicted that it would be more difficult for Washington to expand military ties with Vietnam if Mr. Trong's faction prevailed.
At 66, Mr. Dung is five years younger than Mr. Trong. But according to a longstanding rule, the age limit for a member of the Politburo to start a new term is 65. The leadership can grant an exception, however, and Mr. Dung has been angling for one so he can succeed Mr. Trong as the party's general secretary, several Vietnamese political observers have said in recent months.
That prospect, once considered almost inevitable, has come to seem less likely in recent days as Mr. Trong and his supporters have sought to force Mr. Dung into retirement, analysts said. The apparent turnaround has caused concern among Vietnam's urban intellectuals, many of whom view Mr. Dung as the best hope for further integration into the global economy and curbing Chinese influence in the region.
"Dung doesn't have many allies in the Politburo, and it's very hard for him to change the status quo, so we are worrying," said a Vietnamese academic at a state-affiliated institution, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive political matter.
While Mr. Trong's supporters are said to have the upper hand in the elite, 16-member Politburo, they are worried that Mr. Dung, an unusually dynamic prime minister, has undercut the party leadership by strengthening government institutions and building a vast patronage network among provincial party bosses and in the 175-member Central Committee.
One chain of events that has been discussed in recent days is that the party's top four leaders, including Mr. Dung and Mr. Trong, will retire and cede power to a younger crop of Politburo members, apparently in a victory for Mr. Trong's camp. Some analysts said Mr. Trong may even remain in his post for another year or two to keep a lid on tensions inside the party elite.
It is not entirely clear how the leadership shuffle will affect Vietnam's warming relationship with the United States, or its efforts to assert its economic independence and sovereignty over parts of the South China Sea without angering China.
In May 2014, the Chinese oil rig episode set off street protests in some cities that were initially tolerated -- some said encouraged -- by the government, and then riots at industrial parks in central and southern provinces. Mr. Dung, unlike other party leaders, responded to the Chinese move with denunciations of Beijing's territorial ambitions that appealed to Vietnamese patriotism.
Relations between the Communist neighbors have since recovered somewhat, and Mr. Dung shook hands with President Xi Jinping of China when he visited Hanoi in November. But many Vietnamese object to China's island-building projects in disputed waters, viewing them as reminders of Chinese imperial conquests of Vietnam. They also resent China's economic influence here, in the form of growing trade, tourism and infrastructure projects.
At the beginning of January, Vietnam formally accused China of violating its sovereignty, as well as a recent confidence-building pact, after Beijing landed a plane on one of the artificial islands built by the Chinese.
Mr. Dung's economic record has been marred by scandals at state-owned enterprises and a bout of debilitating inflation. Yet he is still widely seen as the party's strongest proponent of opening the Vietnamese economy to more foreign investment and competition, and of Vietnam's membership in the TPP.
"Until now, none of our leaders did much to internationalize Vietnam, but Dung is different -- he stands out," said Nguyen Viet Ha, who runs a chemical-trading company in Hanoi. "Before, we depended on China a bit more, and now we're a bit more independent and have access to Western technology."
Bui Kien Thanh, an American-educated businessman who has advised Mr. Dung and other prime ministers on economic policy, acknowledged that such policies had left Mr. Dung open to criticism. "A lot of people say Nguyen Tan Dung is an American ally and so on, but that is only talk," he said. "Nguyen Tan Dung sees very well that economic opening cannot go without good relations with the U.S."
Other analysts and business leaders said relations with the United States would remain on an upward swing even if Mr. Dung were forced to retire. Mr. Trong's visit to the White House in July -- the first by a Vietnamese Communist Party boss -- was a clear sign of a growing consensus across party factions that better relations with the United States is in Vietnam's national interest, they said.
Mr. Michalak, the former American ambassador, said Vietnam's relationship with China had "dropped down a few degrees" since the oil rig dispute. "I don't think that's going to change anytime soon no matter what government gets in" at the congress, he added.
The United States, meanwhile, eased a longstanding ban on the sale of lethal arms to the country in October 2014, saying there have been incremental improvements in Vietnam's human rights record.
But human rights activists have pushed back against that narrative, and many said they expect no improvement in civil liberties as a result of the leadership transition.
Le Cong Dinh, a prominent human rights lawyer now under house arrest in Ho Chi Minh City, said in a New Year's Eve message on Facebook to his supporters that he was "totally indifferent" to the outcome of the nine-day party congress. "They haven't proven what they've done or will do for our nation, aside from running back and forth for the sake of their and their comrades' 'chairs' and 'rice pots,' " he wrote, using slang for jobs and income.

Full text:   Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are pushing for lower prescription drug prices as part of their campaigns. Debates about whether and how to reduce drug prices aren't new. But they rarely lead to legislative success.
Still, the mere threat of government price controls may have a moderating effect on drug prices. There's strong evidence it did so as the ill-fated Clinton administration health plan was being developed in the early 1990s. Today, with the high price of drugs and proposals to address them so prominent in the news, there are early signs it may do so again.
Sara Fisher Ellison, an M.I.T. economist, and Catherine Wolfram, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, found evidence that pharmaceutical companies reduce growth in drug prices in response to political pressure. In the 1980s and early 1990s, drug prices grew at three times the rate of inflation. But, according to their study, rates of price growth fell to almost precisely the inflation rate by 1993, just as the Clinton health reform plan took shape.
As they are today, drug prices were a significant concern in the first few years of the 1990s and drew the attention of Congress. In 1990, under pressure from members of Congress, SmithKlein Beecham cut the price of Dyazide -- a fluid retention and hypertension drug -- by 11 percent. In 1991, as Congress considered several price control measures, Merck and Pfizer endorsed voluntary reductions in drug price growth to improve the industry's reputation. In 1990, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Burroughs Wellcome, but not other big drug companies, favored increasing discounts for drugs sold to Medicaid programs.
The 1993 Clinton health reform plan included a proposal that would have used Medicare's buying clout to moderate prices. Under the plan, Medicare would have added a prescription drug benefit -- something it didn't do until 2006 -- and directly negotiated drug discounts program-wide -- something it has never done. (Under the Medicare drug benefit that began in 2006 and continues today, drug prices are negotiated between manufacturers and private plans, or pharmacy benefits management companies on their behalf.)
The prospect of Medicare price controls on drugs got the attention of pharmaceutical companies and their investors. Between January 1992 and October 1993, as Hillary Clinton's "Health Care Task Force" was considering drug price regulations, pharmaceutical stock prices fell as much as 50 percent.
Ms. Ellison and Ms. Wolfram examined over 100 of the largest revenue-generating brand-name drugs from manufacturers receiving the greatest price scrutiny. They found that large, brand-name drug firms tended to keep drug price growth close to that of overall inflation during this period of political examination. This tendency was stronger for firms likely to be more politically sensitive -- those with more sales to Medicare-aged consumers and those less likely to face price-reducing competition because of longer lives left on patents.
In 1993, the dominant pharmaceutical manufacturers trade group asked the Department of Justice for an antitrust exemption so manufacturers could act in concert to reduce prices, voluntarily. The request was denied, but over 20 pharmaceutical companies pledged that year to keep drug price growth at or below inflation.
Today, amid continuing growth in the prices of many drugs, there may be early signs of industry sensitivity to political pressure on prices. Just as in the 1990s, congressional scrutiny of drug prices has not escaped drug investors' attention. In September, when congressional Democrats questioned large price increases of Valeant's heart drugs, its stock price fell 16.5 percent.
Other pharmaceutical stocks have also lost value since Democratic presidential hopefuls have proposed changes to how Medicare pays for drugs, since the Senate opened an investigation into drug pricing and since the Obama administration began to focus on the issue. (On Nov. 20, the administration held a forum to discuss pharmaceutical prices.) In California, polls show a majority of residents support a ballot measure that would impose drug price controls in the state.
The drug industry has shown more explicit signs of responding to the pressure. In an unusual move counter to the drug industry's longstanding unanimity, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturing Association -- the industry's chief advocacy organization -- criticized some "bad actors" that are raising drug prices and hurting the industry's image.
A way out of those problems may be to rein in the growth of drug prices. Already, price growth for some drugs has come down recently. For example, generic drug price growth fell from 4.9 percent in 2014 to below 3 percent in 2015.
Last November, an executive of the largest advocacy group for drug manufacturers suggested that a drug's price should be commensurate with the value it provides, which would be a substantial departure from how drugs are priced today -- at whatever the market will bear.
For those outraged by the prices of drugs, there are two ways to think about drug price responses to political pressure. You can view them as short-term cynical moves by an industry attempting to escape a political firestorm. Or, you can view them as consolation prizes.
Drug price control legislation is exceedingly difficult to pass, and many prior attempts to do so have failed. At least with political pressure, drug price growth may slow, if only temporarily.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. U.S. and Europe Debate Tech
European policy makers and American tech moguls are in Munich for a three-day conference that began on Sunday to debate many of the contentious issues that have caused friction between lawmakers and companies on both sides of the Atlantic, including Europe's tough competition rules.
Margrethe Vestager, Europe's antitrust chief, and Reed Hastings, Netflix's chief executive, are among the attendees as Europe gears up for another year of renewed regulation on such issues as continuing competition and tax and privacy complaints involving many of the largest American tech companies. --Mark Scott
Growth Report From China
On Tuesday, China is expected to report its slowest economic growth in a quarter of a century. Despite continuing questions about the accuracy of Chinese data, the official reading on gross domestic product remains a widely watched indicator of the economy's health and of potential catalysts for the government to step in with more stimulus measures.
Economists expect growth for 2015 to come in at 6.9 percent, the slowest expansion since 1990. Analysts will also try to gauge the depth of the country's slowdown from other data to be released on Tuesday, including December figures for industrial production, investment and retail sales. --Neil Gough
Meeting to Address Puerto Rico's Debt
The Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, will travel to Puerto Rico on Wednesday to meet with its governor, Alejandro García Padilla, and other government, labor and business leaders to discuss the Obama administration's proposal for addressing the island's huge debt.
A major element of the administration's proposal is the enactment of a legal framework, like bankruptcy, that would halt creditor lawsuits while Puerto Rico reduces its debts. Mr. Lew says Congress needs to act by the end of March.
The Puerto Rican legislature also faces a looming deadline: Creditors have given it until Friday to approve an out-of-court restructuring of about $9 billion of the island's $72 billion debt. --Mary Williams Walsh
World Economic Forum to Kick Off
Starting on Wednesday, thousands of political and financial luminaries will gather in the Swiss village of Davos for the 46th meeting of the World Economic Forum. With oil prices plummeting and fears building about China's ability to maintain its high growth rate, the health of the global economy is expected to be a main topic of discussion.
The prime ministers of Britain and Turkey and South Africa's president are expected to attend. Also going will be Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and numerous central bankers, finance ministers and chief executives of companies from around the world. --Landon Thomas Jr.
Consumer Price Report
The Labor Department, on Wednesday morning, is scheduled to report the latest data on consumer prices in December. The Consumer Price Index is expected to be unchanged, weighed down by a steep drop in gas prices. Excluding more volatile food and energy prices, the index is estimated to have risen by 0.2 percentage point, which suggests inflation remains subdued. --Nelson D. Schwartz
Oil Companies' Earnings Reports
Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group will publish preliminary earnings for the fourth quarter and 2015 on Wednesday in preparation for the completion of Shell's acquisition of BG in mid-February. Shell's agreement to buy BG, the oil and gas producer based in Britain, last year in a cash and stock deal now worth around $48 billion has been criticized by some investors as too expensive in the current low oil price environment.
Shell and BG shareholders will vote on the deal next week, and analysts expect that it will be approved. The financial results that Shell and BG release will be an early indication of how hard oil companies' profits were hit in the fourth quarter of last year by falling prices. Along with other major oil companies, Shell and BG will publish formal results in early February. --Stanley Reed
Canada's Central Bank May Cut Rate
As the collapse of oil and other commodity prices continues to shake Canada's economy, many economists expect that the country's central bank will halve its primary lending rate on Wednesday, bringing it down to 0.25 percent, a record low. While interest rates are expected to rise in the United States this year, Stephen Poloz, governor of the Bank of Canada, said last month that he might even consider moving his bank's benchmark overnight rate below zero percent to stimulate the economy.
The bank's low interest rate policy has been a major factor in the fall of the Canadian dollar. Mr. Poloz and others think that a low dollar will buoy the economy by effectively lowering the export prices of products and services from Canadian companies. After hovering close to par with American currency, the Canadian dollar is now fluttering around 70 American cents. Any rate cut on Wednesday would further reduce its value. --Ian Austen
Draghi News Conference on the E.C.B.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is expected to hold a news conference on Thursday after a meeting of the bank's governing council. Analysts do not expect any change in policy, but Mr. Draghi will probably face questions about why inflation in the eurozone remains far below the central bank's official target despite significant stimulus measures. --Jack Ewing
Correction: January 19, 2016, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, the Week Ahead column on Monday misstated the day the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, plans to hold a news conference. The news conference will take place on Thursday, not Wednesday.

Abstract: "Uncertainty associated with the Fed and guidance on future rate hikes is a big overhanging negative" for emerging-market shares, said Brian D. Singer, head of dynamic allocation strategies at the asset manager William Blair. [...]a bear market in commodities became worse as crude oil prices fell to below $35 a barrel, from a fourth-quarter peak of $52 a barrel. Rising interest rates could slow global growth, which may further reduce demand for commodities, and rising domestic rates could also strengthen the value of the dollar against emerging-market currencies.

Full text:   While most forms of investing require a leap of faith, betting on emerging-markets stock funds this year -- Chinese stocks have already had double-digit declines -- may feel like jumping across the Grand Canyon.
Not only have shares of companies based in developing economies like China, Brazil and Russia been mired in a prolonged bear market -- prices were down about 40 percent from April 2011 through Thursday, compared with a 44 percent gain percent for American stocks -- but this once-promising group was also hit with a double whammy of bad news at the end of last year.
There was the Federal Reserve's decision in December to raise short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006. Near-zero rates, intended to encourage risk-taking, induced investors to pump billions of dollars into the developing world in search of higher yields and better returns.
Now rates are a bit higher and the mood is very different. "Uncertainty associated with the Fed and guidance on future rate hikes is a big overhanging negative" for emerging-market shares, said Brian D. Singer, head of dynamic allocation strategies at the asset manager William Blair.
Moreover, a bear market in commodities became worse as crude oil prices fell to below $35 a barrel, from a fourth-quarter peak of $52 a barrel. The economies of many emerging markets are still tied to natural resources, which explains why exchange-traded funds with bigger-than-average stakes in energy and basic materials stocks have faced headwinds lately. The Schwab Emerging Markets Equity E.T.F., for instance, sank more than 1 percent in the fourth quarter and lost 16 percent in 2015.
Despite this bad news, money managers and market strategists say there is a compelling case for long-term investors to have a presence in the developing world.
A big reason is valuations.
Historically, the price-earnings ratio of emerging-market stocks -- based on five years of averaged, or "normalized," profits -- has been roughly 20 percent lower than the price-earnings ratio for stocks in the United States, according to figures compiled by the Leuthold Group. During the global financial crisis in 2008, emerging-market shares actually traded at a 20 percent premium.
Today, these stocks are 53 percent cheaper than domestic shares.
The last time they were this inexpensive was in 2000, shortly after the Asian currency crisis raised questions about the health of those economies. From mid-1997 through 2000, emerging-market shares declined more than 30 percent.
In hindsight, said Jason Hsu, vice chairman of Research Affiliates, the aftermath of the Asian currency crisis was probably among the best times to be invested in these shares.
From 2000 through 2007, emerging-market stocks tripled in value while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of domestic shares was flat. "The lesson of the Asian currency crisis," Mr. Hsu said, is that "rebounds can come fast and furious and waiting can sometimes hurt you."
Research Affiliates predicts that over the next decade, emerging-market stock returns will outpace inflation by nearly 8 percentage points a year, owing much to lower valuations. By contrast, the firm predicts that blue-chip domestic stocks will beat inflation by only about 1 percentage point a year.
Fed rate increases are likely to hurt companies in the emerging world in a couple of ways: Rising interest rates could slow global growth, which may further reduce demand for commodities, and rising domestic rates could also strengthen the value of the dollar against emerging-market currencies.
"If the dollar continues to strengthen, companies and countries holding dollar-denominated debt could be hit with solvency issues," said Arjun Jayaraman, a portfolio manager with Causeway Capital Management. That is because their debt burden based on their local currencies would rise.
But Mr. Jayaraman also pointed out that if the Fed increases are more gradual than expected, leading to "a slow and steady increase in the dollar, the emerging markets can weather that better," he said.
Also, market watchers think that if the slowdown in China is not as pronounced as the market fears, that, too, could be good news for emerging-market equities.
How then can investors play this volatile group of stocks for the long term while still trying to play it safe? There are several strategies.
Investors could simply "dollar-cost average" into emerging-market stocks, which means putting money to work in the markets in small increments on a regular schedule, which investors already do effortlessly with their 401(k) retirement accounts.
"If you think in the long run you'd be comfortable putting 15 percent of your stock portfolio in the emerging markets but don't know if today is the right time, give yourself a window -- say, 15 months -- and commit to putting 1 percentage point to work each month come hell or high water," Mr. Hsu said. "That takes away the anxiety over whether the timing is exactly right."
Lewis J. Altfest, a financial planner in New York City, suggests being selective about the type of emerging-market stocks you own.
For instance, he said, "if you're worried about commodities, you want to be in those countries that are beneficiaries of low commodity prices, not victims." He pointed to industrial and consumer economies such as India and South Korea that stand to gain with low energy and raw-materials prices.
Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief global investment strategist for Charles Schwab, agreed, suggesting that investors stay away from commodity-based economies such as Brazil, Russia and South Africa, instead focusing on more diverse economies such as Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan.
To be sure, such a strategy does have a drawback. While stock market valuations in commodity-producing emerging markets are dirt cheap -- Russian stocks, for instance, trade at a price-earnings ratio of around 6 -- commodity importers like South Korea and India are more expensive. The average price-earnings for the MSCI South Korea index, for instance, is about 10 while Indian stocks trade at 19 times their projected earnings.
"Yes, the emerging markets are cheap, but it's not the cheapest ones you necessarily want to own," Mr. Kleintop said, citing the danger of plunging commodity prices.
At the Thornburg Developing World fund, which has beaten 90 percent of its emerging-market peers over the last five years, the co-manager Charles Wilson is going for a "barbell" approach.
This calls for seeding a portfolio partly with companies based in economies like India that might not be hurt by lower commodity prices. Among the fund's top holdings in India is HDFC Bank, a large retail bank. Then the other part can be devoted to "things that are outright cheap," Mr. Wilson said. "I would put China in that camp. The market is too concerned about the growth outlook for China without noticing the low valuations."
Among the fund's top holdings in China is China Mobile, the world's largest wireless phone company.
China is also of interest to Rainier Investment Management. "We want to focus on the parts of China that we would characterize as China 2.0," said Derrick Tzau, international equity analyst at Rainier.
For instance, he pointed out that over the next 10 to 20 years, the sheer demographic shifts taking place in China -- including the growing middle class and the aging population -- may point to favorable conditions for the country's health care sector.
"In the next 10 years, the pharmaceutical market there could be the second largest in the world, outside the U.S.," he said. Even better, that market is most likely to grow no matter what happens to commodity prices or interest rates.
If you are able to take a really long view, emerging markets may not be as scary as they seem.
