Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. MOSCOW -- Among the motley collection of former ministers, retired spies, billionaire oligarchs, intellectuals and others who constitute Russia's anemic liberal opposition, Boris Y. Nemtsov, the Kremlin critic fatally shot last week, always stood out.
Mr. Nemtsov was the prime organizer behind the opposition's sporadic street demonstrations, which at least showed that a democratic movement still existed. He also managed to cajole a disparate group of men and women, far more proficient at squabbling over leadership positions than at forging unity, to consult one another.
Opposition figures and analysts say those two roles, aside from his high-profile attacks on President Vladimir V. Putin over corruption and the war in Ukraine, probably played a part in his killing last Friday by an unknown assailant just off Red Square.
The question now is whether the opposition will be able to pivot off the death to assert a role in the country's political life, or to sink further into obscurity and irrelevance.
"They find themselves at a crossroads," said Aleksandr Pozhalov, a political scientist and research director at the Institute of Socio-Economic and Political Research here. "The murder of Nemtsov must make the democratic opposition of Moscow reconsider its strategy, starting with their relations with each other."
Over the years, the liberals splintered into at least half a dozen political parties working under a plethora of confusing, forgettable names but lacking any distinct identity. Because they never got past the leadership battles to agree on a common platform, experts said, about their only shared position was "Dump Putin!"
Voters were unimpressed.
The vast majority remains grateful to Mr. Putin for bringing stability and prosperity after the economic hardships and rampant gangsterism ushered in by the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Some major opposition figures served in the Kremlin at the time, which did not help.
In the past year, Mr. Putin has solidified his position by striking a deep nationalist chord, annexing Crimea and selling Russians on the idea that they inhabit a besieged fortress.
Europe and the United States imposed sanctions, hoping the ensuing economic hardship would prompt Russians to push Mr. Putin to change. Instead sanctions have created the opposite effect, exploited by Mr. Putin to convince Russians that the West seeks to bring the country to its knees.
"Security has a dual meaning in Russia," said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former presidential adviser. "It is both national security and social security, and in their eyes, these two notions are combined in one word: Putin."
The opposition, feeling boxed in at home, often endorsed sanctions and other Western efforts to pressure Mr. Putin. They also emphasized what they called the need for Western values like the rule of law, which failed to resonate. That, too, played into Mr. Putin's hands.
The Kremlin used its monopoly over state television to paint the opposition as Western stooges, hammering home the idea daily that government critics constituted a "fifth column," or in Mr. Putin's words, "national traitors" working for foreign interests.
The most prevalent theory among the opposition is that rogue far-right extremists assassinated Mr. Nemtsov -- pointing to repeated statements at demonstrations by right-wing activists that they just awaited an order from Mr. Putin to "cleanse" the country of traitors. The latest such episodes occurred Feb. 21 in central Moscow during a demonstration by the anti-Maidan movement -- a Kremlin-endorsed nationalist movement determined to thwart demands for government change in Russia like the revolution that occurred in Ukraine.
Prominent members of the anti-Maidan movement held a news conference on Thursday to deny any link to the killing. It was orchestrated from abroad, they said.
But government critics maintain that the continual refrain about treachery created an "atmosphere of hatred" that they blame for Mr. Nemtsov's death.
"It is the result of this propaganda of hate, because every day, the Russian media is trying to persuade Russian citizens that there are enemies of our country working for the State Department, working for Washington or some other countries, and they want to ruin Russia," said Dmitry Gudkov, a young member of Parliament and one of the few willing to criticize the Kremlin openly.
Undoubtedly the liberal opposition has faced difficulty building a following, particularly beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg, partly because members are largely blacklisted from state news media. But it has also tended to focus on one or two issues that seem explosive -- like corruption -- but that the public basically disregards.
"They tell people your government is corrupt, and they say, 'Yes, we know, but our pensions are being paid on time,' " said Konstantin von Eggert, a political commentator. The opposition needs to make more of an effort to "build a brand," he said.
Attempts to build it around one person have largely fizzled. A blizzard of legal cases including almost a year under house arrest have kept Aleksei A. Navalny from organizing, and some leftists are troubled by the nationalistic statements he made denigrating immigrant labor.
Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the billionaire owner of the Brooklyn Nets, and his sister Irina D. Prokhorova, have withdrawn from the leadership of Civic Platform, a move seen as protecting his business interests as the Kremlin soured on even mild critics.
Liberals could probably overcome their stigma and attract about 15 percent of the voters nationally, analysts say, but first, they have to build a platform that emphasizes a kind of "patriotic liberalism."
There have been street demonstrations in Moscow this year, for example, over government cutbacks on health services. So the liberals could build a platform on social and economic changes -- including helping entrepreneurs and moving away from state control of at least 50 percent of the economy, experts said.
Mr. von Eggert said the opposition would probably do better if it acted more like a government in waiting, with positions on a wide range of issues, rather than just reacting piecemeal to Kremlin policy.
The economic downturn -- inflation could hit 15 percent and the country could fall into recession -- might help the liberals gain some traction, too.
"It could become a fight between the television and the refrigerator," Mr. Gudkov said. "People try to get information from the television, but if the refrigerator is empty, they won't believe the propaganda."
Perhaps most significantly, opposition liberals might increase their presence in Parliament because 225 seats out of 450 will be up for contention in 2016 in direct elections rather than party lists.
But it is not clear that they can cooperate.
"Liberals are not popular enough to split votes among five or six parties," said Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, an opposition politician.
For the moment, most opposition activists seemed too stunned by Mr. Nemtsov's death to focus on future organizational efforts.
Politicians mourning at his funeral suggested opinion was divided about whether staying in Russia to continue the fight was worth the risks.
Some are already looking for an out, even while acknowledging that the killing might have been designed to prompt such an exodus.
"There is no fresh air in the country," said Galina Timchenko, the editor of Meduza.io, a news website she established in Latvia last October after she was dismissed from one of Russia's most respected news organizations.
Correction: March 10, 2015, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about a leadership void among Russia's opposition left by the murder of Boris Y. Nemtsov, an outspoken Kremlin critic, misspelled the surname of an opposition politician who said it was not clear that his colleagues could increase their presence in Parliament in 2016 elections. He is Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, not Ryzkhov. The article also misstated part of the address of a website established in Latvia last year by a journalist, Galina Timchenko, after she was fired from a respected Russian news organization. It is Meduza.io, not Meduza.com.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- When Ben S. Bernanke walked into the Federal Reserve's ornate boardroom in December 2009, the officials who were gathered around the long table gave the Fed's chairman a standing ovation.
Mr. Bernanke had just been crowned Person of the Year by Time magazine. The recession had ended, unemployment had crested and Mr. Bernanke was widely regarded as singularly responsible.
But the return to normalcy that Mr. Bernanke and his committee began to chart at that end-of-the-year meeting soon proved premature. The Fed had arrested the financial crisis, but the moment would also turn out to be the beginning of a yearslong series of failures to provide a sufficiently large dose of stimulus to restore the battered American economy to its previous health.
Transcripts the Fed released on Wednesday of its 2009 policy meetings show that Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues had a relatively clear understanding of the depth of the nation's economic problems. But they were hobbled by doubts about the Fed's ability to do more and by concerns about the potential political and economic consequences.
At that December meeting, Mr. Bernanke told his colleagues that he was acutely aware of "fairly substantial" calls for the Fed to be doing "a lot more." But he quickly added: "The reason I personally, at least, am not convinced that that's the right way to go is that the connection between what actions we can take at this point and effective easing in the markets is not at all clear. For example, on the one hand, mortgage rates are already extraordinarily low -- it's not clear that we can lower them much more."
He would eventually change his mind. Over the course of his second term as Fed chairman, which began in early 2010, Mr. Bernanke orchestrated three more rounds of bond buying, more than tripling the volume of purchases that the Fed had made during 2009.
The latest batch of crisis-era transcripts -- the Fed releases annual installments after a five-year delay -- adds a chapter to the Fed's halting journey from a single-minded focus on inflation in the years before the crisis to its broad and continuing embrace of responsibility for stabilizing the financial system and reviving job growth.
Mr. Bernanke, who left the Fed last year at the end of his second term, emerges as a perceptive judge of economic conditions and a consultative leader who rarely pushed to impose his perspective on his colleagues, even when he turned out to be right. His successor, Janet L. Yellen, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, appears in these transcripts as prescient in her concerns about the enduring weakness of the economy. She warned at the December meeting that the Fed might need to resume its bond buying -- but she went no further, and neither did anyone else.
In early 2009, financial markets were still in disarray, and Fed officials worked closely with the incoming Obama administration on a successful plan to restore confidence through a series of measures, including theatrical "stress tests" of the largest banks.
At the same time, the Fed began to shift from firefighting to reconstruction, the work that remains its focus. The Fed had already reduced its benchmark interest rate nearly to zero in December 2008. It had also started to buy mortgage-backed securities in January, seeking to revive the availability of financing for borrowers.
At the Fed's second meeting of the year, in March, officials agreed to expand that program substantially. On top of the existing plan to buy $600 billion in mortgage bonds, the Fed said it would buy a further $1.05 trillion in mortgage bonds and Treasury securities.
Fed officials arrived in a mood of profound concern.
Just three nights earlier, Mr. Bernanke told the CBS program "60 Minutes," during the first live interview conducted by a Fed chairman, that he saw "green shoots" -- signs of emerging recovery in financial markets. But at the meeting, Mr. Bernanke made clear the overall picture was still grim, and other officials agreed.
Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said he had taken soundings from 29 corporate executives. "In fact," Mr. Fisher said, "one actually called me and said, 'Do you want some good news?'
"And I said, 'Please.'
"He said, 'Call somebody else.' "
Some thought the Fed should buy more bonds, including William C. Dudley, the newly installed president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Another official, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, argued that the Fed should not set a limit but instead should announce that it would purchase a certain volume of bonds each month. The Fed eventually concluded in 2013 that Mr. Bullard's proposal was the most effective way to conduct a bond-buying program.
But caution prevailed. Ms. Yellen, among others, worried that a larger balance sheet could interfere with the Fed's ability to increase interest rates as the economy began to recover. Officials also worried the Fed could overwhelm the capacity of the financial system if it tried to buy too many bonds. And, from the outset, some officials fretted that higher inflation would surely result.
The greatest doubts, however, were focused on the likely benefits of the purchases, particularly of Treasury securities. Officials generally agreed that buying mortgage bonds was helping, but there were no comparable problems in the Treasury market. The best argument, several officials said, was simply the idea that it was worth trying everything. "We don't know exactly how much a Treasury purchase program would do, but, if we start one, we'll be able to answer that question," Mr. Dudley said.
The Fed has publicly insisted in the intervening years that buying Treasury bonds had important benefits, even as a number of academics have published studies contradicting that conclusion. Mr. Bernanke joked last year, "The problem with Q.E. is it works in practice, but it doesn't work in theory." But the transcripts show that Fed officials at the time harbored the opposite view.
"On theoretical grounds, I believe there's a very strong case that they should have some effect, but it has been awfully hard to identify exactly what that effect is," Ms. Yellen said at the Fed's June meeting. "I would say the benefits don't merit the costs."
By the second half of 2009, this skepticism was being reinforced by optimism that the recession was over. The National Bureau of Economic Research would later determine the downturn had ended in June.
"I think it does appear that the real economy is reaching something of an inflection point," Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said on June 24, accurately capturing the underlying shift. But even though the economic ship was no longer sinking, it was still struggling to advance.
The Fed repeatedly overestimated the strength of the economy in the years before the financial crisis. Officials continued to understate the nation's economic problems well into 2008. The 2009 transcripts show, however, that most officials were cleareyed about the weakness of the recovery.
"If you put all of those imbalances together and you think about what is going to support sustainable economic growth, it is a little hard to see where a robust recovery is going to come from," Mr. Bernanke said in April, and he maintained this caution through the rest of the year.
Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor, noted at the Fed's November meeting that the word he had heard the most during the discussions was "sluggish."
But when the Fed convened in December, there was unanimous agreement it was time to stop buying bonds.
Mr. Bernanke expressed "somewhat more confidence" about the health of the economy, although he was careful to describe the Fed as "walking on eggshells." Elizabeth A. Duke, a Fed governor, said the mortgage market still needed help, but she doubted that the central bank could provide it by buying more bonds.
"I think there's uncertainty about the benefits of adding to our longer-term purchases and some costs to that as well, so I'm not prepared to argue for that," said Donald L. Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman.
Ms. Yellen warned in November that retreating too quickly might leave the economy in a "dangerous deflationary situation," a prescient forecast. Now she told the committee that she had shown the Fed's optimistic job growth forecast to the San Francisco Fed's board.
They were "incredulous," she said.
But Ms. Yellen did not push for the Fed to keep buying bonds. She noted only that if the retreat went badly, "I think we may need to resume purchases."

After Reaching Milestones, Markets Take a Breather

Full text:   Stocks fell on Tuesday from nominal record highs, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped below 5,000 a day after passing that milestone for the first time since the dot-com era 15 years ago.
The losses were modest but broad, with eight industry sectors in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index falling. Higher oil prices helped oil drillers and other energy companies buck the trend. They eked out a 0.2 percent rise for the day.
With no major economic news and few earnings reports, investors were at pains to point to a catalyst for the stock slump other than the anxiety that sometime follows big gains.
"It's only natural we would get a little flutter after a milestone like yesterday," said John Manley, Wells Fargo Funds' chief equity strategist, referring to the Nasdaq's closing above 5,000. "It may very well go on for a few days."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 85.26 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,203.37. The S.&P. 500 declined 9.61 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,107.78. The Nasdaq gave up 28.20 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 4,979.90.
Ford Motor slumped after reporting United States sales from last month that disappointed investors. Sales fell 1.9 percent as dealers lacked the inventory to meet demand for the new F-150 pickup truck. Ford dropped 40 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $16.17.
Oil rose on reports that Saudi Arabia had raised prices for Asian customers and because of fears of rising tensions with Iran after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel addressed Congress. The stock price of several oil drillers surged. Denbury Resources, an oil and gas producer, jumped 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $8.58.
With nearly all companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported their fourth-quarter results, earnings per share for companies in the S.&P. 500 index are expected to have risen a healthy 7.7 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ.
Financial analysts expect earnings to drop compared with the year-earlier periods for the next two quarters, but that is mostly because of a drag from energy companies. Oil prices have fallen more than 50 percent since last June.
Anastasia V. Amoroso, global market strategist for J. P. Morgan Asset Management, said she was not surprised by the pullback.
"We're seeing a market that is fairly valued, earnings are behind us, and no major catalysts are coming up," she said. "It's a market ready for a pause."
The slump in the United States followed losses in European markets. The CAC 40 in France and the DAX in Germany each lost 1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain dropped 0.7 percent.
On Monday, the Nasdaq rose to about 40 points, not adjusted for inflation, from its 5,048.62 peak reached on March 10, 2000. The index has changed significantly since then. Gone is the heavy weighting of telecommunications stocks and the big bets on Internet companies with little or no earnings.
Among other stocks in the news, the personal finance company Springleaf Holdings rose $12.19, or 32 percent, to $50.23 after it said it would buy OneMain Financial from Citigroup for $4.25 billion. OneMain provides personal loans at more than 1,100 branches across 43 states.
Best Buy gained 55 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $39.18 after the company said it would raise its dividend 21 percent and give shareholders an additional one-time payment. The nation's biggest electronics chain also reported higher fourth-quarter earnings than financial analysts had expected.
The liquor company Brown-Forman reports earnings on Wednesday, followed by Costco Wholesale on Thursday. Staples, the nation's biggest office supply chain, reports on Friday.
Benchmark United States crude rose 93 cents to close at $50.52 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many United States refineries, rose $1.48 to close at $61.02 a barrel in London.
In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 5.3 cents to close at $1.950 a gallon.
In metals trading, gold fell $3.70, to $1,204 an ounce.
The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note rose to 2.12 percent from 2.09 percent on Monday, and the price fell 9/32, to 98 30/32.

Full text:   Will Smith will have to wait for another movie to vanquish concerns about his popularity among moviegoers. Terrible weather across the United States contributed to weak multiplex turnout over the weekend, with ticket sales down 14 percent compared with the same period last year, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data. In his first major role since the 2013 bomb "After Earth," Mr. Smith helped "Focus" collect roughly $19.1 million in North American ticket sales, easily enough for first place but a bit less than most analysts had expected.
The blandly titled "Focus," an R-rated crime dramedy co-starring the fast-rising actress Margot Robbie, ranks as one of Mr. Smith's smallest opening-weekend performances, on par with dramas like "Seven Pounds" and "Ali," after accounting for inflation.
"Focus" (Warner Bros.) cost $50 million to make, after taking tax rebates into consideration. Critics held their noses at the weekend's only other new wide-release movie, "The Lazarus Effect," which took in about $10.6 million, and audiences seemed to agree, giving it a C-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls. Still, "The Lazarus Effect" is a win for Relativity Media, which acquired the horror film for distribution from Blumhouse Productions for just $3.3 million.
Also of note over the weekend: "American Sniper" generated an additional $7.7 million in tickets, for a 10-week domestic total of $331.1 million -- a sum that surpasses the domestic performance of seven of the eight "Harry Potter" blockbusters.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   Eurozone Unemployment Reports on Monday on eurozone unemployment and consumer prices will provide a last snapshot of economic activity in the bloc before the European Central Bank undertakes a historic policy shift, moving in March to a program of large-scale bond buying to stimulate growth and hold off deflationary pressures. The economy recently has shown small signs of picking up. Nonetheless, the jobless rate in the 19-nation currency zone is expected to be 11.4 percent, unchanged from December. Consumer prices are expected to fall 0.5 percent, for a second month in negative territory. While the large decline in oil prices has pushed prices lower, "core" inflation -- excluding energy and food costs -- remains near zero, far below the central bank's target of slightly less than 2 percent. --David Jolly
Personal Income and Spending The Bureau of Economic Analysis, a division of the Commerce Department, will report Monday on personal income and spending in January. Economists say they expect spending to have declined slightly primarily because the value of gasoline bought by consumers dropped as gas prices plunged, reducing the amount of spending over all. Auto sales may also have cooled in January, after a blockbuster 2014. Personal income is thought to have risen, because of factors including the annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients, which take effect in January. The combination of rising income, slower spending and savings on gas being put into the bank could increase the savings rate to just less than 6 percent, a two-year high. --Nelson Schwartz
Hearing in Guardrail Case The final hearing in Trinity Industries' guardrail fraud case in Texas will be Tuesday, before Judge Rodney Gilstrap of United States District Court imposes penalties on the company. The highway guardrail maker was found liable by a federal jury in October of defrauding the government by not disclosing changes to its ET-Plus guardrail system. The jury in the whistle-blower case awarded $175 million, which under federal law will be tripled to $525 million. Judge Gilstrap may impose additional fines, potentially adding millions to the judgment, as well as lawyers' fees. Trinity's guardrail product is accused of malfunctioning in crashes and slicing through cars, injuring or killing those inside. The company denies its product is defective. Over 40 states have banned further use of the ET-Plus pending the results of a federal investigation. --Aaron M. Kessler
Retailers to Post Earnings A second wave of retailers will report fourth-quarter earnings this week, including Abercrombie & Fitch, the struggling apparel chain. Best Buy will also report on its holiday quarter and give more guidance for what could be a tough year for consumer electronics amid a decline in tablet sales and fewer big smartphone releases. Figures from Costco, the membership-only warehouse retail chain, will show how much it has been building on its dominance to attract new members and increase store traffic. And Staples, which recently announced a merger with Office Depot, will report on a quarter that is likely to show continued pressure from dwindling demand for office-supply items. Best Buy reports on Tuesday, Abercrombie & Fitch on Wednesday, Costco on Thursday and Staples on Friday. --Hiroko Tabuchi
February Auto Sales Carmakers will report February sales on Tuesday, and analysts predict the numbers will be quite favorable. Auto sales were robust in 2014, though last year's brutal winter kept many people away from dealerships. As a result, this year's January, February and even March sales will have somewhat larger percentage increases than would otherwise be the case. Kelley Blue Book, the auto research company, predicts new vehicle sales in February could reach nearly 1.3 million, up 8 percent from the previous year. It would be the 12th straight month of sales growth. --Aaron M. Kessler
Standard Chartered Report Standard Chartered will report annual results on Wednesday, less than a week after announcing a leadership shake-up. The bank, which is based in London, but generates the majority of its profit in Asia, announced last week that its longtime chief executive, Peter Sands, will be succeeded this year by William T. Winters, the former head of JPMorgan Chase's investment bank. The lender also announced the impending departures of its chairman, the head of its Asian business and several directors. Separately, Barclays is expected to report its annual results on Tuesday. --Chad Bray
Apple's Appeal in Samsung Suit In recent years, Samsung Electronics quickly rose to the top of the smartphone market, but not without stealing ideas from the iPhone, according to Apple's lawyers. Apple failed last year to persuade a federal judge to order a permanent ban on sales of some Samsung phones that infringed Apple's patents. On Wednesday, Apple will present its argument to an appeals court in the hope of overturning the judge's rejection. --Brian X. Chen
Bank Stress Test Results The nation's largest banks on Thursday will receive the results of annual tests that aim to assess if they can weather severe financial storms. The Federal Reserve, which administers the so-called stress tests, will announce the results for 31 banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, at 4:30 p.m. on its website. The tests help the Fed decide whether to approve the banks' plans for distributing money to their shareholders through stock buybacks and dividend payments. The banks, however, must wait until March 11 for the Fed's approval. Last year, the Fed objected to the plans of five banks, including Citigroup. --Peter Eavis
European Bank Meeting On Thursday, the European Central Bank will hold its first monetary policy meeting since it decided in January to begin buying 60 billion euros a month in government bonds and other debt to try to arrest a decline in inflation to levels considered bad for growth. At a news conference after the meeting Mario Draghi, the bank's president, is expected to give more details about how the complicated purchase operations will work. --Jack Ewing
February Jobs Figures On Friday morning, the Labor Department will release the latest employment data for February. After surging to the fastest pace since the late 1990s in late 2014, the rate of hiring is estimated to have dropped slightly in February, with employers increasing payrolls by 235,000. Still, that is a healthy level, and it should be enough to lower the jobless rate by 0.1 or 0.2 percentage points from January's 5.7 percent rate, according to economists on Wall Street. If the pace of hiring is much stronger or the unemployment rate drops more sharply than expected, that will be major news for investors and Wall Street. They are trying to decide when the Federal Reserve will begin its long-expected effort to raise short-term interest rates. It is a tossup between June and September. A positive surprise might tip the scales toward June, or at least tempt traders who always try to guess the Fed's thinking to bet that way. --Nelson Schwartz

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. CARACAS, Venezuela -- Ratcheting up tensions with the United States, President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday ordered a sharp reduction in the number of diplomats at the American Embassy here, said Americans would now need visas to enter the country and took other measures to retaliate for sanctions imposed by Washington on Venezuelan officials.
Mr. Maduro announced the steps at a rally at the presidential palace, hours after four missionaries from North Dakota who had been held and questioned by Venezuelan authorities since Wednesday left the country.
Venezuela, a major oil exporter to the United States, is mired in a deep economic crisis marked by recession, high inflation and shortages of basic goods and medicines. Mr. Maduro, a leftist whose popularity is slumping, blames capitalist enemies and the United States for the country's troubles and has accused Washington of plotting a coup to oust him.
The United States denies those allegations and has pressed Mr. Maduro to release arrested opposition politicians and guarantee protections for antigovernment demonstrators.
Calling for "equal terms between countries, respect between countries," Mr. Maduro said that the United States must immediately reduce the number of officials at its embassy here. "They have 100 officials, and we have 17 there," he said.
If the reduction in embassy staff members includes a significant number of consular officials who process visa applications, it will be more difficult for Venezuelans to get visas to enter the United States.
Mr. Maduro said that embassy officials must now get permission to meet with Venezuelans, saying, "The conspiratorial meetings in Venezuela are over." He routinely accuses American diplomats of involvement in plots against him, although without offering proof.
He also said that Americans would now have to obtain visas to enter Venezuela and would have to pay a fee equivalent to that paid by Venezuelans to receive visas to the United States.
Moreover, Mr. Maduro moved to retaliate for sanctions, including visa restrictions, recently imposed by the United States against Venezuelan officials accused of involvement in human-rights abuses during antigovernment protests last year.
He said that he would bar from Venezuela "a list of political leaders from the United States who have violated human rights by bombing the people of Iraq, the people of Syria, the people of Vietnam." He said it was "a terrorist list that will be headed by George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, the ex-C.I.A. chief George Tenet."
The list, he added, would also include several members of Congress who have been critical of his government, including Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, both Republicans from Florida.
Mr. Maduro also appeared to refer to the four American missionaries who were detained on Wednesday in Ocumare de la Costa, a small coastal town west of Caracas, the capital.
"We have captured some Americans engaged in undercover activity," he said, characterizing the activity as "espionage, trying to win over people in towns on the Venezuelan coast."
He also said that another American had been "captured" in the western state of Táchira, describing the man only as a pilot of Latino origin.
Glenn Guimond, a spokesman for the American Embassy, said he was "unable to make any comment because we have yet to receive any official diplomatic communication from the Venezuelan government."
The four American missionaries flew to Aruba on Saturday morning on their way home, according to Bruce Dick, the pastor of the Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Devils Lake, N.D., where they live. Mr. Dick said that the group of missionaries -- three men and a woman -- had been providing medical aid to the coastal town's residents and support to a local church.
"That's our only agenda; it's not politics at all," Mr. Dick said.
He said the missionaries were interviewed multiple times, including by the intelligence service.
Don Canton, a spokesman for Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, said the missionaries were deported for not having the proper visa, citing information from the State Department.
Correction: March 7, 2015, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions on Sunday about an announcement of retaliatory steps against the United States by President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, who said Washington was meddling in Venezuelan affairs, rendered incorrectly part of the name of the North Dakota city that is home to four American missionaries who were held and questioned in Venezuela over four days before being released. The city is Devils Lake, not Devil's Lake.

Hot Month for Markets Goes Out on Chilly Note

Full text:   February proved to be a strong month for stocks in the United States, even though it ended in downbeat fashion.
Major stock indexes closed lower on Friday, capping a week of subdued trading that nonetheless delivered a couple of new highs for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. It also brought the Nasdaq within striking distance of its March 2000 peak.
The Nasdaq notched the biggest monthly gain at 7.1 percent. But the S.&P. 500's 5.5 percent increase was its best monthly performance since October 2011, and a turnaround from its 3.1 percent slide in January. The Dow rose 5.6 percent for the month.
Trading was listless for much of Friday as investors balanced encouraging reports on housing and consumer confidence against data showing that the United States economy grew at a slower annual rate in the final months of 2014 than previously estimated. Oil rose, recouping some of its losses from a day earlier. Technology stocks were among the biggest decliners.
"Many people are trying to figure out what to do, taking some profits when they can," said JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "It's a wait-and-see attitude."
The Dow ended down 81.72 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,132.70. The S.&P. 500 slid 6.24 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,104.50. The index is down 0.5 percent from a high of 2,115.48 on Tuesday.
The Nasdaq fell 24.36 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,963.53. The index has been inching closer to the 5,000-point mark, something it has not done since March 2000 at the height of the dot-com boom. It is now within 86 points of that era's peak, though nowhere near a record when inflation is taken into account.
The three main stock indexes in the United States are all up for the year.
The bull market, now in its sixth year, has been powered by strong corporate earnings growth and low interest rates, which make stocks more attractive relative to bonds. Strong job growth and improving consumer confidence have also encouraged traders, despite signs of sluggishness in Europe and elsewhere.
Some of that confidence appeared shaken on Friday, when the Commerce Department reported that the United States economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the October-December quarter, weaker than the 2.6 percent estimate last month. But other bellwethers were more upbeat: An index of pending home sales, an indicator of potentially completed sales, rose in January, and the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment slipped this month but remains at the highest level in eight years.
"The market does not have a clear catalyst to either cause it to sell off or to surge forward, and we're getting a little expensive from a valuation perspective," said David Heidel, regional investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
Investors should get a better sense of the economy and consumers' willingness to spend next week when automakers report their February sales figures and the government issues its monthly update on hiring.
All told, eight of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 ended lower, with technology stocks notching the biggest decline. The sector is up 4.2 percent this year. Consumer staples rose the most. Those stocks are up 2.9 percent this year.
Energy companies were among the biggest decliners in the S.&P. 500.
Southwestern Energy fell $1.27, or 4.8 percent, to $25.08, while NRG Energy lost 79 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $23.98. Chesapeake Energy slid 52 cents, or 3 percent, to $16.68.
Benchmark United States crude rose $1.59, to $49.76 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude rose $2.53, to $62.58 a barrel, in London.
Oil prices in the United States appeared to stabilize in February around the $50-a-barrel mark. That has made a crucial variable of business more predictable for investors, Mr. Kinahan said.
"That's really the kind of thing that gives stability to the stock market," Mr. Kinahan said.
United States government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 1.99 percent from 2.03 percent late Thursday.
In metals trading, gold edged up $3 to $1,213.10 an ounce, silver fell 7 cents to $16.51 an ounce, and copper was flat at $2.72 a pound.
In other energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline rose 6 cents to $1.768 a gallon, heating oil jumped 16.3 cents to $2.30 a gallon, and natural gas rose 3.7 cents to $2.734 per 1,000 cubic feet.

4th-Quarter Growth Revised to 2.2%, Less Than Initial Estimate

Abstract: Hiring for all of 2014 rose at the fastest rate since 1999. Besides shifting inventories, another factor holding down growth was a weaker trade balance, as rising imports lowered growth 0.2 percentage point.

Full text:   The American economy expanded at a slower pace than initially thought in the fourth quarter of 2014, as less stockpiling by businesses and a slightly weaker trade balance weighed on growth.
Over all, economic output rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in October, November and December, below the initial estimate of 2.6 percent issued last month, according to government data released on Friday. The downward revision also represented a steep deceleration from the blistering 5 percent annual rate of growth reported in the third quarter of 2014.
Before the announcement, economists on Wall Street expected government statisticians to revise the estimated growth rate to 2 percent. The report released on Friday by the Commerce Department is the second of three estimates that are revised as more data comes in; the final estimate will be released in late March.
Much of the downward adjustment stemmed from slower additions to inventories by businesses than first estimated, shaving 0.7 percentage point from the headline number for growth even though other underlying components like demand from consumers remained healthy.
The seemingly lackluster growth in the final three months of 2014 came even as hiring gained steam. Employers added an average of 324,000 workers a month in the fourth quarter, the best performance for the labor market in years. Hiring for all of 2014 rose at the fastest rate since 1999.
Besides shifting inventories, another factor holding down growth was a weaker trade balance, as rising imports lowered growth 0.2 percentage point. With the dollar gaining strength recently, and the euro's value dropping sharply, imports may continue to rise in the months ahead, one new headwind for the economy in 2015.
On the other hand, while inventory changes are notoriously hard for economists to predict, one bright spot in terms of smaller inventory gain last quarter is that businesses may stockpile more in the current quarter, lifting growth in 2015. Most economists expect the pace of economic activity to pick up in the first quarter of 2015, with an average estimate of 2.5 percent growth for the period.
Final sales to domestic purchasers rose 3.2 percent last quarter, which bodes well for consumer demand in the first half of 2015, said Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS, a research firm in Lexington, Mass.
Over the course of 2015, Mr. Handler says he thinks the final sales metric will continue to gain speed, lifting the overall rate of expansion for the gross domestic product to 3.1 percent this year. For the entirety of 2014, the economy grew at 2.4 percent rate.
As for last quarter, Mr. Handler added, "most of the change in measured G.D.P. can be traced to a reduction in inventory growth. This is good news for the first quarter as it suggests the anticipated slowing of inventory growth will have less of an impact on the bottom line."

Europeans Are Paid to Borrow but Get a Bill for Trying to Save

Author: Hakim, Danny; Eavis, Peter

Publication info: New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]28 Feb 2015: A.1.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. HVIDOVRE, Denmark -- At first, Eva Christiansen barely noticed the number. Her bank called to say that Ms. Christiansen, a 36-year-old entrepreneur here, had been approved for a small-business loan. She whooped. She danced. A friend took pictures.
"I think I was so happy I got the loan, I didn't hear everything he said," she recalled.
And then she was told again about her interest rate. It was -0.0172 percent -- less than zero. While there would be fees to pay, the bank would also pay interest to her. It was just a little over $1 a month, but still.
These are strange times for European borrowers, as if a wormhole has opened up to a parallel universe where the usual rules of financial gravity are suspended. Investors lent Germany nearly $4 billion this week, knowing they would not be fully repaid. Bonds issued by the Swiss candy maker Nestlé recently traded in the market for more than they will ever be worth.
Such topsy-turvy deals reflect the dark outlook for the region's economy, as policy makers do whatever they can to revive growth, even taking interest rates below zero to encourage borrowing (and spending). In this environment, the simplest of banking tasks have become a curiosity.
Consumer loans and mortgages with interest rates that are outright negative remain rare, and Ms. Christiansen appears to be one of the few who actually received one while banks mull how to proceed. Some other Danes are getting charged to park their money in their bank accounts.
Such financial episodes are taking place all across Europe.
To breathe life into Europe's economy and stoke inflation, policy makers recently resorted to a drastic measure tried by some other central banks. The European Central Bank, which dictates policy in the 19-member eurozone, announced a plan that involves printing money to buy hundreds of billions of euros of government bonds.
Just the anticipation of the program prompted bond prices to soar and the euro to drop in value. Other countries that do not use the euro were then forced to take defensive countermeasures to keep a lid on the value of their currencies, encourage lending and bolster growth.
Switzerland, for instance, jettisoned its currency's peg to the euro, shocking markets, and cut interest rates further below zero. Denmark's central bank has reduced rates four times in a month, to minus 0.75 percent. Sweden followed suit earlier this month.
The most profound changes are taking place in Europe's bond market, which has been turned into something of a charity, at least for certain borrowers. The latest example came on Wednesday, when Germany issued a five-year bond worth nearly $4 billion, with a negative interest rate. Investors were essentially agreeing to be paid back slightly less money than they lent.
Bonds issued by Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Finland and even fiscally challenged Italy also have negative yields. Right now, roughly $1.75 trillion in bonds issued by countries in the eurozone are trading with negative yields, which is equivalent to more than a quarter of the total government bonds, according to an analysis by ABN Amro.
One reason investors are willing to tolerate such yields is the relative safety of the bonds, in a weak economy. Traders are also betting that the prices of the bonds will keep going up.
Even some corporate bonds, which are generally deemed less creditworthy than government bonds, are falling into the negative territory, including some issued by Nestlé and Novartis, a Swiss pharmaceutical company. While they did not initially have negative yields, investors bid up their prices after they were issued.
"This is obviously a once-in-a-lifetime and once-in-history phenomenon," said Heather L. Loomis, a managing director at JPMorgan Private Bank, who specializes in bonds, "and it is hard to make sense of it."
It can be especially hard for people who are not bankers. Ms. Christiansen, a sex therapist, took out a loan to finance a website called LoveShack that is part matchmaking site, part social network.
For her, the full novelty of her loan didn't sink in until a spokeswoman for the bank called her back.
"She said, 'Hi, Eva, they have contacted us from TV 2' -- it's a big station in Denmark, one of the biggest -- 'and they would like to talk to you because of this loan,"' Ms. Christiansen said. "Then I was really like, 'O.K., this is big."'
She said she was generally aware of what the Danish central bank was doing, but fuzzy on the specifics and had not paid close attention to the issue until she realized she might be asked about it in front of a camera.
"When I was contacted by the television, I was like, 'O.K., I need to know something,"' she said, laughing, during an interview at her office, where two distant windmills were visible outside the windows.
"So I actually called my bank adviser and said, 'Can we please have a meeting?' Because all these financial terms, I'm not used to them," she said. "If I talk about something, I'd like to know something about it."
Some other Danes are facing a related, if somewhat opposite, issue.
Last month, Ida Mottelson, a 27-year-old student, received an email from her bank telling her that it would start charging her one-half of 1 percent to hold her money.
"At first I thought I had misunderstood this, but I hadn't," she said.
Ms. Mottelson is studying for a master's degree in health sciences, and lives in Odense, a city about 100 miles west of Copenhagen. She said she had been following the news about the central bank, but called her own bank just to make sure she was reading the email correctly.
"I asked him super-naïvely, 'Can you explain this to me?' And he tried, but I got the feeling he was like, come on, just move the money and you'll be fine."
She does plan to move her money to another bank. And there are signs that such practices are spreading to the United States. This week, JPMorgan Chase said it would start charging some institutional clients to hold their money, because of a combination of new regulations and low interest rates.
Economists are now pondering some of the odd things that might occur if interest rates stay negative for a long time.
Companies and individuals may start to hoard cash outside of ordinary banks if the banks start to effectively charge substantial sums to hold deposits. Large savers, for instance, may choose to put their money in special institutions that do little more than warehouse their cash.
"There is some negative interest rate at which it would become profitable to stockpile cash," said James McAndrews, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He said that economists had speculated that such cash hoarding might begin once interest rates were around minus 0.5 percent.
For most people not poring over the financial pages, it can all seem a bit strange.
"I'm not an expert," Ms. Mottelson said, "but to me it sounds so weird that you have to pay to have your account at a bank."
Correction: March 4, 2015, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about negative interest rates in Europe misstated the effect on European bond prices as a result of the European Central Bank's decision to purchase hundreds of billions of euros' worth of bonds. Prices rose sharply; they did not plunge. (Yields, which move inversely to bond prices, did plunge.)

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A plunge in gasoline prices last month lowered consumer prices by the most in six years. But if volatile food and energy costs were excluded, prices rose.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that the Consumer Price Index fell 0.7 percent in January, the sharpest drop since December 2008. Tumbling prices at the gas pump accounted for nearly all of the decline.
Core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.2 percent. The cost of clothes, hotels and restaurants all rose.
Overall consumer prices have slipped 0.1 percent over the last 12 months, the first yearly drop in five years.
Also Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that orders to American factories for long-lasting manufactured goods rebounded in January, rising by the largest amount in six months. In addition, the Labor Department said on Thursday that more Americans sought unemployment aid last week, though the number of applications was still consistent with steady hiring.
Orders for durable goods increased 2.8 percent in January, the biggest increase since July. Much of the strength in durable goods orders came from a big jump in airplane orders. Orders were down 3.7 percent in December and 2.2 percent in November.
Demand in a category that serves as a proxy for business investment increased 0.6 percent in January. It was a small gain but it came after four consecutive declines, including decreases of 0.7 percent in December and 0.5 percent in November.
The 2.8 percent rebound in total orders was larger than had been expected but it was heavily influenced by a surge in demand in the volatile category of commercial aircraft, which soared 128.5 percent in January after having fallen 58.3 percent in December.
Excluding transportation, orders showed a more modest gain of 0.3 percent in January after declines in December and November.
Over the last year, core prices have risen 1.6 percent, below the 2 percent level that the Federal Reserve considers optimal for a healthy economy.
Excessively low inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on when to begin raising the short-term interest rate it controls. Most analysts think the Fed will start to raise rates in June or September from record lows. But persistently low prices could delay that decision.
The Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, told Congress this week that she expected the effects of falling oil prices to fade in coming months, causing inflation to creep back toward the Fed's 2 percent target.
Most economists agree. Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, says he expects core inflation to rebound to 2 percent by early next year.
"There is little danger that this temporary bout of falling energy prices will develop" into deflation, Mr. Ashworth said.
The stronger United States dollar and global weakness have hurt exports, but economists are also still optimistic that surging domestic demand will result in a sustained rebound in orders this year.
Weekly applications for unemployment benefits rose 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 313,000, the most in six weeks. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 11,500, to 294,500.
Applications are a proxy for layoffs. The average has been near or below 300,000 since September, a historically low number that suggests companies are holding onto their staffs and may even be stepping up hiring.
"Despite larger-than-expected weekly swings, the trend in claims remains consistent with an improving labor market," Derek Lindsey, an economist at BNP Paribas, said in a note to clients.

Japan's Inflation Rate Hits a 10-Month Low

Full text:   Japanese households cut spending more than expected and retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in January, data showed on Friday, a sign the central bank's radical stimulus has yet to convince consumers that inflation will take hold. Factory output jumped in January as exports rebounded on solid demand in the United States and Asia, but manufacturers expect output to rise only slightly in February and slump in March. The Bank of Japan hopes its aggressive money printing will fuel expectations that prices will rise and prompt households to spend more now. Separate data also underscored the problem the central bank faces with slumping oil prices slowing annual core consumer inflation to 0.2 percent in January, pushing it further away from its 2 percent target. Weak consumer confidence has contained spending as wages have yet to increase enough to make up for the sales tax increase last April, casting doubt on the strength of the economic recovery. The mixed data will keep the central bank under pressure to maintain its stimulus, although Haruhiko Kuroda, the bank's governor, has emphasized that he sees no need to ease again soon. The bank argues that falling oil prices will lift inflation in the long run by allowing households and companies to spend more on other goods. But analysts doubt that policy makers can meet their pledge of hitting the inflation target in the year beginning in April, as they expect it to take at least six months for the benefits of oil price falls to increase growth.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Dow and S.&.P. Close Slightly Lower on Falling Energy Stocks

Full text:   Two of the three major United States indexes drifted down on Thursday, weighed by falling energy stocks as the slump in oil prices deepened.
Chevron and Exxon Mobil were among the biggest decliners in the Dow Jones industrial average, which eased back from its latest closing high from Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also slipped below its closing high from Tuesday. The Nasdaq bucked the trend, creeping within 61 points of its dot-com-era nominal peak, not adjusted for inflation.
Expectations of rising oil supplies sent the price of crude to its lowest level in nearly a month. Benchmark United States crude oil fell $2.82 to close at $48.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Investors also had to sort through a mix of corporate earnings and economic reports.
"When you have a big move in the market you expect to see it pull back a little bit, catch its breath and wait for that next catalyst to move higher," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial.
The Dow ended down 10.15 points, or 0.1 percent, at 18,214.42. Among Dow members, Chevron lost $1.52, or 1.4 percent, to $107.06 while Exxon Mobil slid 95 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $88.65.
The S.&P. 500 slipped 3.12 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,110.74. The Nasdaq gained 20.75 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,987.89.
The three indexes are all up for the year.
The Dow and S.&P. 500 opened lower on Thursday and held that course most of the day, while the Nasdaq composite index gradually moved higher. The market's trajectory took shape early as traders pored over corporate earnings and economic news.
The Commerce Department reported that orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose 2.8 percent in January, the biggest increase since last July. The Labor Department said that applications for unemployment benefits rose last week to a seasonally adjusted 313,000, the most in six weeks. That total is still consistent with steady hiring.
A report tracking the change in prices paid by consumers held particular interest for the market. The Consumer Price Index, a Labor Department measure of inflation, is closely watched by the Federal Reserve as it looks to begin raising its benchmark interest rate from near zero, where it has been since 2008.
Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the index rose 0.2 percent in January. Over the last year, those core prices have increased just 1.6 percent. That is below the 2 percent benchmark the Fed considers optimal for a healthy economy.
"It's definitely a mixed report," said Randy Frederick, a managing director of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research. "The market is in this zone where it doesn't know whether to cheer bad news because that means rates will stay low or good news because it means the economy is getting better."
Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told Congress this week that the Fed was in no hurry to raise interest rates. Lower rates make borrowing easier and tend to benefit financial markets.
While many economists say they do not expect a rate increase before June or even later this year, rising inflation could prompt the Fed to act sooner.
Six of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 ended lower; energy stocks declined 1.8 percent, the biggest drop in the index. Energy is down 1.2 percent this year. Technology stocks led the gainers, rising 0.7 percent. They are up 3.9 percent this year.
Several oil drilling companies fell sharply. Ensco slid $2.17, or 8.2 percent, to $24.31, while Noble shed $2.49, or 5 percent, to $47.32. Newfield Exploration ended down $2.40, or 6.7 percent, at $33.60.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, fell $1.58 to close at $60.05 in London.
In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline fell 1.1 cents to close at $1.708 a gallon. Heating oil rose 3.2 cents to close at $2.136 a gallon. And natural gas fell 16.5 cents to close at $2.697 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Precious and industrial metals futures ended higher. Gold rose $8.60, to $1,210.10 an ounce; silver rose 15 cents, to $16.58 an ounce; and copper rose 5 cents, to $2.71 a pound.
Government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.03 percent from 1.97 percent late Wednesday.
Among stocks making big moves Thursday, Sears fell 5 percent after the company reported its fourth straight year of falling profit and revenue. Sears lost $1.85, closing at $36.05.
The stun-gun maker Taser International slumped 16.1 percent after its latest quarterly results fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The stock declined $4.37, to $22.69.
Salesforce.com gained 11.7 percent after the cloud software company reported a boost in quarterly revenue. The company jumped $7.37, to $70.24.
Cyberonics surged 10.3 percent on news the medical technology company's fiscal third-quarter earnings exceeded financial analysts' forecasts. The stock gained $6.23, to $66.60.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The relationship between Congress and the Federal Reserve took a turn for the worse on Wednesday.
During a testy three-hour hearing, Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee accused Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed, of using her office to advance liberal policy goals and argued that Congress should increase its oversight of the central bank.
Republicans, who control Congress but not the agencies that interpret and execute legislation, appear frustrated with the course of economic policy. They want the Fed to move more quickly toward raising interest rates and to ease some of the restrictions that a Congress controlled by Democrats imposed on the financial industry after its 2008 collapse.
"Fed reforms are needed, and I, for one, believe Fed reforms are coming," said Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the committee.
Ms. Yellen pushed back forcefully, sometimes speaking over her questioners to make a point. She defended her actions and the conduct of monetary policy, and she warned against constraining the Fed's independence.
Appearing before Congress for a second consecutive day, Ms. Yellen offered no new insights into the likely course of monetary policy, and the committee members made little effort to elicit any. The hearing instead was devoted to questions about financial regulation and to questions about the proper relationship between the central bank and the rest of the federal government.
Republicans expressed particular anger about a speech on rising economic inequality that Ms. Yellen delivered in October, a few weeks before the midterm elections, in which she questioned "whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation's history."
Representative Mick Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican, criticized Ms. Yellen for speaking about "issues outside your jurisdiction," which he said undermined the Fed's political independence.
"You're sticking your nose in places that you have no business to be," Mr. Mulvaney said.
Ms. Yellen, visibly unsettled, responded that she considered the issue important, that all of her predecessors as Fed chairman had from time to time used that pulpit to address broader economic issues, and that "I feel that I am entitled to do the same."
Representative Sean Duffy, a Wisconsin Republican, said the speech showed political bias because Democrats were campaigning on the issue at the time.
"I am not making political statements," Ms. Yellen responded. "I am discussing a significant problem that faces America."
When Mr. Duffy, his voice rising, said that Ms. Yellen in the speech had appeared to advocate the kinds of policy solutions generally favored by Democrats, Ms. Yellen snapped, "I didn't offer any policy recommendations whatsoever in that speech."
Republicans also criticized Ms. Yellen for what they described as frequent meetings with Obama administration officials.
The tone of the hearing was set by a sharp exchange in the opening moments between Ms. Yellen and Mr. Hensarling. Mr. Hensarling backs legislation requiring the Fed to announce a set of rules it would follow in setting its benchmark short-term interest rate. Such an approach would have limited the stimulus campaign the Fed has undertaken since the latest recession.
He quoted a snippet of Ms. Yellen's remarks at a 1995 Fed meeting at which she praised rules that specify how the central bank should balance the sometimes divergent priorities of moderate inflation and minimal unemployment. That, he quoted her as saying, "is what sensible central banks do."
He then asked Ms. Yellen, "Do you no longer believe that a rules-based policy like the Taylor Rule is what sensible central banks do?" The rule is a formula written by the Stanford economist John Taylor that specifies interest rates based on inflation and the gap between actual and potential economic output.
But the context of that 1995 quote is important. Ms. Yellen was then pushing the Fed to pay more attention to job growth, and she was expressing a preference for rules that considered both unemployment and inflation, as opposed to rules focused solely on the pace of inflation.
That, she said at the time, "is an example of the type of hybrid rule that would be preferable in my view, if we wanted a rule."
She continued, "I think the Greenspan Fed has done very well by following such a rule, and I think that is what sensible central banks do."
The Yellen Fed regards job growth as its priority, a transformation so complete that hewing to a Taylor-style rule actually would curb the central bank's stimulus campaign. Ms. Yellen has said in other forums that she sees rules as useful reference tools but that policy should be shaped by circumstances.
On Wednesday, pressed by Mr. Hensarling, she responded more simply and sharply.
"I don't believe that the Fed should chain itself to any mechanical rule," she said. "I did not believe that in 1995. I do not believe it now."
Democrats argue that Mr. Hensarling's proposal is an attempt by Congress to meddle in monetary policy.
"I think it's important to have transparency but not at the expense of the independence of the Fed," said Representative Al Green, a Texas Democrat.
Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, said in turn that Congress had intended to shield the Fed from political pressure "to juice the economy," while in the current situation, Republicans were seeking to curb its stimulus campaign.
Like Ms. Yellen, he suggested that circumstances had changed and that the rules needed to change, too.

Full text:   The Dow Jones industrial average notched its third nominal high close in a row Wednesday, even as other market indexes ended lower.
Trading was relatively subdued as investors reviewed the latest corporate earnings news. Stocks of utilities were among the biggest decliners. Energy stocks rebounded as oil prices ended a five-day slide and climbed back above $50 a barrel.
Wall Street also kept an eye on the second day of congressional testimony from the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, though her remarks did not generate any major market-moving news. On Tuesday, Ms. Yellen suggested that the Fed was not in a hurry to raise interest rates.
"The market is just trying to figure out whether the next move is up or down," said David M. Lebovitz, a global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management.
The Dow ended up 15.38 points, or 0.1 percent, at 18,224.57. McDonald's was the biggest gainer in the 30-company index, climbing 3.9 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.62 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,113.86. The Nasdaq composite index shed 1 point, or 0.02 percent, to 4,967.14. The three indexes are up for the year.
The Dow and S.&P. 500 hit new nominal closing highs on Tuesday after investors were encouraged by Ms. Yellen's remarks on interest rates. Lower rates make borrowing easier and tend to positively affect financial markets.
The Fed has kept its benchmark rate near zero since 2008. Most economists anticipate that a rate increase is not likely before June or even later this year.
A key factor in the decision to raise rates will be inflation. That is one reason investors will be focused on the release of the latest Consumer Price Index on Thursday.
"That should provide a little bit of insight on what the Fed's next move might be and when it may occur," Mr. Lebovitz said.
The three indexes opened lower on Wednesday, then veered between small gains and losses through much of the day. In the last hour of trading, the Dow eked out a gain.
Hewlett-Packard and the Boston Beer Company, the brewer that makes Samuel Adams, slumped early. Both reported disappointing quarterly results late Tuesday. Hewlett-Packard tumbled 9.9 percent, while Boston Beer sank 10.3 percent.
Investors bid up shares in several companies whose latest quarterly earnings fared better.
TJX, the parent company of T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, rose 3.3 percent after its profit beat analysts' expectations. The company also said would raise wages for its workers.
The benefits technology company Benefitfocus vaulted 47.2 percent, and the specialty contracting services company Dycom Industries surged 17 percent. The discount retailer Dollar Tree rose 2.2 percent.
In all, half of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 moved lower. Utilities stocks fell 1.6 percent and are now down 4 percent this year. Consumer discretionary stocks showed the biggest gain. The sector is up 5.6 percent this year.
The price of oil rose after the Energy Department reported that diesel and gasoline inventories fell more than expected, indicating a pickup in demand. Benchmark United States crude rose $1.71 to close at $50.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many United States refineries, rose $2.97 to close at $61.63 in London.
In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline rose 9.9 cents to close at $1.72 a gallon, while heating oil rose 7.5 cents to close at $2.10 a gallon. Natural gas fell 0.8 cents to close at $2.89 per 1,000 cubic feet.The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note slipped to 1.97 percent from 1.98 percent late Tuesday, while its price rose 3/32, to 100 8/32.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told Congress on Tuesday that the central bank is pleased with recent economic growth but convinced there is room for improvement and still pondering when to start raising interest rates.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Ms. Yellen advanced the Fed's slow-motion retreat from its stimulus campaign. She said the next step would be an announcement, which could come as soon as March, that the Fed would begin to consider raising its benchmark rate at each policy-making meeting.
The change would preserve the possibility of a rate increase as soon as June. But Ms. Yellen emphasized that patience remained the Fed's watchword, and that the persistence of sluggish inflation might still push back the timing of the liftoff.
"There has been important progress," Ms. Yellen testified. "However, despite this improvement, too many Americans remain unemployed or underemployed, wage growth is still sluggish and inflation remains well below our longer-run objective."
The ambiguity drew gentle prodding from Republicans concerned that the Fed would move too late and from Democrats worried about a premature retreat.
Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who leads the banking committee, questioned whether the Fed, by continuing to suppress borrowing costs, was blowing bubbles into financial markets and risking higher future inflation.
"Many question whether the Fed can rein in inflation and avoid destabilizing asset prices when the time comes to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet," he said. Patience, he warned, "could lead to a more painful correction down the road."
Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, newly installed as the committee's ranking Democrat, countered that concerns about inflation were misplaced.
"Some pundits and politicians for years have been predicting runaway inflation, but they clearly do not have a very good grasp of what is happening for most Americans," Mr. Brown said. "Low wage growth has continued for the majority of Americans, and the declining participation in the work force is troubling."
Ms. Yellen said the Fed was trying to balance both concerns.
"We do have an economy that fortunately appears to be recovering, and we have to be forward-looking in setting monetary policy, but I want to assure you that we do want to see that recovery continue," Ms. Yellen said. She said that policy was very accommodative -- and would remain so even as the Fed started to raise rates.
Much of the hearing was devoted to legislative proposals aimed at reducing the Fed's autonomy, particularly the "Audit the Fed" bill championed by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, which would task the Government Accountability Office with conducting regular reviews of the central bank's making of monetary policy.
Ms. Yellen had clearly prepared to address the proposal, which she described as misleading and harmful. She brandished a copy of the Fed's audited financial statements to make the point that the central bank already was audited. And she questioned whether such oversight would have discouraged Paul Volcker when he was Fed chairman in the 1980s from raising interest rates to bring inflation under control, a campaign now widely regarded as one of the central bank's seminal achievements.
"I really wonder whether or not the Volcker-led Fed would have had the courage to take the hard decisions necessary to bring down inflation and get that finally under control," Ms. Yellen told the panel. "I wonder if that would have happened with G.A.O. reviews in real time of monetary policy decision-making."
Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, joined Ms. Yellen in criticizing the proposal as allowing Congress to meddle with monetary policy.
Mr. Shelby, however, while not endorsing the specific proposal, said the Fed should be subject to "additional oversight by Congress and further reforms." He said the panel would hold a hearing next week to discuss proposals.
During the hearing, Ms. Yellen offered an upbeat assessment of the economic recovery, echoing the statement the Fed issued after the most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, its policy-making arm, in January.
"There is reason, I think, to feel good about the economic outlook," she said.
She noted "considerable progress" in the labor market, and she said the collapse of global oil prices appeared to be "a significant overall plus" for the United States economy, supporting increased consumer spending.
"If economic conditions continue to improve, as the committee anticipates, the committee will at some point begin considering an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis," Ms. Yellen said.
Ms. Yellen cautioned that the weakness of other developed economies could slow growth in the United States. On the other hand, she said, recent efforts by policy makers in those countries -- including the stimulus campaign announced by the European Central Bank -- could bolster the domestic economy.
Some Fed officials expressed concern at the Fed's most recent meeting in January about sluggish inflation and the decline in measures of inflation expectations. Just as too much inflation can disrupt economic growth, so can too little.
The Fed has maintained an official view that the weakness is a temporary affair, but it has appeared less firm in its conviction of late. Ms. Yellen continued the trend, prefacing the house view with the words, "as best we can tell."
The strength of inflation has become the decisive factor in the course of Fed policy. The Fed judges that the jobs market is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates, but Ms. Yellen reiterated that it would not raise rates until it was "reasonably confident" that inflation would rise back to the Fed's 2 percent annual goal.
"The debate is now about what would make the F.O.M.C. confident enough in their forecast," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial. "Most participants agree that a strong growth and employment outlook is a necessary condition." The question, he said, is whether to wait for tangible evidence of wage or price growth.
Ms. Yellen has pointed to the slow pace of wage growth as evidence that the labor market still has not returned to full health. But she cautioned on Tuesday that the Fed would not necessarily wait for wage growth to accelerate before raising interest rates, because wage growth often lags other kinds of growth.
Referring to the labor market, she said, "We have seen improvement, and if we continue to see improvement, it would add to my confidence, especially as the impact of oil prices diminishes over time, that inflation will be back up."

Optimism Over Interest Rates and Greek Bailout Pushes Indexes to New Peaks

Full text:   The Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index delivered new highs Tuesday, beating marks set last week. The Nasdaq also built on its gains for the year, finishing higher for the 10th day in a row.
The latest milestones came as investors liked what they heard from the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, who told Congress that the central bank would be patient about raising interest rates as the economy improves.
"Markets had been very focused on the Yellen testimony and wanted to see if there was going to be any change in the outlook for the first Fed rate hike," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist for UBS Wealth Management Research. "The short answer to that is, not really. The Fed is, at a minimum, not going to do anything imminently."
Progress in Greece's efforts to secure an extension of its rescue program, and strong earnings from the home-improvement retailer Home Depot also encouraged traders. The company was the best performer in the 30-company Dow, rising 4.4 percent.
The Dow ended up 92.35 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,209.19. That's up 0.4 percent from its most-recent high of 18,140.44 last Friday. The S.&P. 500 gained 5.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,115.48. The index also reached its previous high of 2,110.30 on Friday. The Nasdaq gained 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,968.12. The index is now within 81 points of its March 2000 peak, in the heart of the dot-com era.
The three main U.S. stock indexes are all up for the year. The S.&P. 500 has closed at a new high four times this month. The Dow has done it twice.
The bull market, now in its sixth year, has been powered by strong corporate earnings growth and low interest rates, which make stocks more attractive relative to bonds.
Ms. Yellen's remarks to Congress on Tuesday suggest that the interest rate part of that dynamic isn't likely to change right away.
In the first part of her two-day testimony, Ms. Yellen noted that the U.S. economy is making steady progress, but that for now the Fed will remain patient about raising interest rates because the job market is still healing and inflation is too low.
"It's a little bit uncertain on when exactly they'll raise rates, but it's not going to happen sooner than expected," Mr. Lefkowitz said.
The major stock indexes spent much of the morning drifting between small gains and losses as traders awaited Ms. Yellen's remarks and kept tabs on developments in Greece.
Athens and its bailout creditors reached a tentative agreement last week to continue a rescue loan program by four months to avoid the risk of a Greek default and exit from the euro currency. On Tuesday, the country's European creditors approved a four-month extension to the nation's financial bailout.
Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector analysis at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said, "We don't have to worry about that for at least a few weeks, anyway."
The news helped lift stocks indexes in Europe, including Britain's FTSE 100, which edged up 0.5 percent to 6,949, a record high. France's CAC-40 rose 0.5 percent to 4,886 while Germany's DAX gained 0.7 percent to 11,205. The Athens Stock Exchange General Index jumped 9.8 percent.
All told, nine of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 index rose, led by utilities stocks. Health care stocks declined.
Home Depot rose after the company reported fourth-quarter financial results and a full-year outlook that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company also said it has authorized an $18 billion buyback of its shares and boosted its quarterly dividend by 26 percent. The stock rose $4.47, or 4.4 percent, to $116.75.
U.S. government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.98 percent from 2.06 percent late Monday.
The price of oil fell for the fifth day in a row on expectations of rising inventories in the United States. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 17 cents to close at $49.28 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, fell 24 cents to close at $58.66 in London.
In other futures trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline fell 2.6 cents to close at $1.620 a gallon, while heating oil fell 18.9 cents to close at $2.029 a gallon. Natural gas rose 2.3 cents to close at $2.902 per 1,000 cubic feet.
In metals trading, gold edged down $3.50 to $1,197.30 an ounce, silver lost seven cents to $16.19 an ounce and copper rose six cents to $2.65 a pound.
Among other stocks making big moves Tuesday, First Solar jumped 10 percent a day after the solar power company said it plans to combine some of its assets with SunPower into an investment vehicle that is intended to provide steady dividends. First Solar led the gainers in the S&P 500, adding $5.06 to $54.70.
Macy's reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, but the retailer issued a forecast that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The stock dipped $2.06, or 3.2 percent, to $62.10.
Rosetta Resources slumped 15 percent after the oil and gas company reported worse-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and said it is deferring production growth. Its shares slid $3.29 to $18.58.

Abstract: Mr. Maduro's fears of a coup appear to be a diversion strategy by a maniacal statesman who is unable to deal with the dismal state of his country's economy and the rapidly deteriorating quality of life despite having the world's largest oil reserves.

Full text:   Listening to embattled President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela ramble for hours about an international right-wing conspiracy to oust him, it's clear that he would use any fabricated pretext to jail opposition leaders and crack down on dissent.
In recent days, the government's claims have become outlandish and its repression of critics even more vicious.
On Thursday, intelligence agents dispatched by Mr. Maduro arrested Mayor Antonio Ledezma of Caracas, the capital, one of the politicians who has been critical of the president. Mr. Ledezma has been charged with conspiracy to help plot an American-backed coup. The arrest came a year after the country's most high-profile opposition leader, Leopoldo López, was jailed on trumped-up charges that he instigated violent demonstrations.
"You know that the right in Madrid, the ultraright in Bogotá and the ultraright in Miami have forged an axis to conspire against the homeland," Mr. Maduro said Thursday in a televised address.
Delcy Rodríguez, the country's foreign minister, weighed in with an absurd detail, saying on Twitter that "the international community should know that the coup plan included airstrikes to tactical objectives without distinction of civilians."
Mr. Maduro's fears of a coup appear to be a diversion strategy by a maniacal statesman who is unable to deal with the dismal state of his country's economy and the rapidly deteriorating quality of life despite having the world's largest oil reserves. The country's inflation rate has topped 68 percent, the currency has been in a tailspin for months and the black market has become dominant as state-owned shops contend with chronic food shortages.
Mr. Ledezma, a democratically elected official who has, so far, responded with remarkable stoicism, is the latest mayor critical of the government embroiled in legal proceedings. Mr. Maduro's government has opened cases against 33 of the 50 mayors in the country who have been critical of his leadership.
The State Department responded forcefully to denounce the move on Mr. Ledezma and refute the charge that Washington was helping plot a coup. "We regret that the Venezuelan government continues to blame the United States or other members of the international community for events inside Venezuela," the State Department said in a statement. "The Venezuelan government needs to deal with the grave situation it faces."
In a televised address, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia also expressed concern about the developments in Venezuela, a neighboring country, as he made an impassioned plea that democratic principles be respected.
While Mr. Maduro may claim that he's taking action against a potential coup, the fact is that the opposition movement is poorly organized and has not been able to mobilize against Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, the populist leader Hugo Chávez.
Leaders critical of Mr. Maduro have ideological differences about policy and have been at odds over the best strategy to bring about political change. As the situation in the country worsens, they would be wise to unite to champion democratic principles in months leading up to legislative elections expected to take place late this year.
Articulating an attractive and viable option to Mr. Maduro's authoritarian and erratic rule would give distressed voters a way to oust him at the ballot box. With so many of the strongest opposition leaders facing charges, this obviously will not be an easy feat. But if the international community continues to champion their cause, and insist that a fair election is held, it might be possible.
Mr. Maduro's conspiracy theories surely won't cease, but even among many of his supporters, his credibility is nearly gone.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- WITH the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign underway and millions of Americans still hurting financially, both parties are looking for ways to address wage stagnation. That's the good news. The bad news is that both parties are offering tax cuts as a solution. What has hurt workers' paychecks is not what the government takes out, but what their employers no longer put in -- a dynamic that tax cuts cannot eliminate.
Wage stagnation is a decades-long phenomenon. Between 1979 and 2014, while the gross domestic product grew 150 percent and productivity grew 75 percent, the inflation-adjusted hourly wage of the median worker rose just 5.6 percent -- less than 0.2 percent a year. And since 2002, the bottom 80 percent of wage earners, including both male and female college graduates, have actually seen their wages stagnate or fall.
At the same time, taxation does not explain why middle-income families are having a harder time making ends meet, even as they increase their education and become ever more productive. According to the latest Congressional Budget Office data, the middle 60 percent of families paid just 3.2 percent of their income in federal income taxes in 2011, less than half what they paid in 1979.
Yes, a one-time reduction in taxes through, say, expanded child care credits or a secondary earner tax break, as Democrats propose, could help families. But as wages continue to stagnate, it is impossible to continuously cut taxes and still pay for things like education and social programs for the growing population of older Americans.
Republican tax proposals, like the reforms put forward by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, focus on lowering individual and corporate tax rates alongside revenue-saving efforts to simplify the tax code. But this same approach has been tried for decades -- the same decades in which wages have continued to stagnate. Instead, these cuts have helped corporations, shareholders and the top 1 percent capture a larger share of economic growth.
Similarly, President George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which likewise promised to increase middle-class income, were followed by slower productivity and wage stagnation. The latest proposed Republican cuts won't even provide much short-term relief, as they tend to be targeted at the highest-income households. For example, under a much-touted proposal by Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the middle fifth would gain just $279 in tax relief a year, according to the Tax Policy Center, while the top 0.1 percent would garner the largest rate cut, valued at $248,000.
Obtaining better economic growth, another goal of these cuts, is certainly worthwhile, but it establishes only the potential for broad-based wage growth -- it's no guarantee. Again, we have seen plenty of growth since 1979, but this expansion has not "trickled down" to middle-wage workers.
The challenge is to ensure that a typical worker's wages grow along with profits and productivity. There is no silver bullet, but the key is to make raising wages the central focus of economic policy making and to reverse decades of decisions that have undercut wage growth.
We need to start with monetary policy. In the next few years, the most important decisions being made about wages are those of the Federal Reserve Board as it determines the scale and pace at which it raises interest rates -- and thereby slows job growth. Before raising rates, it is essential we achieve a robust recovery, with roughly 3.5 to 4 percent annual wage growth. This will ensure that wage growth matches productivity growth and that everyone can benefit from the rebounding economy.
Another short- to medium-term policy decision affecting wage growth is to avoid trade deals, such as the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, that would further erode Americans' wages and send jobs overseas.
And there are several things we can do to bolster the labor standards and institutions that support wage growth. Raising the minimum wage to $12.50 an hour by 2020 would ensure that the minimum wage equals more than half the average wage, as it did in the late 1960s. And it has been too long since we have raised the salary threshold for overtime pay; raising it to $50,000, so that anyone making below that would get overtime, would move us closer to what prevailed in the 1970s, when about two-thirds of salaried workers received overtime pay.
Protecting and expanding workers' right to unionize and bargain collectively is also essential; the erosion of collective bargaining is the single largest factor suppressing wage growth for middle-wage workers over the last few decades. And we need to modernize our New Deal-era labor standards to include earned sick leave and paid family leave so workers can balance work and family.
Finally, stronger laws and enforcement to deter and remedy wage theft and the illegal treatment of employees as independent contractors could put tens of billions of dollars into workers' pockets.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, wage stagnation is not a result of forces beyond our control. It is a result of a policy regime that has undercut the individual and collective bargaining power of most workers. Because wage stagnation was caused by policy, it can be reversed by policy, too.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- For a glimpse into Venezuela's economic disarray, slip into a travel agency here and book a round-trip flight to Maracaibo, on the other side of the country, for just $16. Need a book to read on the plane? For those with hard currency, a new copy of "50 Shades of Grey" goes for $2.50. Forget your toothpaste? A tube of Colgate costs 7 cents.
Quite the bargain, right?
But for the majority of Venezuelans who lack easy access to dollars, such surreal prices reflect a tremendous currency devaluation and a crumbling economy expected to contract 7 percent this year as oil income plunges and price controls produce acute shortages of items including milk, detergent and condoms.
"I've seen people die on the operating table because we didn't have the basic tools for surgeries," said Valentina Herrera, 35, a pediatrician at a public hospital in Maracay, a city near Caracas. She said she planned to look for other work because making ends meet on her salary of 5,622 bolívars a month -- $33 at a new exchange rate unveiled recently -- was impossible.
Faced with tumbling approval ratings as Venezuelans reel from the economic shock, President Nicolás Maduro is intensifying a crackdown on his opponents, reflected in last week's arrest of Antonio Ledezma, the mayor of Caracas, and his indictment on charges of conspiracy and plotting an American-backed coup.
Mr. Maduro, a protégé of President Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013, has adopted an increasingly shrill tone against critics of Venezuela's so-called Bolivarian Revolution. As evidence against Mr. Ledezma, Mr. Maduro pointed to an open letter this month calling for "a national agreement for a transition" that was signed by Mr. Ledezma; Leopoldo López, another opposition figure who has been imprisoned for the past year; and María Corina Machado, an opposition politician charged in December with plotting to assassinate Mr. Maduro.
"In Venezuela we are thwarting a coup supported and promoted from the north," Mr. Maduro said over the weekend on Twitter. "The aggression of power from the United States is total and on a daily basis."
Mr. Maduro is taking a page from Mr. Chávez, who was briefly ousted in a 2002 coup with the Bush administration's tacit approval, then made attacking Washington and locking up people suspected of being putschists a fixture of his government. But the State Department has disputed Mr. Maduro's claims, saying the United States is not promoting unrest in Venezuela.
At the same time, the move by Mr. Maduro points to a hardening in how opposition figures here are treated. Thirty-three of the 50 opposition mayors in the country are now facing legal action in connection with antigovernment protests last year that left 43 people dead, according to Gerardo Blyde, the mayor of Baruta, a Caracas municipality.
One prominent opposition mayor, Daniel Ceballos of the city of San Cristóbal, has been in jail for the past year, while another, Enzo Scarano of the industrial town of San Diego in Carabobo State, was transferred from jail to house arrest last month because of deteriorating health.
The arrest of Mr. Ledezma, 59, who was democratically elected but had much of his authority stripped away in 2009, has even some pro-Chávez analysts questioning the wisdom of Mr. Maduro's move. While Mr. Ledezma joined a hardline faction of the opposition last year called "the Exit," he was not viewed as especially prominent or influential.
"Fueling suspicion is a distraction tactic from the huge currency devaluation we've had to withstand," said Nicmer Evans, a pro-Chávez political consultant who is among those on the left here now openly criticizing Mr. Maduro. "What's not clear is the proof of wrongdoing in this case."
With inflation soaring to a rate of 68 percent, the Venezuelan authorities are seeking to manage the economic crisis with a complex web of three official exchange rates. For instance, some basic goods are imported at rates of 6.3 and 12 bolívars to the dollar, but a new floating rate of about 171 was introduced last week, effectively reflecting a devaluation of nearly 70 percent.
On the black market, which some Venezuelans already use to carry out basic transactions, the rate is even higher.
Even for some Chávez loyalists, Mr. Maduro seems to be in over his head in dealing with the scramble for hard currency. Jorge Giordani, one of the late president's top economic advisers, said this month that Venezuela was emerging as Latin America's "laughingstock," citing corruption and labyrinthine bureaucracy as factors accentuating the economic quagmire.
"We need to acknowledge the crisis, comrades," said Mr. Giordani, whom the president ousted last year as finance and planning minister.
Indeed, some economists say that the government's hesitance to overhaul its perplexing currency controls could intensify Venezuela's economic problems.
"The system is going haywire," said Francisco Rodríguez, chief Andean economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, emphasizing that galloping price increases could soon enter the realm of hyperinflation, accelerating to triple digits this year and to more than 1,000 percent in 2016 if policies are maintained.
Mr. Maduro seems to recognize that some profound economic changes are needed in Venezuela, which commands the world's largest oil reserves, creating the illusion of inexhaustible wealth. He supports raising the price of gasoline, which costs less than 10 cents a gallon at the strongest official exchange rate; there is considerable resistance to such a shift even though the fuel subsidy costs the government more than $12 billion a year.
But ahead of congressional elections this year in which Mr. Maduro's supporters seem vulnerable, the president is also seeking to shore up his base.
Mr. Ledezma's wife, Mitzy, told Reuters on Sunday that the president was showing his dictatorial tendencies. "He knows that every day there are more opponents," she said.
Despite the widespread complaints about hardship and high levels of violent crime, some here remain loyal to Mr. Maduro out of gratitude for a vast array of social welfare programs.
"I'll vote for Maduro until I die," said Marco Miraval, 77, who sells coconuts in 23 de Enero, a sprawling housing complex that is a bastion for pro-Chávez groups, pointing to Mr. Maduro's support of subsidized university education and health care. He said Venezuela's economic problems were a result of Washington's pressure on the government. "It's because they're being sabotaged by this economic war," he said.
Still, while Venezuela's opposition remains divided and hampered by the arrests of some leading figures, Mr. Maduro lacks the oratorical skill of Mr. Chávez, who skewered his opponents in what often seemed like a stream-of-consciousness approach to governing that kept many Venezuelans on the edge of their seats.
"Maduro is trying to consolidate his leadership without having the charisma to do so," said Margarita López Maya, a historian who studies protest movements, describing his latest moves as amounting to "an excess of authoritarianism."
In the meantime, bizarre prices persist for many basic services, punishing those who earn and save in bolívars while benefiting an elite with access to hard currency in bank accounts abroad. For instance, monthly broadband service from the state telecommunications company costs less than the equivalent of $1. The monthly electricity bill for a huge luxury apartment, with air-conditioning on at all hours, comes to less than $2.
Even that absurdly cheap flight to Maracaibo is more complicated than it appears since some airlines have trouble obtaining the dollars they need to maintain their planes.
"You'll see things you'll never believe: half a dozen aircraft from just one airline just waiting on the ground because they don't have parts," said Nicolás Veloz, a pilot based in Caracas.
For some Venezuelans who are struggling to get by, the economic disorder they see explains the president's targeting of his opponents. "Maduro is terrified, and so he's using more totalitarian methods, putting politicians in prison with so many police," said Eduardo de Sousa, 28, a pharmaceutical lab assistant. "They know that the revolution is over, and they're scared."

Full text:   HUNTINGTON, W.Va. -- For Tabitha Waugh, it was another typical day of chaos on the sixth-floor cancer ward.
The fire alarm was blaring for the second time that afternoon, prompting patients to stumble out of their rooms. One confused elderly man approached Ms. Waugh, a registered nurse at St. Mary's Medical Center here, but she had no time to console him. An aide was shouting from another room, where a patient sat dazed on the edge of his bed, blood pooling on the floor from the IV he had yanked from his vein.
"Hey, big guy, can you lay back in bed?" she asked, as she cleaned the patient before inserting a new line. He winced. "Hold my hand, O.K.?" she said.
Ms. Waugh, who is 30 and the main breadwinner in her family of four, still had three hours to go before the end of a 12-hour shift. But despite the stresses and constant demands, all the hard work was paying off.
Her wage of nearly $27 an hour provides for a comfortable life that includes a three-bedroom home, a pickup truck and a new sport utility vehicle, tumbling classes for her 3-year-old, Piper, and dozens of brightly colored Thomas the Tank Engine cars heaped under the double bed of her 6-year-old, Collin.
The daughter of a teacher's aide and a gas station manager, Ms. Waugh, like many other hard-working and often overlooked Americans, has secured a spot in a profoundly transformed middle class. While the group continues to include large numbers of people sitting at desks, far fewer middle-income workers of the 21st century are donning overalls. Instead, reflecting the biggest change in recent years, millions more are in scrubs.
"We used to think about the men going out with their lunch bucket to their factory, and those were good jobs," said Jane Waldfogel, a professor at Columbia University who studies work and family issues. "What's the corresponding job today? It's in the health care sector."
In 1980, 1.4 million jobs in health care paid a middle-class wage: $40,000 to $80,000 a year in today's money. Now, the figure is 4.5 million.
The pay of registered nurses -- now the third-largest middle-income occupation and one that continues to be overwhelmingly female -- has risen strongly along with the increasing demands of the job. The median salary of $61,000 a year in 2012 was 55 percent greater, adjusted for inflation, than it was three decades earlier.
And it was about $9,000 more than the shriveled wages of, say, a phone company repairman, who would have been more likely to head a middle-class family in the 1980s. Back then, more than a quarter of middle-income jobs were in manufacturing, a sector long dominated by men. Today, it is just 13 percent.
As the job market has shifted, women, in general, have more skillfully negotiated the twists and turns of the new economy, rushing to secure jobs in health care and other industries that demand more education and training. Men, by contrast, have been less successful at keeping up.
In many working- and middle-class households, women now earn the bigger paycheck, work longer hours and have greater opportunities for career advancement. As a result, millions of American families are being reconfigured along with the economy.
"The culture still has traditional attitudes about who does what, who brings home the bacon and who scrambles the eggs," said Isabel Sawhill, co-director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution. "The economy is now out of sync with the culture, and I think that's creating tensions within marriage."
A New Springboard
At the Waughs' house, it is T.J. Waugh, 33, who picks up the couple's two children from the babysitter when he leaves his afternoon shift at a small plant in Huntington.
By the time Ms. Waugh arrives home in rural Salt Rock from her shift, often far later than her 7 p.m. quitting time, the children have been bathed and fed.
The house is usually messy. The bathroom walls are covered with scribbles from bath crayons; dirty clothes pile up. Ms. Waugh often jams six 12-hour shifts into one week, leaving little time for cleaning and laundry. Mr. Waugh mows the lawn and will run the vacuum cleaner now and then, and if there are no clean towels, Ms. Waugh will do a load of laundry. Otherwise, housework waits until she has a stretch of days off.
"I'm just really tired when I get home," Ms. Waugh said.
Ms. Waugh is the keeper of the family's books. That she out-earns her husband -- a pipe fitter who hunts deer and plays men's softball on the weekends -- is an unspoken given.
"She doesn't rub that in," he said.
Without missing a beat, Ms. Waugh adds, "It doesn't matter where it comes from."
Most of the new jobs produced by America's sprawling economy -- especially since the turn of the century -- are either in highly paid occupations that often require an advanced degree, or, more predominantly, in lower-paid positions providing direct services that cannot be sent overseas and, at least for now, are difficult to automate.
But even with a hollowing out of the job market and a broad stagnation in wages, an analysis by The New York Times has found, a set of occupations has emerged that holds promise as the base of a more robust middle class.
Many are in health care, which has grown sharply over the last few decades.
Economists at the Labor Department project that by 2022, as baby boomers age, health care and social assistance will absorb nearly 20 percent of consumer spending, double the share of manufactured goods. The sector is expected to support over 21 million jobs, five million more than today. This includes half a million more registered nurses.
A Rare Green Shoot
The reordering of the economic landscape can be seen all over West Virginia's old coal country, where billboards along the highways that run through the region advertise a new cardiac center and an orthopedic clinic; and where a strip mall houses Scrubs Unlimited, a medical outfitter, its retail floor crammed with nursing uniforms in 38 colors and Peter Pan prints.
Hugging the Ohio River as it bends around the Appalachian foothills, Cabell County, which includes Huntington, has often found itself on the wrong side of economic change. The population -- about 97,000 today -- has shrunk 10 percent over the last three decades, as the old have died and many of the young have left.
The railroad that helps shuttle coal to Huntington, one of the nation's busiest inland ports, is still a source of jobs. But manufacturing employment -- once clustered at the long-gone glassmaking plants and furniture makers -- has dwindled to fewer than 5,000 jobs. Recently, a 1920s-era nickel alloy plant laid off dozens of workers after a bankruptcy, a corporate acquisition and weak sales.
In real terms, wages in Cabell County now are lower than in the 1970s, stumbling along well below the national average. One in five residents lives in poverty.
The health care industry -- which added 3,000 jobs here over the last 10 years -- is one of the few green shoots in a struggling economy.
West Virginia has been battered by the same forces that have reshaped the nation since the late 1970s, when global competition, an overvalued dollar, declining unions and advanced technology began to undercut the jobs created during America's industrial heyday, deepening income inequality. And since 2000, the share of middle-income workers has been squeezed and wages have stagnated.
Yet many of the jobs added in medical services here and across the nation have turned out to be surprisingly good ones.
That was what motivated the only male registered nurse colleague of Ms. Waugh's on the sixth-floor cancer unit, Johnny Dial, a former highway construction worker and heavy equipment mechanic. More men are joining nursing, but they still make up only 10 percent of the ranks, compared with 4 percent in 1980.
As Mr. Dial contemplated supporting a family, it came down to health care or the railroad if he wanted job security and benefits. He chose what he thought would be a more fulfilling career, and the same one as his wife, who is also a nurse.
"You get to help people," Mr. Dial said.
Women Stepped Up
Similar thinking was behind the career choices of Ms. Waugh's fellow female R.N.s. They include a former waitress, a former journalist, an ex-administrator in a metals factory and a former store clerk at Bath & Body Works. In addition to the satisfaction of the work, they all said, the wages are generally better in health care than they could find in other fields.
Ms. Waugh has urged her husband to try to move up at his company, where he earns about $40,000 in regular wages, plus pay for occasional extra shifts, or to switch to a more lucrative career, maybe even in health care as a radiology technician.
But for Mr. Waugh, the only way up at the plant is to go into sales, a promotion he already turned down because he said he did not want to "deal with people." He could earn more in the coal mines, but that work is dirty and dangerous.
Mr. Waugh has talked about trying college again; he dropped out twice in the past. At one point, his wife even filled out application papers for him to jump-start his re-enrollment, but he did not pursue class work.
"My philosophy is he is lazy," Ms. Waugh said, standing in the hospital's white hallway. "That's what makes me so mad."
For all the troubles associated with traditionally male jobs, women have not had an easy ride through the economic turmoil, either.
"The occupational structure has not somehow become more women-friendly," said David Autor, an economist at M.I.T. who has studied the changing American job market. In fact, he added, "the hollowing out of middle-skill jobs was larger for women than for men." The process intensified sharply during the financial crisis and the ensuing economic downturn.
But in general women have reacted much better, climbing the educational ladder to capture more of the better jobs. Today, 38 percent of women in their late 20s and early 30s have a college degree, compared with 15 percent 40 years ago. The completion rate for young men is now 7 percentage points lower than for women -- back then it was 7 points higher.
This has given women an edge in the new job market: Today, almost 58 percent of registered nurses have a bachelor's degree or more, compared with about a third in 1980.
This is true across the range of occupations capable of supporting a middle-class life. In 1980, 55 percent of workers who earned the equivalent of $40,000 to $80,000 in today's dollars had at most a high school diploma, according to the analysis by The Times, which reviewed census returns for employed people ages 25 to 64. Only a quarter had a college degree. Today, the share of college graduates has risen to about 41 percent, while just under 31 percent have completed no more than high school.
"The days when a very, very substantial share of the work force would be able to make good middle-class incomes from jobs that did not require post-high school training are just not the case anymore," said Francine D. Blau, an economics professor at Cornell University.
Men still hold most of the top jobs in the economy, including seven out of 10 jobs that pay over $80,000 a year. But women are rapidly moving up the ranks. Women hold 44 percent of middle-income jobs, compared with about a quarter 30 years ago.
These trends may not hold forever. Though educational attainment continues to rise for women, their progress in the workplace -- in terms of both wages and jobs -- has slowed significantly. Tighter controls on the cost of health care could weaken the job growth and pay raises helping support the new American middle. And while the industry is largely immune to foreign competition, it may be affected by advances in labor-saving technology.
Even as more women get ahead, many men are struggling to grab a handhold into higher-paying jobs. After her husband was laid off from a string of auto mechanic jobs, Donna Colbey, 53, urged him to switch careers and become a radiology technician.
It was a job Ms. Colbey knew would offer a good salary and require only two years of training. She had taken the same route, which eventually led her to a nursing career at a Washington hospital.
He enrolled in the courses but dropped out after a few months.
"He got tripped up over the math and didn't go back," said Ms. Colbey, who regularly picks up extra shifts to support her family.
A Relentless Pursuit
Far more is expected of nurses now than even two decades ago. Medical advances have kept patients alive longer, meaning many are sicker with more complex illnesses than in the past. Nurses must master technology that helps both treat and track patients, and they are called on to coordinate not just with doctors but also social workers and physical therapists.
At St. Mary's Medical Center, Ms. Waugh, in her navy scrubs, fed potassium on a recent day into the vein of one woman with a broken hip who was on the cancer floor because of a lack of beds. She gave anti-nausea medicine to a moaning young man with liver cancer in the midst of chemotherapy and prepared pills for a half-dozen other patients, documenting it all on a computer.
An outpatient arrived for his regular blood-drawing and, squatting alongside him in a waiting room, Ms. Waugh unbuttoned his shirt and collected blood from an access port in his chest.
Ms. Waugh's pursuit of learning to advance her career has been relentless. By her own count, she has been out of school for no longer than two years since kindergarten.
All that education has come with a cost. The couple has amassed about $50,000 in student debt. Ms. Waugh would like to send her children to a better school, but the $10,000 annual tuition that would require is out of reach. "I can't save for their college and send them to private school," she said.
To her husband's co-workers who are raising families on pipe fitters' salaries, the Waugh family is rich. Ms. Waugh's purchase of a new Toyota S.U.V. raised eyebrows around the plant.
"We're not wealthy," Mr. Waugh said, "but we're not poor."
It hasn't been easy getting to this point. As she made the rounds at the hospital, Ms. Waugh explained how her family was set back in 2008 after Collin was born. She stayed home for one year with the boy, who had digestive problems and required expensive formula. Living on just Mr. Waugh's salary, they ran through their savings and they accumulated credit card debt that they are still paying off.
"That was a horrible financial situation," Ms. Waugh said.
But later this year, when her classes and other course work are finished, Ms. Waugh will qualify as a nurse practitioner, a job that she expects will allow her to earn at least 50 percent more than her current salary. And she will be prepared, she believes, for almost anything to come.
"I knew if I was a nurse I could be self-sufficient," she said, "and wouldn't have to rely on anyone to take care of me."

Full text:   Regular readers know that I sometimes mock "very serious people" -- politicians and pundits who solemnly repeat conventional wisdom that sounds tough-minded and realistic. The trouble is that sounding serious and being serious are by no means the same thing, and some of those seemingly tough-minded positions are actually ways to dodge the truly hard issues.
The prime example of recent years was, of course, Bowles-Simpsonism -- the diversion of elite discourse away from the ongoing tragedy of high unemployment and into the supposedly crucial issue of how, exactly, we will pay for social insurance programs a couple of decades from now. That particular obsession, I'm happy to say, seems to be on the wane. But my sense is that there's a new form of issue-dodging packaged as seriousness on the rise. This time, the evasion involves trying to divert our national discourse about inequality into a discussion of alleged problems with education.
And the reason this is an evasion is that whatever serious people may want to believe, soaring inequality isn't about education; it's about power.
Just to be clear: I'm in favor of better education. Education is a friend of mine. And it should be available and affordable for all. But what I keep seeing is people insisting that educational failings are at the root of still-weak job creation, stagnating wages and rising inequality. This sounds serious and thoughtful. But it's actually a view very much at odds with the evidence, not to mention a way to hide from the real, unavoidably partisan debate.
The education-centric story of our problems runs like this: We live in a period of unprecedented technological change, and too many American workers lack the skills to cope with that change. This "skills gap" is holding back growth, because businesses can't find the workers they need. It also feeds inequality, as wages soar for workers with the right skills but stagnate or decline for the less educated. So what we need is more and better education.
My guess is that this sounds familiar -- it's what you hear from the talking heads on Sunday morning TV, in opinion articles from business leaders like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, in "framing papers" from the Brookings Institution's centrist Hamilton Project. It's repeated so widely that many people probably assume it's unquestionably true. But it isn't.
For one thing, is the pace of technological change really that fast? "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters," the venture capitalist Peter Thiel has snarked. Productivity growth, which surged briefly after 1995, seems to have slowed sharply.
Furthermore, there's no evidence that a skills gap is holding back employment. After all, if businesses were desperate for workers with certain skills, they would presumably be offering premium wages to attract such workers. So where are these fortunate professions? You can find some examples here and there. Interestingly, some of the biggest recent wage gains are for skilled manual labor -- sewing machine operators, boilermakers -- as some manufacturing production moves back to America. But the notion that highly skilled workers are generally in demand is just false.
Finally, while the education/inequality story may once have seemed plausible, it hasn't tracked reality for a long time. "The wages of the highest-skilled and highest-paid individuals have continued to increase steadily," the Hamilton Project says. Actually, the inflation-adjusted earnings of highly educated Americans have gone nowhere since the late 1990s.
So what is really going on? Corporate profits have soared as a share of national income, but there is no sign of a rise in the rate of return on investment. How is that possible? Well, it's what you would expect if rising profits reflect monopoly power rather than returns to capital.
As for wages and salaries, never mind college degrees -- all the big gains are going to a tiny group of individuals holding strategic positions in corporate suites or astride the crossroads of finance. Rising inequality isn't about who has the knowledge; it's about who has the power.
Now, there's a lot we could do to redress this inequality of power. We could levy higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, and invest the proceeds in programs that help working families. We could raise the minimum wage and make it easier for workers to organize. It's not hard to imagine a truly serious effort to make America less unequal.
But given the determination of one major party to move policy in exactly the opposite direction, advocating such an effort makes you sound partisan. Hence the desire to see the whole thing as an education problem instead. But we should recognize that popular evasion for what it is: a deeply unserious fantasy.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- The mayor of Caracas, Antonio Ledezma, who was arrested last week by intelligence agents, has been indicted on charges of conspiracy against the Venezuelan government and plotting an American-backed coup.
The government said late Friday that charges had been brought against Mr. Ledezma, 59, and that he would be moved from a military intelligence facility to the Ramo Verde military prison just outside the capital, which for a year has housed Leopoldo López, an opposition figure who was charged with inciting major antigovernment unrest.
Mr. Ledezma's lawyer, Omar Estacio, said Saturday that the maximum sentence for the charges was 25 years in prison.
"The accusations are weak, and we believe we will win a favorable decision," Mr. Estacio said. "The family is, of course, worried, but Mr. Ledezma remains calm and optimistic."
President Nicolás Maduro appeared on state television the night after Mr. Ledezma's arrest on Thursday and railed against the United States, specifically comments from the White House on Friday that the Obama administration was considering "tools" to "better steer the Venezuelan government."
"For a long time in Latin America, we have stripped away American imperialist aggression," Mr. Maduro said in a speech to a crowd of supporters. "I feel sorry for President Obama because he is trapped in an alley without an exit, and he now thinks the way out is to attack Venezuela."
Mr. Maduro then criticized those in Venezuela he saw as conspiring with Washington.
"In Venezuela, no one is untouchable," he said. "The coup plotting is over. Whoever wants to seek that past will be met with the fist of the people, an iron fist."
Small protests have taken place across Venezuela against Mr. Ledezma's arrest. The president's approval ratings are very low, thanks in large part to a crumbling economy with an annual inflation rate of about 70 percent and major shortages of basic goods.
The arrest of Mr. Ledezma and the repeated criticism of the United States by the government are seen by critics as an effort to divert attention from the country's problems before legislative elections late this year and a potential referendum in 2016 on whether to dismiss the government.
Henrique Capriles Radonski, an opposition leader and two-time presidential candidate, said Friday that the government's days were numbered.
"It's so obvious. This revolution is over," Mr. Capriles said. "They don't want elections because they know they will lose."
Mr. Maduro said that further evidence of a United States-backed coup attempt would be presented.
The president's primary ammunition against Mr. Ledezma was an open letter earlier this month calling for a "national agreement for a transition," and signed by Mr. Ledezma, Mr. López and María Corina Machado, an opposition politician charged in December with plotting to assassinate Mr. Maduro.

Abstract: Data collected by the Federal Reserve and analyzed in a recent paper by Edward N.

Full text:   Debt is a double-edged sword. Charles Dickens's character Wilkins Micawber warned eloquently of debt's downside: "Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pound ought and six, result misery."
He was certainly right: Debt can blight your life. But what Mr. Micawber didn't say is that debt can make you much wealthier. Then it's called leverage, and it can supercharge your investment returns if you use it wisely.
To a startling degree, the two sides of debt -- its destructive and its beneficial powers -- have been responsible for the shifting fortunes of vast numbers of Americans since the turn of the century. Data collected by the Federal Reserve and analyzed in a recent paper by Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, makes it clear that many American households of moderate means got much richer, on paper, anyway, from 2001 to 2007, largely because of rising home prices combined with mortgage debt.
The data also shows that when the housing market soured, that debt intensified an extraordinarily sharp decline in the household wealth of most Americans from 2007 to 2010. The effects of that shocking decline on the wealth of American households since then -- and the proper role of debt in the future -- are much less obvious. But important and sometimes counterintuitive lessons about the use and abuse of debt are already emerging from the data.
First, consider that while debt is inherently dangerous, when it's handled carefully and appropriately it may be a very good thing. It's easy, after the ravages of the last recession, to forget that during the exhilarating period from 2001 to 2007, many middle-class American homeowners had good reasons to be happy about their mortgage debt. It helped give the middle 60 percent of American households better overall investment returns than people who were much better off -- those in the top 1 percent. "That differential in the rate of return is pretty remarkable," Mr. Wolff said in an interview. "It shows you that debt, in that period, had a very positive wealth effect. It's why people in the middle had higher returns -- when you include debt -- than people at the very top."
Here's the reason: While people in the top 1 percent tend to carry very little debt as a proportion of their overall assets, people in less exalted financial strata typically need to carry mortgage debt to finance a house, which is usually their most important asset. In the most basic terms, the beneficial effect of leverage works like this: If you invest $100,000 and it grows to $103,000 in one year, after inflation, then your real annual rate of return is 3 percent. If you've borrowed half the money, or $50,000, and pay 2 percent interest, or $1,000, on the loan, your net return is $2,000. But because your investment was only $50,000, that's a better rate of return -- of 4 percent.
In other words, by borrowing, you increased your rate of return. That's what happens for homeowners when they hold a mortgage and the value of their house rises. What's more, as a matter of longstanding public policy in the United States, additional benefits are bestowed on homeowners with mortgages, who can reduce their income taxes by taking a mortgage interest deduction. And as I've written, government and quasi-government entities have been actively supporting the housing and mortgage markets for years, adding to the benefits of homeownership.
From 2001 to 2007, in one sense, the mortgage advantage outweighed the considerable benefits enjoyed by households in the top 1 percent, whose wealth gives them access to the most rarefied opportunities in the stock, bond and commodities markets -- and in just about any other area they want to pursue. And, if you leave debt out of it and look at assets alone, much as you might expect, the overall portfolios of households in the top 1 percent were better. They had real annual rates of return of 3.86 percent from 2001 to 2007, compared with only 2.95 percent for people in the middle 60 percent, according to data derived by Mr. Wolff from the Federal Reserve's 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances. It appears in his paper, "Household Wealth Trends in the United States, 1962-2013: What Happened Over the Great Recession?"
Add debt to the mix, however, and you turbocharge the returns. Thanks to leverage, the net assets of the middle 60 percent of households, including the effect of debt, increased 5.95 percent in those years, far better than the 4.03 percent gain for households in the top 1 percent.
Wealthier people shared in the benefits of homeownership too -- as they do now -- but they have so much other wealth and so little debt as a proportion of their total assets that homeownership isn't as crucial to their net worth. Mr. Wolff has found that in 2013, for example, mortgage debt for the top 1 percent was only 16.5 percent of the value of their homes; for households in the middle 60 percent of the population, mortgage debt accounted for almost 50 percent of home values. And home equity -- the value of your home after loans are subtracted -- accounted for only 7.3 percent of the total assets of the top 1 percent. The comparable number for the middle 60 percent was 31.4 percent.
That's why the net worth of the households in the middle took such a savage beating after housing prices began to fall in 2007. From 2007 to 2010, leverage was a terrible weapon that hurt the middle class much more severely than the top 1 percent. In that period, Mr. Wolff has found, after inflation, without counting the effects of debt, the total portfolios of the top 1 percent declined 6.37 percent annually. The comparable decline for the middle 60 percent of the population was 7.06 percent.
When you add debt to the calculation, the picture is far worse for the middle 60 percent. The real net worth of these households dropped 10.55 percent annually versus a drop of 6.52 percent for the top 1 percent. Those are the most severe losses in many decades.
From the standpoint of wealth, poorer people endured vastly more punishing blows than both the very wealthy and those of more moderate incomes, the data shows. The poorest 20 percent of the population was in bad shape to start with. In 2001, these households were already locked in the Micawber nightmare, unable to pay their bills and spiraling downward. They had an average negative net worth of $10,800, and while the rest of the country was getting richer they were falling further behind. By 2007 they had an average net worth of negative $15,200 -- and by 2010 they plunged further into a negative net worth, on average, of $25,500. Few of these people owned homes, but when the mortgage crisis hit, they suffered acutely.
The big picture, of course, is that carnage in the American housing and mortgage markets led to a global financial crisis and contributed to a worldwide recession. Those shocks led to foreclosures, a drop in the rate of homeownership, a reduction in mortgage debt -- and the still transitional asset markets with which we are grappling today.
While the most recent figures available from the Federal Reserve show that both the median and mean incomes of American households had not yet recovered by the end of 2013, it's a different situation for wealth. Mean, or average, household wealth has reached a new high. Federal Reserve statistics on wealth show that from June to September (the third quarter) of last year, average wealth was 9.4 percent higher than in the first quarter of 2008, its previous peak. Asset prices have been rising, especially in the stock market, and wealthier households, which own far more stock, have benefited disproportionately.
The rich could have done even better if they had used more leverage, Mr. Wolff noted. "It's surprising, when you look at the numbers, that rich people don't take on more debt," Mr. Wolff said. "They can withstand the downturns -- and the debt would increase their returns and make them richer over the long run."
For everyone else, debt raises much trickier questions. Should public policy encourage people to take on more debt, or should we follow Mr. Micawber's advice and try to avoid it? Should poorer people be encouraged to take on debt in order to gain a foothold on the road to wealth? These are complex issues, and I expect to return to them.

Full text:   Walmart is the biggest private employer in America, with 1.3 million United States workers. And many of them will soon see a raise, in the latest snippet of corporate news that suggests a firmer job market is starting to enable workers to successfully demand higher pay.
The company said it would pay even its lowest-level workers at least $9 an hour starting this spring, comfortably above the $7.25 federal minimum wage, and push that to $10 in 2016. The company also said it would strengthen a "department manager" role, giving it a minimum wage of $13 per hour this year and $15 next, thus offering low-wage hourly workers a clearer path to advancement. Including similar bumps at Walmart-owned Sam's Clubs, the company expects 500,000 workers to receive a raise at a cost of $1 billion a year, executives said in a conference call with reporters.
Walmart is surely hoping to get plenty of good press for its decision to offer raises, but it's worth examining the decision less based on whether they deserve applause on some moral grounds and more based on the economic forces that led them to act. Indeed, the best possible news would be if Walmart's executives made this decision not out of a desire for good press or for a squishy sense of do-gooderism, but because coldhearted business strategy compelled it.
A first reaction to Thursday's news may be simply: What took so long?
This has been a challenging five-year period in which, despite steady economic growth, average hourly wages for nonmanagerial workers have risen around 2 percent a year, barely more than inflation. There is no doubt that working on the floor of a Walmart store is still going to be a hard job at a pay level that makes it hard to get by. But these are enormous percentage gains, and the decision by Walmart comes on the heels of a similar announcement by the health insurer Aetna and survey data that also point to a tighter labor market and higher raises in the future.
Back in its 2007 fiscal year, before the recession, Walmart reported $183,500 in revenue per employee and $5,938 in profit. Not bad, but by 2014 those numbers had risen 18 percent and 22 percent. The company's sales and profits rose nicely in that time while the company kept a lid on its payroll. Gains went to Walmart shareholders, not Walmart workers.
So what has changed? The simple answer is that the world for employers is very different with a 5.7 percent unemployment rate (the January level) than it was five years ago, at 9.8 percent. Finding qualified workers is harder for employers now than it was then, and their workers are at risk of jumping ship if they don't receive pay increases or other improvements. Apart from pay, Walmart executives said in their conference call with reporters that they were revising their employee scheduling policies so that workers could have more predictability in their work schedules and more easily get time off when they needed it, such as for a doctor's appointment.
The giant question now is not whether there will be some meaningful wage gains in 2015; beyond the anecdotal evidence from Walmart and Aetna, the collapse in oil prices means even modest pay increases will translate into quite large inflation-adjusted raises. The question is whether wage gains will be strong enough to create a virtuous cycle in which rising pay for the workers at the bottom three-quarters of the income scale, who are most likely to spend the money and get it circulating through the economy, will spur more investment and hiring.
To the degree their logic was, "We think we're going to need to raise wages this much in the next couple of years anyway to retain good workers and maximize profitability, so we may as well get ahead of the curve and get a public relations bump out of it and announce the plans in a big splashy way," that would be the best news for American workers. Because that would imply that it won't just be Walmart workers getting a raise in 2015.

Full text:   PARIS -- The eurozone economy perked up again this month, a private sector report showed on Friday, powered by continuing strength in Germany and surprisingly strong growth in France.
Purchasing managers across the eurozone, the 19-nation currency union, reported increased backlogs of work and an improvement in demand, leading companies to add workers at the fastest pace since August 2011, according to a survey by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm in London.
Markit's composite output index for the eurozone came in at 53.5 for February, up from 52.6 in January. A number above 50 signals that the economy is expanding, while a figure below that suggests contraction. The purchasing managers' data is thought by economists to provide one of the best snapshots of the economy.
Production of official data for the eurozone, compiled from the 19 countries' national statistics agencies, tends to lag behind similar data for the United States and other developed countries.
An index geared specifically to France showed output in February swinging back into expansion, at 52.2 from 49.3 in January, and rising at the fastest pace since the summer of 2011. It was the first increase in French output since last spring, Markit said. German output also reached a seven-month high this month, the company found.
Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, said the February data suggested that the eurozone would post quarterly growth of about 0.3 percent in the January to March period, or about 1.2 percent at an annualized rate.
The economy "is gathering momentum and looks set to gain further traction in coming months," Mr. Williamson wrote in the survey report. Signs that employment is growing at the fastest pace since 2011 suggest that employers are increasingly confident about growth, he added.
The eurozone economy expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, an official report showed last week. While that number was stronger than economists had expected, it was still behind the 2.6 percent annual pace in the United States. With demand crimped by high joblessness and limits on government spending, Europe is still struggling to leave behind the 2008 financial crisis and its debt aftereffects.
Such concerns are currently subservient to the tense negotiations over Greece's finances, amid fears that the country could leave the eurozone.
European officials on Friday were discussing whether to grant the new Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, a six-month extension of a loan agreement so that Athens would have more time to convince its partners that it could come up with a credible growth and repayment plan.
The eurozone's tepid growth and ultralow inflationary pressures led Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, to announce in January an initiative under which the bank will spend up to 60 billion euros, or about $68 billion, each month buying bonds, including government debt. The program of so-called quantitative easing is intended to help restore growth and inflationary pressures by flooding the financial system with liquidity and possibly driving down the euro.
Reinforcing the fears of deflation, a report on Thursday from the French national statistics agency showed that consumer prices in France fell 1 percent in January from December, and 0.4 percent from a year earlier. The core rate, which strips out the impact of falling crude oil prices, came in at 0 percent.
The euro, which has been trading near 11-year lows against the dollar on expectations of bond-buying by the European Central Bank, fell 0.4 percent to $1.1319 on Friday afternoon after the purchasing managers report. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue-chip eurozone equities slipped 0.52 percent.

Full text:   The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended at record highs, without adjustment for inflation, on Friday, after Greek and eurozone finance ministers reached a deal to extend Greece's financial rescue by four months. The Nasdaq notched an eighth consecutive day of gains.
The agreement removes the immediate risk of Greece's running out of money next month and being forced out of the single currency area.
Investors awaited a deal all week. As talks progressed, the euro rebounded and the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury note retreated.
In the United States, the Nasdaq matched an eight-session winning streak from a year ago and inched closer to its 5,132.52 intraday high, which was reached in March 2000 just before the dot-com bubble burst. The S.&P. 500 ended slightly higher for the week as well, its third consecutive week of gains.
Greece's deal should allow investors to concentrate on the fundamentals that should be driving the market, said Benjamin A. Pace, chief investment officer at HPM Partners in New York.
"You're seeing a little bit better U.S. economic statistics than you've been seeing over the past three or four weeks," Mr. Pace said. "The European statistics have gotten a lot better, too."
Surveys indicated on Friday that the eurozone's private sector expanded in February at its fastest pace in seven months, though companies continued to cut prices, suggesting that low inflation remains a challenge for policy makers.
The euro traded up slightly at $1.1375. Against the yen, the dollar pared losses to trade up 0.12 to 119.06.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 154.67 points, or 0.9 percent, at 18,140.44. The S.&P. 500 gained 12.85 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,110.3.
The Nasdaq added 31.27 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 4,955.97. The index, which tracks the 2,500-plus stocks that are listed on the Nasdaq stock market, has advanced 4.6 percent this year, and is up 16.8 percent in the last year.
One stock in particular is giving the Nasdaq a lift: Apple. It has gained 17 percent this year, pushing its market value over $750 billion. The surge means Apple accounts for about 10 percent of the Nasdaq's market value.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent, the S.&P. 500 gained 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq 1.3 percent.
Intuit was among the Nasdaq's biggest positives, rising 6.2 percent to $96.72 a day after reporting a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.
Shares of Nordstrom rose 6 percent to $81.74, and the stock was among the S.&P. 500's biggest percentage gainers, after it reported results. A collection of retailers is scheduled to report next week, including Macy's and Home Depot.
Greek bond yields fell on hopes that eurozone finance ministers would reach a deal. Greek three-year yields dropped 57 basis points to 16.555 percent.
The Greek stalemate overshadowed data pointing to growth in Germany. Halfway into the European earnings season, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to grow 19.5 percent, which would be the best quarter in three and a half years.
The FTSEurofirst 300 is up 11.4 percent so far this year, outpacing a 2.6 percent gain in the S.&P. 500. The European Central Bank's plan to buy government bonds to bolster the economy has seemingly helped the rally.
The gap between the yield of 10-year United States Treasuries and the earnings yield of the S.&P. 500 is at its widest in 40 years, said Alex McKnight, a portfolio manager at GAM in New York.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 2.11 percent. Brent crude oil rose a penny to close at $60.22 in London. Benchmark United States crude fell $1.02 to close at $50.81 a barrel in New York.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- The abrupt arrest of the mayor of Caracas on accusations that he had plotted an American-backed overthrow of the government threatened to plunge Venezuela into new political convulsions on Friday, as his supporters rallied in the capital and pockets of protest erupted elsewhere.
The arrest of the mayor, Antonio Ledezma, on Thursday evening by intelligence agents who fired weapons in the air, was viewed by the opposition as the kidnapping of a political rival to President Nicolás Maduro.
Mr. Ledezma's backers called it another assault on democracy in Venezuela, the oil-endowed nation that has been reeling from a severe economic decline under the watch of an increasingly unpopular president.
Many opposition figures said Mr. Maduro, desperate to divert attention from Venezuela's internal ills and his own disapproval ratings, concocted Mr. Ledezma's arrest.
Mr. Maduro, the protégé of Venezuela's longtime leader Hugo Chávez, often castigates the United States, accusing it of trying to topple his government. He promised, in a nearly three-hour speech soon after the mayor's arrest, to release evidence to demonstrate what he called the secret American plot to topple him.
"Every fascist has his day," Mr. Maduro said.
"I have heard them saying that this is a lie, this is a show," he said, speaking of his political adversaries. "Because the United States gave the order, you have to mock the accusation, it must be trivialized. This is serious."
Mr. Ledezma's lawyer, Omar Estacio, met with his client soon after the arrest. "He's content, in a happy state of mind and not scared of anything," Mr. Estacio said, adding that Mr. Ledezma, 59, had sensed that something was awry.
"He started to be followed around two weeks ago by cyclists, black cars, et cetera," the lawyer said. "He had a feeling, therefore, that something like this would happen."
Mr. Estacio and other witnesses described the method of arrest as disproportionately severe. They said Mr. Ledezma had been working calmly in his office when a dozen armed officials burst in, fired into the air and dragged the mayor away to the intelligence agency's headquarters.
Mr. Maduro confirmed that the mayor would be dealt with by Venezuela's judicial system on what he described as charges committed against the country's "peace, security and constitution."
A hard-line opposition figure and ally of Mr. Ledezma, María Corina Machado, was charged in December with plotting to assassinate Mr. Maduro.
"If anyone in Venezuela knows about coup-plotting, it's Mr. Maduro and those in power right now," said Ms. Machado, referring to a failed coup attempt by Mr. Chávez in February 1992, which the government here continues to celebrate.
The United States has repeatedly denied Mr. Maduro's charges. "These latest accusations, like all the previous such accusations, are baseless," the State Department said in a statement.
"The United States is not promoting unrest in Venezuela, nor are we attempting to undermine Venezuela's economy or its government," the statement read. "Venezuela's problems cannot be solved by criminalizing dissent."
Venezuela is the fourth-largest provider of crude oil to the United States.
Many government critics suggested that Mr. Ledezma's arrest was a means to silence the opposition before legislative elections later this year. The opposition is able to call for a recall referendum in 2016.
Gladys Ramírez, a lawyer who attended a rally Friday against Mr. Ledezma's arrest, said he had been detained because he was the type of leader who could push the government out of power. "This government has lost all perspective," she said. "This isn't democracy. We're suffering a dictatorship."
María Martínez, 68, a retiree, said the government was trying to put a stranglehold on the opposition. "The opposition has been kidnapped, and so the people have been kidnapped," she said. "We've all been kidnapped. I don't know if this is a dictatorship, communism or what. But it's not a democracy."
Mr. Ledezma's arrest came nearly a year after the detention of Leopoldo López, a popular hard-line opposition figure who remains in jail on charges of inciting nationwide unrest.
The collapse in the international price of oil, from which Venezuela derives nearly all of its foreign income, is an important reason for its economic ills. Annual inflation was at 69 percent in 2014, and the country's currency has fallen more than 50 percent in value against the dollar on the black market in the last year. Shortages leave supermarket shelves across the country nearly empty and lines stretching sometimes into the thousands.
"The government is showing force and generating fear," said Luis Vicente León, director of Datanálisis, a polling firm, which has calculated Mr. Maduro's approval ratings in the low 20 percent.
Mr. Maduro's unpopularity, combined with the troubled economy, is raising fears of major unrest like that of early last year, when tens of thousands took to the streets and pitted themselves against the authorities in battles involving Molotov cocktails, rubber bullets and tear gas.
"All us Venezuelans that express views differing from those of Nicolás Maduro have our days numbered," said David Smolansky, the mayor of the nearby municipality of El Hatillo and a member of the opposition party. "The question is when the guillotine falls."

Walmart Lifts Its Wage Floor to $9 an Hour

Abstract: Matthew Shay, the group's chief executive, said: "Government mandates that arbitrarily require businesses to implement politically driven policy are unnecessary and, in fact, create hurdles to job creation, curtail capital investment and pose as barriers to a sustained economic recovery."

Full text:   Walmart, the largest private employer in the country, said on Thursday that it would increase wages for a half-million employees, a move that comes amid persistent scrutiny of its labor practices and high employee turnover.
The retail giant, which for years has been the target of widespread criticism over its low pay structure and increasing reliance on part-time workers, said that all of its United States workers would earn at least $9 an hour by April and at least $10 by next February. Some labor advocates, however, who are demanding $15 an hour for service workers, called the plan inadequate.
The pay raise also signals that a tightening job market -- with the unemployment rate now at 5.7 percent, compared with 9.8 percent five years ago, is leading to higher wages. Walmart has had significant trouble retaining employees in a job market where its competitors like Costco Wholesale offer better wages.
The wage bump by Walmart, which has long been a pay laggard, could simply mean that wage increases are finally an inevitability for low-wage workers in America.
"We're finally going to see a wage creep, and Walmart is trying to get out in front," said Ann C. Hodges, a labor relations expert at the University of Richmond. "They're thinking: We're probably going to do this anyway."
While the company said about 40 percent of its work force, including those at the wholesale Sam's Club outlets, would be affected, many of those raises will amount to much less than a dollar an hour more. About 6,000 employees receive the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. Walmart says its part-time workers already earn an average wage of $9.48, and full-timers an average of $12.85.
Walmart lags behind major retailers like Gap and Ikea, which have moved recently to set hourly wages at or above $9, to try to reduce turnover and attract more workers. Even those higher pay scales fall short of compensation offered by Costco, known to offer wages closer to $20 an hour, or the Container Store.
But Walmart's move could force other major retailers like Target and Home Depot to follow suit. Kroger pays its cashiers $7.26 to $11.99 an hour, according to PayScale, a company that collects data on salaries. Target pays its cashiers $7.42 to $10.09, and Home Depot pays its sales associates $7.90 to $11.16, according to PayScale. "Wage increases could be imminent for other companies," said Oliver Chen, retail analyst at Cowen & Company in New York.
Aside from competitive pressure to hire and retain low-wage workers, political pressure for higher wages has been building. Several states and cities have raised the minimum wage far beyond the federal minimum. Seattle, for example, raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour, and San Francisco approved a tiered approach to reach $15 in a few years.
Twenty-nine states now exceed the federal minimum, which has not risen since 2007, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. President Obama has proposed raising it to $10.10 an hour, but that effort has stalled in Congress.
A spokesman for the White House said, "Today's announcement is another example of businesses, along with cities and states, taking action on their own to raise wages for their workers, recognizing that doing so can raise productivity, reduce turnover and improve morale."
The National Retail Federation, an industry group representing the country's biggest retailers, welcomed Walmart's decision but also used the moment to lobby against legislation.
Matthew Shay, the group's chief executive, said: "Government mandates that arbitrarily require businesses to implement politically driven policy are unnecessary and, in fact, create hurdles to job creation, curtail capital investment and pose as barriers to a sustained economic recovery."
With a domestic work force of 1.3 million people, Walmart has long been a target of labor groups and some politicians. For years, protesters have demonstrated outside Walmart stores for higher pay and better hours, with a highly visible national campaign aided by labor groups that sought to keep an embarrassing spotlight on the retailer's treatment of employees. At one point, the company was pilloried for setting out donation boxes to help some of its own employees on public assistance. Like fast-food workers who have lobbied for better pay, Our Walmart, an advocacy group for store employees, has demanded that the retailer pay at least $15 an hour.
Christine L. Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, credited the persistence of workers and supporters for influencing the outcome.
"Few could have envisioned a group of workers forcing Walmart, ruthlessly committed to cost-cutting, to unilaterally raise wages," she said.
Still, she called the changes inadequate: "When compared to the $16 billion in profit that the company rakes in annually, Walmart's promise of $10 an hour -- which even for a full-time worker is not enough to keep a family of four out of poverty -- is meager."
Fatmata Jabbie, 21, a single mother of two who makes $8.80 an hour as a cashier at the Alexandria Walmart store in Northern Virginia, said she had long requested to work 40 hours a week so she could afford new clothes and diapers for her toddler. But last week, she was assigned just 26 hours, and she has worked as few as 18. Her weekly take-home pay sometimes falls below $200, a figure she did not expect to increase by much.
"It will have a bit of an effect," said Ms. Jabbie, who has worked at Walmart about a year. "But unless they give us more hours, it's not going to be very much."
After the pay increases, the average full-time hourly wage at Walmart will be $13, while the average part-time hourly wage will be $10. And by February 2016, current hourly workers would earn at least $10. Walmart's work force of 1.3 million is split evenly between full-time and part-time workers, it said, and that ratio will not change.
Holly Sklar, chief executive of the Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, a group of business leaders pressing to raise the minimum wage, called for further pay increases.
"It's important that our nation's largest private employer is finally beginning to follow many other companies in raising starting pay. But given that the buying power of the 1968 federal minimum wage is nearly $11 adjusted for inflation, Walmart should be setting higher targets than $9 in April 2015 and $10 in 2016," Ms. Sklar said.
Nevertheless, in addressing other major complaints from workers, Walmart said it would work to make scheduling easier and more predictable and would improve employee training. Together with the wage increases, Walmart is investing $1 billion more in its employees, the retailer said.
"We're providing an opportunity to earn more and have a long-term career with us, should they choose to," said Greg Foran, chief executive of Walmart's United States division.
The company on Thursday beat profit estimates for the fourth quarter, reporting earnings of $1.61 a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast earnings of $1.53 a share.
Walmart's revenue was slightly lower than forecast, at $131.57 billion, compared with an estimate of $132.36 billion.
Closely watched comparable-store sales for the quarter, or sales at Walmart stores that have been open more than a year, rose 1.5 percent, above estimates of 0.7 percent. Walmart also recorded its first increase in shopper traffic in over two years, and it credited lower gasoline prices and milder weather. The fiscal quarter, which ended Jan. 30, is considered crucial for retailers because it includes the holiday season sales.
But investors appeared to interpret the results negatively, as Walmart shares closed down $2.77, or 3.2 percent, at $83.52.

Full text:   Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, is said to be a rising contender for the Republican presidential nomination. So, on Wednesday, he did what, these days, any ambitious Republican must, and pledged allegiance to charlatans and cranks.
For those unfamiliar with the phrase, "charlatans and cranks" is associated with N. Gregory Mankiw, a professor at Harvard who served for a time as George W. Bush's chief economic adviser. In the first edition of his best-selling economics textbook, Mr. Mankiw used those words to ridicule "supply-siders" who promised that tax cuts would have such magic effects on the economy that deficits would go down, not up.
But, on Wednesday, Mr. Walker, in what was clearly a rite of passage into serious candidacy, spoke at a dinner at Manhattan's "21" Club hosted by the three most prominent supply-siders: Art Laffer (he of the curve); Larry Kudlow of CNBC; and Stephen Moore, chief economist of the Heritage Foundation. Politico pointed out that Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, attended a similar event last month. Clearly, to be a Republican contender you have to court the powerful charlatan caucus.
So a doctrine that even Republican economists consider dangerous nonsense has become party orthodoxy. And what makes this political triumph especially remarkable is that it comes just as the doctrine's high priests have been setting new standards for utter, epic predictive failure.
I'm not talking about the fact that supply-siders didn't see the crisis coming, although they didn't. Mr. Moore published a 2004 book titled "Bullish on Bush," asserting that the Bush agenda was creating a permanently stronger economy. Mr. Kudlow sneered at the "bubbleheads" asserting that inflated home prices were due for a crash. Still, you could argue that few economists of any stripe fully foresaw the coming disaster.
You can't say the same, however, about postcrisis developments, where the people Mr. Walker was courting have spent years warning about the wrong things. "Get ready for inflation and higher interest rates" was the title of a June 2009 op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal by Mr. Laffer; what followed were the lowest inflation in two generations and the lowest interest rates in history. Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Moore both predicted 1970s-style stagflation.
To be fair, Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Laffer eventually admitted that they had been wrong. Neither has, however, given any indication of reconsidering his views, let alone conceding the possibility that the much-hated Keynesians, who have gotten most things right even as the supply-siders were getting everything wrong, might be on to something. Mr. Kudlow describes the failure of runaway inflation to materialize -- something he has been predicting since 2008 -- as "miraculous."
Something else worth noting: as befits his position at Heritage, Mr. Moore likes to publish articles filled with lots of numbers. But his numbers are consistently wrong; they're for the wrong years, or just plain not what the original sources say. And somehow these errors always run in the direction he wants.
So what does it say about the current state of the G.O.P. that discussion of economic policy is now monopolized by people who have been wrong about everything, have learned nothing from the experience, and can't even get their numbers straight?
The answer, I'd suggest, runs deeper than economic doctrine. Across the board, the modern American right seems to have abandoned the idea that there is an objective reality out there, even if it's not what your prejudices say should be happening. What are you going to believe, right-wing doctrine or your own lying eyes? These days, the doctrine wins.
Look at another issue, health reform. Before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, conservatives predicted disaster: health costs would soar, the deficit would explode, more people would lose insurance than gain it. They were wrong on all counts. But, in their rhetoric, even in the alleged facts (none of them true) people like Mr. Moore put in their articles, they simply ignore this reality. Reading them, you'd think that the dismal failure they wrongly predicted had actually happened.
Then there's foreign policy. This week Jeb Bush tried to demonstrate his chops in that area, unveiling his team of expert advisers -- who are, sure enough, the very people who insisted that the Iraqis would welcome us as liberators.
And don't get me started on climate change.
Along with this denial of reality comes an absence of personal accountability. If anything, alleged experts seem to get points by showing that they're willing to keep saying the same things no matter how embarrassingly wrong they've been in the past.
But let's go back to those economic charlatans and cranks: Clearly, failure has only made them stronger, and now they are political kingmakers. Be very, very afraid.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank conducted an exhaustive debate before deciding last month on measures to avert a catastrophic decline in consumer prices. But on Thursday the first glimpse ever into the deliberations revealed that, in effect, the decision had already been made.
Statements by Mario Draghi, the central bank president, and other top officials had primed investors to expect a large-scale asset-purchase program that would include government bonds. The 25 members of the bank's Governing Council were well aware that if they delivered anything less after meeting on Jan. 22, there might have been chaos in the financial markets.
Recent gains in stocks, declines in market interest rates and a welcome fall in the value of the euro against the dollar -- it might have all come undone. Or as the central bank put it in an account of the meeting, which was released Thursday: "The associated positive impact on the growth and price outlook could be unwound, and a higher degree of volatility or instability in the financial markets could create additional risks."
The narrative of the meeting was the first under a new central bank policy. Previously, Governing Council proceedings were a closely guarded secret. By coincidence, the inaugural account covered one of the most momentous meetings in the central bank's 16-year history.
At that meeting on Jan. 22, the Governing Council decided to begin buying government bonds and other debt at a monthly rate of 60 billion euros, or $68.3 billion, beginning in March. Such purchases are a standard method for stimulating inflation but had never been tried by the central bank.
The account contained few major surprises, much less any sense of drama or conflict. If any members pounded on the table or hurled invective, it was not recorded. The main significance of the account may come from what it disclosed about the power of Mr. Draghi and a few other top officials to manage market expectations in a way that created almost irresistible pressure for the central bank to act.
Mr. Draghi has denied that he makes public statements that do not reflect Governing Council sentiment. But for months before the January meeting, he had been warning of the dangers of very low inflation and hinting that large-scale bond purchases, or quantitative easing, were becoming more likely.
When the Governing Council gathered on Jan. 21 for the start of the two-day meeting in Frankfurt, some members were still arguing that quantitative easing should be used only in a dire situation that had not yet arrived.
These members maintained that "purchases of sovereign bonds should remain a contingency instrument of monetary policy, to be used only as a last resort in the event of an extremely adverse scenario, such as a downward deflationary spiral," according to the account.
But the wait-and-see faction was in the minority. Others heeded a warning from Peter Praet, a member of the central bank's six-person executive board. "The risks stemming from not acting at the present meeting," Mr. Praet said, according to a summary of his remarks, "might be higher than the risks stemming from acting." Mr. Praet cited the heightened market expectations as one of the risks.
"It was clear that the E.C.B. had become prisoner of the expectations it had created in December," Peter Vanden Houte, an analyst at ING Bank, said in a note to clients on Thursday. "As financial markets had already strongly anticipated the announcement of a sovereign bond purchase program, failing to act could have created a dramatic market reversal."
The meeting account did not indicate which members of the Governing Council argued for delay, but one was almost certainly Jens Weidmann, president of Germany's central bank. He has been vocal in his opposition to purchases of government bonds, the same method used by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan to pump money into the economy after official interest rates had been cut to close to zero.
While members disagreed on the timing of government bond purchases, they agreed that they were a legitimate tool of monetary policy allowed by European Union law, according to the account. That is significant, because the council's decision to begin buying government bonds is likely to face legal challenges from Germany and elsewhere.
The Governing Council also agreed that the eurozone was not at imminent risk of deflation, even though inflation had sunk into negative territory for the first time since 2009. But many members worried that consumers and businesses were becoming accustomed to low inflation or even falling prices. In central bank jargon, inflation expectations were at risk of becoming "unanchored."
As a result, businesses would not be able to raise prices and wages might fall, symptoms of deflation, a condition associated with high unemployment and economic depression.
Furthermore, previous action by the central bank, like purchases of private sector assets, "had clearly fallen short of initial expectations," the account said.
After listening to the arguments, Mr. Draghi "concluded that a large majority of voting members supported a decision to launch an expanded asset purchase program."
The members made one decision that surprised markets. "In order to accelerate the impact," the Governing Council decided to increase the asset purchases to [euro]60 billion a month instead of the expected [euro]50 billion a month.
By keeping the account of the debate largely anonymous, the council was trying to avoid subjecting members to pressure from their home constituencies. The 25 members of the council -- the executive board members and the heads of the 19 national central banks in the eurozone -- are not supposed to represent the interests of their home countries but rather the welfare of the currency bloc as a whole.
The central bank plans to publish accounts of its monetary policy meetings four weeks after they take place. It does not plan to publish accounts of interim meetings, which deal with other matters. The monetary policy meetings are held every six weeks and are followed by a news conference with Mr. Draghi, the European Central Bank president.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Biggest Decline Since 2009 for Producer Price Index

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Producer prices in the United States in January recorded the biggest decline in more than five years on plunging energy costs, pointing to benign inflation in the near term, which could argue against raising interest rates.
Other reports on Wednesday suggested that the economy was growing moderately early in the first quarter. Housing starts fell last month, while manufacturing output edged higher.
"The reports paint a disappointing picture on the U.S. recovery, with the housing starts report in particular reinforcing the narrative that the housing recovery might be in a spot of bother," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index for final demand fell 0.8 percent, the biggest drop since the revamped series started in November 2009, after dipping 0.2 percent in December. It was the third straight month of decline in the index.
In the 12 months through January, producer prices were unchanged, the weakest year-on-year reading since records started in November 2010, after rising 1.1 percent in December.
Economists had forecast the index's declining only 0.4 percent last month and gaining 0.3 percent from a year ago.
Lower energy prices, against the backdrop of softer global demand and increased shale production in the United States, as well as a strengthening dollar, are reducing domestic inflation pressures.
"The weak P.P.I. report adds further evidence of building disinflationary pressures in the U.S., not only in headline prices, but also in core prices," Mr. Mulraine said.
While the Federal Reserve, which has a 2 percent inflation target, views the tame price environment as transitory, signs that the energy-driven weakness is leaking to core inflation could cause discomfort among some policy makers.
An important measure of underlying producer price pressures, which excludes food, energy and trade services, fell a record 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in December.
Most economists expect the central bank to start raising interest rates in June, citing rapidly tightening labor market conditions. The Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
The American economy still faces difficulties created by a stronger dollar and weaker overseas markets, which weigh on exporters. Manufacturing output rose a modest 0.2 percent in January and was flat in December, the Fed said in a separate report.
Wholesale energy prices tumbled a record 10.3 percent in January after sliding 6.2 percent in December. It was the seventh straight month of declines.
Food prices fell 1.1 percent, the largest decline since April 2013, after falling 0.1 percent the previous month. The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins, rose 0.5 percent after a similar gain in December.
The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.07 million units in January.
Despite the decline, which was driven by a fall in groundbreaking for single-family projects, housing starts remained above the million-unit mark for a fifth straight month. Compared with January last year, groundbreaking was up 18.7 percent.
Sluggish wage growth and a shortage of homes on the market stymied housing last year, even as the broader economy was accelerating.
But a turnaround in housing is expected this year as a rapidly tightening labor market pushes up wages and encourages more young adults to move from parents' homes.
In January, permits for future home construction dipped 0.7 percent to an annual pace of 1.05 million units. Permits have been above a million-unit pace since July.
Single-family permits fell 3.1 percent last month, while multifamily permits rebounded 3.6 percent.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is not sounding like an institution that is ready to raise its benchmark interest rate in June.
Fed officials at their most recent policy-making meeting in January worried that economic growth remained fragile, and that raising rates prematurely could undermine recent gains, according to an official account released Wednesday.
The account also described greater concerns than the Fed had disclosed previously about the sluggish pace of inflation and the decline of inflation expectations among investors.
"You can almost hear a little hesitation in the committee," said Zach Pandl, senior interest rate strategist at the investment firm Columbia Management. "They sound confident on the economy but nervous on pulling the trigger on rate hikes."
The economy is growing strongly, and the statement the Fed issued after the January meeting was its most upbeat since the end of the recession in 2009.
That optimism has since been reinforced by the government's latest jobs report, released this month, which estimated that strong employment gains at the end of 2014 continued at a healthy pace in January.
The Fed has gained enough confidence in the strength of the recovery that officials spent much of the January meeting discussing various aspects of raising the Fed's benchmark interest rate, which they have held near zero since December 2008.
At the meeting, some officials argued, as they have publicly, that there is a growing risk the Fed will wait too long before raising rates.
Yet the account suggested that the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and most members of her committee continue to regard the stimulus campaign as necessary. It said that many officials were concerned that raising rates prematurely "might damp the apparent solid recovery," potentially forcing the Fed to reverse course.
It also noted that fewer officials were concerned about the appearance of raising rates when inflation is running well below the Fed's 2 percent goal.
"Many participants indicated that their assessment of the balance of risks associated with the timing of the beginning of policy normalization had inclined them toward keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound for a longer time," it said. The minutes were released after a standard three-week delay.
Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said the account reinforced her view that the Fed would wait until September to begin raising short-term rates and would continue to move slowly thereafter.
"I don't get the sense that anybody wants to actually move in June," Ms. Swonk said. "I think they want to preserve the option, but you've still got inflation and wages not doing what you want. And that's tough."
Ms. Swonk said that disruptive winter storms in recent weeks also might put a temporary damper on economic data, as happened last winter, giving the Fed another reason to wait just a bit longer before moving.
Uncertainty about the evolution of the Fed's intentions has been heightened in recent months by a dearth of public comments by Ms. Yellen and other senior officials. Some of that fog may lift next week, when Ms. Yellen is scheduled to testify on monetary policy and the outlook for the economy before committees of both the House and the Senate.
Fed officials have long pointed toward June as the most likely timing for a first rate increase, but sluggish inflation appears to be prompting second thoughts.
The Fed regards the collapse of oil prices as a temporary drag on inflation, but the trend has made it harder to gauge the actual health of the recovery. Wage growth remains weak, and some measures of inflation expectations have declined.
The account said many officials would like to see evidence inflation would rebound, but that they were fragmented regarding what, exactly, they would consider an appropriate signal. Some said they would be satisfied with strong economic growth, on the assumption that continued expansion would eventually increase inflation.
Others, however, said they wanted to see direct evidence of a rebound, either in wages or in measures of price inflation that exclude the direct effects of oil prices, which have dragged down the broadest gauges of price movements.
Officials also debated the significance of market-based measures of inflation expectations -- basically, the compensation investors demand to offset the inflation they expect over the life of an investment. Those measures have fallen sharply in recent months, indicating that Wall Street traders expect annual inflation to average significantly less than 2 percent over the next five years.
Economists do not understand why inflation rises and falls, at least in the short term, but Fed officials put great stock in the view that public expectations about future inflation play a role in determining actual inflation.
Some Fed officials take comfort in the stability of survey-based measures of expectations, and argue that market-based measures are being distorted by unrelated forces, like a recent rush of investors buying Treasury bonds. But the meeting account said that other officials were increasingly concerned.
"A number of participants emphasized they would need to see either an increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation or evidence that continued low readings on these measures did not constitute grounds for concern," it said.
Fed officials will resume this debate at their next policy-making meeting, in March, when they must decide whether to retain language in the statement that says the Fed will be "patient" in deciding when to raise interest rates.
Ms. Yellen has said that the presence of the word means a rate hike was at least two meetings away. Some officials, including Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, want to remove the word to make clear the Fed will start raising rates as soon as economic conditions warrant.
The account, however, said that many Fed officials were worried that removing the statement might send a stronger signal than intended, suggesting that the first rate increase is imminent rather than merely possible.
"As a result, some expressed the concern that financial markets might overreact, resulting in undesirably tight financial conditions," it noted.

Full text:   For anyone who spent the years 2010 to 2012 obsessing over the fate of the eurozone during the crisis set off by Greek debt, the last few days have been a time of uncomfortable déjà vu.
There are messy, protracted negotiations in Brussels, a game of chicken with the entire future of European unity at risk. The talks are on, then they're off. There are ultimatums. Details of the talks leak, as is perhaps inevitable when there are representatives of a few dozen countries, each with a domestic press they wish to spin.
But just because you feel like you've seen something before doesn't mean there won't be a different ending.
If Greece ends up dropping out of the euro currency zone entirely, with unpredictable ripple effects across the Continent and the world financial system, the events of the last few days will look like a turning point that led to that moment. As of Tuesday, to be clear, markets were predicting nothing of the sort. European stock markets were down only slightly, and the value of the euro was actually up a bit. In effect, markets have seen this show before: the sturm und drang of threats and counterthreats that end in a last-minute deal.
The hedge fund manager Mark Dow offered on Twitter a way to think about the tense negotiations: "EZ bears underestimate the short-term resolve of EZ policy makers. EZ bulls overestimate the long-term viability of the exchange rate system."
Here's what Mr. Dow is saying. We have seen again and again that this generation of European leaders, who built their careers on the altar of European unity, will eventually do what it takes to prevent the common currency from ripping apart. If this recent history is a guide, then the drama of the last few days is merely the theatrics required to get these finance ministers to arrive at a deal.
On the other hand, Mr. Dow also points out, Europe really does have a big and plausibly unsolvable macroeconomic problem.
You can think about it this way: Germany and a couple of other countries are operating in a radically different economic gear than Southern Europe, and the ways you might normally expect those imbalances to work themselves out are not available. In pre-euro Europe, currency swings would have handled the job. In the United States, continuing fiscal transfers from rich states to poor states do the work. Neither is a palatable option in a Europe that has a single currency and deep aversion among Germans, Finns and the Dutch to sending their hard-earned euros to Greece and Spain and Italy.
Either Northern European governments will accept bigger fiscal transfers and higher inflation than their citizens want, or the Mediterranean nations with economic challenges will have to accept falling wages and high unemployment as they try to restore competitiveness, which their citizens very much do not want.
These are all democracies, so something has to give politically. The Greek elections last month that swept the leftist party Syriza into power and set up the current effort to renegotiate Greece's bailout agreement may have been that moment.
The details of these negotiations actually cut across some of the usual North-South lines, with, for example, Portugal and other debtor countries apparently siding with the Northern creditor countries against Greece (we've taken our austerity medicine, goes the logic; you should have to do the same).
But the ultimate question is which logic will prevail in these particular talks. There is the short-run possibility, which financial markets seem to believe is most likely: a deal that lets everyone save face and kicks the can of resolving those longer-term contradictions down the road.
Then there is the long-run possibility, that this standoff will force some resolution of these huge, slow-building imbalances in the European economy. In this sequence of events, Greece, the most extreme outlier on the debtor-creditor divide within the Continent, leaves the euro entirely, and in the financial and economic chaos that follows the remaining countries using the euro form tighter bonds with an eye toward ensuring there are no more defections.
The first option seems most likely this time around. But what makes this debate fascinating for anyone who cares about global economics is the mere possibility that Europe's real day of reckoning has finally arrived.

Full text:   SRIPERUMBUDUR, India -- China's economy is slowing. Brazil is struggling as commodity prices plunge. Russia, facing Western sanctions and weak oil revenue, is headed into a recession.
As other big developing markets stumble, India is emerging as one of the few hopes for global growth.
The stock market and rupee are surging. Multinational companies are looking to expand their Indian operations or start new ones. The growth in India's economy, long a laggard, just matched China's pace in recent months.
India is riding high on the early success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a raft of new business-friendly policies instituted in his first eight months.
Small factories no longer need to shut down every year for government inspectors to spend a day checking boilers. Foreign investment rules have been relaxed for insurers, military contractors and real estate companies. A broad tax overhaul is underway.
Renewed optimism from outside investors is spurring business expansion in cities around the country like Tiruppur, a hub of India's yarn and textile industry. "Most of the factories in Tiruppur are doubling or tripling their capacity, and these are huge factories," said Pritam Sanghai, the director of Arjay Apparel Industries.
Whether India's momentum is short-lived or sustainable hinges on whether Mr. Modi can push through deeper reforms, including addressing the persistent poverty and corruption that plague the economy. Lacking the necessary political support to overhaul legislation quickly, he has largely relied on temporary measures to make changes.
His party lost badly in recent local elections in Delhi. The next test comes later this month. The government is set to present its full-year budget to Parliament and lay out an agenda for taming chronic deficits while increasing investment, bolstering manufacturing and building modern highways and ports.
India, in part, is benefiting from favorable economic winds, the same ones wreaking havoc in Russia, Venezuela and elsewhere.
The country's reliance on imported oil, for example, has been its bane for decades. By last summer, oil was a $100 billion drag on the economy, roughly 5 percent of the entire country's economic output.
With crude prices now halved, fuel costs for trucks and cars have plunged, pulling down transport expenses and inflation. The cost of government fuel subsidies has nose-dived, helping curb the country's chronic budget deficits.
"We've got essentially a $50 billion gift for the economy," said Raghuram G. Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India.
India is also profiting from the troubles of other emerging markets.
China's investigations of multinationals, persistent tensions with neighboring countries and surging blue-collar wages have prompted many companies to start looking elsewhere for large labor forces.
Big companies like General Motors have recently moved their international or Asia headquarters from Shanghai to Singapore as they expand further into India and its main rival as an alternative to China, Indonesia.
Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M., came to Pune in western India last September to oversee the start of Chevrolet exports from there to Chile. She is also scouting for opportunities to expand in India's auto market, which the company predicts will be one of the world's three largest by 2020.
"All the circumstances have come together to make manufacturing and growth happen," said Shailesh V. Haribhakti, the chairman of MentorCap Management, a boutique investment bank in Mumbai.
As India's fortunes begin to shift, Mr. Modi is trying to tackle thornier economic issues.
He wants to expand the private sector's role in coal mining, a government-dominated industry. He is looking to accelerate the construction of roads and other infrastructure. On the tax front, Mr. Modi hopes gradually to replace state taxes on goods that cross state borders with a national tax.
In a January visit to New Delhi, President Obama highlighted chronic regulatory obstacles in India. "There are still too many barriers -- hoops to jump through, bureaucratic restrictions -- that make it hard to start a business, or to export, to import, to close a deal, deliver on a deal." But Mr. Obama acknowledged the country's progress, saying, "Prime Minister Modi has initiated reforms that will help overcome some of these barriers."
The challenges are significant.
The World Bank recently ranked India as the 142nd-hardest place to do business out of 189 countries.
Legal disputes, often involving land, can bog down even the most sought-after projects. A Boeing aircraft maintenance center is only now close to opening after a two-year delay in construction of a crucial taxiway, caused by villagers who lay down in front of bulldozers until the state government paid them more for a 200-yard strip of land.
Would-be builders of large factories also worry about India's stringent labor laws, including essentially lifetime employment guarantees for unskilled or semiskilled workers with at least two years' experience.
Nokia and Foxconn Technology of Taiwan suspended production late last year at an eight-year-old cellphone manufacturing complex here in southern India. Nokia is dealing with a $365 million tax dispute that started under Mr. Modi's predecessor, as well as slowing demand for the older models of cellphones that the complex produced.
Foxconn faced hundreds of young workers who held a one-day hunger strike on Jan. 27. The company offered them 22 months' severance. They wanted six years' severance, and ended up settling last Thursday for roughly three years.
Rohini, a 25-year-old Foxconn worker who earned $220 a month at one of the factories in the complex, said she had been saving money from the job to create a dowry that would make her a better marriage prospect. So she was devastated when she heard from a co-worker that they would lose their jobs.
"I felt both anger and sadness. I cried a lot," she said. "I know that according to the law, I must be given employment until age 58," she added.
Those labor law protections are starting to erode. Many companies rely increasingly on contract workers, whom they require to leave after a single year, circumventing the employment guarantees.
For Mr. Modi, the most immediate challenge is on the political front.
While his party dominates the lower house of Parliament, the deeply divided upper house has delayed action on bills for his longer-term reforms. So Mr. Modi has relied on executive orders that automatically expire in late April. They can be renewed, though not indefinitely.
Needing support from minority parties in the upper house of Parliament, he sent Arun Jaitley, the finance minister, to the home of Jayalalitha Jayaram, the longtime leader of an influential regional party here in Tamil Nadu state, with flowers on Jan. 18. The trip was controversial since Jayalalitha, who is known by her first name, is out of prison on bail pending her appeal of a conviction last year in a corruption case.
The government has also been criticized for revising the way it calculates gross domestic product. The move on Jan. 30 brought India into line with the practices of most developed nations and produced a sharp increase in the country's reported economic growth. But critics viewed the timing as a political move intended to give Mr. Modi more support.
Even some of Mr. Modi's supporters are cautious about what he has accomplished so far. "Lots of people have been blindly jumping into India on euphoria and hype," said Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a wealthy financier and a member of the upper house of Parliament who wants more extensive reforms when the prime minister sends the new budget to Parliament on Feb. 28. "He hasn't introduced any new ideas, and that is what he needs to do in February."
Mr. Modi's senior advisers say that they have begun making significant changes and that critics are too impatient. "There are a lot of inherited, legacy issues we had to work through," like budget deficits and persistent inflation, said Jayant Sinha, the minister of state for finance. "You have to give us a little bit of time for every business to feel the difference."

Full text:   The safety net helped keep Camille Saunders from falling, but not Charles Constance.
The difference? Ms. Saunders has a job, and Mr. Constance does not. And therein lies a tale of a profound shift in government support for low-income Americans at a time when stagnating wages and unstable schedules have kept many workers living near or below the poverty line.
Assistance to needy Americans has grown at a gallop since the mid-1980s, giving a hand up to the disabled, the working poor and married couples with children. At the same time, though, government aid directed at the nation's poorest individuals has shrunk.
"Most observers would think that the government should support those who have the lowest incomes the most, and provide less help to those with higher incomes," Robert A. Moffitt, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, writes in a forthcoming article in the journal Demography. "But that is not the case."
Mr. Moffitt found that government assistance for families whose incomes flutter just above the poverty line nearly doubled from 1983 to 2004 after taking inflation into account. The numbers look very different for those scraping along at the bottom, generally unemployed single mothers with children. Their benefits declined in real terms by about one-third.
During the Great Recession, assistance to the poorest briefly expanded but has since fallen back, he said, and there is no indication that the long-run trend is shifting.
"There's been this emphasis on rewarding workers and people like the elderly or disabled who are considered 'the deserving poor,' " said Mr. Moffitt, referring to a revival in recent decades of age-old attitudes toward those at the bottom of the economic ladder. "If you're not working, the interpretation is that you're not trying."
President Obama's new proposals for a $500 tax credit for working parents with children, an increase in the minimum wage and paid parental leave are just the latest examples of this trend.
The shift reflects not only a more conservative political climate but also a response to broader economic forces, like globalization, advancing technology and workers' enfeebled bargaining power, all of which have had a role in eliminating millions of traditional middle-class jobs and holding down wages.
More than 300,000 California workers at big companies like Walmart, for example, qualify for Medi-Cal, the state's health insurance for the poor, according to a study from the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley. And in New York, 40 percent of bank tellers are on some form of public aid like food stamps.
Across the country, working families account for nearly three-quarters of the people enrolled in major public benefits programs and 63 percent of the costs, the Berkeley researchers concluded.
Experts emphasize that they do not want to pit one needy group against another. "The working poor deserve some help; there's no way I want to cut any of that," Mr. Moffitt of Johns Hopkins said. "But there's a group here that's being left out."
Distinguishing between people who deserve public generosity and those who don't dates to colonial times, but the idea has found powerful champions on both sides of the political divide, including Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the influential new Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
The move away from giving more aid to those in abject poverty can be traced, in part, to the campaign to "end welfare as we know it," promoted by President Bill Clinton during his 1992 presidential run and accomplished in 1996 when the system was overhauled.
The program he created, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, imposes time limits and work rules on recipients. And when a state's allotted budget runs out, poor families are turned away.
"It got rid of welfare cheaters," Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, said of the Clinton-era changes. "But we forgot about people who want to work but can't find anybody to hire them."
Like Mr. Constance. "I couldn't really find any kind of work or the help that I needed to help raise my son," said Mr. Constance, 53, who until recently had been living at a homeless shelter in New Orleans with his 9-year old son, Pablo.
A prison record from the 1980s, the result of selling two ounces of marijuana in Texas, has hampered his search for work as a house painter. "That's why I say it's been a hard road for me trying to raise my son, with all those ghosts and shadows over my head," he said.
As he discovered, benefits vary greatly from one state to the next. He applied to the Temporary Assistance program in Miami, he said, but was uncertain about why he never received any. "It wasn't nothing but problem after problem after problem," he said.
Last year, he moved with his son to New Orleans, where he said he was offered $123 a month in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families aid in exchange for community service. He tried it, but the time and money spent commuting wasn't worth it, he said, explaining that he was better off using the time to look for an odd job, a car to wash or a yard to rake.
He said he received $318 a month in food stamps, and that his son received $390 a month from disability payments through his mother, who still lives in Florida.
After months of bouncing around in emergency homeless shelters, the two are now settled in an apartment. The $700 monthly rent is being paid by the Salvation Army for six months, while Mr. Constance searches for a permanent job. "With the light bill and water bill, I don't have enough to take care of all of that," he said.
LaDonna Pavetti, the vice president for family income support policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization in the nation's capital, said that without the small cash allotments previously available, "it becomes much trickier to figure out how to make ends meet."
For Ms. Saunders, a 34-year-old security guard with two young daughters in Washington, government assistance has come in the form of food stamps, a rent subsidy, a tax refund for low-wage earners and a matching grant for budding entrepreneurs.
That aid has helped put food on the table after Ms. Saunders's weekly $459 paycheck runs out and has given her hope that she might be able to start her own cleaning business.
"I'm very much a go-getter," Ms. Saunders said. "For a person that doesn't make much money, it's definitely a big help."
She supplements her income as a security guard with $297 a month in food stamps and depends on Medicaid for health insurance. The earned-income tax credit, considered by many advocates to be the best program to help nudge people above the poverty line, brought the family $5,500 in federal and local tax refunds.
One of the lucky few to live in federally subsidized housing, Ms. Saunders pays only $110 a month for her two-bedroom apartment in the northeast section of Washington. "It's not the best neighborhood," she said, but it's cheap.
And by saving $1,000 to put toward her dream of a cleaning service, she is now designated to receive a $4,000 tax-free, no-strings-attached federal subsidy through the Individual Development Accounts program. These accounts, which are financed through public money and private donations, can be used only to help buy a home, pay for college or start a business.
"This is not a handout approach," said Joseph Leitmann-Santa Cruz, the head of Capital Area Asset Builders, the nonprofit organization that administers development accounts in the region. Earlier this year he insisted on rescheduling a meeting with Ms. Saunders so she could get some sleep after working an 18-hour double shift. "It's a way for society to co-invest with a poor working family," he said.
Ms. Saunders also has the advantage of living in the District of Columbia, which offers more generous benefits for low-income families than many states. Mr. Constance in New Orleans knows the difference.
"Not getting any kind of help or anything," he said, "it's been very rough."

Abstract: Income inequality has not actually risen since the financial crisis began. Because the crisis, which ran roughly from 2007 to 2010, reduced the pretax incomes of the wealthiest Americans more than the incomes of any group. (The stories you hear about wealthy investors paying little in taxes are real but not the norm.) And unemployment-insurance payments and other federal benefits help the middle class and poor more than the rich.

Full text:   The notion that income inequality has continued to rise over the past decade is part of the conventional wisdom. You've no doubt heard versions: The rich just keep getting richer. Inequality is higher than ever. Nearly all of the gains from the economic recovery have gone to the top 1 percent.
No question, inequality is extremely high from a historical perspective -- worrisomely so. But a new analysis, by Stephen J. Rose of George Washington University, adds an important wrinkle to the story: Income inequality has not actually risen since the financial crisis began.
How could that be? Because the crisis, which ran roughly from 2007 to 2010, reduced the pretax incomes of the wealthiest Americans more than the incomes of any group. The wealthy have indeed received the bulk of the gains since the recovery began, but they still haven't recovered their losses. Meanwhile, the steps that the federal government took in response to the crisis, including tax cuts and benefit increases, have mostly helped the nonwealthy.
Fascinatingly, Mr. Rose's case is not based on a new or previously undiscovered data set. It's based on the same statistics most commentators have been using to discuss inequality. The most up-to-date numbers come from the pathbreaking analysis of tax records by Emmanuel Saez, the University of California, Berkeley, professor who often collaborates with Thomas Piketty. A second set of statistics comes from the Congressional Budget Office.
Both point in the same direction: The income of the top 1 percent -- both the level and the share of overall income -- still hasn't returned to its 2007 peak. Their average income is about 20 percent below that peak. Yet we have all become so accustomed to rising inequality that we seem to have lost the ability to consider the alternative. Maybe it's because many liberals are tempted to believe inequality is always getting worse, while many conservatives are tempted to believe that the Obama economy is always getting worse.
The numbers, however, make clear that inequality isn't destined to rise. Not only can economic forces, like a recession, reduce it, but government policy can, too. And Washington's recent efforts to fight inequality -- as imperfect and restrained as they've been -- have made a bigger difference than many people realize.
The existing safety net of jobless benefits, food stamps and the like cushioned the blow of the so-called Great Recession. So did the stimulus bill that President Obama signed in 2009 and some smaller bills passed afterward. "Not only were low-income people protected -- middle-income and some higher income-households had much lower losses because of these public policies," Mr. Rose said. "For those who think government programs never work, maybe they need to think again."
Before diving into the numbers on the government's role, let's start with the pretax statistics. These are the data on what's happened before the government redistributes income through taxes and benefits.
The average pretax incomes for the top 1/10,000th of earners peaked at $39.4 million in 2007, according to Mr. Saez's data, which is adjusted for inflation. It then plummeted to $21 million in 2009 -- partly because the stock market crash reduced gains from stock sales -- before rising back to an average of $29.2 million in 2012 and 2013.
(Why am I using an average for 2012 and 2013? It's more meaningful than the data for only 2013, because changes in the tax law accelerated some stock sales into 2012. So looking at the data for 2013 alone makes the decline in inequality look even larger than it truly is.)
Needless to say, $29.2 million is a whole lot of money, but it represents a major decline -- 26 percent -- from the 2007 level. No other income group has experienced such a large decline.
The average income of the top 1 percent, by comparison, fell 21 percent over the same span. For the top 5 percent, the drop was 15 percent. For the bottom 90 percent of earners, it was 13 percent.
If anything, these pretax data exaggerate the level of inequality, as Mr. Rose notes in his paper, published by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a Washington research group. The rich pay a higher average federal tax rate than the middle class and the poor. (The stories you hear about wealthy investors paying little in taxes are real but not the norm.) And unemployment-insurance payments and other federal benefits help the middle class and poor more than the rich.
The data from the Congressional Budget Office, though not as current, show how much of an effect government policy has had. Pretax income for the middle class and poor dropped substantially from 2007 to 2011 -- about 10 percent for most groups. Yet including taxes and transfers, incomes fared better: Average income for the bottom fifth of earners rose 2.6 percent, to $24,100, and the average for the middle fifth fell only 2 percent, to $59,000. Such stagnation is hardly good news, but it's a lot better than a large decline.
By contrast, the pre- and post-tax incomes for the top 1 percent are nearly identical to each other, both showing large drops.
>
None of these facts, to be clear, changes the larger story: Inequality is far higher than for most of the last century. The Great Depression and the New Deal helped reverse the high inequality of the 1920s. The last several years haven't reversed more than a small fraction of the post-1980 rise in inequality.
It's even possible that inequality will soon surpass its 2007 peak, because the affluent often fare better than any other group in the second half of an economic expansion. On the other hand, the current data doesn't reflect several of Mr. Obama's efforts to fight inequality, such as the expansion of health insurance or top-end tax increases. Whatever happens in the next few years, top incomes will almost certainly remain vastly higher than they were in previous decades, while incomes for the middle class and poor will remain only marginally higher. This stagnation has damaged living standards and caused widespread frustration.
As Mr. Rose himself, who's more optimistic about the state of the middle class than I am, says, the United States has "a real income-inequality problem."
But the fact that inequality hasn't continued rising in the last several years matters -- first, because facts matter, and, second, because it helps show what Washington has the potential to do. For much of the last few decades, rather than attacking inequality, government policy has exacerbated it. Tax rates on the very rich, the same group receiving the largest pretax raises, have fallen the most.
In the last several years, however, the federal government has tried to combat inequality, through a combination of tax and spending policies. These efforts weren't aggressive enough to bring major raises to most families. The financial crisis was too big, and Washington's response was too restrained. Yet the efforts were aggressive enough to make a difference.
They are a reminder that rising inequality is not inevitable, and that the country has the power to shape its economy.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   Here are some of the top business stories to pay attention to in the coming week.
MEETING ON GREECE Finance ministers from countries using the euro will meet Monday for the second time in less than a week to discuss how to fund Greece as it seeks to revise the terms of a huge bailout. The other 18 members of the currency group are pressuring Greece to ask to extend its current bailout rather than let the European portion of the program expire at the end of the month. Renewing the program would diminish the risk that Greece would destabilize the wider economy.
But the leadership in Athens has rejected that approach. It came to power vowing to scrap key requirements of the bailout it describes as a national disaster. That has raised the prospect of a new-look bailout for Greece that would be the country's third. Technical staff members from Greece and its main international creditors on Friday began assessing where the current bailout program and the plans of the new government overlap. The idea is to lay the groundwork for a possible interim compromise at the Monday meeting, which is scheduled to begin midafternoon and expected to run late into the night. JAMES KANTER
G.M. LIABILITY HEARING General Motors' efforts to shut down hundreds of lawsuits over a defective ignition switch linked to at least 52 deaths enters a critical phase on Tuesday in a court hearing in Manhattan. Judge Robert E. Gerber of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York will hear oral arguments over G.M.'s request that he enforce a provision of the company's July 2009 bankruptcy agreement that shields G.M. from liability for accidents before that date.
Lawyers representing plaintiffs in both economic loss and personal injury cases argue that G.M. misled the bankruptcy court when it negotiated its original agreement because it did not reveal the potential for large numbers of claims stemming from the defect. G.M. disclosed the defect in February 2014 when it began recalling 2.6 million cars for the problem, but officials have acknowledged that some engineers, lawyers and others in the company knew about the problem years earlier. HILARY STOUT
FED MINUTES The Federal Reserve would like to start raising its benchmark interest rate this summer, so long as economic conditions cooperate. Until then, Fed officials are just killing time. They held a regularly scheduled meeting in January and issued a placeholder statement. On Wednesday, the Fed will release an account of the meeting that is likely to be equally bland. The message is simple: The Fed hasn't made any decisions yet. Check back after the snow melts. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM
AIR FRANCE-KLM RESULTS On Thursday, Air France-KLM reports its earnings for 2014, a year in which a crippling two-week strike by the company's French pilots in September cost more than $400 million and curtailed plans to create a European low-cost subsidiary.
The struggling French-Dutch group is pressing ahead this year with a scaled-back low-cost expansion that has the blessing of its unions. But management has already warned of the need for further cost cuts and the elimination of several hundred more jobs. The carrier has already cut 8,000 jobs over the past three years as part of a broad-based restructuring. NICOLA CLARK
WALMART EARNINGS Walmart, the world's largest retailer, reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, and its bottom line is likely to have received a boost from the recent rebound in jobs and consumer sentiment. Lower gas prices are also leaving more change in consumers' pockets and making it cheaper for shoppers to drive to Walmart's discount superstores.
Investors will look for signs that new strategies introduced last year by the chief executive, Doug McMillon, are gaining traction: a shift in investment from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce, a focus on improving the fresh foods and groceries business, and an overhaul of inventory and stocking methods after widespread complaints of out-of-stock goods at Walmart's 4,400 stores across the United States.
Walmart is also looking to build smaller neighborhood stores to make up for sluggish sales at its supercenters. A strong dollar, which deflates earnings from Walmart's 6,200 or so stores worldwide, could weigh on the company's bottom line, however. And as a discount retailer, Walmart remains vulnerable to the economic health of the country's lowest-income households, which have struggled to gain a fair share of the economic recovery. HIROKO TABUCHI
E.C.B. RELEASE The European Central Bank on Thursday will for the first time publish an account of the proceedings of the Governing Council, which sets monetary policy. As it happens, the first internal debate to be disclosed under a new policy was also one of the most momentous. On Jan. 22 the central bank decided to begin buying 60 billion euros of government bonds and other debt a month in an effort to raise inflation from levels considered toxic for growth.
But some analysts are skeptical whether the account -- which the central bank is not calling "minutes" -- will be all that enlightening. The account will not give any vote tallies and will not say which council members took which positions. The central bank plans to continue publishing accounts of monetary policy meetings four weeks after they occur. JACK EWING

Full text:   PHILADELPHIA -- Cheesesteaks? Never mind. Sichuan shoestring French fries? That's more like it. Like many American cities, Philadelphia has greatly evolved both economically and culturally since 2000, the last time a major political party held its national convention here, not to mention the days when W. C. Fields made it a national punch line.
While its public school system remains a mess, its crime rate elastic and its poverty rate high, Philadelphia has been revitalized over the last decade and a half, with celebrity chefs, a vibrant technology sector and thriving art scene, all boxes to check for cities on the move these days.
"Yes, the schools are still a problem, crime is still a problem, gun violence is still a problem," said Senator Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat who has watched Philadelphia evolve over several decades. "But people have much more optimism about the future now. With the pope coming in 2015 and the Democrats in 2016, it's a one-two punch."
The story of Philadelphia, which the Democrats chose on Thursday as the venue for their national convention in 2016, is less a tale of two cities than a nuanced novel with overlapping plots.
Its population of 1.6 million has increased by roughly 36,000 since 2000, with many of the newcomers drawn by new tech companies and Comcast, the city's biggest corporate benefactor.
Yet Philadelphia has a higher percentage of people living in poverty than any other large city in America, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. According to the Census Bureau, 27 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Since 2000, its median income, adjusted for inflation, has actually fallen. It is getting younger, and remains racially mixed; its black population, about 43 percent of the total, is almost unchanged, but the Hispanic and Asian populations have increased significantly. Of the three mayors in the past 16 years, two have been black and one white.
"I would call it almost a communal grittiness," said David L. Cohen, an executive vice president of Comcast, who was the chief of staff to Edward G. Rendell when he was the city's mayor. "We fight together, we work together, we try to build the city together again."
Philadelphia's self-image as gritty and blue-collar has evolved as the millennials who studied at the city's many universities have found jobs and affordable housing that have persuaded them to stay.
The influx of millennials is expected to continue, fueled in part by hundreds of new jobs at Comcast, which is building a new tower that will be the eighth-tallest in the United States when it is completed in 2018. But, unlike in other cities, firefighters, students and executives still rub shoulders in many of the watering holes here, even as well-known chefs expand their empires of ethnically diverse fare.
The city's longstanding inferiority complex about being an impoverished postindustrial center that has neither the financial power of New York nor the political clout of Washington has been replaced in large part by its increasing pride in its affordability, which has helped maintain its diversity and unpretentious flair.
"We are sometimes in the shadow of being between Washington and New York," said Larry Ceisler, who owns a public relations firm in central Philadelphia.
While the convention will draw national attention, it will not solve Philadelphia's chronic problems, Mr. Ceisler said. "When people come here for the convention, what are they going to see?" he said, referring to the Democratic National Convention next year. "They are going to see this glittering city core, with lots of restaurants, parks and culture. They are not going to see the poverty that we have, and they are not going to see a public school system that can't support nurses, libraries and music programs."
The city has more or less shed its nickname of Killadelphia as the number of murders has fallen to historic lows in recent years, although the 248 homicides last year were a tiny uptick from the previous year, indicating that the city is far from having solved its violence problem.
For Democrats, the city's growing progressive agenda may be a boon, even as it offers a backdrop against which to discuss the dismal state of the public education system in America, and income inequality.
On Thursday, the Philadelphia City Council voted 14 to 2 to approve an ordinance guaranteeing workers in the city the right to earn paid sick leave. Mayor Michael A. Nutter, who had vetoed the measure twice previously, signed it hours later. "If the national Democrats are smart, they'll use this opportunity to make paid sick days a national issue in 2016," said Kati Sipp, the director of the Pennsylvania Working Families Party.
The convention decision comes as Philadelphia is preparing for a visit by Pope Francis in September, an event that is expected to draw millions of visitors to several public events. Some officials questioned whether Philadelphia is equipped to handle the two major public events, but at this point it does not have much of a choice.
"We've got to be ready to go two for two," Mr. Ceisler said.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The Swedish central bank on Thursday put its benchmark interest rate in negative territory and announced a bond-buying program in bold moves to protect its economy from mounting economic and political uncertainty in Europe.
It was the latest example of how central bankers are being pushed to their limits in efforts to stoke growth as the threat of deflation has replaced inflation as their main worry.
The Swedish benchmark interest rate was cut to minus 0.1 percent, and the central bank said it would begin buying Swedish government bonds, emulating the program used by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England and soon the European Central Bank to pump money into the economy and increase inflation.
Sweden is a member of the European Union, but it is not in the eurozone. Its economy is vulnerable to spillovers from its neighbors, forcing the central bank to react aggressively to avoid deflationary forces emanating from the rest of the Continent.
Negative interest rates were almost unknown until recently. But as inflation has fallen, they have increasingly become a feature of monetary policy in countries including Denmark and Switzerland, in the government bond market and even in a few corporate bonds.
Central bank negative rates are intended to encourage companies and individuals to borrow more, increasing investment and consumer spending and driving up inflation.
As recently as October, the Swedish central bank, or Riksbank, said it preferred to avoid a negative rate. But Stefan Ingves, governor of the Riksbank, said the precedents set by Denmark and Switzerland in recent months had reassured the bank's policy committee that there would be no dire consequences.
"We felt that going negative to minus 0.1 was not a major issue," Mr. Ingves said in a telephone interview.
The decision means that Swedish commercial banks will be able to take out loans from the central bank at a negative interest rate. When the loans are due, banks will pay back less than they borrowed.
For Sweden, as well as for Denmark and Switzerland, negative rates also help contain increases in their currencies that have been caused in part by actions of the European Central Bank.
The bond purchases, initially valued at 10 billion Swedish kronor, or about $1.2 billion, are tiny compared with those of other central banks. But Mr. Ingves said the point was to send a message that the Riksbank was prepared to act.
"We can easily scale these things if need be," he said. "We can technically easily do much, much more than the 10 billion."
Next month, the European Central Bank plans to begin buying 60 billion euros a month of eurozone government bonds and other debt. The action is expected to push market interest rates in the eurozone down from already low levels and has prompted investors to move their money to countries like Sweden in search of better returns.
Mr. Ingves said it was too early to tell what effect the European Central Bank bond purchases would have on Sweden. He acknowledged, though, that Sweden was largely at the mercy of European Central Bank policies and other forces beyond its control.
"It's like sailing in a small boat on a big ocean," he said. "That's reality when you come from a midsize fairly open economy."
The flow of money to noneurozone countries like Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland has also been prompted by global political and economic turmoil, and the desire by investors to find a haven, even if they have to pay to keep their money there. In a statement on Thursday, the Riksbank cited uncertainty caused by Greece as one reason for its decision. The Riksbank is also concerned about conflict in Ukraine, Mr. Ingves said.
But if one currency goes down, another must go up, and economists say that actions by central banks to devalue their own coin is ultimately a zero-sum game.
"These essentially 'beggar thy neighbor' policies are not helping solve the overall problem of deficient global demand," Janet Henry, chief European economist at HSBC, and Daragh Maher, the bank's senior foreign exchange strategist, said in a note to clients.

Full text:   A "glimmer of hope" but "no illusion" was the inauspicious way Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, described the Ukraine cease-fire she and President François Hollande of France brokered in talks in Minsk, Belarus, with Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine. Ms. Merkel certainly deserves a lot of credit for her determined shuttling among Kiev, Moscow, Munich, Washington and Minsk in the urgent search for a resolution of the biggest security crisis to confront Europe since the end of the Cold War.
The last cease-fire negotiated in Minsk, in September, quickly unraveled, and the new one is very limited, leaving hard problems to be settled in coming weeks and months. And in the end, it is still for Mr. Putin to decide whether this is to be a real step toward peace or just another cynical feint in his campaign to dismember Ukraine.
Mr. Putin won a lot in Minsk. The fact that the cease-fire is to start on Sunday -- and not immediately, as the Ukrainians wanted -- gives the Ukrainian separatists a couple more days to press their siege on Debaltseve, a key rail hub where thousands of Ukrainian troops are surrounded, and in their attack on the Black Sea port of Mariupol. If the cease-fire does take hold, which is far from certain, both sides are to pull their heavy weapons out of range of each other. Then the deal requires both sides to withdraw "foreign" fighters and equipment, though Mr. Putin has never acknowledged the obvious presence of Russian forces and weapons in eastern Ukraine.
On the political side, the agreement says Ukraine can recover full control over its border with Russia by the end of 2015, after local elections in rebel-held areas and constitutional changes that would give these areas considerable autonomy. The degree of self-rule for pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine is at the core of any sustainable settlement, but the negotiations will take place while Russia remains free to move men and equipment over the border.
In short, the deal is a bitter pill for Mr. Poroshenko. But he was right to accept it, and Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande were right to press it. The conflict has already taken 5,400 lives and has displaced hundreds of thousands, and it has ravaged Ukraine's most industrialized regions.
Ukraine, moreover, is an economic mess, with inflation running at about 30 percent and the currency in sharp decline. Coinciding with the conclusion of the Minsk negotiations, the International Monetary Fund announced it would grant a new lifeline to Ukraine. But to get the money, Ukraine needs to start carrying out internal reforms, and for that, it needs a respite from conflict.
Russia, too, finds itself in tough economic straits as a result of economic sanctions and the fall in oil prices. Mr. Putin finds himself increasingly ostracized in the West and potentially facing not only more sanctions but a Ukraine armed with lethal Western weaponry. One reason Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande may have embarked on their peace mission last week, apart from increased fighting in Ukraine, was a growing clamor in the United States Congress to send lethal arms to Ukraine. That would be an irresponsible and dangerous move in the current situation, but it added urgency to the Europeans' mission.
What remains incontrovertible is that Ukraine is Mr. Putin's war. Mr. Putin has been offered a far better deal than he deserves. Now it is imperative for the West to keep his feet to the fire; there should be no easing of sanctions until he demonstrates a willingness to live by the agreements reached in Minsk. And if he does not, there should be no doubt of more sanctions.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. MOSCOW -- The International Monetary Fund agreed on Thursday to throw a new $17.5 billion lifeline to Ukraine, hoping to stabilize the country as it teeters on the edge of default.
The new plan replaces a $17 billion emergency bailout that was extended last year after mass street protests in Ukraine ousted the country's president, Viktor F. Yanukovych; Russia annexed Crimea; and a violent separatist uprising began in the east of the country. That uprising has now stretched into a nearly yearlong battle that has devastated Ukraine's economy.
In addition to the heavy costs of the continuing military operation and the displacement of more than one million people from the east, Ukraine has had to grapple with a collapse in the value of its currency, the hryvnia, and spiking inflation. Trade with Russia, long Ukraine's largest partner, has plummeted, paralyzing many industries. Foreign investment has dried up amid the turmoil.
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who recently visited Kiev to reiterate American financial support for Ukraine, issued a statement praising the new rescue plan.
"Fully implemented, this ambitious I.M.F. program will play an important role in helping to unleash Ukraine's considerable untapped economic potential," Mr. Lew said.
Announcing the program in Brussels on Thursday, the fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, acknowledged that there were serious risks in providing any credit to Ukraine but said that the need for assistance was urgent.
"This new four-year arrangement would support immediate economic stabilization in Ukraine as well as a set of bold policy reforms aimed at restoring robust growth over the medium term and improving living standards for the Ukrainian people," Ms. Lagarde said in a statement. "It is an ambitious program; it is a tough program; and it is not without risk."
If successful, she added, it "can represent a turning point for Ukraine."
Ms. Lagarde's announcement came as peace negotiations in Minsk, Belarus, aimed at settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine yielded progress, including a cease-fire to take effect on Sunday.
About $4.6 billion in credit was extended to Ukraine from the previous rescue package, which, combined with the new program, brings the total assistance from the I.M.F. to more than $22 billion.
Even that will not be enough, most experts agree.
Officials with the I.M.F. have been working to identify how much help Ukraine will need and where that assistance can come from.
The European Union late last month agreed to provide $2 billion in loans to Ukraine, while the United States has pledged $2 billion in loan guarantees, on the condition that the Ukrainian government remain committed to an ambitious overhaul program that many officials in Kiev acknowledge has been slow to take shape.
While the fund had demanded that Ukraine begin major changes and undertake some tough austerity measures in exchange for last April's rescue, the country's economic problems have outpaced the prescriptions.
For instance, at the fund's insistence, Ukraine last spring raised the tariffs paid by regular households for natural gas by 50 percent, a painful and unpopular increase but one intended to begin rolling back heavy government energy subsidies that have long contributed to the country's economic woes.
In the months after the tariff increase, however, the value of the hryvnia collapsed by nearly the same amount, wiping out any additional revenue for the state-owned gas company, Naftogaz, which bills its customers in the local currency but pays its suppliers, including Russia, in dollars.
Western officials have repeatedly expressed confidence that the government in Kiev is committed to change, and Ms. Lagarde repeated that optimism on Thursday.
Ms. Lagarde cited fiscal discipline that limited the decline in the country's annual economic output last year to a better-than-expected 4.6 percent, the increase in household gas prices and new anticorruption programs as promising steps.
Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk of Ukraine issued a statement saying that the government was committed to making the improvements, not to meet the demands of creditors, but for the benefit of the country.
"The program is aimed to restore economic growth," Mr. Yatsenyuk said of the help from the fund. He added, "We believe that 2016 will become for Ukraine a year of stabilization and economic growth."
Under the new aid program, called an extended fund facility, Ukraine will receive the maximum allowable four years of assistance.
It will also have more time to repay the loans, up to 10 years, compared to a maximum of five years under the prior program.
Ukraine is now expected to enter into tough negotiations with its existing debt holders seeking to reduce its huge borrowing costs.
Such savings, along with other assistance, is expected to bring the total financing package for Ukraine to more than $40 billion over the next four years, Ms. Lagarde said.
Among the challenges is that Russia is among those creditors, and a dispute seems to be looming over a $3 billion loan that was provided to Ukraine just before Mr. Yanukovych, the former president, fled.
Russia can demand to renegotiate terms of the loan if Ukraine's debt exceeds 60 percent of its gross domestic product, a threshold that the country may have already crossed.
Correction: February 20, 2015, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about the International Monetary Fund's approval of a new $17.5 billion bailout package for Ukraine, which is teetering on the edge of default, referred imprecisely to the circumstances under which Russia can demand to renegotiate the terms of a $3 billion loan provided to Ukraine in 2013. It can do so if Ukraine's overall debt -- not just its external debt, which is the amount owed to foreign creditors -- exceeds 60 percent of its gross domestic product.

As Global Oil Prices Decline, British Consumer Prices Follow

Abstract: The report highlights Britain's divergence with central banks in Europe that are cutting interest rates into negative territory and embarking on so-called quantitative easing, or asset purchase programs, to stimulate the economy.

Full text:   LONDON -- Consumer prices in Britain will continue to fall this year, with the possibility of inflation dipping into negative territory, the Bank of England said on Thursday.
After its anemic 0.5 percent rise in December, inflation is expected to decline to zero percent in the second quarter of 2015, and will most likely dip below zero briefly in the second half of the year, the central bank said in its quarterly inflation report.
The prospect of falling inflation means the market expects that interest rates, which remain at a low of 0.5 percent, will not increase until 2016, to 0.8 percent, and to 1.1 percent in 2017, the report said.
The possibility of declining inflation in Britain has different contours than the tumbling prices in Europe. Prices in Britain are falling because of a crash in oil prices and because of supermarket wars, which have driven down food and gas prices.
The British economy, said Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, is strong.
"Output growth remains solid and domestic demand growth robust," he said at a news conference.
The report highlights Britain's divergence with central banks in Europe that are cutting interest rates into negative territory and embarking on so-called quantitative easing, or asset purchase programs, to stimulate the economy.
Britain put quantitative easing into effect in March 2009 and has maintained 0.5 percent interest rates since then. If economic growth remains strong, it is expected to raise rates rather than cut them in the near future.
Mr. Carney said that lower gas and food prices were "unambiguously positive" for the British economy, which grew at a healthy clip of 2.6 percent last year, as consumers had more money to spend.
The Bank of England inflation report forecasts British unemployment to fall, to 5.4 percent in 2015, from 5.7 percent last year, unlike in Europe, which faces high unemployment and low growth. It will dip again to 5.2 percent in 2016, the central bank said.
Mr. Carney said he would "look through" the immediate effect of the fall in oil prices to broader economic forces like wages and productivity when contemplating when to raise rates.
The report predicts slack in the economy -- the difference between what the economy can produce and what it is producing -- to be about 0.5 percent, down from 1 percent last quarter. It expects slack to be eliminated by mid-2017.
Some economists worry about deflation, a state in which consumers delay purchases because they think goods and services will be cheaper in the future. But the inflation report anticipates healthy growth in real post-tax household income of 3.5 percent in 2015, and 3 percent in 2016.
As expected, Mr. Carney wrote a letter to the chancellor of the Exchequer on Thursday, explaining why inflation was more than one percentage point from target, which is 2 percent.
"The most important single reason for below-target inflation over the past year is the unexpected and sharp drop in energy prices," the letter said.
In the letter, he outlined scenarios under which inflation could rise faster than expected or fall further. For example, he said, if employers see inflation falling and refuse to raise wages, that could depress growth.
Though Mr. Carney sounded bullish on Britain's prospects, he made clear that he would be willing to cut rates or increase the size of its quantitative easing if needed.
This is a deviation from the past, when the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee said it would not lower rates because of weakness in the banking sector. "Reductions in the bank rate are therefore less likely to have undesirable effects on the supply of credit to the U.K. economy than previously judged by the M.P.C.," the letter said.
Economic projections are notoriously volatile, however, subject to assumptions about often-unforeseeable events. For example, few people saw oil prices' dropping as quickly as they did.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Over all, a composite index of American REITs has outperformed the S.&P. 500 for every five-year period for 40 years, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the trade association of the industry. According to a new report by Prudential Investment Management, about 60 million to 70 million people will be added to urban areas in the next 30 years.

Full text:   With the 2008 collapse still visible in many investors' rearview mirrors, it is often hard to make a case for real estate.
After all, the rebound of high-end Manhattan properties aside, didn't a crash caused by a credit bubble taint the idea of broader real estate investing?
But it still makes sense to own properties through real estate investment trusts, called REITs, and exchange-traded funds.
Fueled by growth in the United States and abroad, real estate trusts posted stellar returns last year. The benchmark American index had a total return of 27 percent last year, nearly double the total return, which includes dividends, of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in 2014.
Globally, REITs also beat the S.&P. 500. The global REIT benchmark index rose nearly 15 percent last year. Over all, a composite index of American REITs has outperformed the S.&P. 500 for every five-year period for 40 years, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the trade association of the industry.
Part of the reason REITs have performed consistently is that under United States law they must pay out at least 90 percent of their earnings to shareholders. That cash comes from rents paid by property owners. Yields on REITs that hold properties and mortgages averaged 4 percent last year, double the S.&P. 500's dividend yield.
While REITs can certainly be as volatile as stocks, in growing economies they can raise rents, which can offset their sensitivity to rising interest rates.
The growing expansion of urban areas will increase demand for developed properties. According to a new report by Prudential Investment Management, about 60 million to 70 million people will be added to urban areas in the next 30 years. That will spur development of retail, residential, office, health care and industrial projects. And falling oil prices will aid countries dependent on imported petroleum, if that trend continues.
Nevertheless, global economic health is worth watching because Brazil, Japan and most of Europe are reporting meager growth and China's growth appears to be slowing. In addition to their income bonus, REITs offer diversification from common stocks and bonds. Although they are traded on stock exchanges, these vehicles, owning mostly commercial real estate, rarely follow stocks closely.
But one of the strongest arguments for holding global real estate trusts in the near future is their resilience in an environment of rising interest rates, which many pundits predict is coming. A study last year by Altegris, an alternative investment firm, said the conventional wisdom that REITs would get burned if interest rates rise, as investors turn to vehicles with higher yields, was only partly true.
The firm studied REIT returns since 1972 and found that in seven periods of rising interest rates, REITs declined in only two and rose in five.
"The initial reaction to rising rates and REITs is negative," said Neena Mishra, director of exchange-traded fund research for Zacks Investment Research, "but long term they can withstand the reaction."
Ms. Mishra recommends broad-based exchange-traded funds that invest in a variety of REITs. Among her picks are the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ), which holds 143 companies, and the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR), which similarly holds companies investing in apartments and hotels, as well as industrial, office, public storage and retail properties. The SPDR Dow Jones International Real Estate ETF (RWX) invests in companies outside the United States.
Robert Stammers, director of investor education for the CFA Institute and a former real estate fund manager, said if investors thought they had invested enough in real estate by owning primary and secondary homes, "the correlation of commercial real estate with residential is low.
"REITs definitely have a role in portfolios," Mr. Stammers added. "They can provide a good inflation hedge and can perform well in the face of rising interest rates. Although performance as an inflation hedge or in the face of rising rates is not absolute, they are both good reasons to include REITs in an investment portfolio."
The downside of REITs is that they can go south in a widespread downturn in the global economy, as was the case in 2008. The NAREIT Composite Index fell nearly 38 percent that year in total return. That was roughly equivalent to the loss of the benchmark S.&P. 500-stock index.
Paula Hogan, a certified financial planner in Milwaukee, who called commercial real estate an "alternative" investment, recommends a small, steady exposure to REITs in the stock portion of a portfolio.
Just keep in mind that, even though they pay generous dividends, REITs should not be considered as safe as bonds; they will still take a hit if interest rates climb because they will be competing with bond yields. "They move like a stock in volatility," Ms. Hogan noted.
Investing in commercial real estate through individual REITs can be difficult, though, if investors are trying to time various markets. It may be wise to get professional advice and to think long term if investing for a retirement portfolio.
And investors who choose REITs should keep in mind they will incur some tax obligations if held outside retirement plans.

Abstract: Bonds in economically fragile Mediterranean countries like Spain and Italy should benefit from ebbing deflation fears, but loose European Central Bank policies have kept yields close to record lows, just like those of more stable economies.

Full text:   If global financial markets are telling a story, it's one set in a dystopia where chronic malaise keeps the economy on the verge of recession and companies can't raise prices because people can't afford to pay more.
One sign of the grim outlook is the collapse in oil prices to about $45 a barrel, close to a six-year low, from $108 last June. Other commodities -- including copper, corn, iron ore, platinum and soybeans -- are all trading near multiyear lows, too.
More evidence that investors expect a lingering slump can be seen in bonds; yields on American, European and Japanese government issues are near historical lows. Five-year German bonds even have a negative yield; the deflation story is so compelling that buyers are willing to pay more for the bonds than their face value, and all the interest payments they are due to receive, just to be assured of getting most of their money back.
What if there's a plot twist? What if global growth and inflation pick up, either because the central bank policies intended to engineer a recovery take hold at last, or else just because? Certain investments stand to rally vigorously if deflation fears prove unfounded, investment advisers say, and they have been hit so hard lately that the risk of further loss may be minimal even if conditions remain subdued.
"I thought coming into the year that 2015 would provide an opportunity to pick up assets priced for a deflationary abyss," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. "You don't even need inflation," he added. "You just need to avoid the abyss."
If the abyss is avoided, a variety of means exist to capitalize on that, including energy stocks, junk bonds and stocks in emerging markets, Mr. Paulsen said. A rebound in growth probably would increase demand for oil, and junk bonds would tend to rally as investors express relief that issuers are likely to have sufficient business to meet interest payments. A robust global economy helps emerging markets in several ways, by supporting their bonds and currencies, and expanding markets for companies that export commodities and other goods to the West.
John C. Maxwell, manager of the Ivy International Core Equity fund, agreed, saying that "if you really thought there was going to be global growth and healthy inflation, emerging markets would be an interesting place to go."
The same applies to other economically sensitive niches that have been shunned for several years, he said, including shares of mining companies, home builders and producers of building materials. He especially likes copper-mining stocks because in his view supply and demand are more closely balanced for copper than for other industrial metals, so he expects copper producers to respond more favorably to a rebound in growth.
Mr. Maxwell is more skeptical about prospects for big oil companies. These days, he remarked, "a lot more people are experts on the oil price after nobody got it right."
To Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families, a re-evaluation of deflationary expectations would make prospects particularly bright for Mexican stocks. Mexico's proximity to the United States has made its economy more resilient than those of other oil exporters, she pointed out, so it's also a comparatively safe option.
"One reason I think it's an interesting time for Mexico is that its economic fundamentals are decent, with a small deficit and growth closest to trend," she said, meaning the average rate across an economic cycle. She finds Mexico a good investment destination "if you think the U.S. might do O.K. this year and oil won't go to zero."
The same goes for Canada, she said. While far more mature economically than Mexico and other developing countries, Canada is a large energy exporter, and its economic output and currency have been hurt by the drop in oil prices, she noted.
Bonds in economically fragile Mediterranean countries like Spain and Italy should benefit from ebbing deflation fears, but loose European Central Bank policies have kept yields close to record lows, just like those of more stable economies. A weaker euro, which reduces the dollar value of European bonds and their income, means that American buyers face currency risk, too, so Ms. Patterson recommends avoiding them.
"I would stay far away from Spanish or Italian government bonds," she warned. "You're asking for pain. I don't see any benefit for dollar-based investors' owning European debt."
David B. Iben, manager of the Kopernik fund, said he found "no evidence of deflation whatsoever" and saw plenty of room to run for exotic commodity plays.
"We're finding incredible values in uranium, farmland, coal and electricity generation outside the U.S.," he said. "The market used to make you pay up for those, but they're trading at prices that should make them work out whether we get inflation or deflation."
Uranium supplies have been abundant since the Cold War ended, Mr. Iben said, and the 2011 nuclear plant disaster in Fukushima, Japan, has kept demand from nuclear plants, and therefore prices, low. But dozens of plants are going into operation, especially in China, he added, making nuclear power generation "a growth business, not a dying business."
He also likes South American farmland owners, such as SLC Agricola in Brazil and Cresud in Argentina, and electricity producers like Eletrobras in Brazil and RusHydro in Russia. Shares of all four trade in the United States.
Mr. Maxwell at Ivy said he was wary of buying stocks in Russia, where energy played a dominant role in the economy. Because of the geopolitical risk, he said, "I would not be going crazy and buying Russia."
Neither would Mr. Paulsen of Wells. He would avoid esoteric investments like those Mr. Iben suggested and stick with more sedate choices in case the global economy turned out to be more like the horror story that some feared and not a rags-to-riches tale.
"There are plays that will do well if the trend reverses without having to go into deep, deep plays like Russia," Mr. Paulsen said. "I like the idea of betting against deflation, but when there are so many bargains around, you can take a conservative approach."

Full text:   Critical elements of Puerto Rico's plan to avert financial disaster are in jeopardy, after a federal judge struck down a law that allowed the government to restructure certain debts.
The law, known as the Recovery Act, was meant to give Puerto Rico's public corporations protections similar to bankruptcy. Unlike American cities like Detroit, which used federal bankruptcy law to sort out its finances, Puerto Rico, a United States commonwealth, is not permitted to declare bankruptcy.
In his decision on Friday night, Judge Francisco A. Besosa of the United States District Court in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said the Recovery Act overstepped federal law, and he enjoined commonwealth officials from enforcing it. The government said on Monday that it planned to appeal the judge's ruling.
Without the Recovery Act, government officials worry that attempts to gain concessions from creditors and unions at public corporations like the deeply indebted Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority will dissolve into chaos.
The court ruling frightened some investors, who worry that the island is running out of ways to escape its basic predicament: tens of billions of dollars in debt and a stagnant economy.
Prices on Puerto Rico general obligation bonds dropped on Monday, the first trading day after the court ruling. Yields on a $3.5 billion bond that the commonwealth issued last March traded as high as 10.23 percent, topping yields on similar Greek bonds -- suggesting that Puerto Rico is at greater risk of default.
The plunging prices could complicate Puerto Rico's plans to sell roughly $2 billion in new bonds in the coming months -- money the island of 3.6 million people needs to repay previous debts.
"Who are they going to sell to?" asked Tom Metzold, a senior portfolio adviser at Eaton Vance, an investment company that has sold most of its Puerto Rico holdings. "Bondholders want to know what their rights and remedies are. There is no clarity about that at all."
Puerto Rican officials -- backed by hedge funds that own billions of dollars of the island's debt -- are turning to Washington for help. Puerto Rico's resident commissioner to Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, said he planned to push for federal legislation this week that would allow the commonwealth to approve bankruptcy filings by its municipalities and public corporations. The commonwealth itself could not file for bankruptcy under the proposed law, he said.
Mr. Pierluisi said he met Monday afternoon with a group of about 20 executives from hedge funds and private equity firms in New York to brief them on his effort to create a bankruptcy statute. Earlier on Monday, he discussed his proposal with ratings firms.
"You simply do not want to have a default," Mr. Pierluisi said. "You need to have some structure."
The legal turmoil is also testing the big bet by many of Wall Street's largest hedge funds and private equity firms that have barreled into the commonwealth's bonds and now own an estimated 25 percent of Puerto Rico debt. Funds including Fir Tree Partners and Centerbridge Partners are leading a group of investment firms, known as the Ad Hoc Group, that months ago expressed its willingness to offer the commonwealth financing options.
In some cases, there are signs that the hedge funds' reach for big profits may be faltering or at least delayed.
Hedge funds were big buyers of the commonwealth's bond deal in March, which originally sold at 93 cents on the dollar. On Monday, that price fell to as low as 81 cents on the dollar. The high interest rates that the bonds pay have softened the hedge funds' losses somewhat. But their investment is becoming increasingly complicated.
Some hedge funds are planning to double down and invest in the new bond deal, according to people briefed on the mater. The bond would probably be backed by revenues from a tax on petroleum, though investors are looking for the government to offer additional sweeteners like a provision that would tie the pledged revenue to inflation.
Many of the hedge funds that own Puerto Rico debt are seasoned investors in distressed situations that have profited by buying, for example, debt issued by Greece, a country that has possibly faced even bigger challenges than Puerto Rico.
Broadly, the hedge funds appear to expect that the new bond deal will buy Puerto Rico more time to overhaul its tax system. Once revenues start to perk up, the bonds should gain in value. Puerto Rico and its bond investors have applied a similar logic for years, viewing each new bond deal as a temporary fix. But with each deal, the commonwealth and its public corporations have sunk deeper in debt.
The Recovery Act was meant to give added protections to holders of Puerto Rico's general obligation debt by limiting restructurings to a handful of public corporations. But political pressure is growing for the government to spread the financial pain to all debt holders -- not just investors in the public corporation debt, said Robert Donahue, a managing director at Municipal Market Analytics.
"I think now everything is on the table," said Mr. Donahue.
Officials at the Government Development Bank, which oversees the commonwealth's debt deals, have said that the general obligation pledge remains sacrosanct.
"We view the court's decision as a temporary setback, and we will pursue all remedies available to continue to operate in the best interests of all our constituents and public interests," the bank's president, Melba Acosta Febo, said in a statement.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Many economists, including Janet Yellen, view global economic troubles since 2008 largely as a story about "deleveraging" -- a simultaneous attempt by debtors almost everywhere to reduce their liabilities. Why is deleveraging a problem? Because my spending is your income, and your spending is my income, so if everyone slashes spending at the same time, incomes go down around the world.
Or as Ms. Yellen put it in 2009, "Precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms -- and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state -- nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole."
So how much progress have we made in returning the economy to that "normal state"? None at all. You see, policy makers have been basing their actions on a false view of what debt is all about, and their attempts to reduce the problem have actually made it worse.
First, the facts: Last week, the McKinsey Global Institute issued a report titled "Debt and (Not Much) Deleveraging," which found, basically, that no nation has reduced its ratio of total debt to G.D.P. Household debt is down in some countries, especially in the United States. But it's up in others, and even where there has been significant private deleveraging, government debt has risen by more than private debt has fallen.
You might think our failure to reduce debt ratios shows that we aren't trying hard enough -- that families and governments haven't been making a serious effort to tighten their belts, and that what the world needs is, yes, more austerity. But we have, in fact, had unprecedented austerity. As the International Monetary Fund has pointed out, real government spending excluding interest has fallen across wealthy nations -- there have been deep cuts by the troubled debtors of Southern Europe, but there have also been cuts in countries, like Germany and the United States, that can borrow at some of the lowest interest rates in history.
All this austerity has, however, only made things worse -- and predictably so, because demands that everyone tighten their belts were based on a misunderstanding of the role debt plays in the economy.
You can see that misunderstanding at work every time someone rails against deficits with slogans like "Stop stealing from our kids." It sounds right, if you don't think about it: Families who run up debts make themselves poorer, so isn't that true when we look at overall national debt?
No, it isn't. An indebted family owes money to other people; the world economy as a whole owes money to itself. And while it's true that countries can borrow from other countries, America has actually been borrowing less from abroad since 2008 than it did before, and Europe is a net lender to the rest of the world.
Because debt is money we owe to ourselves, it does not directly make the economy poorer (and paying it off doesn't make us richer). True, debt can pose a threat to financial stability -- but the situation is not improved if efforts to reduce debt end up pushing the economy into deflation and depression.
Which brings us to current events, for there is a direct connection between the overall failure to deleverage and the emerging political crisis in Europe.
European leaders completely bought into the notion that the economic crisis was brought on by too much spending, by nations living beyond their means. The way forward, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany insisted, was a return to frugality. Europe, she declared, should emulate the famously thrifty Swabian housewife.
This was a prescription for slow-motion disaster. European debtors did, in fact, need to tighten their belts -- but the austerity they were actually forced to impose was incredibly savage. Meanwhile, Germany and other core economies -- which needed to spend more, to offset belt-tightening in the periphery -- also tried to spend less. The result was to create an environment in which reducing debt ratios was impossible: Real growth slowed to a crawl, inflation fell to almost nothing and outright deflation has taken hold in the worst-hit nations.
Suffering voters put up with this policy disaster for a remarkably long time, believing in the promises of the elite that they would soon see their sacrifices rewarded. But as the pain went on and on, with no visible progress, radicalization was inevitable. Anyone surprised by the left's victory in Greece, or the surge of anti-establishment forces in Spain, hasn't been paying attention.
Nobody knows what happens next. Bookmakers are still giving better than even odds that Greece will stay in the euro. But if it doesn't, I don't believe the damage would stop there -- a Greek exit is all too likely to threaten the whole currency project. And if the euro does fail, here's what should be written on its tombstone: "Died of a bad analogy."
Correction: February 19, 2015, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Paul Krugman's column on Monday incorrectly described bookmakers' odds that Greece will exit the eurozone. The odds were worse than even, not better than even.

Full text:   Here are some of the top business stories to pay attention to in the coming week.
WILLIAMS BEGINS LEAVE Monday night officially begins Brian Williams's indefinite leave from NBC's "Nightly News," while the network investigates the anchor's admittedly false account of a forced helicopter landing in Iraq in 2003 and his reporting during Hurricane Katrina, among other issues. Lester Holt, the anchor for "Dateline," will step in as a substitute. Mr. Williams also will not appear on CBS's "Late Show With David Letterman" on Thursday as had been planned, a person who works for NBC News confirmed. EMILY STEEL
OIL AND STEEL REPORTS The fallout from the deep slump in oil prices will continue to be in evidence this week when Total, the French giant, reports quarterly and annual results on Thursday. Patrick Pouyanné, who became chief executive last year after the death of Christophe de Margerie in a Moscow plane crash, is expected to present his cost-cutting plans at a news conference in London.
On Friday, results from ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel maker, will show whether economic jitters in Europe are beginning to put the brakes on what had already been a painfully slow recovery for the industry. ThyssenKrupp, Europe's second-largest steel maker, will report on the same day. STANLEY REED
EUROPEAN LEADERS MEET Can Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany avoid a showdown over austerity with Greece's newly elected prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, at a meeting of European Union leaders on Thursday? Mr. Tsipras wants far less onerous terms for an international bailout of his country. Ms. Merkel, backed by leaders from other European creditor nations, wants the Greeks to stick to previously agreed-upon reforms and cuts. Mr. Tsipras looks set to win a vote of confidence in the Greek Parliament by a comfortable margin early in the week.
But by failing to strike a compromise with Europe, Mr. Tsipras could lead his country into a default and a chaotic exit from the euro, which would pose risks to the wider European economy. Efforts to defuse the tensions go into high gear on Wednesday evening, when the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, joins his 18 eurozone counterparts for emergency talks ahead of the leaders' meeting. JAMES KANTER and NIKI KITSANTONIS
HASBRO EARNINGS The toy industry will be paying keen attention to Hasbro's earnings on Monday morning, after a recent management shake-up at Mattel drew more scrutiny to two giants that have struggled to keep up with changes in technology and consumer appetites. Unlike Mattel, whose earnings have been gloomy, Hasbro's earnings per share have been roughly flat in recent years. Analysts will pay special attention to how much items like Hasbro's Get Up and GoGo My Walkin' Pup Pet and Transformers action figures lifted holiday sales. RACHEL ABRAMS
SWISS BANK RESULTS The Swiss bank UBS will report its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday and Credit Suisse will report its results on Thursday. The big question on the minds of investors this week will be the potential impact on the banks' bottom lines of the rise of the Swiss franc to the euro. Last month, Switzerland abandoned measures to hold down the value of the franc to the euro as concerns about Europe's economy pushed the euro downward.
UBS and Credit Suisse have both said that they did not sustain trading losses as a result of the jump in the franc after the Swiss National Bank's move in January, but the rise in the franc could potentially lower their profits. Both banks hold capital in a variety of currencies, like the dollar, but report results in francs. In a research report last month, Barclays estimated that the move in the franc could reduce UBS's results by as much as 14 percent and Credit Suisse's results by as much as 15 percent. CHAD BRAY
ONLINE MUSIC CASE Trial begins in federal court in New York on Tuesday in a case pitting Pandora Media, the Internet radio giant, against the music licensing agency BMI, the latest clash over the value of music online. Pandora wants its royalty rate lowered to what terrestrial radio broadcasters pay, while BMI -- a clearinghouse for millions of songs -- wants Pandora's rate raised, arguing that it makes more intensive use of music than any traditional radio station.
The case comes as Pandora has been pummeled by Wall Street over lower-than-expected revenues, and also as legal and regulatory issues in the music industry are under scrutiny. Last week the United States Copyright Office recommended a series of changes in music copyright, and the Justice Department is currently considering changes in the decades-old regulatory agreements that govern BMI and its rival, Ascap. BEN SISARIO
CHINESE INFLATION China releases its consumer price index and producer price index for January on Tuesday morning in Beijing. Falling prices for oil and other commodities are expected to result in very low inflation at the consumer level, around 1 percent, and continued deflation at the producer level, with prices falling more than 3 percent from a year earlier. But other monthly statistics normally issued in the second week of each month will not be coming out at all, including industrial production, retail sales, overall fixed asset investment and real estate investment.
The Lunar New Year holiday falls each year between late January and the middle of February -- it is in the third week of February this year -- and has a big effect on the economy because factories close for at least a week and often longer. So year-on-year comparisons of output in January or February are almost meaningless, and China waits until early March to release aggregate figures for January and February for numerous economic indicators. KEITH BRADSHER
ELIS I.P.O. Elis, the French provider of rental uniforms, table and bed linens and carpets to businesses, is expected to begin trading on Euronext in Paris on Wednesday after pricing its initial public offering. The offering comes as European I.P.O.s are on pace for their best start since the financial crisis. Elis intends to sell 670 million euros, or about $763 million, in new shares in the I.P.O., while an entity controlled by the French buyout company Eurazeo and a group of Elis employees and managers plans to sell about [euro]50 million of their holdings in the company.
Eurazeo acquired Elis from the French private equity firm PAI Partners in October 2007 in a deal that valued the company at about [euro]2.28 billion. Eurazeo currently holds an 83 percent stake in Elis. Elis expects to price its I.P.O. at [euro]13 to [euro]16.50 a share. CHAD BRAY
TESLA'S NUMBERS The electric carmaker Tesla Motors will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday evening, and investors will be watching to see whether the company was able to achieve its goal of delivering 33,000 cars last year. Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report monthly sales figures, only quarterly deliveries, and it needs around 11,000 more vehicles to make its target.
Tesla's stock is still up year-over-year, but it has been in a slide since September as the market worried about the company's troubles in China and the prospect that Tesla might not be profitable until the end of the decade. AARON M. KESSLER
FASHION WEEK BEGINS The fall New York Fashion Week kicks off Wednesday, a perfume-infused nine days of designer shows from upstarts like Karolina Zmarlak and industry stalwarts like Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren. Among the events generating the most buzz is the expected introduction of a new line from Adidas and the hip-hop artist Kanye West, reflecting the strength of the "athleisure" fitness apparel boom in the United States. The twice-yearly fashion week, sponsored by Mercedes and run by the WME-IMG agency, is in the midst of an overhaul, and is set to move from Lincoln Center to downtown Manhattan later this year. HIROKO TABUCHI
JANUARY RETAIL SALES On Thursday, the Commerce Department will report on retail sales in January. In December, retail sales fell as gas stations took in less money because of plunging energy prices, and because some holiday shopping had shifted to November. Economists expect the headline number to decline again for January, with gas prices continuing to drop and auto sales softer. Excluding those two often-volatile categories, economists expect retail sales to have increased by 0.4 percent in January, as consumers put the money they were saving on fuel to work elsewhere. In addition, frantic preparation for the blizzard that largely failed to materialize on the East Coast may have given retail activity a tiny boost last month. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Many economists, including Janet Yellen, view global economic troubles since 2008 largely as a story about "deleveraging" -- a simultaneous attempt by debtors almost everywhere to reduce their liabilities. Why is deleveraging a problem? Because my spending is your income, and your spending is my income, so if everyone slashes spending at the same time, incomes go down around the world.
Or as Ms. Yellen put it in 2009, "Precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms -- and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state -- nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole."
So how much progress have we made in returning the economy to that "normal state"? None at all. You see, policy makers have been basing their actions on a false view of what debt is all about, and their attempts to reduce the problem have actually made it worse.
First, the facts: Last week, the McKinsey Global Institute issued a report titled "Debt and (Not Much) Deleveraging," which found, basically, that no nation has reduced its ratio of total debt to G.D.P. Household debt is down in some countries, especially in the United States. But it's up in others, and even where there has been significant private deleveraging, government debt has risen by more than private debt has fallen.
You might think our failure to reduce debt ratios shows that we aren't trying hard enough -- that families and governments haven't been making a serious effort to tighten their belts, and that what the world needs is, yes, more austerity. But we have, in fact, had unprecedented austerity. As the International Monetary Fund has pointed out, real government spending excluding interest has fallen across wealthy nations -- there have been deep cuts by the troubled debtors of Southern Europe, but there have also been cuts in countries, like Germany and the United States, that can borrow at some of the lowest interest rates in history.
All this austerity has, however, only made things worse -- and predictably so, because demands that everyone tighten their belts were based on a misunderstanding of the role debt plays in the economy.
You can see that misunderstanding at work every time someone rails against deficits with slogans like "Stop stealing from our kids." It sounds right, if you don't think about it: Families who run up debts make themselves poorer, so isn't that true when we look at overall national debt?
No, it isn't. An indebted family owes money to other people; the world economy as a whole owes money to itself. And while it's true that countries can borrow from other countries, America has actually been borrowing less from abroad since 2008 than it did before, and Europe is a net lender to the rest of the world.
Because debt is money we owe to ourselves, it does not directly make the economy poorer (and paying it off doesn't make us richer). True, debt can pose a threat to financial stability -- but the situation is not improved if efforts to reduce debt end up pushing the economy into deflation and depression.
Which brings us to current events, for there is a direct connection between the overall failure to deleverage and the emerging political crisis in Europe.
European leaders completely bought into the notion that the economic crisis was brought on by too much spending, by nations living beyond their means. The way forward, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany insisted, was a return to frugality. Europe, she declared, should emulate the famously thrifty Swabian housewife.
This was a prescription for slow-motion disaster. European debtors did, in fact, need to tighten their belts -- but the austerity they were actually forced to impose was incredibly savage. Meanwhile, Germany and other core economies -- which needed to spend more, to offset belt-tightening in the periphery -- also tried to spend less. The result was to create an environment in which reducing debt ratios was impossible: Real growth slowed to a crawl, inflation fell to almost nothing and outright deflation has taken hold in the worst-hit nations.
Suffering voters put up with this policy disaster for a remarkably long time, believing in the promises of the elite that they would soon see their sacrifices rewarded. But as the pain went on and on, with no visible progress, radicalization was inevitable. Anyone surprised by the left's victory in Greece, or the surge of anti-establishment forces in Spain, hasn't been paying attention.
Nobody knows what happens next. Bookmakers are still giving better than even odds that Greece will stay in the euro. But if it doesn't, I don't believe the damage would stop there -- a Greek exit is all too likely to threaten the whole currency project. And if the euro does fail, here's what should be written on its tombstone: "Died of a bad analogy."
Correction: February 13, 2015, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Paul Krugman's column on Monday incorrectly described bookmakers' odds that Greece will exit the eurozone. The odds were worse than even, not better than even.

Abstract: Mrs. Clinton's economic plan would be more populist and reliant on the government than the centrist approach of trade agreements, welfare reform and deficit reduction associated with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.

Full text:   With advice from more than 200 policy experts, Hillary Rodham Clinton is trying to answer what has emerged as a central question of her early presidential campaign strategy: how to address the anger about income inequality without overly vilifying the wealthy.
Mrs. Clinton has not had to wade into domestic policy since before she became secretary of state in 2009, and she has spent the past few months engaged in policy discussions with economists on the left and closer to the Democratic Party's center who are grappling with the discontent set off by the gap between rich and poor. Sorting through the often divergent advice to develop an economic plan could affect the timing and planning of the official announcement of her campaign.
Although people close to Mrs. Clinton say she has not yet settled on a specific platform, she is expected to embrace several principles. They include standard Democratic initiatives like raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, closing corporate tax loopholes and cutting taxes for the middle class. Other ideas are newer, such as providing incentives to corporations to increase profit-sharing with employees and changing labor laws to give workers more collective bargaining power.
Behind many of these proposals is a philosophy, endorsed by Mrs. Clinton's closest economic advisers and often referred to as inclusive capitalism, that contends that a majority of Americans do not want to punish the rich; they just want to feel that they, too, have a chance to succeed. It also calls for corporations to put less emphasis on short-term profits that increase shareholder value and to invest more in employees, the environment and communities.
Whether Mrs. Clinton's approach will be enough to satisfy the unease over growing economic disparity is unclear. In a Gallup poll conducted last month, 67 percent of Americans said they were dissatisfied with the way income and wealth are distributed in the United States. In the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, Mrs. Clinton's economic message -- summed up by a frequent refrain, "If you work hard, you play by the rules, you ought to be able to get ahead" -- resonated with white, working-class voters, who overwhelmingly supported her over Barack Obama.
But in the years since, Mrs. Clinton has come under criticism for delivering speeches to Wall Street banks at more than $200,000 each, roughly four times the median annual household income in the United States, and for comments she made about her family's financial situation, including a lament about being "dead broke" after leaving the White House. And she must convince a middle class that feels frustrated and left behind that she understands its struggles, even as she relies heavily on the financial industry and corporate interests to fund her candidacy.
Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said she had "a record of bringing people together to solve big problems, while also putting a real premium on accountability."
Asked whether creating an economic message could affect the timeline for her presidential campaign, Mr. Merrill said, "There's no red X on a calendar somewhere, but make no mistake: If she runs, she will present solutions to our toughest challenges."
Mrs. Clinton's economic plan would be more populist and reliant on the government than the centrist approach of trade agreements, welfare reform and deficit reduction associated with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
"It's not enough to address upward mobility without addressing inequality," said Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration who is among those talking with Mrs. Clinton. "The challenge, though, is to address inequality without embracing a politics of envy."
The debate is extending beyond the Democratic Party as Republicans wade into the issues. "If Americans are working harder than ever, earning less than they once did, our government and our leaders should step up, offer a plan, fix what's wrong," former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said in a speech in Detroit last week as he laid the groundwork for his potential 2016 candidacy.
Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state when some major economic debates took hold on Capitol Hill, and as a result, her economic views are still not broadly known. Her approach to poverty was forged in the 1970s, when she went door to door while working for the Children's Defense Fund, leaving her a committed advocate for early childhood education, equal pay for women and paid leave.
But later experiences complicated her worldview. Many of the advocates who knew Mrs. Clinton as a champion for the poor and working-class women felt betrayed in 1996 when, as first lady, she supported Mr. Clinton's overhaul of the welfare system, which gave states more power to remove people from welfare rolls and pledged to cut federal spending on assistance for the poor by nearly $55 billion over six years. She was more skeptical about the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Clinton signed into law in 1993 and which has also been accused of hurting American workers.
After being elected in New York to the United States Senate in 2000, Mrs. Clinton had another constituency to represent: Wall Street. In 2001, she supported bankruptcy legislation that some Democrats -- most notably Elizabeth Warren, now senator from Massachusetts -- argued hurt working families and single mothers, and they accused her of doing the bidding of the financial industry. Mrs. Clinton has said she worked to improve the bill.
As a presidential candidate in 2008, Mrs. Clinton angered some of her Wall Street donors when she came out early in support of the regulation of derivatives and other complicated financial products and called for eliminating the "carried interest" loophole that allowed some financiers to avoid paying millions in income taxes. She also said that as president, she would create a cabinet-level position to fight poverty.
When the housing market collapsed, Mrs. Clinton, who had returned to the Senate full time after Mr. Obama defeated her, proposed legislation similar to a New Deal-era program that would allow the government to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. She voted in favor of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which led to the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the multibillion-dollar bailout for automakers.
Last month, Mrs. Clinton reiterated her support for the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. "Attacking financial reform is risky and wrong," she wrote on Twitter.
As she dives back into domestic policy, Mrs. Clinton faces an economy in which, even amid steady job growth, weekly earnings for low- and middle-income workers have remained virtually unchanged for 15 years.
"Where has the money gone?" asked Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor during the Clinton administration. "That is the topic that is embarrassing for people to talk about, particularly in Washington, because even mentioning it creates the potential charge of class warfare."
Mr. Reich, who recently sent Mrs. Clinton a five-page memo laying out his ideas, said candidates in both parties needed to abandon the politically safe discussion of upward mobility for the poor and middle class that dominated the 1990s, and instead take on the stickier issue of income distribution.
"Upward mobility, equal opportunity -- those are safe phrases and safe aspirations," he said in an interview. "I don't want to minimize their importance, but they obscure the real issue."
Mr. Reich is one of some 200 economists and academics who have offered Mrs. Clinton ideas and guidance as she settles on an economic doctrine. Several of Mr. Clinton's former advisers, including Alan S. Blinder, Robert E. Rubin and Mr. Summers, maintain influence. But Mrs. Clinton has cast a wide net that also includes Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics who has written extensively about inequality; Alan B. Krueger, a professor at Princeton and co-author of "Inequality in America"; and Peter R. Orszag, a former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama. Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist who focuses on retirement issues, is also playing a prominent role.
Last month in Washington, a 17-person commission convened by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank with close ties to Mrs. Clinton, presented a 166-page report on "inclusive prosperity," which is among the numerous economic blueprints Mrs. Clinton has reviewed. For some, the solutions proposed by the committee, of which Mr. Summers was co-chairman, did not go far enough.
Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, has pushed the idea of a government fee on the sale or purchase of certain financial assets, which he believes could hold Wall Street accountable while funding social services. "Clinton people didn't want to go near it," Mr. Baker said.
Mrs. Clinton has not commented on the financial transaction tax or on profit-sharing.
She has expressed support for many of the proposals Mr. Obama laid out in his State of the Union address last month, signaling that they could help shape her agenda. In a post on Twitter, she said the speech had "pointed way to an economy that works for all. Now we need to step up & deliver for the middle class."
Mrs. Clinton frequently talks about the economic success of the Clinton administration, under which median family income, adjusted for inflation, increased to $56,080 in 1999 from $48,884 in 1993, compared with a decline to $51,017 in 2012 from $55,987 in 2000, according to census data. But she has acknowledged that a globalized economy calls for new ideas, and many are urging her to go beyond her comfort zone and address the deeper frustrations of those who have not shared in that economy's benefits.
"Long-term answers about education and skills that help change mobility don't get at the current frustrations and aggravations," said Austan D. Goolsbee, an economic adviser to Mr. Obama and a professor at the University of Chicago.
"People want to answer the question, 'Are we going to be O.K.?' " Mr. Goolsbee said. "And then the natural question is, 'Whose fault was that, and let's go find those people.' "

Full text:   Anxiety and uncertainty are weighing on individuals even where the overall economy is growing.
Some of this angst is the fallout from advances in information technology. The Internet, ubiquitous computing, robotics, 3-D printers and the like are wonderful advances, yet they may also be personal threats: For some, the technologies may eliminate our jobs or potential future jobs, or make them less lucrative. For others, they may bring new riches.
Even people with moderately high incomes have reason to be uncertain. Some college professors, tenured or not, might lose their jobs in the face of massive open online courses, while others prosper from them. Lawyers might find less demand for services that can be supplanted by computerized legal research tools. News and entertainment media have already faced huge technology-related job losses.
Along with this enormous problem is the psychic cost of growing income inequality. Poor people, who see themselves slipping further and further behind, are hurting, of course. What's less obvious is that yawning inequality also seems to be preoccupying the rich. For example, an Oxfam report issued last month, "Richest 1 Percent Will Own More Than All the Rest by 2016," was the focus of many nervous conversations at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which I attended. Davos is a gathering of the global elite yet even many of those in such rarefied circles are wondering whether they and their friends and loved ones will lose their privileged status in the future.
Such fears are not measured by the usual consumer confidence indexes. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index reached its highest level since 2004 in January. But this index, and others like it, look ahead only into the short term and report about perceived aggregate conditions rather than individual risks.
I suspect that there is a real, if still unsubstantiated, link between widespread anxieties and the strange dynamics of the economic world we live in today -- a link that helps to explain why it's not just short-term interest rates that are very low, but long-term rates, too. Understanding long rates might also help explain why stock market prices are so high in some countries and why real estate prices have come up in many places since the financial crisis.
In the United States, for example, the 30-year Treasury bond yield hit a record low on Jan. 30 of 2.25 percent, and the 30-year fixed-rate home mortgage reached 3.59 percent as of Feb. 5, also a very low level. The rate for 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities was just 0.52 percent on Jan. 30. These unusual rates cannot be attributed entirely to the Federal Reserve, because it stopped quantitative easing in October, and rates have dropped since then. While other central banks certainly are affecting global interest rates, something else is going on.
One puzzle is that many people are willing to lock up their savings at these paltry rates for decades. When rates are this low, there may seem to be very little incentive for people to save. Yet according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal saving as a fraction of disposable personal income stood at 4.9 percent for the United States in December. That may not be an impressive level, but it's not particularly low by historical standards. The answer may be that all this uncertainty impels them to do that.
In a classic 1978 paper, "Asset Prices in an Exchange Economy," a University of Chicago economist, Robert Lucas, presented a mathematical model that shows that increased uncertainty about future incomes can indeed push up all asset prices and push down expected returns, even in perfectly efficient markets.
When there is unusual uncertainty about the future, and if not enough new business initiatives can be found to increase the supply of good investments, people will compete to bid up existing investable assets. They may go so far in bidding up prices that even though the assets may have horrible prospects, people will still want to hold them because they feel they have to save somewhere.
There is a great deal that we don't know about market movements. Interest rates and prices generally reach extreme levels when there is an unusual confluence of many precipitating factors, like anxiety, and others as well. We are usually puzzled by this multiplicity.
And, because markets are really not very efficient, the effect of these varied factors tends to be amplified through emotional feedback. For example, when people start to see rates or prices changing, some of them take action: They are enticed into the market when prices are rising, and often leave when prices fall. We then are typically surprised by the extent of apparent market overreaction to precipitating factors that we didn't think were really on everyone's mind.
At the moment, anxiety does not seem to be the basis of much public discussion of asset pricing. That's understandable: There may be no real benefit from bringing up the effect of these diffuse fears on market strategy with your tax preparer, lawyer or financial adviser, who surely will not have an authoritative opinion on what to do about them.
Anyone can tell you that there is no certainty about the effect that new technologies will have on job security in coming decades: There is a risk, but it is hard to quantify for general categories of jobs, and nearly impossible to calculate for individuals. Yet these concerns have effects on investor decision-making through the emotional component of our actions -- what John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist, called our animal spirits.
Uncertainties about individual economic fortunes can affect asset prices through an important indirect channel, government policy, which is swayed by popular concerns. Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in his book "Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy" (Princeton 2010) argued that governments were more tolerant of excessive credit expansion when their citizens were upset about rising inequality. Governments, he said, use expanded credit in a desperate effort to placate a dissatisfied electorate. Credit expansion can create housing bubbles and an illusion of wealth for many people, for a while, at least. The idea is: "Let them eat credit."
But with rising anxiety about our economic lives and about the state of the markets, we need something more substantial than credit expansion to help us. We all need to think hard about the underlying mechanisms producing individual uncertainty and inequality, and we need to devise financial and insurance plans to help us to deal with whatever looms ahead.

Abstract: The Labor Department said on Friday that employers added a seasonally adjusted 257,000 jobs in January, but even more significant was a revision of earlier estimates showing an additional gain of 147,000 jobs in November and December. Since Nov. 1, employers have hired more than one million new workers, the best performance over a three-month period since 1997.

Full text:   The economy cruised into the new year with a burst of fresh momentum, adding jobs at the fastest pace since the boom of the late 1990s and lifting employment and wage prospects for millions of Americans left behind in a long but mostly lackluster recovery.
The Labor Department said on Friday that employers added a seasonally adjusted 257,000 jobs in January, but even more significant was a revision of earlier estimates showing an additional gain of 147,000 jobs in November and December.
Since Nov. 1, employers have hired more than one million new workers, the best performance over a three-month period since 1997. More jobs were created in 2014 as a whole than in any year since 1999.
"This is the best employment report we've had in a long time," said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. "The labor market looks like it's in really good shape as we head into 2015."
If the job market continues to gather strength into the run-up to the presidential election of 2016, as some forecasters now predict, the rebound promises to reshape the political landscape, as well as the economic one.
Fierce Republican criticism of President Obama's economic policies, a touchstone of the 2012 presidential campaign, could resonate less with voters the next time around. Hillary Rodham Clinton or another potential Democratic nominee might have an easier time making the case for keeping the White House in Democratic hands.
The key, say political experts from both parties, is how the bounty from renewed growth is shared and whether wages for middle-income workers rise more quickly, along with other yardsticks like overall economic activity and the stock market.
"Good statistics always favor incumbents or the incumbent party," said Wayne Berman, who served as a top Commerce Department official under the first President Bush and more recently was a senior adviser to the Romney and McCain campaigns.
"The challenge for Republicans remains the same in the face of today's numbers," said Mr. Berman, now head of government relations at the Blackstone Group. "We have to advocate policies that are relevant to middle-income Americans' everyday lives."
On the wage front, the jury is still out. Last month, average hourly earnings rebounded after falling in December, increasing 2.2 percent for the last 12 months and suggesting that the benefits of a tighter job market could soon begin to spread more broadly to ordinary workers.
But the major question after Friday's report is whether better wage growth can be sustained.
A few other signals are flashing yellow as well. Data last week showed that economic output grew at a slower-than-expected 2.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 2014.
And on Thursday, the government reported a big jump in the country's trade deficit in December, as imports surged and exports fell. With the dollar gaining strength against the euro and other currencies, a rising trade imbalance may weigh on the economy in 2015.
Nevertheless, even the one seemingly negative note in the January jobs report -- an increase in the unemployment rate to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent in December -- was actually an encouraging sign, analysts said, since it was mostly caused by more jobless Americans looking for work again as labor demand heats up.
The overall picture was so encouraging, experts said, that Federal Reserve policy makers may feel more comfortable starting their long-awaited move to raise short-term interest rates in June, a step Wall Street had generally expected to be delayed until September or even later.
"Employment growth is astonishingly strong," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "With every indicator we follow screaming that payrolls will be very strong for the foreseeable future, wage pressures will intensify."
Others cautioned that the Fed would probably wait for more evidence that underlying inflation was picking up before deciding to pull the trigger.
"This is a step in the right direction, but it is not a game changer for the Fed," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. "It takes away the concern that wages are decelerating, but we still have to see them accelerate."
Although the unemployment rate has been steadily falling since peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, wage gains have been paltry, especially when inflation is taken into account.
And even in months when wages rose more sharply, hopes for a more durable upswing were dashed by weakness the next month, as in November and December, when a 0.2 percent jump was immediately followed by a 0.2 percent dip.
That has added to the challenges facing Fed officials in gauging whether the slack built up in the labor market since the recession is finally receding and how much economic running room they should provide for wages to catch up after a long period of stagnation.
The jobless rate is an imperfect guide because people who give up the search for work entirely are not counted as unemployed. Last month's slight increase in the participation rate was encouraging, despite the resulting rise in the unemployment rate, because it suggested that more such people are being lured back to the job market, helping to heal the economy without generating fears of outsize inflation.
Although the latest data was stronger than most analysts expected, it is unlikely to change the timetable for Federal Reserve officials because it is consistent with the Fed's expectations. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, and other officials have signaled repeatedly that they would like to start raising rates come summer.
"I remain comfortable with the assumption that circumstances will come together around midyear or a little later," Dennis Lockhart, chief of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a speech Friday in Naples, Fla. "I won't be more definitive than that. I think all possibilities from June on should remain open."
Ms. Yellen may provide some additional insight when she makes a biannual appearance Feb. 24 before a Senate committee to testify about monetary policy. She will testify before a House committee the next day.
Along with the generally positive tenor of the headline numbers, economists were also heartened by job gains in a broad variety of industries, both white collar and blue collar.
For example, the construction industry, which is still suffering from the effects of the housing bust seven years ago, gained 39,000 jobs. Manufacturers added 22,000 workers, and restaurant and food service employment rose nearly 35,000.
At the same time, higher-paid tiers of the economy also displayed strength. Financial companies and insurance providers hired more than 22,000 additional workers, and the booming health care field gained another 38,300.
One notable weak spot was oil and gas extraction, as plunging energy prices prompted companies to lay off 1,900 workers, bringing total employment in the sector to 199,500. The public sector eliminated 10,000 jobs, including a 6,000 cut in employment by the federal government.
"The good news is that there was hiring across a wide range," said Tara M. Sinclair, a professor of economics at George Washington University and chief economist at Indeed.com, one of the nation's largest job-posting sites .
"People worry about having too many low-end jobs being created," she said. "But we need those jobs too."

Abstract: "The number of people who will be ready to listen to us will increase," said Mr. Navalny, 38, wearing a dark blue-gray sweatshirt and bluejeans, his previously lean frame reflecting the past year spent confined by house arrest to his 800-square-foot, three-room apartment.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. MOSCOW -- Glancing out the window at the swirling snow, Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition activist, mused aloud about how mounting economic problems, along with some public antagonism toward the Kremlin's role in the war in Ukraine, may have damaged President Vladimir V. Putin's administration enough to make it vulnerable.
He is gambling that they have, leading a drive by the fractious, somewhat anemic opposition movement to organize an anti-crisis demonstration on March 1, testing its conviction that Muscovites -- if not the broader Russian public -- are fed up.
"The number of people who will be ready to listen to us will increase," said Mr. Navalny, 38, wearing a dark blue-gray sweatshirt and bluejeans, his previously lean frame reflecting the past year spent confined by house arrest to his 800-square-foot, three-room apartment. "We can see that people support Crimea and all this stuff, but they don't want to pay for that."
Having been Russia's leader for the past 15 years, Mr. Putin can no longer entirely blame the deepening economic crisis on his predecessors or even on foreign hostility, Mr. Navalny said in an interview, after months of being barred from speaking to the news media.
"It is much easier for us to explain that within these 15 years, Putin actually did nothing," he said. "All the time they told us that they are reconstructing the great Russia, they are reconstructing the great Soviet Union and blah blah. But now oil prices dropped and everything is falling apart."
The government has tried to extend his house arrest, despite the sentencing in December. Mr. Navalny plans to pick up where he left off, trying to weaken the centralized authority of Mr. Putin and the ruling United Russia party by highlighting accusations of corruption and mismanagement. The president may enjoy an 84 percent approval rating for returning Crimea to Russian control last March, he said, but polling by Mr. Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation indicates that 87 percent want government corruption curbed.
Despite Mr. Putin's huge personal support, "he cannot delegate this support to the lower level, that is why this system is so weak," Mr. Navalny said.
The headquarters of his anti-corruption campaign are in an upscale office block. They could be the disheveled offices of a campaign anywhere, except one whiteboard details the interrogation schedule of employees hauled in for questioning by the security services -- 12 sessions in three days.
Mr. Navalny, a father of two who trained as a corporate lawyer, lives in permanent legal twilight. He has been convicted twice in court, while the appeal against a third conviction, on Dec. 30, for criminal fraud will start Feb. 17, it was announced this week.
His three-and-a-half year sentence was suspended, but his younger brother, Oleg, 31, was sent to jail for the same term. "Their idea was to punish me by imprisoning my brother and keeping me quiet and isolated in my apartment," he said. "They have a long history and long experience of torturing people, so I guess that they are good psychologists in such situations."
His brother remains in good spirits, he said, brandishing a recent letter in which Oleg had sketched Mr. Putin as a toad sitting on an oil spigot, a reference to one of Mr. Navalny's earlier speeches.
Still, the criminal cases against Mr. Navalny multiply. The latest accusation is that he received a stolen piece of street art from the nearby city of Vladimir that neither the janitor who painted it nor the municipality that regularly trashes such works claims was stolen, he said. An active case means the security services can legally continue to follow him, monitor his telephone calls and Internet traffic, and the like, he said.
Mr. Navalny is not quite sure why he was spared jail, but guesses that Mr. Putin has larger concerns right now and does not want another prominent political prisoner to become an international cause célèbre, after releasing the oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky in December 2013. House arrest generates far less sympathy, he said.
Mr. Khodorkovsky joined other opposition figures in endorsing the March 1 rally, and Mr. Navalny said the two men share similar ideological outlooks. "I consider him an ally," he said.
Both men want to be president of Russia one day, yet share similar handicaps. For one, their convictions bar them from running for office for many years. (Before the convictions, Mr. Navalny was released from jail while one case was on appeal and allowed to run for mayor of Moscow in 2012, winning a surprising 27.2 percent of the vote.)
In addition, both are viewed with some suspicion by Russian liberals: Mr. Navalny for his occasional nationalistic pronouncements and Mr. Khodorkovsky for getting stupendously rich through what many considered the dubious acquisition of state assets.
Opposition to Russian involvement in the war in Ukraine is the main theme of the March 1 rally. The rally needs a permit, and Mr. Navalny thinks it may get one for a location on Moscow's outskirts, but not in the center.
"Everyone understands that war with Ukraine is just crazy," he said. But other issues include some major political and economic demands: reducing the 32 percent of the government budget dedicated to defense and public security; canceling the sanctions on Western food imports, which fuel inflation; and loosening election laws to give more parties a chance, including his own, the Progressive Party.
Mr. Navalny said he thought Western sanctions on certain sectors, like banking, had had some influence on the Kremlin, while personal sanctions had been too easy to circumvent.
If the West really wanted to influence the discussion inside the government, it could quietly impose a complete travel ban on the 1,000 or so most important Russians and their families, Mr. Navalny said, many of whom own property abroad. "That would increase the split in the elite," he said. "All these guys want to drink coffee in Paris." Such measures would be popular with ordinary Russians, he added.
Although many opposition figures have fled into exile, Mr. Navalny said moving abroad has no appeal. He admitted, however, that he was no longer as naïve as when he first started about how fast change can happen.
"I still live here, my children live here and I am not going to leave," he said. "It is my country."
Correction: February 12, 2015, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Thursday about a perception by Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition activist, that Russia's recent economic troubles may have made President Vladimir V. Putin's administration vulnerable misidentified the field of law that Mr. Navalny practiced before becoming an anticorruption campaigner. He was in corporate law, not real estate law. The same error appeared in an article on April 17, 2013, about his defiance ahead of a trial on charges of embezzlement.

China Moves to Free Up Money in Its Economy

Abstract: "The People's Bank of China will continue to implement a prudent monetary policy maintained to an appropriate degree, guide monetary credit and social financing to steady moderate growth, and promote the smooth operation of economic health," the bank said in a statement announcing its decision. Easy lending policies by state-controlled banks, particularly as China sought to avoid the effects of the global financial crisis, have left a long list of industries bedeviled by severe overcapacity, falling prices and little or no profit -- and scant ability to repay bank loans.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- China signaled fresh concerns about its slowing economy as the country's central bank moved on Wednesday to stimulate growth by freeing up more money for banks to lend.
The action reflects the growing uncertainty in the global economy. Central banks around the world are grappling with how to respond to falling oil prices, low inflation, volatile currencies and tepid demand.
In recent weeks, India, Australia, Singapore, Canada and Denmark have all turned to monetary tools to address weaknesses in their economies. The European Central Bank last month unleashed a major stimulus program aimed at stoking a return to moderate inflation and rekindling growth.
China is dealing with a slowdown, as its economy last year grew 7.4 percent, its lowest rate since 1990. Real estate and heavy industry, like steel production, have been the biggest brakes on the country's growth. Real estate prices have been gradually falling since last spring, and while the pace of the decline has begun to slow, construction has lost momentum. That has contributed to a sharp drop in steel prices in China in the last several weeks. While the drop to some extent reflected the halving of iron ore prices last year, the price decline was also a warning sign of very weak demand.
Taking aim at such worries, the People's Bank of China on Wednesday reduced the share of assets that commercial banks must hold as reserves. Doing so gives institutions more leeway for lending, which is particularly beneficial to real estate and industry.
Home buyers, for example, consider the availability of mortgages and the interest rate on them before deciding whether to make a purchase. Developers have borrowed heavily as well, and need to be able to keep obtaining new loans to repay previous loans.
Steelmaking and auto manufacturing require large initial investments, typically financed with borrowed money. Plus, buyers of steel and cars frequently need bank loans for purchases.
The Chinese central bank reduced its required reserve ratio by half a percentage point. The ratio varies by financial institutions, but for big commercial banks this means a reduction to 19.5 percent, from 20 percent.
"The People's Bank of China will continue to implement a prudent monetary policy maintained to an appropriate degree, guide monetary credit and social financing to steady moderate growth, and promote the smooth operation of economic health," the bank said in a statement announcing its decision.
The central bank is stepping up an existing effort to stimulate the Chinese economy. The People's Bank of China decided in November to lower its benchmark one-year deposit rate 0.25 percentage point, to 2.75 percent, and reduce the one-year lending rate by 0.4 percentage point, to 5.6 percent.
But the policies could create other challenges for the country. An increase in lending could further drive a stock market rally that has been propelled mainly by small investors who have borrowed money to buy stocks. Regulators have already tried to reduce the risk of a bubble popping by tightening some limits on such margin trading.
The central bank's move could also fuel China's propensity for credit-driven growth.
Easy lending policies by state-controlled banks, particularly as China sought to avoid the effects of the global financial crisis, have left a long list of industries bedeviled by severe overcapacity, falling prices and little or no profit -- and scant ability to repay bank loans. Fearing that additional lending could result in even more nonperforming loans, the central bank has periodically tried to signal tighter monetary policies, only to face overwhelming pressure from other government agencies for easier credit to prevent the economy from slowing further.
Reducing the reserve ratio means that banks will be allowed to park less money at the central bank, where it earns negligible interest, and will lend it instead. The greater availability of loans is likely to push down interest rates, which in turn will make it less attractive to invest in China's currency, the renminbi.
That could result in further weakening of the renminbi, which would make Chinese goods even more competitive in foreign markets, while making imports more expensive in China. In the United States, many Democrats and some Republicans in Congress have called over the years for China to be confronted on what they describe as the deliberate undervaluation of the renminbi to help Chinese exports.
Economists at Standard Chartered predicted in a research note Wednesday evening that the renminbi would not decline immediately, because some investors would hold it in the hope that the central bank's action would help pick up the tempo of economic growth. But with the dollar strong, and the central bank limiting its intervention in those markets, the renminbi could later weaken, the economists said.
Economists at UBS pointed out in a research note Wednesday night that the central bank to some extent needed to reduce the reserve ratio to offset the investment money now flowing out of China.
An estimated $160 billion left the country in the fourth quarter alone, more than in the previous three quarters combined. Faced with slowing growth at home, wealthy Chinese have been investing more of their money offshore, particularly seeking to profit from the strengthening American economy and dollar. That has reversed the pattern of most of the last decade, when investors were trying to put more money into China.
When the money was previously flooding into China, the central bank used to issue hundreds of billions of extra renminbi annually to buy dollars. Foreign exchange reserves peaked at $3.99 trillion last June, before edging down to $3.84 trillion by December as the tide of capital began to flow in the other direction.
With the central bank no longer issuing such a torrent of renminbi, credit has tightened somewhat. The lowering of the required reserve ratio, UBS said, is needed to offset that pullback.
For mostly small banks that lend heavily to small businesses, certain water conservation projects and farmers, the central bank cut the requirement by an additional half-point. The reserve ratio was cut by an extra 4 percentage points for the Agricultural Development Bank of China, an arm of the central bank whose mission is to help rural areas.
The change is set to take effect on Thursday, allowing time for commercial banks to supply extra money to the economy before the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts two weeks later.
The days leading up to the Lunar New Year celebrations are often characterized by heavy spending on parties and gifts. The central bank commonly injects extra money into the financial system to accommodate this -- although it usually chooses less drastic measures to do so, like short-term loans to commercial banks.
"Liquidity typically tightens ahead of Chinese New Year, which may explain the timing of this decision," wrote Mark Williams, the chief Asia economist in the London office of Capital Economics, a research firm.

Abstract: The euro had been enshrined in a treaty but not yet come to life in the autumn of 1997, when Martin Feldstein, the influential president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, published an essay arguing that European leaders' hopes that a monetary union would foster greater harmony and peace in a Continent repeatedly ravaged by wars were misplaced. Needless to say, Mr. Feldstein's sobering forecast was widely derided in Europe and even treated as beyond the pale by a number of economic commentators in the United States, including the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal.

Full text:   The euro had been enshrined in a treaty but not yet come to life in the autumn of 1997, when Martin Feldstein, the influential president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, published an essay arguing that European leaders' hopes that a monetary union would foster greater harmony and peace in a Continent repeatedly ravaged by wars were misplaced.
It "would be more likely to lead to increased conflicts," wrote Mr. Feldstein, a former chief economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan.
War within Europe, "would be abhorrent but not impossible," he added. "The conflicts over economic policies and interference with national sovereignty could reinforce longstanding animosities based on history, nationality and religion."
Needless to say, Mr. Feldstein's sobering forecast was widely derided in Europe and even treated as beyond the pale by a number of economic commentators in the United States, including the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal.
It doesn't look so outrageous these days. True, not all of his observations hit the bull's-eye. He expected Europe's monetary union to proceed toward deeper unification, including a common foreign and defense policy, and even a unified military. Interestingly, he feared a more assertive Europe might go to war with Russia if it were to invade Ukraine.
In a conversation last week, he clarified that the editors of Foreign Affairs, where the essay appeared, spiced up his account. What he meant at the time was that the euro, which went into effect in 1999, could aggravate tensions between member countries -- leading to heated conflict but not to real armed war.
But despite the misses, the last five years have more than justified his conclusion: Tying together a set of disparate economies with rigid common rules that barred them from pursuing independent policies on government spending or interest rates was doomed to fail as soon as their economic fortunes diverged. No democratic political system could handle it.
To be fair, many economists -- mostly on this side of the Atlantic -- have long recognized the flaws of the euro area's monetary arrangement. But still wedded to the notion of European solidarity, euro advocates failed to grasp the crucial, irreducible obstacle to their economic plan that Mr. Feldstein highlighted: Politics are still local.
"They made the mistake of thinking that a solution had to happen at the eurozone level rather than at the country level," Professor Feldstein told me. "That anything they could do to increase the sense of European solidarity would be a good thing."
Desperate Greek voters ignited the latest panic in Europe's rolling crisis. Last week they elected a new populist government that promised to put an end to the drastic budget-cutting imposed by Europe in exchange for financial support.
But Greece is hardly the only problem. Political contagion is in the air. In Spain, "Podemos," a left-wing party born last year out of anger at Europe, has surged in the polls ahead of general elections to be held later this year. If elected, it promises to write off much of Spain's debt.
"The politics we see now are the result of an economic strategy," said Paul De Grauwe, a former member of the Belgian Parliament now at the London School of Economics. "When you push countries to impose deep austerity policies, you shouldn't be surprised that the unemployed push for extreme parties."
The economics are pretty straightforward.
The euro area suffers, principally, from a lack of growth. Indebted countries on Europe's periphery -- which include not only Greece and Spain but also countries like Italy and Ireland -- have been slashing their budgets, cutting jobs and trimming wages, hoping to lighten their burden of debt.
Germany, the biggest creditor country and main architect of the European Union's strategy, argues that such austerity is an indispensable corrective for the boom years, when low interest rates fueled spending binges -- in Greece by the government, in Ireland and Spain by the private sector.
But the traditional corrective hasn't worked: Indebted economies are shrinking faster than their debt. "The killer incriminating fact is that for all the costs and all the pain, the debt-to-G.D.P. ratios are nevertheless much higher than before the crisis," said Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard's Kennedy School. "Even if you don't care about the distress and the extremist governments, you haven't even restored financial stability."
Fixing this is not impossible. The most direct way would be for the creditors in Europe's north to relax the tight conditions on debtor countries, provide them with debt relief and allow them to spend more to kick-start growth. Alternatively, they might just invest more themselves, which would lead to higher wages and prices at home, encouraging more output in their poorer neighbors.
This path presents some political complications, however. Voters in Germany and other rich northern countries have no appetite for transfering resources to the vulnerable neighbors around Europe's edge. And, comfortably insulated by their own prosperity and conditioned by memories of hyperinflation after World War I, they still fear higher inflation. Even the direst warnings of impending doom seem unlikely to shift the public mood.
And that sets the political constraint on the other end of the field. "The right policies would defuse the political crisis in the peripheral countries at the expense of intensifying it in Germany," Mr. De Grauwe said. "It would prevent communists taking over in the south but would fuel the extreme right in the north."
The eurozone might have been built differently. Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University argues that had governments been allowed to employ countercyclical fiscal policy -- tightening budgets when the economy was expanding robustly and actively spending more when economies slowed -- much of the present crisis could have been avoided.
Germany's obsession with budget deficits prevailed, however.
That leaves the ball entirely in the court of the European Central Bank, which is institutionally sheltered from popular democracy, though certainly not unaware of the political environment.
The E.C.B. has kept the euro from collapsing over the last two years by acting as lender of last resort to its weakest members. It now hopes to stimulate growth through quantitative easing, buying up bonds to reduce long-term interest rates, much as the Federal Reserve has done in the United States.
But bond-buying, Mr. Feldstein argues, will have little impact. Long-term interest rates are already low.
Few other options fit within the political constraints.
Mr. Frankel suggests that the central bank buy United States Treasury securities, which would further devalue the euro and stimulate euro area exports. Mr. Feldstein proposes revenue-neutral tax incentives: accelerated depreciation of new investment, say, accompanied by higher corporate taxes. Governments might commit to future increases in the value-added tax tied to reductions in the income tax, to accelerate spending.
Could these ideas pull Europe from its morass? Perhaps, but the latest academic proposals seem a bit like clutching at straws. "They might not try it, or it might not work," conceded Mr. Feldstein. "If so, there may be no solution to the euro crisis."
What then? In a recent column, the Financial Times economist Martin Wolf argued that creating the eurozone was its members' second-worst idea. Letting it break up would be the worst. If the euro is to survive, voters in not just Greece and Spain but most of all those in Germany and the Netherlands must be persuaded of the necessity of compromise. Nothing we've seen so far suggests they are.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- With oil prices down more than 50 percent in the past year, the ruble having lost more than half its value, a recession looming and the country already dipping into its rainy-day funds, the Russian economy is in a race against time. But one would be hard pressed to grasp the depth of the troubles from the Kremlin's prescriptions.
Anton Siluanov, the finance minister, laid out the government's long-promised "anti-crisis" package in a live broadcast on state television last week, a laundry list of half-measures and a vague promise of a 10 percent budget cut that economists almost unanimously dismissed as inadequate.
"That plan is nonsense," the Russian oligarch Aleksandr Y. Lebedev said in an interview, describing it as throwing away money to rescue some of Russia's worst companies. "Lots of words and little specific."
President Vladimir V. Putin weighed in briefly, repeating that along with keeping tight control over government finances, "We need to change our economy's structure."
Yet a wide array of business owners, economists and former senior government officials said in interviews that they expected the Kremlin to react to the crisis the way it had in 2008, the last time it faced a precipitous decline in oil prices -- with disaster management, but no fundamental changes.
"They are trying to get by, manage it strategically and hope that oil prices rise, hope they can make a few adjustments and it will all go away," said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University who recently attended a high-level economics conference in Moscow. "There is no appetite for fundamental reform. They are just going to wait."
The sword of Damocles hanging over the economy is whether $385 billion in government reserves will run dry before oil prices rise. Mr. Rogoff, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, noted that governments habitually underestimate how fast they will go through their financial reserves when they race to bail out banks, save major state corporations and douse flames throughout an ailing economy.
Last year, for example, the Central Bank of Russia said it had shelled out more than $80 billion to shore up the value of the ruble on currency markets. "If oil prices stay low, under $70 per barrel, they are going to run out of money sooner rather than later," Mr. Rogoff said.
In 2008, oil prices quickly rebounded, as the effects of the financial crisis began to fade. But this time is likely to be different, energy experts say, and it may be quite some time before current prices of less than $50 a barrel regain the lofty $100 levels that prevailed in recent years. Russia, they say, is simply not prepared -- or perhaps is unable -- to take the measures needed to stimulate economic growth to make up for lost oil revenue.
Measures detailed in the plan or pledged earlier include more than $22 billion to shore up banks and major state companies, including roughly $8 billion from the rainy-day Russian National Wealth Fund.
The plan protected two of Mr. Putin's most important constituencies -- older Russians and the security establishment. It earmarked more than $2.7 billion to peg pensions closer to the inflation rate, which mushroomed to 11.4 percent last year and is expected to be at least as high in 2015. No cuts were announced in military spending.
The government appropriated roughly $700 million for agricultural aid. That is meant to help Russian farmers increase production, because prices soared after the Kremlin barred a host of food imports from the West in retaliation for economic sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States over the annexation of Crimea and Mr. Putin's actions in eastern Ukraine. Food prices over all climbed more than 15 percent last year, with some staples like sugar up 40 percent.
Even members of Parliament complained last week that a bowl of porridge in their cafeteria had jumped to 53 rubles, from 20 last year.
Russia's economy is expected to contract at least 4 percent in 2015. While the government holds very little foreign debt, private companies, including some at the very core of the state-dominated economy, have more than $100 billion in loans coming due this year. Most of that is owed to Western banks and will be hard to refinance because of economic sanctions.
The Kremlin's response combines confidence that oil prices will rebound soon with official bravado that Russians will endure any hardship, including eating less, for the motherland.
The first part of the anti-crisis plan is also aimed at supporting strategic targets like exports and high-tech manufacturing. But no specific steps were included.
"You never hear the details of what structural change means," said Konstantin V. Remchukov, the editor in chief of Nezavisimaya Gazeta and an economics professor. It is not discussed "at any level," he added.
Fighting between the conservative, nationalistic security establishment surrounding Mr. Putin and his liberal economic advisers has raged for years. Mr. Putin's choices, ranging from a huge investment in modernizing the armed forces to military adventures in Ukraine, have gradually solidified the position of the security establishment to the detriment of the economists.
Moreover, Mr. Putin came to power after the chaotic 1990s promising to restore order at home and to re-establish Russia's status as a world power. Easing his singular grip on the country's political and economic levers or pulling back in Ukraine would threaten the foundations of his presidency and his personal popularity.
Mr. Putin and his closest advisers, particularly those like him who are former agents of the K.G.B., remain wary of the consequences of too much economic freedom, many experts said.
"He is afraid to let it go," said Igor Yurgens, the chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Development, a liberal-leaning research organization. "You have to give much more freedom to those who will implement the changes."
Serious questions about whether the Kremlin has a crisis plan have circulated for weeks.
Recently, at the Gaidar Forum, the country's premier annual economic conference, three top officials painted rather different portraits of the economy.
Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev called the reliance on raw material exports "a thing of the past," without saying what exactly would replace them.
Alexei Ulyukayev, the minister of economic development, said Russia had plenty of money to ride out the hard times until economic growth resumed in a year or two. ("He's a Buddhist!" quipped Mr. Lebedev, noting that the private sector was markedly less calm.)
Only Mr. Siluanov, the finance minister, expressed concern, saying: "In the Ministry of Finance we have no peace of mind. It's only tension."
The lack of a unified message aggravated the sense that there was little economic coordination at the highest levels of government. "Today, even nonspecialists see that the authorities don't act as one team," Mikhail D. Prokhorov, one of Russia's richest men, wrote on Thursday in the daily business newspaper Kommersant.
"Mr. Putin believes that in six months oil prices will come up; this is his deep conviction," Mr. Remchukov, the newspaper editor, said. "If we don't fall apart, we will be in chocolate in two years," using a Russian expression roughly equivalent to "in a bed of roses."
Russia's oligarchs avoid criticizing Mr. Putin publicly or privately, since maintaining their vast fortunes depends on his favorable opinion. Asked at the annual meeting last month of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, whether he had shared his bleak economic outlook with the Kremlin, Oleg V. Deripaska, the chairman of the aluminum giant United Company Rusal, said he had been too busy.
Mr. Prokhorov, who has taken a lower political profile recently, pleaded in Kommersant for a "new strategy" to emerge from the crisis.
Mr. Lebedev, accepting that structural changes needed more time, proposed immediate measures to stimulate economic growth, including deregulating the timber industry, subsidizing agricultural loans at a much lower rate (he is an investor in one of Europe's largest potato producers), and aiding the construction industry by releasing public land.
But Mr. Lebedev mused aloud about how to transmit his ideas to Mr. Putin, and groused that regional governments, like the Kremlin, tended to kill proposals that meant surrendering control over state assets.
For now, there is no actual panic in the Kremlin, analysts said.
"It is a big machine, which still has money, which still sells a lot of oil and gas, which still receives a lot of revenue," Mr. Yurgens said, noting that Russians had endured much rougher economic periods in recent memory, including long lines for food in the last decade of the Soviet Union.
"It's tolerable," he continued. "There is vodka, there are groceries on the table, there are pickled cucumbers. We will manage."

Abstract: Moving up just a few notches to 19th -- so that the average American score matched the O.E.C.D. average -- would add 1.7 percent to the nation's gross domestic product over the next 35 years, according to estimates by the Washington Center, a nonpartisan, liberal-leaning research group focused on narrowing inequality.

Full text:   Study after study has shown a yawning educational achievement gap between the poorest and wealthiest children in America. But what does this gap costs in terms of lost economic growth and tax revenue?
That's what researchers at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth set out to discover in a new study that concluded the United States could ultimately enrich everybody by improving educational performance for the typical student.
When it comes to math and science scores, the United States lags most of the other 33 advanced industrialized countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, ranking 24th, far behind Korea, Poland and Slovenia.
Moving up just a few notches to 19th -- so that the average American score matched the O.E.C.D. average -- would add 1.7 percent to the nation's gross domestic product over the next 35 years, according to estimates by the Washington Center, a nonpartisan, liberal-leaning research group focused on narrowing inequality. That could lead to roughly $900 billion in higher government revenue, more than making up for the cost of such an effort.
If Americans were able to match the scores reached in Canada, which ranks seventh on the O.E.C.D. scale, the United States' gross domestic product would rise by an additional 6.7 percent, a cumulative increase of $10 trillion (after taking inflation into account) by the year 2050, the report estimated.
Robert G. Lynch, an economist who wrote the Washington Center report, explained why he took the trouble to make these what-if calculations.
"One of the main goals was to see how we could promote more widely shared and faster economic growth," he said. In the three decades that followed the end of World War II, almost all Americans, no matter where they fell on the earnings scale, enjoyed at least a doubling of their real incomes.
But that balanced growth has evaporated. While those at the top have continued to experience robust income increases, everyone else's income has either stalled or dropped. The average income of the bottom 20 percent of households sank by more than 8 percent from 1973 to 2103, while the inflation-adjusted incomes of the top 20 percent grew by about 60 percent, according to the report. The top 5 percent enjoyed an 80 percent jump.
One point of this exercise, Mr. Lynch explained, is to show that the added cost of improving educational achievement at the bottom would be more than made up for by the rise in economic output and tax revenue.
The study used math and science scores from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, a test widely used around the world for measuring and comparing educational achievement. The average combined score for the United States is 978, while the O.E.C.D. average is 995. The Canadian average is 1,044.
Eliminating the achievement gap in America would require raising the country's average to 1,080, so that it would rank third behind South Korea (with an average score of 1,092) and Japan (with a 1,083 average). That stunning improvement, according to the center, would raise the total output in the United States by another 10 percent. Lifetime earnings of the poorest quarter would jump by 22 percent in this event.
The income gap is an outgrowth, at least in part, of the education gap. An analysis by the O.E.C.D. released last fall showed that the United States greatly lagged nearly every advanced industrial nation on measures of educational equality. Only one in 20 Americans age 25 to 34 surpassed the educational level of their parents, for example. For the 20 richest member nations, that average was one in four.
The report includes the types of changes, which include expanding early childhood education, reducing exposure to lead paint and starting school later so teenagers can get more sleep, that the center views as necessary to raise achievement scores, though it does not include specific costs in its calculations.
The report also notes how widely achievement scores vary within the United States, not only from state to state but county to county. Montgomery County, a generally affluent suburban area in Maryland just outside of Washington, for example, was able to reduce the gap and increase scores after instituting all-day kindergarten programs, reducing class size, investing in teacher development and reducing housing-based segregation in its schools.

Full text:   The data necessary to assess the economy's performance last year and help project its path for this year is now coming in. One point stands out from all the rest: For all the talk about accelerating growth, the economy grew last year at a rate of 2.4 percent, basically in line with growth over the past several years.
That moderate pace is not inherently unsatisfactory. The problem is that modest growth has never been enough to overcome the damage of the Great Recession and, from there, to reach new levels in terms of output, employment and wages.
Set against those benchmarks, progress remains painfully slow, while headwinds that a stronger economy could withstand become setbacks. Recently, for example, corporate earnings and growth more broadly have been hit by the stronger dollar and global weakness, which reduce foreign demand for American products and, in the process, threaten domestic investment and hiring. Gone are the days when the American economy was the engine pulling weaker economies along.
The slow pace of progress is also on display in the job market. Even with recent job gains, estimates of the time it will take for the job market to return to full health range from more than a year to more than two years, assuming no economic backsliding in the meantime.
And even then, more jobs will not necessarily mean higher wages. The latest government report on employers' labor costs showed that nearly six years into the current economic recovery, wage growth, adjusted for inflation, remained tepid. If wages were tracking productivity growth, as would be expected in a healthy economy, they would be rising at a far stronger pace.
Of course, lower oil prices and lower overall inflation increase purchasing power, which explains the recent upsurges in consumer sentiment and consumer spending. That increase, however, is akin to a temporary tax cut. The extent to which it will lead to sustained stronger growth, if any, remains to be seen. For now, recent bolstered spending probably reflects consumers taking advantage of lower prices at the pump to indulge pent-up demand after years of belt tightening. To support elevated consumption on an ongoing basis, the savings rate, still low by historical standards, would have to fall lower still, an unlikely occurrence so soon after a debt binge.
The economy, in short, is still wounded, and the route to recovery runs through government. Direct policies could raise wages in the near term, including the minimum wage. Policies can also change norms that keep wages depressed. Currently, for example, corporate executives are fighting to delay a new rule under the Dodd-Frank law to require companies to disclose the ratio of a chief executive's pay to the median pay of the company's employees. The information could expose indefensible disparities and lead to higher employee pay. Still other policies could set the stage for healthy growth in the longer term, including immigration reform, infrastructure spending and education initiatives.
All such policies, however, require bipartisan congressional action or forceful regulation, which are in short supply. On its own, the Obama administration has advanced helpful policies to make home buying more affordable. It also will soon issue regulations to increase worker eligibility for overtime pay, which has been badly eroded over decades of congressional neglect of labor standards.
The Federal Reserve, for its part, has said it will put off interest rate increases until clearer signs of growth emerge. That is wise, though it is increasingly clear that the Fed's efforts to revive the economy can, at best, maintain the economy at its current pace, not speed it up. That is not an argument to end those policies. It is a reminder that the members of Congress, and particularly the Republican majority, could do much more to help if they only would act to advance the broad interests of the public rather than the narrow interests of their party.

Full text:   Powered by healthy spending from increasingly optimistic consumers, the American economy is emerging as an island of relative strength in the face of renewed torpor and turmoil elsewhere in much of the world.
Just hours after Russia unexpectedly cut interest rates on Friday in response to a shrinking economy and worries over its banks, and European officials reported more signs of weakness on the Continent, new government data showed the American economy grew at a decent 2.6 percent rate in the final quarter of 2014.
That pace represents a downshift from the blistering 5 percent growth rate recorded in the third quarter and was modestly below what economists had been expecting. Nonetheless, most economists viewed the report in a positive light and saw the robust consumer spending as pointing to an improving economy in 2015.
The combination of plunging energy prices and a healthier job market in late 2014 helped consumer spending rise last quarter by 4.3 percent, the fastest rate of growth since early 2006. And in a separate report on Friday, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment in January rose to its highest level since January 2004.
"The windfall to consumption from lower energy prices is showing up," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. "And we all know that over the long term, where the consumer goes, the economy goes."
Not everything was rosy, though. While consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of economic output in the United States, there were weaknesses elsewhere that could drag on growth in the months ahead and which are likely to foster continuing turmoil in markets for stocks, bonds and currencies.
The country's trade balance deteriorated, shaving a full percentage point off the overall growth rate, as export gains slowed sharply from earlier in the year, while imports surged.
Although any single quarter represents a snapshot of the economy, rather than a nuanced portrait, experts suggested the falloff in net exports reflected a stronger dollar, which makes imported goods more competitive domestically while increasing the price of American products abroad. It also reflected weakness in Europe and other overseas markets, which are becoming tougher for American companies.
"Although cheaper imports are a boon for shoppers, import growth will subtract significantly from growth in G.D.P. in 2015 and 2016," said Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS. He expects the economy to expand at a rate of 3.1 percent in 2015, as lower energy prices encourage shoppers to keep spending, overwhelming other headwinds.
Friday's estimate by the Commerce Department of economic output last quarter is the first of three the government will make; as more data is reported, upward or downward revisions are possible. One clue will come next week, when trade figures for December are released.
For all of 2014, the economy grew at a rate of 2.4 percent, roughly in line with the underlying trend of the last five years.
One notable negative in late 2014 was a 1.9 percent fall in spending on new equipment by companies, reversing increases of more than 11 percent in the previous two quarters. Many economists expect business spending to be lackluster in the coming months, hurt by deep cuts among drillers and other energy companies because of plunging oil prices.
Military spending, which tends to be volatile, plunged last quarter and was another major drag on the overall trend, subtracting about 0.4 percentage point from the growth rate.
"The composition was what we thought: strong private consumption, modest growth in investment and drags from trade and government spending," Mr. Gapen added. "But I think the government spending drag is a one-off and there is tangible evidence that the consumer is in a much better place than in previous years."
Looking ahead, many economists expect 2015 to start off at about the pace of last quarter's trend, with growth picking up over the course of the year.
Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, is looking for the economy to grow by about 2.7 percent in 2015. As was the case last quarter, he expects consumers to more than make up for whatever softness there is in spending by companies.
In a separate but closely watched announcement also released Friday morning, the Labor Department reported that its employment cost index rose 0.6 percent in December, slightly better than the figures for hourly wages and about what was expected.
This quarterly survey of compensation costs is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, as well as many private economists, to gauge overall wage growth for American workers.
This week, the Fed signaled it would not raise short-term interest rates before June, at the earliest. Although Fed policy makers have been encouraged by stronger hiring, they remain concerned about very weak inflation along with paltry wage gains.
The 0.6 percent rise in compensation costs was healthy, Mr. Berger said, but not big enough to persuade Fed policy makers to move up their expected rate increase, which he predicts will come in September.
By contrast, the outlook in Europe seems to be getting grimmer.
In Western Europe, officials said on Friday that prices in the eurozone fell for the second month in a row in January, underscoring weak demand there and highlighting the challenges facing the European Central Bank in getting inflation closer to its annual target of 2 percent, which would help encourage more spending by business and consumers.
In Moscow, the Central Bank of Russia abruptly cut interest rates by two percentage points to 15 percent, in an effort to ease the strain on the country's financial system but risking a further fall in the ruble. Russia, a major energy producer, is also reeling from falling crude prices as well as sanctions imposed as a result of the crisis in Ukraine.
"We're leading the pack here in terms of economic growth," Mr. Handler, crediting the Fed's aggressive efforts in recent years to stimulate the economy, which the E.C.B. has only very recently begun to emulate after years of more timid steps. "We didn't do the navel gazing we had in Europe."

Abstract: Another beneficiary will be exporters in Germany and elsewhere in the eurozone, whose goods have become more attractively priced around the world because of a decline in the value of the euro prompted by central bank policy. Nobody forecast, for example, that imminent quantitative easing by the European Central Bank and the plunging euro would prompt the Swiss National Bank to abandon efforts to hold down the value of the franc, with grave repercussions for homeowners in Poland who hold mortgages in francs.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- As central banks have injected cash into their nations' economies, a question has raged over whether they have helped average people or simply made the rich even richer.
The question, part of a larger debate over the causes of economic inequality around the world, rises anew now that the European Central Bank plans to start a similar program in the eurozone. The purpose will be defeated, though, if the policy only widens the eurozone's gulfs.
So-called quantitative easing, announced last week by the European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, carries a risk of helping only a privileged few, like those whose stocks have been rising in recent days. If it works as intended, though, it should benefit the eurozone's 18.4 million jobless people after the bank switches on the money pumps in March.
The question of who benefits is particularly pertinent at a time when European solidarity is under severe strain. Greeks have just elected a prime minister who wants to cast off the fiscal shackles imposed by fellow eurozone members.
Germans are grumpy that the European Central Bank chose to adopt quantitative easing over their objections. Populist parties from Helsinki to Madrid are feeding on the resentments generated by seven years of economic crisis.
Official economic data due Friday is expected to underscore the region's problems. Unemployment in the eurozone will remain stuck at 11.5 percent, according to analyst estimates. Inflation is forecast to fall to minus 0.5 percent, reinforcing fears that the region is being pulled into a downward price spiral -- deflation -- that would discourage hiring and growth.
There is little doubt that some people, countries and industries will cash in more than others. The winners include commercial banks that hold a lot of government bonds and will be able to sell them for higher prices.
Another beneficiary will be exporters in Germany and elsewhere in the eurozone, whose goods have become more attractively priced around the world because of a decline in the value of the euro prompted by central bank policy. Investors have been selling euros because they can find better interest rates elsewhere.
And people who own eurozone stocks are already reaping the rewards, as market indexes have soared since Mr. Draghi's announcement.
The losers could include insurance companies, which will have even more trouble earning a low-risk return on the money they keep on hand to pay policyholders. And people who keep their savings in the bank -- as many Europeans do -- will see few gains as Mr. Draghi and company keep interest rates at low or even negative levels.
And then there are unpredictable chain reactions that quantitative easing could set off.
Nobody forecast, for example, that imminent quantitative easing by the European Central Bank and the plunging euro would prompt the Swiss National Bank to abandon efforts to hold down the value of the franc, with grave repercussions for homeowners in Poland who hold mortgages in francs.
Another European country that is not in the eurozone and is scrambling to respond to the euro's plunge is Denmark, whose central bank on Thursday edged interest rates further into negative territory, for the second time in 10 days, trying to keep the krone from rising.
But proponents of Mr. Draghi's quantitative easing argue that, whatever the potential downside, the most important thing is to do something to prevent an even more severe economic crisis that would hit poor people the hardest.
For Mr. Draghi the only objective -- officially, at least -- is to push inflation back up toward the central bank's target of just below 2 percent. Inflation that is too low -- or worse, outright deflation -- undercuts corporate profits, forces down wages and leads to higher unemployment.
The stimulus of pumping money into the economy is supposed to automatically raise inflation, although the strategy has not worked in the United States very well because the stronger dollar has lowered the price of oil and other imported goods.
The only relevant criterion "is the mandate of the E.C.B. to achieve an inflation target of close to 2 percent," said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.
Germany, for all its criticism of quantitative easing, stands to be one of the big beneficiaries. But not all Germans will share in the bonanza.
For example, the German benchmark DAX index has hit highs since Mr. Draghi's announcement. Analysts at DZ Bank in Frankfurt forecast that the index would climb even higher.
That is great for Germans who own shares or stock mutual funds. But only about 14 percent do. That is in stark contrast to the United States, where about half of all families own stocks directly or indirectly and have profited from the market-stoking effects of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing.
Germany might also be benefiting disproportionately from the recent decline of the euro against the dollar. If Germany were not part of the eurozone, its currency would probably be doing what the Swiss franc is doing -- rising to its highest levels since 2011, as investors look for a haven from global uncertainty. The strong franc is already creating problems for Switzerland's tourism industry, as well as its watchmakers and other exporters.
But German companies are not the only ones that could enjoy a quantitative easing bonus. Italian and French exporters will benefit even more from a weak euro than German companies, Mr. Wolff of Bruegel said, because they are more likely to sell consumer goods like fashion or food products whose price tags are an important competitive factor. German companies tend to sell products like machine tools, where reliability and precision are more important than price.
Commercial banks around the eurozone are other possible beneficiaries of the new Draghi policy. The central bank plans to spend 60 billion euros a month, or about $68 billion, in the bond market, which will push down yields, the market interest rates on debt. When yields fall, the value of a bond with a fixed interest rate goes up. Higher bond prices should especially help banks in Italy and some other countries that have large holdings of their own country's debt.
If bankers feel better about their financial health, they may be more willing to lend to small and midsize businesses, which will in turn create jobs. Economists suspect that is exactly what the central bank is hoping for.
"A big part of this is just cleaning the bank balance sheets after the sovereign debt crisis," said Viral V. Acharya, professor of finance at Stern School of Business at New York University.
But Mr. Acharya said central bank bond buying was an inefficient way to fix eurozone banks. At the rate that the European Central Bank plans to buy bonds, he said, it will take months for banks to unload their holdings.
"Banks are the ones that will have to transmit this policy," Mr. Acharya said. "I'm not optimistic this will happen very fast."
Overly indebted homeowners in Spain and Ireland have reason to raise a toast to quantitative easing, to the extent banks do become more willing to lend. They should be able to refinance their homes at even lower interest rates and make smaller monthly payments.
But that benefit will be smaller in Germany, where most people rent their homes and debt levels are low. And besides being renters, Germans are also savers who will earn even more dismal interest rates.
As for the most vulnerable people in the eurozone -- the unemployed and the working poor -- there is no certainty that any benefits from monetary stimulus will reach them.
The big hope seems to be that the program will improve the mood among businesses, which will be inspired to hire.
"It could have some good implications in terms of the business mind-set," said Jean-Philippe Courtois, president of Microsoft International.
But because the rewards of euro-style quantitative easing are so uncertain, some economists propose a more radical solution to ensure that all citizens get their share.
John Muellbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at Oxford University, for instance, has called on the European Central Bank to print money and simply give [euro]500 to every person in the eurozone.
That idea does not sit well with central bankers, though. "It would be very complicated to do that," Benoît Coeuré, a member of the European Central Bank executive board, told the broadcaster Europe 1 on Monday.
"If there are things to be done that target citizens directly, it is up to governments to do it," Mr. Coeuré said. "That is not our work."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Oil Cash Waning, Venezuelan Shelves Lie Bare

Abstract: Some states have barred people from waiting outside stores overnight, and government officials are posted near entrances, ready to arrest shoppers who cheat the rationing system. Because Venezuela is so dependent on oil sales to buy imports of food, medicine and many other basics, the drop in oil prices means that there is even less hard currency to buy what the country needs. "If things are so bad now, I really cannot imagine how they will be in February or March" when some of the lowest oil prices "materialize in terms of cash flow," said Francisco J. Monaldi, a professor of energy policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- Mary Noriega heard there would be chicken.
She hated being herded "like cattle," she said, standing for hours in a line of more than 1,500 people hoping to buy food, as soldiers with side arms checked identification cards to make sure no one tried to buy basic items more than once or twice a week.
But Ms. Noriega, a laboratory assistant with three children, said she had no choice, ticking off the inventory in her depleted refrigerator: coffee and corn flour. Things had gotten so bad, she said, that she had begun bartering with neighbors to put food on the table.
"We always knew that this year would start badly, but I think this is super bad," Ms. Noriega said.
Venezuelans have put up with shortages and long lines for years. But as the price of oil, the country's main export, has plunged, the situation has grown so dire that the government has sent troops to patrol huge lines snaking for blocks. Some states have barred people from waiting outside stores overnight, and government officials are posted near entrances, ready to arrest shoppers who cheat the rationing system.
Because Venezuela is so dependent on oil sales to buy imports of food, medicine and many other basics, the drop in oil prices means that there is even less hard currency to buy what the country needs.
Even before oil prices tumbled, Venezuela was in the throes of a deep recession, with one of the world's highest inflation rates and chronic shortages of basic items.
One of the nation's most prestigious public hospitals shut down its heart surgery unit for weeks because of shortages of medical supplies. Some drugs have been out of stock for months, and at least one clinic performed heart operations only by smuggling in a vital drug from the United States. Diapers are so coveted that some shoppers carry the birth certificates of their children in case stores demand them.
Now economists predict that shortages will get even more acute and inflation, already 64 percent, will climb further. The price of Venezuelan oil dropped this month to $38 a barrel, down from $96 in September.
"Things are going to be even worse because oil keeps Venezuela going," said Luis Castro, 42, a nurse, standing in line with hundreds of others at a grocery store. He had arrived with his wife and 6-year-old son at 6 a.m., but by 11:30 a.m., they had still not entered. "We're getting used to standing on line," he said, "and when you get used to something, they give you only crumbs."
The shortages and inflation present another round of political challenges for President Nicolás Maduro, who has vowed to continue the Socialist-inspired revolution begun by his predecessor, the charismatic leftist Hugo Chávez.
"I've always been a Chavista," said Ms. Noriega, using a term for a loyal Chávez supporter. But "the other day, I found a Chávez T-shirt I'd kept, and I threw it on the ground and stamped on it, and then I used it to clean the floor. I was so angry. I don't know if this is his fault or not, but he died and left us here, and things have been going from bad to worse."
Venezuela has the world's largest estimated petroleum reserves, and when oil prices were high, oil exports made up more than 95 percent of its hard currency income. Mr. Chávez used the oil riches to fund social spending, like increased pensions and subsidized grocery stores. Now that income has been slashed.
"If things are so bad now, I really cannot imagine how they will be in February or March" when some of the lowest oil prices "materialize in terms of cash flow," said Francisco J. Monaldi, a professor of energy policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.
Mr. Maduro spent 14 straight days in January traveling the globe in an effort to court investment and persuade other oil-producing nations to cut production and push the price back up.
"We have serious economic difficulties regarding the country's revenue," Mr. Maduro said to the legislature during his annual address, which had to be pushed back because of the trip. "But God will always be with us. God will provide. And we will get, and we have gotten, the resources to maintain the country's rhythm."
After months of toying with the politically taboo idea of raising the price of gasoline sold at pumps here, the cheapest in the world, he said that the time had finally come to do so.
And he reiterated his position that the country's economic ills are the fault of an economic war being waged against his government by right-wing enemies.
Many economists argue that government policies are a big part of the problem, including a highly overvalued currency, price controls that dissuade manufacturers and farmers, and government restrictions on access to dollars that have led to a steep drop in imports.
Some investors fear Venezuela will default on billions of dollars in bonds, but Mr. Maduro has said the country will pay its debts.
Typically, in an election year like this one, when voters will choose a new legislature, the government showers supporters with goods, like refrigerators and washing machines, or other benefits, like free housing. But now there may not be enough foreign currency to import appliances and construction materials.
In interviews, shoppers did not say they were going hungry. Rather, many said the economic crisis meant eating canned sardines instead of chicken, or boiled food instead of fried because vegetable oil is so hard to get. Many said they ate meat less frequently because it is out of stock or too expensive. Fresh fish can be harder to find, in part, fishermen said, because they find it more profitable to use their boats to sell subsidized Venezuelan diesel on the black market in a high-seas rendezvous instead of hauling in a catch.
But social media in Venezuela is full of urgent pleas from patients trying to find prescription medicine.
Dr. Gastón Silva, the head of cardiovascular surgery at the University Hospital of Caracas, said that because of medical shortages, only about 100 heart operations were performed there last year, down from 300 or more in previous years.
Some patients who had been hospitalized awaiting surgery for a month or more were sent home in November because there were not enough supplies, and the operating rooms remained shut for more than eight weeks, Dr. Silva said, despite a list of hundreds of people awaiting heart operations.
He said the shortages stemmed from the government's foreign exchange controls, which have kept medical importers from getting access to the money they need to make purchases abroad. Now with the low price of oil further restricting the government's supply of hard currency, he worried the crisis would get worse.
"We are getting to a breaking point," Dr. Silva said. "If one thing is lacking, O.K. If there are no automobile parts, we'll see. Food, that's problematic. But health care, that's more problematic. Where will it end?"
Mr. Silva said that a private clinic where he also works had sharply scaled back heart surgeries in the last four months of 2014 because of limited supplies.
A heart surgeon at another private clinic said that a colleague had smuggled an essential drug from the United States to keep the operating room functioning.
Ana Guanipa, 75, a retired government office worker, said that she had searched numerous pharmacies for her hypertension medicine.
"I've been looking all month, and I can't find it," she said, adding that a neighbor who takes the same drug gave her some. "I take it one day on and one day off so that it will last longer."
On a recent morning, hundreds of people stood in line outside a big-box store, similar to Costco. Inside, many shelves were stripped clean. The large appliance and electronics section was empty. One aisle displayed hundreds of boxes of a single brand of toothpaste. There was no fresh meat; a cooler was filled with frozen pigs feet.
Most people came to buy only three items sold at government-mandated prices: laundry detergent, vegetable oil and corn flour.
Every purchase was entered into a database, ensuring that shoppers did not try to buy the same regulated staples at the chain for at least seven days.
Soldiers patrolled the line outside, police officers were stationed inside and government officials checked identification cards, looking for fake ones that could be used to cheat the rationing system -- or for immigrants with expired visas. An official from the immigration and identification service said that offenders would be arrested.
"This is pathetic," said Yenerly Niño, 18, adding that she had waited more than five hours to buy the three subsidized products because she could not afford to buy them at the higher prices charged by street vendors.
"You do what you have to," she said. "If you don't do it, you don't eat."

Abstract: Recent research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate overstates the recovery of the labor market because some people who have stopped looking for work are likely to return as the recovery gains strength. [...]those who continue to look for work are disproportionately older and better educated, groups with historically lower rates of unemployment, suggesting that the Fed may be able to push the overall unemployment rate below 5 percent without unleashing significantly higher inflation.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve kept its options open on Wednesday, signaling that it would not raise short-term interest rates any earlier than June, while leaving unresolved how much longer it might be willing to wait before lifting its benchmark rate from near zero, where the central bank has held it for more than six years.
Treating the recent turmoil in markets as essentially meaningless noise, the Fed issued its most upbeat assessment of economic conditions since the recession, after its first policy-making meeting of the year, in a statement that noted solid economic growth and strong job growth.
But the optimistic tone was tempered by the Fed's acknowledgment that inflation has slowed markedly in recent months and is likely to slow even more, making it harder for the Fed to determine how quickly to retreat from its stimulus campaign.
Fed officials for more than a year have pointed to the summer of 2015 as the likely time for the central bank to increase its benchmark interest rate, but investors are increasingly convinced that the sluggish pace of inflation will force the Fed to wait until fall at the earliest.
The Fed, for now, is basically watching economic developments to see what happens.
"They don't want to exclude June from the range of options at this point," said Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon who follows the Fed closely. "June is still five months off, and they have no intention of deciding just yet."
The Fed has tried for years to spur faster job growth, and it seems to be working. Average monthly job gains have increased in each of the last five years, reaching 246,000 a month last year. The unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in December, closing in on its prerecession level of around 5 percent.
The economic expansion is gaining strength as confident consumers spend more, heartened by the rise in employment and the fall in oil prices.
The weakness of the global economy received only a passing mention, in a sentence noting that the Fed would pay attention to "international developments." Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, said Fed officials seemed relatively sanguine about the problems of other developed nations.
"Altogether, we believe the Fed sees the combination of central bank actions and lower oil prices as outweighing the negative effects on growth and inflation from a stronger dollar," Mr. Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.
But the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose 0.8 percent in 2014, the slowest pace during a time of economic growth in half a century.
The Fed's stated goal is to keep prices rising at an annual rate of about 2 percent, part of its effort to support economic growth and grease the wheels of commerce. But it has not hit that target in more than two years, and it is increasingly unlikely to achieve it this year.
The rapid fall of oil prices is largely responsible for the decline, and the statement reiterated the view of most Fed officials that inflation will rebound "as the labor market improves further and the transitory effect of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate."
The short-term fluctuations, however, make it harder for the Fed to determine how much of the recent decline in inflation might reflect more enduring economic weakness.
Wage growth remains weak as companies continue to find an abundant supply of potential employees. Recent research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate overstates the recovery of the labor market because some people who have stopped looking for work are likely to return as the recovery gains strength. Moreover, those who continue to look for work are disproportionately older and better educated, groups with historically lower rates of unemployment, suggesting that the Fed may be able to push the overall unemployment rate below 5 percent without unleashing significantly higher inflation.
Mr. Duy predicted that wage growth would play a critical role in determining the Fed's timing. Average hourly earnings rose only 1.7 percent in 2014, reflecting an abundance of job seekers. Moreover, until wages rise more quickly, higher inflation most likely would not endure because it would erode real wages, reducing demand.
"They really need to see some wage growth in order for them to move in June," Mr. Duy said. "Unless you have enough pressure on labor markets to generate higher wages, it's tough to see how you get to sustainably higher inflation."
The statement was passed by a unanimous vote, a contrast with the three dissents at the previous meeting in December of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making body, which also met on Wednesday. The change, however, does not necessarily reflect greater internal harmony. Instead, the three regional reserve bank presidents who dissented in December rotated out of voting seats on the committee and were replaced by three members of the majority.
The statement, as expected, said for the second consecutive meeting that the Fed "judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy." Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said after the Fed's December meeting that the language indicated that the Fed would wait at least two meetings before raising rates. Its inclusion in the latest statement means the Fed does not intend to act at its meetings in March or April.
That puts the focus on the Fed's meeting in June.
Fed officials have long pointed to that June meeting as the most likely date for a first rate increase, and some analysts continue to regard that as a good bet.
"The statement leaves the door open to the first hike in June, if the labor data continue on their current path," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "We are surprised markets seem more interested in the acknowledgment of the (obvious) near-term downside inflation risks."
But investors are increasingly skeptical. Measures derived from asset prices suggest that investors do not expect a first rate increase until autumn. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell 10 basis points on Wednesday.
David Mericle, an economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote last week that the Fed "would find it hard to justify" a rate increase while inflation continued to decelerate.
Goldman still predicts that the Fed will raise rates this year. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, predicted on Monday that the Fed would not raise rates until 2016.
"We believe the F.O.M.C. would risk entrenching inflation expectations at levels inconsistent with its 2 percent goal if it were to push forward with rate hikes as early as June," Morgan's economic forecasters wrote in a research note.
Some Fed officials have cautioned that the difference between June and September may matter to investors, but it does not have much economic significance.
"After six years of recovery and considering all that has both transpired and been accomplished, I don't think we policy makers should get too rigid about liftoff a little earlier or later," Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a speech this month.
Mr. Lockhart and other officials have also sought to emphasize that the first rate increase will not end the Fed's stimulus campaign because the Fed is likely to keep rates at unusually low levels for years to come.

Full text:   In late December, as they do every few months, American military officials in Kabul sent a trove of data to the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction for its quarterly report. Over the years, such figures have told an often dispiriting story about Washington's enormous investment in the country's security forces, laying out their size, readiness, attrition level and the state of their infrastructure.
Five days later, military officials followed up with an unusual request. Commanders in Afghanistan informed the inspector general's office that they had decided to classify the bulk of that data. The decision came after the military, late last year, classified a periodic report that the inspector general has used over the years as the primary source to assess the state of Afghan forces. The stated reason? It could give the enemy the upper hand.
"With lives literally on the line, I am sure that you can join me in recognizing that we must be careful to avoid providing sensitive information to those that threaten our forces and Afghan forces, particularly information that can be used by such opposing forces to sharpen their attacks," Gen. John Campbell, the American commander in Afghanistan, wrote to the inspector general, John Sopko, on Jan. 18.
The threats that Afghan and American troops face in Afghanistan remain all too real. But it strains credulity to believe that insurgents would become more proficient fighters by poring over lengthy inspector general reports about an increasingly forgotten war. Classifying that information unreasonably prevents American taxpayers from drawing informed conclusions about the returns on a $107.5 billion reconstruction investment that, adjusted for inflation, has surpassed the price tag of the Marshall Plan.
Mr. Sopko, a former prosecutor who takes great pleasure in needling bureaucrats, has at times gone overboard in his protests over the state of reconstruction projects. On this issue, however, he's rightfully outraged.
"The decision leaves SIGAR for the first time in six years unable to publicly report on most of the U.S. taxpayer-funded efforts to build, train, equip and sustain" Afghan forces, the agency wrote, using its acronym, in its latest quarterly report, which was issued Thursday. Mr. Sopko last year had protested the decision to restrict dissemination of a more limited set of data that would have otherwise been included in the October report. He said there was no evidence that aggregate nationwide data on Afghan military capabilities could give militants an edge.
"Its inexplicable classification now and its disappearance from public view does a disservice to the interest of informed national discussion," Mr. Sopko wrote in the October report.
Under the new classification guidelines, the military is not publicly reporting how many Afghan policemen and soldiers are employed, how much Washington is spending on their salaries, the state of corruption in Afghan ministries or the results of an effort to recruit more women in the army. Washington's war in Afghanistan nominally ended at the turn of the year, when a campaign called Operation Enduring Freedom folded and a new mission, called Operation Freedom's Sentinel, began. While it's tempting to think that Americans troops and taxpayer dollars are no longer at war in Afghanistan, they very much are. More than 10,000 American troops are there training and supporting the Afghans.
The Obama administration has pledged to continue spending billions to keep the Afghan government afloat for years. Americans are entitled to the unvarnished truth about that daunting effort.

Full text:   SINGAPORE -- Singapore's central bank eased its monetary policy on Wednesday, becoming the latest central bank using policy to help shore up growth against a backdrop of global economic turbulence.
In a surprise move, the bank said it would take measures to slow the appreciation of the Singapore dollar. The news from the Monetary Authority of Singapore comes as central banks around the world have taken action in recent weeks to ease policies amid steep falls in the price of oil and broader economic uncertainty.
Singapore's central bank said it would slow the pace of appreciation of the dollar within a targeted band, citing recent developments in both global and domestic environments. The currency of Singapore, a city-state, is set against a basket of currencies within an undisclosed range. Adjusting its currency is one of the government's main policy tools.
The currency dropped 1.4 percent to 1.35 Singapore dollars against the United States dollar on Wednesday, its lowest level in more than four years.
Several governments have shocked global markets recently with a series of policy changes. Central banks in Denmark, Canada and India unexpectedly cut rates this month, and Switzerland removed a cap on its currency, the franc. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, announced that it would begin a program to buy government bonds in an attempt to pump money into the eurozone.
Central banks in China and South Korea also cut borrowing costs last year.
These policy actions may have helped prompt Singapore's central bank to take action, analysts at the bank HSBC said Wednesday.
"This has perhaps led to concerns that Singapore's exports -- both in goods and crucially in services as well -- would feel competitive pressure, especially from other Asian economies," the analysts said in a note to clients.
On Wednesday, the central bank also cut its inflation forecast for 2015, saying that the outlook had "shifted significantly" because of lower oil prices. Declines in the price of oil have led to a sharp fall in import prices.
For several years, Singapore has felt the impact of slowing global economic growth. Its economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, roughly half the pace of the previous quarter, the central bank said. The Singapore economy is expected to grow 2 to 4 percent in 2015.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Despite a Sharp Price Drop, Gas Remains Expensive

Abstract: More oil production, then, involves enormous trade-offs: a healthier economy, at least in the short term, but a less healthy planet, with all of the political, ecological, health and economic downsides that come with it. Fuel-economy standards, signed by President Gerald Ford in 1975, forced automakers to replace gas guzzlers with smaller, more efficient cars.

Full text:   The decline in gasoline prices over the past four months has been sharp and surprising. But for Americans wondering why their family budgets still feel strained, part of the answer is almost as surprising:
Gas is not actually that cheap, at least not when compared with its level for much of the last 30 years.
At $2.03 a gallon -- its current nationwide average -- a gallon of gas is still more expensive than nearly anytime in the 1990s, after adjusting for general inflation. Over a 17-year stretch from the start of 1986 to the end of 2002, the real price of gas averaged just $1.87.
That era of cheap gas is easy to forget. Yet it offers a couple of important lessons about two of today's biggest economic (and political) issues: climate change and the great wage slowdown.
Political leaders -- from President Obama and Hillary Clinton to Jeb Bush and Scott Walker -- have been signaling in recent weeks that they consider the wage slowdown to be the country's most pressing issue. And it's clear that energy plays an important role in it. The beginning of the wage slowdown roughly coincides with the end of the era of cheap gas, which is no coincidence. Energy costs are a major expense for most middle-class and poor families, taking a chunk out of their real (that is, inflation-adjusted) wages.
One of the surest ways to end the great wage slowdown would be for the United States to make sure it's entering a new era of cheap energy. "It's the proverbial tax cut," says Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of the research firm IHS and author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of oil. If energy costs remain at current levels, it would put $180 billion into Americans' pockets this year, according to Moody's Analytics, equal to 1.2 percent of income and a higher share for lower-income households.
That's why taking virtually every step to push oil costs even lower -- "drill, baby, drill," as the phrase goes -- would make a lot of sense, so long as oil use did not have harmful side effects.
The most obvious way to hold down the price of oil is to increase its supply. The earlier era of cheap gas was made possible by technological advances that allowed for a surge of supply in the 1980s from northern Alaska and Europe's North Sea. Mexico also became a major producer. The recent drop in oil prices, similarly, stems in part from supply increases in Iraq and Libya. Even more important has been the shale-oil boom (also known as the fracking boom.)
The problem, of course, is that oil use does have side effects. It leads to carbon emissions, which are altering the world's climate. Last year was probably the planet's hottest since modern records began in 1880, and the 15 hottest have all occurred since 1998. Oceans are rising, species are at risk and some types of severe storms, including blizzards, seem to be more common.
More oil production, then, involves enormous trade-offs: a healthier economy, at least in the short term, but a less healthy planet, with all of the political, ecological, health and economic downsides that come with it.
Is it possible to get the benefits of more energy production without the drawbacks? Yes, at least in part. Fracking is less carbon intensive than convention oil drilling (though fracking brings other dangers that need managing). Clean energy -- like wind and solar -- would be better yet, if it could become even cheaper.
Then there is the other side of the oil price equation: demand. A second reason that gas prices fell so rapidly in the early 1980s was the series of conservation efforts that followed the 1970s oil shocks. Fuel-economy standards, signed by President Gerald Ford in 1975, forced automakers to replace gas guzzlers with smaller, more efficient cars. Electricity plants began using natural gas or nuclear power in place of oil.
The conservation didn't last, though. Its success brought about its own demise. Low gas prices, for years on end, persuaded many drivers to give up their small cars. When the era of cheap gas began, in the mid-1980s, the Honda Accord, the Ford Escort, the Ford Tempo and the Chevrolet Celebrity -- all modest-size -- were among the country's 10 best-selling vehicles. When the era ended, in 2002, the Ford Explorer, the Chevrolet Trailblazer, the Chevrolet Silverado and the Dodge Ram -- all trucks -- were among the best-selling.
Left to its own devices, the energy market will repeat this cycle. Low prices will cause supply to grow more slowly, both clean and dirty energy, and demand to grow more quickly. It's happening already.
Sales of S.U.V and pickup trucks were 12 percent higher in December 2014 than December 2013. Car sales rose just 5 percent over the same period. As Mr. Yergin notes, shale-oil production will slow if oil prices remain where they are.
There is a whiff in the energy market of what Winston Churchill lamented as "the endless repetition of history." Breaking that cycle certainly wouldn't be easy, but it would be one of the biggest things that economic policy could accomplish in coming years: finding a way to cement a new era of cheap energy, one that's more enduring than the last one and that doesn't do nearly so much climate damage.
We are at least off to a decent start. Fracking (like nuclear energy) has the potential to increase supply without as much pollution. Wind and solar power have made major progress, though not yet enough in most cases to compete on their own with oil and coal. And the Obama administration, the current Chinese government and possibly the current Indian one are taking conservation more seriously than their predecessors.
The period of cheap oil that began in the 1980s wasn't preordained. If anything, it was the exception to the modern history of energy. But the fact that oil has been even cheaper than it is today -- and for years on end -- does offer reason for economic hope.

Full text:   Differences in race, religion and sexual orientation have erupted in violence around the world recently, making it all too clear that tolerance is an ideal that our societies haven't fully achieved.
What isn't well known is that economists have been studying tolerance and its preconditions for many years, discovering some fascinating yet also unsettling truths.
Since the Enlightenment of the 18th century, for example, it's often been assumed that when you trade with other people you tend to become more tolerant of their differences because mutual understanding increases with greater contact. Furthermore, tolerance is in most people's individual self-interest because the truly intolerant forgo economic benefits -- losing the chance to hire the best workers and to sell to all available customers. For those reasons, as commerce increases and economies grow more sophisticated, discrimination and prejudice should diminish, or so it has been thought.
But is any of that true? Two economists from Sweden, who identify with the Enlightenment tradition, have been testing those claims against the data. They are Niclas Berggren at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics and Therese Nilsson of Lund University. The two scholars have produced a fascinating series of papers on these questions, sometimes writing singly, sometimes together or with the collaboration of a variety of co-authors. Their most notable study is perhaps a paper they wrote together, "Does Economic Freedom Foster Tolerance?"
One of their most striking findings is that societies characterized by greater economic freedom and greater wealth do indeed exhibit greater tolerance toward gay people, a tendency suggesting that gay rights, including gay marriage, will spread globally as national economies liberalize and develop. In other words, if a society allows individuals to engage in consenting capitalist activities with a minimum of legal regulation, we might also expect tolerance of a variety of other choices, including those regarding sexual behavior. Identifying cause and effect can be difficult in such studies, but increases in economic freedom have been associated with increases in this kind of tolerance. Score one for the Enlightenment.
This is no small matter. With the Supreme Court considering legalization of gay marriage throughout the entire United States and not just in the states in which gay marriage is legal now, the paper implies that such a decision would stand on the side of history.
There is a catch, though. This greater tolerance is strongly associated only with certain features of what has often been defined as economic freedom. For example, a smaller government, measured as a share of gross domestic product, is often included in so-called economic freedom indexes as an objective measure of freedom. But the data show that smaller government has a slight negative correlation with tolerance of gay people by heterosexuals. One implication is that many conservatives may be overly preoccupied with the size of government as a measure of how free societies actually are.
On the other hand, the data shows that when a society has impressive scores on property rights security and low inflation -- two other components of economic freedom indexes -- these characteristics are strongly and positively correlated with tolerance of gays. It's possible that low inflation, and the behavior of a central bank, are stand-ins for the general trustworthiness of a nation's government and broader institutions, and such trustworthiness helps foster tolerance.
When we move to racial tolerance, we find similar but much weaker correlations with measures of economic freedom. Perhaps racial prejudices are more deeply ingrained than other sorts of prejudice, although, as one might expect from their Enlightenment orientation, Mr. Berggren and Ms. Nilsson are not themselves convinced such pessimistic conclusions are warranted. Let's hope they are right, because a recent Gallup Poll showed that while American tolerance toward gays has risen, race relations have worsened. The events in Ferguson, Mo., seem to reflect that sad truth.
Another lesson from this data is that economic forces alone are not all-powerful. Both economic freedom and wealth have much closer associations with tolerance when a society exhibits high levels of trust, as measured by the attitudes that people report when surveyed. In other words, economic freedom, wealth and good human values seem to work together, although the causality is murky. Questions of trust occupy only a secondary position in economics and arguably deserve much more attention.
How can prejudice be dismantled? We are often told that education is an important remedy, yet it does not register as a meaningful factor in the cross-country data in this paper. Higher levels of education simply have not correlated significantly with higher levels of tolerance across countries. Income inequality is also not a significant variable. It would be premature to conclude that education and income have no influence, but we should re-examine the pieties that suggest they are of major importance for tolerance.
Finally, the paper offers an intriguing result drawn from data on Muslims who responded to polling questions around the world: Compared with non-Muslims, they are much less tolerant of gay individuals but no less tolerant of differences across the races.
None of these results should be taken as the final word, but they point in some intriguing directions. Economists respect numbers, but we also ought to do more to recognize the meaning of human values and perceptions. Commercial incentives and wealth matter but they are not decisive. Societies do not build trust automatically and so prejudice does not always fall away. The moral quality of our government, and our governance, is important for the fabric of society at the micro level. And finally, not all kinds of prejudice are affected by the same factors. We may make big progress in one area while standing still or perhaps even moving backward in others.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- THE talk up in Boston is all about deflation while the talk down here is all about inflation.
Our sleek, techie president, whose battery dies faster than an iPhone's, was fully charged Tuesday night for the State of the Union.
He was so puffed up, with such a bristling sense of self, that it was hard to believe this was the same guy who spent the last year clenched like a fist, beset by ISIS, beheadings and Ebola, shunned by his own party and slammed by the other party in the fall election.
The murmur went up from grateful Democrats gathered at the Capitol: "Wow, he's got a pulse."
Proving once again that he is a different kind of cat, Barack Obama is oddly pumped by his party's defeat. Even in the House chamber, surrounded by hundreds of people and watched by millions, he seemed to delight in his detachment as he laid down his own markers to drive up his own numbers.
He doesn't mind splendid isolation. He really thinks it's splendid. He's free to revert to being the consummate outsider who doesn't see himself in the context of a system.
He likes the game better when he's up against an opposing team. To him, Harry Reid was as big a problem as Mitch McConnell.
Now it's easier for him to see who he is and where he stands vis-à-vis the Republicans because he doesn't have to make intellectual compromises or negotiate the jagged shoals of the old-school Democratic Party. Now he can define himself against modern conservatives such as Rand Paul and Scott Walker.
President Obama feels he will be able to finally float above it all, more singular and more interesting and more separate, debating enlightened progressive topics like criminal justice reform and child care infrastructure while those off-kilter conservatives fight it out for 2016.
Unlike F.D.R., Obama was not determined to give Americans heart and courage at times of crisis. Instead, his White House tended to take on the coloration of his funks and the clouds spread worldwide.
He only began to really brag on the economy Tuesday night, when he felt certain of the numbers, rather than before the midterms, when it might have helped his party. He could have done a better job all along explaining where we stood and where we were hopefully headed. As one top White House official says about the Obama inner circle, "They'd rather be right than win."
He's alone on the stage -- always his preferred setting. As an isolato, he can say what he thinks and define himself on his own terms. He can ascend to the mountaintop and ignore us when we pester him to come down.
He doesn't have to negotiate with Republicans anymore. He doesn't have to stroke Democrats anymore. He doesn't have to hawk himself to voters anymore. He isn't concerned about Hillary, as he yanks the party to the left. He has forged no lasting links to foreign leaders. And he can have the "vacation from the press" that he told NBC News's Chuck Todd he yearns for.
"Barry got his groove back," as Larry Wilmore, the droll host of Comedy Central's "The Nightly Show," put it.
We got the guy we've been yearning for only when he was able to blow us all off. He can finally do and say whatever he wants.
One Democrat who saw Obama in the White House said the president was so buoyant he had an air of "senioritis."
It seemed a shame, the Democrat said, that Obama couldn't have a third term, now that he was, at long last, fired up and ready to go. Of course, if there was a third term, he would be waiting another four years to show the mojo.
Thrilled to sidestep the press, he felt liberated enough, even as Yemen spiraled, to go on YouTube and make his case to the appealing GloZell Green, a YouTube star wearing glowing green lipstick who got famous eating cereal out of a bathtub.
Remarkably, The One has ended up in the same place the unpopular W. found himself at the end of his two terms: casting his lot with history.
Now that it's all about him, he doesn't get languid and reflective. He rolls up his sleeves and crisscrosses the country.
Anyone expecting Clintonesque triangulation or even a conciliatory nod to the winning team Tuesday night was disappointed. Instead, they got the State of the Veto Threat Address.
The president goaded Republicans, who chortled when he reminded them he was done running for office. He shot back with his favorite snarky rejoinder to Republicans: I won.
Obama won the presidency by creating a magnetic narrative. But then, oddly, he lost the thread of his story and began drifting. He didn't get to the point Bill Clinton did, where he had to insist he was relevant, though last summer, some of his frustrated hopey-change-y acolytes talked about having an intervention with the rudderless president. But others argued against it, pointing out that, while Obama might not have the presidency that was giddily anticipated, during the 2009 tulip-craze phase, he was doing what he wanted.
He wanted to do what he saw as right and have the public and the pols come along simply because he said it was right.
But when the Potomac didn't part when he was elected, he got grumpy and decided not to play the game.
As David Axelrod said, and as Obama concurred, the president was resistant to the symbolism and theatrical aspect of his office. He never got it that the emotional component of the presidency is real, whether it's wooing lawmakers or comforting the nation.
When the public was jittery about ISIS, Ebola and Ferguson, Obama responded like a law professor. He made a stunning speech on race to save his 2008 campaign, but he has stayed largely detached from the roiling race drama that stretched from St. Louis to New York.
In Year 7, when everyone else has started focusing on 2016, he suddenly popped up with a full-throated narrative and rationale for his presidency: It is time for the middle class to share the wealth and the Republicans are still protecting the rich.
The State of the Union was not so much "too little, too late," as "too much, too late."
Republicans said Obama was in "Fantasyland." While free community college educations, money for child care, new roads, new taxes on the rich, initiatives on climate change and partying in Cuba are all feel-good ideas for Democrats, a lot of that isn't going to happen and he knows it.
Though President Obama's numbers are up, the results are likely to be pretty meager. When he trolled Republicans in his speech, it felt good to him and Democrats jumped for joy. But Republicans will have their revenge -- and not just Netanyahu's visit.
In the end, the speech told us less about the state of the union than the state of Obama. The state of Obama is strong, if solitary.

Abstract: Any relief that national leaders feel might be clouded by the realization that there is probably not much more the European Central Bank and its president, Mario Draghi, can do to stimulate the region's economy.

Full text:   DAVOS, Switzerland -- As the European Central Bank deploys its most powerful economic weapon, the onus for growth now lies with the 19 individual countries in the euro currency union, a fractious and highly political group.
The central bank's plan calls for buying 60 billion euros, or about $69 billion, of government bonds and other debt each month. It is the kind of aggressive action that leaders in weaker eurozone countries have long wanted and that Germany has tried to block.
Syriza, the leftist party expected to win the Greek elections this weekend, on Thursday called the bond purchase program "an important decision which the next Greek government will use for the benefit of the country."
The central bank, though, is stretching the limits of its power with the bond-buying program. And if it is not enough to address what ails Europe, any further stimulus efforts would fall to national leaders.
Such steps would involve the sort of extensive government spending that many countries, particularly Germany, have been reluctant to pursue, hewing instead to a philosophy of budget discipline known as austerity. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Thursday warned her peers not to waste the breathing space given by the central bank's stimulus.
"We should not become diverted from the fact that we as politicians need to put a framework for recovery in place," Ms. Merkel said at the World Economic Forum here in Davos, minutes before the European Central Bank announced its decision in Frankfurt.
The central bank's plan, in part, is aimed at easing the burden on national governments by pumping at least [euro]1.1 trillion into the system.
The increased demand from the European Central Bank should raise bond prices and push down yields. If the tactic, known as quantitative easing, works, it would ripple through financial markets, pulling down the interest rates on other types of debt, like business loans.
As a further stimulus step, the European Central Bank said on Thursday that it was cutting the interest rate it charges on loans to commercial banks, as long as the banks commit to lending that money to companies or individuals. The new rate would be 0.05 percent, down from 0.15 percent.
The increased borrowing should help drive inflation and growth in individual countries. The plan could also give governments a share of any profit the European Central Bank might make in interest or in reselling the bonds later.
Even if the central bank action does not reach Italian or Portuguese borrowers, it could still help.
Mario Moretti Polegato, president of the Italian shoemaker Geox, said quantitative easing could help restore a sense of optimism. Many smaller Italian companies could get credit if they wanted it, he said, but they are too pessimistic about their business prospects to invest.
"The E.C.B. move is not something that will replace what Italy needs to do," Mr. Polegato said in an interview at Davos. But he added, "It's a first step."
Any relief that national leaders feel might be clouded by the realization that there is probably not much more the European Central Bank and its president, Mario Draghi, can do to stimulate the region's economy.
On Thursday, Mr. Draghi once again emphasized that national governments need to step up their efforts to rekindle growth.
"It is crucial that structural reforms be implemented swiftly, credibly and effectively as this will not only increase the future sustainable growth of the euro area, but will also raise expectation of higher incomes and encourage firms to increase investment today and bring forward economic recovery," Mr. Draghi said in a statement. "Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery."
Quantitative easing programs have helped revive the economies of the United States and Britain. But the eurozone is not a single country. It is largely a matter of conjecture whether pushing down the interest rates on government debt and some other kinds of bonds in Spain, for example, would make it easier for a hard-pressed small business owner in Italy to get a loan.
"The way it's transmitted is the key," Anat R. Admati, a professor of economics at Stanford University, said in an interview in Davos. Central banks "don't control what happens after they give the money," she said. "They make money cheaper and hope it finds its way to the real economy."
Lawrence H. Summers, a professor at Harvard University and former Treasury secretary, said during a Davos panel discussion that it was "a mistake to suppose that Q.E. is a panacea in Europe, or that it will be sufficient."
In a compromise intended to appease Germans fearful that they will pick up the bill if other countries do not pay their debts, the European Central Bank will delegate some of the bond buying to national central banks, which will also assume some of the risk. Analysts said that leaving some risk with individual countries could weaken the credibility of the program.
Anticipating the criticism, Mr. Draghi said, "The singleness of monetary policy remains in place."
The European Central Bank has sometimes seemed like the sole eurozone institution seeking to restore the economy, in the absence of government spending stimulus. Eurozone leaders may now feel more pressure to act. But most of the changes that economists say are needed, such as loosening rules that make it hard for companies to fire unwanted workers, are unpopular with voters.
"It's a difficult task," Sigmar Gabriel, the German economics minister, said of making economic reforms during a panel discussion. "Most governments that have gone through with it have lost the next elections. But there is no alternative."

Full text:   The European Central Bank unleashed a surprisingly aggressive stimulus plan on Thursday that looked like the last, best hope to prevent the region from sliding toward another lost economic decade with the stagnant growth, high unemployment and political strains that it would mean.
But the 1.1 trillion-euro question is whether the bond-buying program will jolt Europe out of its economic doldrums or merely create a short-term lift to financial markets. The flood of new money sloshing around the global economy could also create problems elsewhere.
"The E.C.B. will succeed in weakening the euro and maintaining generally low interest rates," said Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at the financial services company Allianz. "But this is insufficient to deliver a growth breakthrough," he added, and "comes with the risk of collateral damage and unintended consequences."
Since the financial crisis in 2008, nations grappling with economic weakness have repeatedly turned to one tool to try to fix things: the power of their central banks to create new money from thin air and push it into the financial system by buying bonds. Such programs, known as quantitative easing, can help lower long-term interest rates and bolster financial markets, encouraging spending and business investment.
Years after the United States, Britain and Japan traveled down that path, the European Union, long hamstrung by the complex politics of a single central bank setting policy for 19 countries, has developed its own program. The E.C.B. will buy 60 billion euros worth of securities a month, the bank's president, Mario Draghi, said, including both government bonds and private sector assets. With prices falling in the countries using the euro, Mr. Draghi pledged that the purchases would "be conducted until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation" to become more consistent with the central bank's aim of inflation just below 2 percent a year.
The program was bigger than analysts had expected, and the initial market reaction was favorable. Stocks jumped worldwide, and borrowing costs fell, particularly in Europe. The value of the euro -- already dropping precipitously in recent months in anticipation of the move on Thursday -- dropped an additional 2 percent against the dollar to its lowest level since 2003. That should help the E.C.B's goal of increasing eurozone inflation, and help make the Continent's exporters more competitive.
The success or failure of the program, though, depends on much more than one day's market moves. And the mixed record of monetary injections elsewhere show the challenges that Mr. Draghi and his colleagues will have turning their fiscal activism into sustained economic improvement. The American and British efforts are generally considered successful, but Japan is struggling with a weak economy and deflation.
Mr. Draghi acknowledged that it would take more than an open spigot of money from the central bank to get Europe's economy on track, and that political authorities across Europe must act as well. "What monetary policy can do is to create the basis for growth," he said at a news conference in Frankfurt. "But for growth to pick up, you need investment. For investment, you need confidence. And for confidence, you need structural reforms."
"It's now up to the governments to implement these structural reforms," he said.
Then there are the broader risks of such aggressive monetary activism, as trillions of new dollars, pounds and yen have created unpredictable ripple effects worldwide. Even before Europe announced its plans, risks started to surface.
Switzerland's central bank last week abandoned a longstanding peg of the value of its currency, the franc, against the euro, concluding that it would be impossible to maintain amid the anticipated E.C.B. action. After dropping the cap, the value of the franc rose 17 percent in a single day, and a Swiss recession may well result.
Also Thursday, the Danish central bank cut interest rates, as it faces the challenge of maintaining its own peg between the krone and the euro. It is the country's second rate cut in a week.
Going in the opposite direction, the Federal Reserve is withdrawing its extraordinary stimulus from the United States, helping to drive up the value of the dollar on global currency markets. That could make for more challenging times for American exporters and companies and banks in emerging markets that have borrowed extensively in dollars.
Even as the ripples from years of monetary intervention spread through the globe, the biggest uncertainty for Europe is whether the new program will be enough to arrest a slide toward deflation. Analysts have been reluctant to predict too much out of the new program.
"Q.E. is not a silver bullet for the eurozone's many problems," Howard Archer, the chief European economist for IHS Global Insight, wrote in a research note. "But it should provide some limited help to growth by adding to the stimulus that is already coming from very low oil prices and the markedly weaker euro."
At first glance, Mr. Draghi's plan emulates the Federal Reserve's third and final round of quantitative easing, which is generally credited with helping to accelerate the American economy over the last two years. Both programs were open-ended in size, with billions in monthly bond purchases paired with a pledge to continue until some goal was met. (For the Fed, it was substantial improvement in the job market. For the European Central Bank, returning inflation toward its target).
There are two big differences.
First, the E.C.B. is late. When the Fed pulled the trigger on its open-ended bond buying, in September 2012, annual inflation was running at 1.6 percent in the United States, not far below its 2 percent target. The economy was growing at a steady if unexceptional rate. The Fed was looking to get ahead of its problem of sluggish growth.
The European Central Bank, by contrast, has begun a series of half-measures over the last two and a half years. The contrast has its roots in differing economic analysis about the dangers of deflation and political factors, in particular the aversion of Europe's central bankers and German political leaders to use the common central bank to share risk among countries.
The second big difference with the American program is that the E.C.B. is moving only partway in distributing the risk of losses across the countries that use the euro.
The European Central Bank, which is based in Frankfurt, administers its policies through national central banks across the eurozone: the Bundesbank in Germany, the Banca d'Italia in Italy, and so on. One debate Mr. Draghi and his colleagues had to resolve was whether any losses from government defaults or restructurings on bonds bought through this program would be borne by Europe as a whole or the specific national bank that bought the bonds.
Mr. Draghi was dismissive of the importance of this so-called risk mutualization debate in his news conference Thursday. But the plan he unveiled showed the hallmarks of an intricate negotiation to have some elements of risk-sharing and some risk remaining on the books of individual national bank.
Mr. Draghi showed guile and savvy in guiding a fractious committee of central bankers to a bigger and more aggressive program than seemed plausible even a few weeks ago. But those compromises, if they are too significant, may undermine his goals, failing to shock decision makers across Europe into a belief that it is riskier to hoard money than to spend and invest it.
"I am not sure this is a game changer," Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "Monetary policy in itself is one ingredient, not the ultimate solution."

Full text:   Mario Draghi has delivered -- for now, at least.
After more than a year of speculation, Mr. Draghi, the never-predictable head of the European Central Bank, has given global investors what they have clamored for, with an extra twist: an open-ended commitment to buy eurozone government bonds in bulk.
And in doing so, Mr. Draghi announced to the world that Europe, stuck in a cycle of low growth and deflation, would at long last follow the lead of the United States, Japan and Britain by unleashing the full money-printing powers of its own central bank.
Across the board, the yields on eurozone bonds, from Germany to Greece, declined as traders rushed to scoop up bonds before the E.C.B. started buying. Riskier corporate and high-yield bonds, as well as European stocks, also rallied strongly on the news. The euro, already on a downward slope, lost 2 percent against the dollar, to $1.1361.
Stocks in the United States, which have been under pressure in recent weeks, surged on the news, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increasing 1.5 percent for the day.
While Mr. Draghi had been expected to announce a plan to buy eurozone government bonds, the size and extent of the purchases came as a surprise.
Investors worldwide have been piling into the riskiest sovereign bonds in the eurozone, driving their yields to historic lows even as many of these countries (Italy, Portugal and Greece, in particular) are seeing their debt burdens increase.
But by targeting a larger than expected 1.1 trillion euros' worth of bonds and by leaving room to keep the program going beyond 2016, Mr. Draghi gave his bond-buying bid an added charge of adrenaline.
He doubled down, in effect, on the now-famous promise he made two years ago to "do whatever it takes" to save the euro.
"This is a victory for the idea of monetary dominance in Europe," said C. Randall Henning, an economist at American University in Washington, who had just completed a paper arguing that the central bank should assume a more activist role in combating economic stagnation. "The E.C.B. is right to follow the Fed in this regard, and the sooner the better."
Of course, monetary dominance -- a term that Mr. Draghi actually used during his news conference on Thursday -- is no easy trick when a central bank must satisfy the whims and needs of 19 economies.
But it was Mr. Draghi's ability to fend off objections from Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, that gave investors hope on Thursday that the E.C.B.'s bond-buying program would, unlike past efforts, continue well into the future.
For Mr. Draghi, though, the best news of the day may have been the sharp fall of the euro, whose 2 percent drop against the dollar was quite an acute move for such a widely traded currency. While the rally in eurozone bonds has lasted the better part of two years, the euro's precipitous fall -- it is now trading near an 11-year low -- has been more recent, driven in part by a move by global central banks to keep less of their reserves in low-yielding euro assets.
Over the past six months, the euro has dropped 15 percent, although its decline has been most pronounced in recent weeks as investors of all stripes have been switching out of euros to dollars.
Many economists believe that it will be a cheaper euro, and not rock-bottom interest rates on government bonds, that will lead to an increase in economic activity in the eurozone.
That could come via increased German exports; American and Japanese tourists flocking to Greece, Italy and Spain; and, most crucially, higher prices paid for imports by European consumers that might lift inflation.
"Draghi's No. 1 goal is to weaken the currency," said Dean Popplewell, a currency specialist at Oanda, an online currency trading firm based in Toronto. "He has thrown all the tools in the kitchen at the problem. Now, we have to see if he gets results."
Mr. Popplewell said he believed that the next psychological level to be tested by the market will be 1.10 euros to the dollar, with parity, or 1 euro to the dollar, the ultimate target for euro bears.
As it stands now, the central bank will start buying about 60 billion euros, or $69 billion, in mostly government bonds each month, starting in March, until September 2016. Crucially, Mr. Draghi said that if the bank was not closer to hitting its 2 percent inflation target by then, the buying could continue.
The amount to buy each month is to be linked to each country's size, which means that the bonds of Germany, France, Italy and Spain would make up the bulk of the purchases.
In terms of Greece, where worries abound that a radicalized new government could push for a debt restructuring, Mr. Draghi indicated that if Greece continued with its reforms and followed through with a large bond repayment to the E.C.B. in July, it could be included in the program.
Greek elections are scheduled for Sunday, and the left-leaning Alexis Tsipras, who has talked about restructuring Greece's debt, holds a strong lead in the polls.
While the bond-buying targets may seem large, they are by no means infinite. The E.C.B. said that it would buy no more than 33 percent of a country's outstanding bonds. For countries that have issued lots of government bonds, like Italy and France, the impact of the program could be significant since it would take quite some time to hit that benchmark.
For smaller countries, like Ireland and Greece, that have experienced bailouts and, as a result, have less debt trading in the market, the opposite could be true and the E.C.B. could reach that target quickly, pushing those countries out of the program.
Greece has the highest interest rates in Europe and has been hurt the most by deflation, so such an outcome could be disastrous.
Analysts were mostly in agreement that Mr. Draghi's bond-buying bet stands out as perhaps the most powerful step to aid Europe as a whole since the debt crisis flared up more than four years ago.
That does not mean the plan is destined to succeed. Even with an aggressive stimulus program by its central bank and a weak currency, Japan, for example, still suffers from deflation.
Still, with growth stagnating and prices falling in Europe, there were few other options available to Mr. Draghi other than buying government bonds.
"You know it won't work if you don't do it," said Mr. Henning, the eurozone expert. "But if you do do it, it could have a substantial effect."

Full text:   The United States and Europe have a lot in common. Both are multicultural and democratic; both are immensely wealthy; both possess currencies with global reach. Both, unfortunately, experienced giant housing and credit bubbles between 2000 and 2007, and suffered painful slumps when the bubbles burst.
Since then, however, policy on the two sides of the Atlantic has diverged. In one great economy, officials have shown a stern commitment to fiscal and monetary virtue, making strenuous efforts to balance budgets while remaining vigilant against inflation. In the other, not so much.
And the difference in attitudes is the main reason the two economies are now on such different paths. Spendthrift, loose-money America is experiencing a solid recovery -- a reality reflected in President Obama's feisty State of the Union address. Meanwhile, virtuous Europe is sinking ever deeper into deflationary quicksand; everyone hopes that the new monetary measures announced Thursday will break the downward spiral, but nobody I know really expects them to be enough.
On the U.S. economy: No, it's not morning in America, let alone the kind of prosperity we managed during the Clinton years. Recovery could and should have come much faster, and family incomes remain well below their pre-crisis level. Although you'd never know it from the public discussion, there's overwhelming agreement among economists that the Obama stimulus of 2009-10 helped limit the damage from the financial crisis, but it was too small and faded away far too fast. Still, when you compare the performance of the American economy over the past two years with all those Republican predictions of doom, you can see why Mr. Obama is strutting a bit.
Europe, on the other hand -- or more precisely the eurozone, the 18 countries sharing a common currency -- did almost everything wrong. On the fiscal side, Europe never did much stimulus, and quickly turned to austerity -- spending cuts and, to a lesser extent, tax increases -- despite high unemployment. On the monetary side, officials fought the imaginary menace of inflation, and took years to acknowledge that the real threat is deflation.
Why did they get it so wrong?
To some extent, the turn toward austerity reflected institutional weakness: In the United States, federal programs like Social Security, Medicare and food stamps helped support states like Florida with especially severe housing busts, whereas European nations in similar straits, like Spain, were on their own. But European austerity also reflected willful misdiagnosis of the situation. In Europe as in America, the excesses that led to crisis overwhelmingly involved private rather than public debt, with Greece very much an outlier. But officials in Berlin and Brussels chose to ignore the evidence in favor of a narrative that placed all the blame on budget deficits, and simultaneously rejected the evidence suggesting -- correctly -- that trying to slash deficits in a depressed economy would deepen the depression.
Meanwhile, Europe's central bankers decided to worry about inflation in 2011 and raise interest rates. Even at the time it was obvious that this was foolish -- yes, there had been an uptick in headline inflation, but measures of underlying inflation were too low, not too high.
Monetary policy got much better after Mario Draghi became president of the European Central Bank in late 2011. Indeed, Mr. Draghi's heroic efforts to provide liquidity to nations facing speculative attack almost surely saved the euro from collapse. But it's not at all clear that he has the tools to fight off the broader deflationary forces set in motion by years of wrongheaded policy. Furthermore, he has to function with one hand tied behind his back, because Germany remains adamantly opposed to anything that might make life easier for debtor nations.
The terrible thing is that Europe's economy was wrecked in the name of responsibility. True, there have been times when being tough meant reducing deficits and resisting the temptation to print money. In a depressed economy, however, a balanced-budget fetish and a hard-money obsession are deeply irresponsible. Not only do they hurt the economy in the short run, they can -- and in Europe, have -- inflict long-run harm, damaging the economy's potential and driving it into a deflationary trap that's very hard to escape.
Nor was this an innocent mistake. The thing that strikes me about Europe's archons of austerity, its doyens of deflation, is their self-indulgence. They felt comfortable, emotionally and politically, demanding sacrifice (from other people) at a time when the world needed more spending. They were all too eager to ignore the evidence that they were wrong.
And Europe will be paying the price for their self-indulgence for years, perhaps decades, to come.

Full text:   Let's raise the gas tax.
There are several reasons we need to discuss this now. One is that plummeting gasoline prices make the idea very timely. Also, people will be asking you this week what you thought of President Obama's State of the Union address. Even though he did not mention the gas tax, bringing it up will allow you to avoid having an opinion on whether it's time to close the capital gains stepped-up-basis loophole.
The gas tax raises much-needed money for roads and mass transit. Our roads, you may have noticed, are falling apart. Every time you hit a pothole, yell: "Raise the gas tax!"
Even more important, it encourages Americans to use fuel-efficient cars. While we're all happy as clams about falling gas prices, every gallon produces more than 19 pounds of planet-warming emissions. We just had the hottest year on record. The ice floes are melting. Walruses keep piling up along the Alaskan shore, where the babies can get squashed.
Raise the gas tax and remember the walruses.
Plus, it's not really a tax! Or at least not necessarily. Just ask Ronald Reagan. When he entered office, Reagan said he didn't see the likelihood of a gas tax increase "unless there's a palace coup." But then, you know, stuff happened and The Great Communicator discovered that a levy on gasoline wasn't really a tax, but merely a "user fee." So no problem at all, and under his administration the, um, fee was more than doubled.
Ah, Ronald Reagan. Perhaps you noticed, during the State of the Union, that President Obama was urging Congress to bring the capital gains tax back up to Reagan-era levels? Who'd have thought? We live in ironic times, people.
But about the gas tax. It was also raised under George H.W. (The Good One) Bush, and then again under Bill Clinton. Remember Al Gore breaking the tie in the Senate? Ah, Al Gore.
And that was it. The federal gas tax, currently 18.4 cents a gallon, is not indexed for inflation, and it has not gone up since 1993. The Highway Trust Fund, which pays for the federal highway construction program, keeps falling deeper into the red. It's currently scheduled to implode sometime this spring.
The White House has been very clear about its lack of enthusiasm for solving the problem with a gas tax increase. Mainly, the objection is that if Congress wouldn't pass Obama's proposal to pay for early education with a tobacco tax, it's not going to fund road repair with a gas tax. This is a pretty good point. However, deeply cynical souls could also argue that the current majority likes road construction more than preschool.
During the State of the Union, Obama made his pitch for another idea: reform the tax on overseas business profits, creating a one-time-only windfall of revenue for the government to use in a mega-road-building spree.
Three reasons the gas tax is a better idea:
1) Walruses.
2) Half the members of Congress are eyeing that very same windfall to pay for their own pet programs.
3) Only works once. "It's just a coward's way out," says Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican. Genuine fiscal conservatives hate the idea of paying for permanent ongoing programs with one-shot revenues. Corker has been known to complain that he's been in the Senate for eight years and never saw Congress permanently solve a problem.
Last year Corker and Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat of Connecticut. floated the idea of raising the gas tax 12 cents over two years. "Our bet when we went out on a limb last year was that we could position it as a topic for serious discussion this year, and I hope it's going to pay off," said Murphy.
And it's working, sort of. A number of prominent Republicans have been muttering things like "nothing is off the table." Senator James Inhofe, the new chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and a man whose position on global warming makes him an enemy to walruses everywhere, has said a gas tax is "one of the options." An option that is not off the table! Truly, the worm has turned.
On the other hand, Representative Paul Ryan, the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently announced: "We won't pass a gas tax." That would seem to be somewhat discouraging, but there are still these gleams of hope that Republicans might come around since:
-- You can call it a user fee. (Ask Ronald Reagan)
-- President Obama doesn't like it.
-- Compromise is possible. Many conservatives hate the fact that the Highway Trust Fund also helps support mass transit and invests in things like highway beautification and bike paths. There might be some room for give here. Let's throw something in the fund under the proverbial bus. I nominate "transportation museums."

Abstract: If transaction fees add up to $4,000, for example, the family needs to stay in the home for at least 21 more months (if borrowing $400,000; 17 months if borrowing $389,826) to justify the transaction (or a bit longer if you also try to account for the tax savings they are not receiving because they are paying less to the bank in mortgage interest).

Full text:   The bond market is a complicated thing, and it is understandable if most people don't spend a lot of time thinking about it. But even for Americans who don't want to spend any mental energy on yield curves, convexity and term premia, there is one simple thing to know about the current tumult in the multitrillion-dollar market: It's time to think about refinancing your mortgage.
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.8 percent at the end of last week. That is down from 4.5 percent as recently as last spring, the lowest since May 2013 and far below the 5 percent-plus rates that prevailed as recently as early 2011.
That raises the possibility that the great American refinancing machine might again chug into motion, leaving Americans with lower monthly payments, more cash in their pockets or both. Homeowners who secured their current mortgage in late 2013 or early 2014, or anytime before mid-2011, may want to at least plug their numbers into an online calculator to see if the potential savings are worthwhile.
The math can be as simple as you want or as complex; here's how to think of the decision.
When considering whether to refinance, you are exploiting the fact that you can fully repay a home mortgage whenever you want and take out a new one. If rates rise, you can stick with your old one as long as you continue to own your home; if they fall, you can pay off the old mortgage and get a new one. Heads you win, tails your lender loses. Seldom in life in does this dynamic apply, so it is worth exploiting whenever the opportunity arises.
Everyone's details are different, but if the current rate is half a percentage point below the rate on your mortgage, a refinance is potentially compelling. If it is closer to a full percentage point gap, it may be a slam-dunk unless you expect to move soon.
But taking out a new mortgage comes with costs, such as origination and appraisal fees -- typically in the low four figures. The open question is whether you will enjoy the benefits of lower rates for long enough to cover that upfront cost.
As a hypothetical, a family that took out a $400,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in June 2013 at 4.6 percent could save $187 a month by refinancing $400,000 at a 3.8 percent rate. (If instead of taking cash out they borrowed only the $389,826 they should owe on the mortgage at this point, they would save $234 a month, reflecting both the lower interest rate and a smaller principal.)
Before taking the plunge, though, our family has to decide how long it expects to stay in the home. If transaction fees add up to $4,000, for example, the family needs to stay in the home for at least 21 more months (if borrowing $400,000; 17 months if borrowing $389,826) to justify the transaction (or a bit longer if you also try to account for the tax savings they are not receiving because they are paying less to the bank in mortgage interest).
Or here's another intriguing possibility. Let's say our family has seen its income rise since originally taking out the home loan in mid-2013. The interest rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is now a mere 2.9 percent. An option would be to refinance the $389,825 currently owed into a 15-year mortgage. That would increase the monthly payment by $623 a month -- but would result in paying the home loan off entirely in 2030, not 2043 as the family was previously on track to do.
As with all major financial decisions, the details of each family's situation can add all kinds of complexity that are worth gaming out and analyzing carefully. But for the economy as a whole, this latest shift in rates has a particular silver lining.
In years past, mortgage rates have dipped when it looked like the United States economy could be falling back toward recession, and the Federal Reserve intervened with easier money to try to stop that from happening. This time, the economy is looking relatively strong and the Fed is making plans to raise interest rates.
This drop in mortgage rates is being driven by a combination of plummeting oil prices, which are reducing investors' expectations for inflation in the years ahead, and a tumultuous global economic environment, which is leading investors worldwide to plow money into safe American assets. That includes the bonds packaged by the government-sponsored mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which in turn fund most of the nation's consumer mortgages.
In other words, global investors are so desperate for a safe place to park cash and so confident that inflation is nowhere to be found that they are flinging money at United States homeowners. Americans now paying significantly above-market rates on their home loan might at least do them the favor of picking it up.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDLOS ANGELES -- Hollywood is prone to superlatives, but this one is truly jaw dropping: "American Sniper," which arrived in wide release on Friday, is expected to sell about $105.2 million in tickets in North America over the four-day holiday weekend.
While America's coastal intelligentsia busied itself with chatter over little-seen art dramas like "Boyhood" and "Birdman," everyday Americans showed up en masse for a patriotic, pro-family picture that played more like a summer superhero blockbuster than an R-rated war drama with six Oscar nominations.
Directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, "American Sniper" joins another unexpected hit, Angelina Jolie's "Unbroken," in turning out a conservative, heartland crowd that surprised Hollywood in its size. "Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico -- all absolutely massive," said Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., which released "American Sniper."
But unlike "Unbroken," Mr. Eastwood's film has also been nominated for best picture at the Oscars. Until now, the best picture race, with small films like "Birdman" and "Boyhood" in the running, has been sorely missing a breakout hit -- considered a crucial factor for the ratings success of the ceremony, which will be broadcast live on Feb. 22.
"American Sniper," which received reviews that were strong but not euphoric, was adapted from a best-selling autobiography of the same name by Chris Kyle, a member of the Navy SEALs who was credited with enough confirmed kills in Iraq and Afghanistan to rank as the most deadly sniper in American history. Mr. Kyle was killed in 2013 at a Texas gun range by an emotionally troubled veteran he was trying to help.
"The previews looked really intense, and I was curious about it being a true story," said Eric Davidson, 19, who saw the movie with two friends in Indianapolis on Friday. "I immediately recommended it on Twitter. Everyone's talking about it."
The film gave Hollywood its biggest January opening weekend ever. "Avatar," which opened in December 2009, had the biggest previous January weekend take, $74.4 million in 2010, after adjusting for inflation. Mr. Eastwood's film ranks as the largest R-rated release in history for Imax, where the film took in $11.5 million, beating the previous record-holder, "Prometheus." Making "American Sniper" look even better: "Blackhat," a cyberthriller from the director Michael Mann, bombed in its first weekend. "Blackhat," which cost Legendary Entertainment an estimated $70 million to make and was released by Universal Pictures, is expected to take in $4.6 million over the four-day weekend, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data.
Warner, which produced "American Sniper" with Village Roadshow for $58 million, initially planned to release the film next Christmas. Mr. Eastwood, 84, typically makes one film a year and his 2014 entry was "Jersey Boys," which fizzled in July, taking in a total of $47 million.
But when Warner saw rough "American Sniper" footage last summer, it moved the film's release to December 2014.
Still, the studio was already fully committed to the wide release of "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," and the overall Christmas box office was crowded with competing films; securing additional theatrical space for the wide-release of "American Sniper" would be difficult. So Warner decided to ease Mr. Eastwood's film into the marketplace, releasing it in just four theaters on Dec. 25.
Ticket sales in that handful of theaters exceeded expectations, helping Warner to rally multiplex chains around the picture. "American Sniper" suddenly went from smaller auditoriums to the biggest bookings available. Imax came on board only 10 days ago, for instance. "The strong reaction to the limited, platform release helped us in a huge way," Mr. Fellman said on Sunday.
So-called "sand movies," the term Hollywood sometimes uses for films set in Afghanistan and Iraq, have a terrible box office track record. To overcome that stigma, "American Sniper" was positioned as equal parts war thriller (attracting men) and emotional family drama (luring women). In the end, the gender breakdown was relatively balanced: Warner said 57 percent of the weekend audience was male.
Warner also generated advance word-of-mouth with extensive military screenings and outreach to veterans. Over the weekend, "American Sniper" received a rare A-plus grade in exit polls conducted by CinemaScore. Twitter and Facebook lit up with comments from satisfied customers, driving more people to theaters.
The success demonstrates the way "social media buzz can push a movie really far, really fast," said Phil Contrino, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com.
Martin Luther King's Birthday weekend, however, also brought a reminder that social media attention does not always translate into ticket sales: "Selma," another best picture nominee, was expected to take in a quiet $10.3 million over the four-day period -- on par with "The Imitation Game," also a best picture nominee that played in far fewer theaters. "Selma" on Thursday became the center of a heated conversation about a lack of racial diversity at the Oscars.
Among other new films, "The Wedding Ringer," an R-rated comedy starring Kevin Hart, is expected to sell $25 million in tickets over the four-day weekend while the family film "Paddington" will arrive to more than $20 million.
Correction: January 22, 2015, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about the weekend box-office revenue for movies, including the estimated $105.2 million for "American Sniper," a record for a January weekend opening, erroneously attributed a distinction to "Avatar." It held the record for the biggest box-office take for a January weekend -- $74.4 million in 2010, after adjusting for inflation -- not for an opening on a January weekend.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices in the United States are rising at the slowest pace during a period of economic growth in the last half-century, a trend that could delay the Federal Reserve's retreat from its stimulus campaign.
An index of the prices Americans pay for goods and services rose just 0.8 percent during the 12 months ending in December as the collapse of oil prices offset the higher cost of food and health care, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday.
The slow pace of inflation means Americans are experiencing less erosion in the value of their paychecks at a time when wages, too, are rising unusually slowly. But it is also evidence that the recovery from the Great Recession remains incomplete. And sluggish inflation itself can impede debt repayment and other economic adjustments.
The Fed has said it plans to start raising its benchmark interest rate around the middle of the year. Job growth has outstripped its expectations and other economic indicators are improving. The University of Michigan's consumer survey reported on Friday that consumer confidence in January hit the highest level in a decade.
Some Fed officials reiterated on Friday that they saw sluggish inflation as a temporary problem. They said that lower oil prices would actually help reverse the trend by contributing to stronger economic growth and, in time, increased inflation.
"We've all been expecting this given what oil prices are doing," Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in an interview on Friday. "The bigger question is what happens in the next four to six months. Will inflation begin to drift back up toward our target? I think that it will."
But Fed officials also have underscored in recent weeks that their policy decisions will be determined by the course of events, not by their predictions. And some analysts said on Friday that it seemed increasingly likely the Fed would once again decide to wait a little longer before finally raising interest rates.
"In light of the downward pressure on inflation, we expect the F.O.M.C. will be 'patient' this year as far as monetary policy is concerned," Ryan Wang, United States economist at HSBC, wrote in a note to clients on Friday, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy. "We believe the committee will hold off any increase in the federal funds rate until September, waiting for evidence that both total and core inflation have bottomed out and are beginning to rise again."
The Fed aims to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, and Friday's report is worse than it looks because the Fed prefers a different government measure that tends to show somewhat less inflation. That measure, the index of personal consumption expenditures, will be updated later this month.
Separately, the Fed reported that industrial production fell by 0.1 percent in December, driven mostly by a sharp drop in utility output caused mostly by a swing from an unusually cold November to an unusually warm December. A 0.3 percent increase in manufacturing and a 2.2 gain jump in mining, which showed that crude oil production was continuing to advance despite the drop in prices, offset most of the drop in utility output.
The sharp decline of oil prices is a crucial factor in the low inflation figures. The government said the price of gasoline fell 21 percent over the last year, and analysts said cheap gas also appeared to be holding down the cost of some other goods and services. But oil prices cannot continue to fall at the same pace, and surveys of economists and consumers show a widespread expectation that inflation will rebound.
The University of Michigan's consumer survey reported on Friday that expectations for inflation over the next year declined substantially to 2.4 percent in January from 2.8 percent in December. Crucially, however, the survey reported no change in consumer expectations for annual inflation five years from now.
"The bottom line is that permanently lower energy prices are a stimulus package for U.S. consumers," Laura Rosner, an economist at BNP Paribas, wrote on Friday. "Stronger final demand should speed up inflation's return to 2 percent, not slow it down or make it less likely."
The weakness of inflation, however, predates the collapse of oil prices. The Fed has not hit its 2 percent target in more than two years. And the data suggests other factors, including a strengthening dollar, are restraining inflation. The prices of imported goods like clothing and cars also have fallen in recent months.
Notably, a version of the consumer index that excludes oil and food did not rise in December. The Fed and many independent economists regard this measure, known as core inflation, as a more accurate indicator of future inflation because oil and food prices are volatile, obscuring the underlying trend.
Measures of inflation expectations derived from asset prices suggested that some investors had doubts about how quickly inflation was likely to rebound -- and they are increasingly betting the Fed will wait until the fall to raise rates.
The Fed, however, has not significantly altered its timetable in more than a year, and officials have said they will not wait for inflation to recover before acting. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said last month that it would be sufficient for officials to feel "reasonably confident" that inflation was going to rebound.
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said on Friday that the Fed was being pulled in opposite directions by the growing strength of the economy and the weakness of inflation. He noted that the Fed had underestimated job growth and overestimated inflation in each of the last two years.
But Mr. Bullard, speaking in Chicago, said that on balance, based on current economic conditions, he was inclined to think that the time had come to raise rates. "The level of inflation is not so low that it can alone justify a policy rate of zero," he said.

Abstract: The coalition of Hindu conservatives and small-business owners who form the political base of Prime Minister Narendra Modi want deeper rate cuts and other policies to help borrowers and stimulate economic growth. In an hourlong interview Wednesday afternoon at the Reserve Bank's headquarters overlooking Mumbai's financial district, Mr. Rajan said that he was not feeling pressure to change the direction of monetary policy.

Full text:   MUMBAI -- Few central bankers in emerging markets have been as internationally lionized as Raghuram G. Rajan of India.
Mr. Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has been honored with awards this winter for his role in helping to bring momentum back to the country's economy. His unexpected interest rate cut on Thursday helped strengthen emerging market stocks around the world.
At home, the view is less favorable, as Mr. Rajan finds himself caught in a political struggle.
The coalition of Hindu conservatives and small-business owners who form the political base of Prime Minister Narendra Modi want deeper rate cuts and other policies to help borrowers and stimulate economic growth. Mr. Rajan's critics contend that he has been so focused on reducing inflation that he has not paid enough attention to tumbling world oil prices or the heavy debt burdens of many Indian companies.
"He believes the best way to reduce the temperature of a patient is to kill him," said Subramanian Swamy, the chairman of the strategic affairs committee of Mr. Modi's party and a former commerce minister and law minister.
The situation reflects Mr. Rajan's bigger dilemma. At 5 percent, inflation in India is high, compared to the rest of the world. But it is low enough by India's standards that political support is splintering over further action to address the issue. While Western-trained technocrats like Mr. Rajan are still concerned about price increases, populists and businessmen in Mr. Modi's political base are not.
At the same time, economic growth, which is expected to reach 6.4 percent this year, looks robust by Western standards. Even so, growth is not enough to satisfy many of Mr. Modi's backers, who promised the economy would spring forward if freed from heavy government regulation and taxation. They now want the central bank to help the process by stimulating lending.
In an hourlong interview Wednesday afternoon at the Reserve Bank's headquarters overlooking Mumbai's financial district, Mr. Rajan said that he was not feeling pressure to change the direction of monetary policy. He described a harmonious working relationship with Mr. Modi's top economic policy makers. "We completely understand each other," he said.
Mr. Rajan defended his decision not to lower interest rates at his last monetary policy review on Dec. 2. While oil prices had already fallen considerably by then, he said there was no way to foresee the abrupt plunge that followed, or to pass judgment on how long prices would stay low.
In a news release on Thursday, Mr. Rajan made such a judgment, saying, "Crude prices, barring geopolitical shocks, are expected to remain low over the year." He reduced the bank's main overnight loan rate by a quarter percent, to 7.75 percent.
Despite the move, Madhav Nalapat, a Manipal University professor with close ties to the conservative wing of Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, predicted that the party's conservatives would remain deeply unhappy with Mr. Rajan, a holdover from the previous government.
"He's good for Wall Street," Professor Nalapat said. "He's not good for our Main Street."
The acrimony that has greeted Mr. Rajan's slowness to reduce interest rates is symptomatic of why India in particular has tended to tolerate more inflation and of the particular challenges facing central bank leaders in emerging markets.
Many companies in India are heavily indebted and are in favor of rising prices, which make it easier for them to afford fixed monthly payments.
Compounding the anger is that Mr. Rajan has interpreted broadly his mandate as the country's top financial regulator as well as monetary policy maker. Mr. Rajan has repeatedly urged the country's mostly state-owned banks to step in and replace management at struggling, indebted companies, instead of waiting for them to fail and default on loans.
He has also insisted that banks start requiring the founders and controlling shareholders of big companies to provide more collateral and give personal guarantees for large bank loans extended to their businesses. That has set off considerable indignation in India's business elite, which has periodically been able to persuade state-owned banks to expunge debts during hard times, sometimes while retaining their holdings in the same companies.
But Mr. Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said that he had no plans to relent.
"If they do take the risk, they should pay the costs of taking that risk, rather than benefit when that risk pays off but shove the cost on somebody else when it doesn't," he said.
Another criticism is that Mr. Rajan did not try to reverse the rupee's steep fall against the dollar, which occurred in the summer of 2013, before he took office in September of that year. This has meant that Indians who had borrowed dollars overseas need more rupees to repay their debts. The central bank has even been intervening in currency markets in ways that tend to prevent the rupee from rising against the dollar: spending rupees to buy more dollars for its foreign exchange reserves.
Mr. Rajan defended this move, saying that India needed to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves, which had been depleted during the rupee's rout in 2013. He also noted that because the rupee had been steady against the strong dollar of late, it had generally been rising this winter against most currencies.
The job of governor of the Reserve Bank of India is a strange hybrid, a holdover from British colonial rule, which ended in 1947, with the checks and balances of democracy grafted on.
Unlike the practice at the United States Federal Reserve and many other central banks, where interest rate changes are voted on by a committee, such decisions in India are the personal responsibility of the governor, although he may consult with others. The reserve bank also has an unusually broad array of regulatory powers, many of which are not subject to judicial review. It oversees bank licensing, bank regulation, bond trading and consumer protection.
But the central bank governor has less independence, at least on paper. The governor may be dismissed and replaced by the finance minister, who may also order the governor to make an interest rate change, although the order must be issued in writing. Because either move would be highly contentious, finance ministers have refrained over the years from exercising these powers.
Some conservatives around Mr. Modi want to see Mr. Rajan removed. Mr. Swamy, who was a president of the Janata Party before its merger with Mr. Modi's party, predicted on Thursday that Mr. Rajan would someday be forced to resign.
"I don't know why they kept him; they didn't even appoint him," he said. "He was appointed by the last government."
But Mr. Swamy acknowledged that Mr. Rajan retained the strong support of the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, a longtime pillar of the New Delhi establishment. Another friend of Mr. Rajan, and his former colleague at the I.M.F., Arvind Subramanian, became the government's chief economic adviser in October.
Mr. Rajan brushed away questions about political tensions sounded. He sounded wistful only once during the interview on Wednesday, when he explained why he ran half-marathons.
"I have never run a full marathon, and my wife will not let me run one," he said. "She says that's tempting fate."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Producer prices in December recorded the biggest drop in more than three years as energy prices continued to tumble. With underlying inflation pressures remaining light, it was a cautionary signal for the Federal Reserve as it considers its next move on monetary policy.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that its Producer Price Index for final demand declined 0.3 percent, the biggest drop since October 2011, after falling 0.2 percent in November.
"That makes the Fed's job more difficult," said Augustine Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. "The Fed needs to be more cautious about raising interest rates."
In the 12 months through December, prices at the factory gate increased 1.1 percent, the smallest gain since November 2013, after rising 1.4 percent in November. A broader measure of underlying producer inflation pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged in November.
Fed officials have largely viewed the energy-driven weakness in inflation as transitory. But with retail sales and average hourly earnings, another crucial inflation measure, falling in December, some policy makers might question that view.
The Federal Reserve has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. Inflation is running below the bank's 2 percent target. Analysts have said they expect consumer inflation data on Friday to show that price pressures remained muted in December.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 316,000 for the week to Jan. 10.
Economists, who had forecast claims falling to 291,000 last week, said the data had been distorted by difficulties adjusting it for seasonal fluctuations. Seasonal quirks also have been blamed for the weak retail sales and wage growth in December.
"Seasonal adjustments become particularly difficult around year-end. We expect claims to resume their downward trend in the coming weeks and reflect broader improvement in labor markets," said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered to be a more reliable measure of trends, remained below 300,000, a level associated with a strengthening labor market, for the 18th consecutive week.
Other reports showed mixed fortunes for manufacturing in January across New York State and the mid-Atlantic region. Economists said this was broadly in line with some cooling in factory activity in response to slowing global demand and a stronger dollar.
Wholesale energy prices dropped a record 6.6 percent in December, declining for a sixth month. The fall reflected sliding crude oil prices against the backdrop of weakening global demand and more shale production in the United States. A strong dollar, as the American economy outperforms its peers, is also helping to curb inflation.
The International Monetary Fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, said on Thursday that weak oil prices were unlikely to bolster the global economy.
Concerns about global growth have also undercut copper prices. On Thursday, copper rose on a mix of bargain-hunting, short-covering and hedging by buyers, a day after its biggest slide in more than three years, but more losses were expected.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- A court opinion issued on Wednesday makes it all but certain that the European Central Bank will announce a major round of economic stimulus next week, after months of contentious internal debate.
But much mystery remains about how the bank will deploy quantitative easing -- buying government bonds on a large scale to pump money into the economy.
The central bank still needs to decide the amount and the mix of bonds, including whether riskier nations such as Greece should be avoided. They must also navigate thorny political issues, like the concerns of Germany, whose opposition to E.C.B. bond-buying has long been the main impediment to action.
It is a moment of truth for the central bank and a test of whether its president, Mario Draghi, can finesse the details while leaving no doubt about his institution's resolve to reinvigorate the eurozone economy.
If it is not big or broad enough, the program might not work to revive the region. And many of the economists who have been saying for a year or more that the European Central Bank needs to take this stimulus step contend that when the move finally comes, it could be too little, too late. Some even predict that at its much-anticipated meeting next week, the central bank will announce only its intention to engage in bond-buying and wait until the next meeting, in March, to provide the details.
"They have always been too late," said Adalbert Winkler, a former economist at the central bank who is now a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management and an advocate of quantitative easing. "The last five years, if they had been more aggressive, maybe we could have avoided this discussion."
A solid majority on the central bank's 25-member Governing Council appears, based on recent public statements, to favor broad bond-buying. Their position was strengthened by the opinion submitted to the highest European appeals court on Wednesday in response to a lawsuit by German citizens seeking to block a previously planned bond-buying program that Mr. Draghi announced in 2012 but never deployed.
The opinion, by an adviser who considers legal arguments for the court, affirmed the European Central Bank's freedom to intervene in bond markets, with only minor restrictions. The opinion -- it is not binding, but the court typically follows such guidance -- could also help insulate the central bank from future lawsuits by warning lower courts to be cautious about interfering in monetary policy.
In principle, quantitative easing is simple and well tested. It has been used by the Federal Reserve in the United States, which began a series of bond-buying programs in the aftermath of the financial crisis that is credited with helping to revive the American economy. Britain, too, has used quantitative easing to similar effect.
Under such a program, the central bank buys large amounts of government bonds and other assets, paid for with newly created money. Such purchases help drive down market interest rates, inject money into the economy and push inflation up from dangerously low levels considered incompatible with growth.
After that, it gets complicated.
Should the European Central Bank buy bonds from all 19 eurozone countries, and in what proportions? If from all eurozone members, then how should it handle Greece? The country is poised to elect a new government that could repudiate some of the billions of euros of loans the country owes as part of its international bailout. And how to keep the Germans on board?
Mr. Draghi has resolved to jolt inflation back to the central bank's official target of "below, but close to" 2 percent. And yet, consumer prices fell at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in December, raising the specter of a downward price spiral that could further undercut wages and growth.
Because of the large number of unanswered questions, the European Central Bank may not be ready to announce details of a bond-buying program next week.
"It's almost impossible for the E.C.B. in this environment not to act," said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group. But, he said, "We think it's a two-step move -- announcement in January, further details in March."
Some elements of such a program are a given. The central bank would buy bonds on the open market -- not directly from governments, which would be a violation of its charter.
But the bank will have to figure out how to deal with the lack of Pan-European assets comparable to the United States Treasury bonds that the Fed purchased in its quantitative easing program.
The simplest and most likely option would be to buy bonds in proportion to each eurozone country's share of the central bank's capital, which is calculated according to each member state's population and gross domestic product.
The drawback to this method is that it would mean buying large quantities of German government bonds, which are already in heavy demand -- so much so that on Wednesday the yield on the 10-year German bond reached a new low.
Germany accounts for 18 percent of the European Central Bank's capital, more than any other country. (Malta, with 0.65 percent of the central bank's capital, has the smallest share.) Market interest rates on some other German government bonds are already below zero. So it is not clear what purpose, if any, would be served by pushing the rates even lower, as would happen if the European Central Bank started buying.
A second option would be to buy only highly rated government bonds -- those of France, Finland and Germany, say, while avoiding the bonds of governments with riskier finances, like Portugal or Greece. That approach would answer German concerns that taxpayers could be stuck with the bill if some eurozone governments were to default on their debt.
In theory, if the European Central Bank drove up the prices of highly rated bonds, private investors would turn to the bonds of weaker countries instead. But it is not certain that would happen. If not, the E.C.B. would not achieve its goal of providing relief in heavily indebted countries like Italy.
A third option would be to buy bonds in proportion to the outstanding debt of each eurozone country -- the higher the debt level, the more bonds the central bank would buy. This alternative would favor countries that are the most deeply in debt and need the most help, like Italy. But conservative critics in Germany would probably complain that these countries were being rewarded for irresponsibly running up huge debts.
Every option has negative side effects. But Mr. Winkler of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management said that did not mean the central bank should sit on its hands. "If you are about to drown," he said, "you don't worry about the possibility of having a heart attack a week later."
Whatever the method used by the central bank, the next big question is how much to buy. The central bank has implicitly set a target of expanding its balance sheet, a measure of the volume of its stimulus, by 1 trillion euros, or about $1.18 trillion.
The bank has already been buying private sector assets, including bundles of real estate loans. But the amount so far, about [euro]33 billion, is clearly inadequate to meet the balance-sheet goal. Most of the rest would have to come from government bonds, the most abundant asset available.
Analysts at Nomura in London estimate that the European Central Bank would have to spend at least [euro]700 billion on eurozone government bonds. But rather than setting the long-range target, Nomura analysts said in a note to clients last week, the central bank will probably announce monthly targets of around [euro]55 billion, which could be adjusted to reflect changes in the inflation rate or other economic developments.
Among economists, there is widespread skepticism about whether any amount of bond-buying will solve the eurozone's growth and inflation problem. There is already plenty of money in the system, they say. The problems, many economists argue, lie in economic drags that are beyond the control of Mr. Draghi and the central bank -- that it takes too long to get a building permit in Italy, for example, or that there are too many restrictions on hiring and firing in France.
"I don't think what he does," said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., "is going to make any difference for the economy."

Abstract: For workers who have faced six years of stagnant pay, Federal Reserve officials trying to decide when they can safely raise interest rates, or anyone who wants the United States economy to experience a truly robust recovery, the single biggest question about the economy in 2015 is whether pay raises will become more commonplace. [...]next year, the company plans to offer a new health benefits program to lower out-of-pocket expenses for low-income workers that the company says could save employees up to $4,000, essentially combining the raise this year with better benefits next year.

Full text:   All eyes are on wages. For workers who have faced six years of stagnant pay, Federal Reserve officials trying to decide when they can safely raise interest rates, or anyone who wants the United States economy to experience a truly robust recovery, the single biggest question about the economy in 2015 is whether pay raises will become more commonplace.
Three pieces of news on Tuesday point to yes.
There are new signs that American workers, especially at the middle and low end of the pay scale, may finally start having enough negotiating leverage to demand wage increases in excess of inflation.
First, the Labor Department's monthly report on job openings, hiring and firing was released, and it showed a continuation of a trend that has been underway for more than a year: In November, employers said they had about 4.97 million openings, up 142,000 from October. They also hired 4.99 million people.
That ratio of openings to people hired matches some of the highest levels on record (though the data goes back only to 2002). In other words, employers are saying they have a lot more openings, but seem to be having trouble filling those jobs as quickly as historical patterns would suggest. As we have argued before, that suggests they will have to make those jobs more attractive to fill those openings more rapidly, either with higher pay, improved benefits, better working conditions or a combination of these.
The second piece of news is the latest survey from the National Federation of Independent Business. Its members, small businesses around the country, reported the highest level of overall optimism since 2006, and, more to the point, showed that small businesses were expecting to increase worker pay.
The proportion of small businesses planning to increase compensation in the next three months was 17 percentage points higher than those that planned decreases, the widest margin since 2007.
But the most interesting piece of evidence for rising wage pressure was in an announcement by Aetna, the giant health insurer. The company said it would set a minimum hourly pay for its workers at $16 an hour starting in April, which will mean a raise averaging 11 percent for 5,700 claims administrators and other low-level workers. That works out to total earnings of about $33,000 a year for a person working a 40-hour week.
And next year, the company plans to offer a new health benefits program to lower out-of-pocket expenses for low-income workers that the company says could save employees up to $4,000, essentially combining the raise this year with better benefits next year.
The company is counting on the raise to make it easier to retain good employees and recruit for vacant positions. Turnover is expensive for a company like Aetna, as it must attract and retain thousands of workers who are less likely to feel attachment to a job if it offers rock-bottom pay and few benefits.
Aetna's chief executive, Mark T. Bertolini, framed the decision as being about more than dollars and cents, assigning Thomas Piketty's inequality tome "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" as reading to executives and telling The Wall Street Journal that "it's not just about paying people, it's about the whole social compact."
But if the trends we're seeing elsewhere in the data hold up, including those released Tuesday, raising wages could prove to be a sensible decision based purely on business strategy. If job growth continues at its recent pace over the next couple of years, companies that resist raising wages may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, losing their best workers to companies like Aetna that try to get ahead of the curve a bit with pre-emptive raises.
We don't know if that will happen, of course. Maybe the path of job growth will slow as we get closer to full employment. Maybe more of the millions of people no longer in the labor force will enter in larger numbers, holding down wages even longer.
But the flow of news Tuesday presents a coherent, consistent story: Employers have lots of openings they need to fill. Small businesses surveyed expect to raise pay in the coming months. And one giant employer is doing exactly that.
Add it up, and Aetna workers may not be the only ones seeing raises this year.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDBullets were flying in the cities. Crack wars trapped people in their homes. The year was 1994, and President Bill Clinton captured the grim national mood, declaring "gangs and drugs have taken over our streets" as he signed the most far-reaching crime bill in history.
The new law expanded the death penalty, and offered the states billions of dollars to hire more police officers and to build more prisons. But what was not clear at the time was that violent crime had already peaked in the early '90s, starting a decline that has cut the nation's rates of murder, robbery and assault by half.
Perhaps nowhere has the drop been more stunning than in New York City, which reported only 328 homicides for 2014, compared with 2,245 in 1990. The homicide rate in some cities has fluctuated more -- Washington ticked up to 104 in 2014, after a modern low of 88 in 2012. But that still is a drastic fall from a peak of 474 in 1990.
Now, Democrats and Republicans alike are rethinking the vast, costly infrastructure of crime control and incarceration that was born of the earlier crime wave.
"The judicial system has been a critical element in keeping violent criminals off the street," said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who is co-sponsor of a bill to reduce some federal drug sentences. "But now we're stepping back, and I think it's about time, to ask whether the dramatic increase in incarceration was warranted."
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has opposed broad reductions in sentences. But he still agreed, in an interview, that "there are a lot of ideas -- prison reform, policing, sentencing -- being discussed now that wouldn't be if we hadn't had this drop in the crime statistics."
Yet even as law enforcement and the political establishment look toward a new era, the reasons for the broad drop in crime remain elusive. It has confounded both those from the right who had predicted that waves of young predators would terrorize communities and those on the left who watched crime fall even through ups and downs in poverty and unemployment.
There are some areas of consensus. The closing of open-air drug markets drove down shootings in many urban areas. Credit is also given to a revolution in urban policing, in which officers concentrate on crime "hot spots," as small as a block or a bar, that are responsible for outsize mayhem.
The major increases in drug and gun sentences in the 1980s and '90s played some role but only a modest one, most experts say, with soaring incarceration rates bringing diminishing returns while disproportionately hitting minorities.
Various experts have also linked the fall in violence to the aging of the population, low inflation rates and even the decline in early-childhood lead exposure.
But in the end, none of these factors fully explain a drop that occurred, in tandem, in much of the world.
"Canada, with practically none of the policy changes we point to here, had a comparable decline in crime over the same period," said Franklin E. Zimring, a law professor and an expert in criminal justice at the University of California, Berkeley. He described the quest for an explanation as "criminological astrology."
The fall in serious crime was accompanied by declines in other social ills such as teenage pregnancy, child abuse and juvenile delinquency, emphasizing the role of cultural shifts beyond the ken of the justice system.
"Young people are growing up in a safer environment and behaving more responsibly," said Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and co-editor of a 2014 report by the National Academy of Sciences on the consequences of mass incarceration.
Along with uncertainty about the sources of lower crime are contentious debates about what should come next. How far can incarceration be reduced without endangering safety? Where is the proper line between aggressive, preventive policing and intrusive measures that alienate the law-abiding?
The rise in incarceration has been even more striking than the decline in crime, leading to growing agreement on both the right and the left that it has gone too far. From the early 1970s to 2009, mainly because of changes in sentencing, the share of American residents in state or federal prison multiplied fourfold, reaching 1.5 million on any given day, with hundreds of thousands more held in local jails, although the rate has tapered off somewhat since 2009.
The social and economic costs are now the subject of intense study. Some conservatives such as William G. Otis, a former federal prosecutor and adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University, argue that while many factors account for falling crime, harsher justice surely played a significant role.
"When people are incarcerated they are not out on the street to ransack your home or sell drugs to your high school kid," he said.
But many criminologists say the impact has been limited.
"The policy decisions to make long sentences longer and to impose mandatory minimums have had minimal effect on crime," said Mr. Travis, of John Jay College. "The research on this is quite clear."
Higher imprisonment might explain from 10 percent to, at most, 25 percent of the crime drop since the early 1990s, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. But it brought diminishing returns, he said, as those committing less severe crimes also received lengthy sentences.
Many states, led by Republicans as well as by Democrats, have acted to reduce sentences for low-level and nonviolent crimes and to improve drug and other treatment services, while still bringing down crime rates.
In the Congress, figures as varied as Senator Durbin and Republican senators including Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky have supported cuts in federal sentencing.
Police methods entered the spotlight after the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York led to mass protests, followed by the murderous targeting of two officers in New York.
Combined at its best with close public cooperation, the concentration of police resources on crime hot spots has been shown, in several studies, to reduce crime without simply pushing it elsewhere, said Daniel S. Nagin, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University.
Methods used with success in New York City in the mid-1990s under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his police commissioner William J. Bratton have been widely imitated, including the mapping of crime and concentration of forces in trouble spots and use of "CompStat" data and meetings to hold local commanders accountable for crime in their precincts.
John F. Timoney, who was No. 2 in the New York Police Department at the time and later headed police departments in Philadelphia and Miami, said new attention to seemingly minor crimes like public drunkenness and vandalism is also vital.
"It's the quality-of-life issues that dominate community meetings," he said. Pushing street officers to respond, under the so-called broken windows theory, won public support and sometimes headed off more serious criminal behavior, he said.
But some say the tactics too often devolved into overly aggressive policing and the "stop and frisk" policy at the center of controversy in New York, in which officers search young men, mainly black and Hispanic, on little pretext.
In the wake of the police killings of unarmed black men in Missouri and New York, President Obama established a task force of police officials and experts that is expected to recommend increases in community policing, which has declined since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and other changes intended to repair the gulf between law enforcers and minorities as well as improve crime prevention.
Given how poorly trends in crime were foreseen in the past, and the role of deeper social forces, there is no guarantee that crime rates will not rise again.
But there is wide agreement on measures outside the scope of the criminal justice system that could foster further declines or blunt any rise, Dr. Nagin said. Enriching the early childhoods of high-risk children, expanding drug treatment programs and offering more mental health services are prime examples.
"One clearly bad option," Dr. Nagin said, "is turning prisons into substitutes for mental hospitals."
Correction: January 19, 2015, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Wednesday about American officials' rethinking crime control and incarceration in light of a declining crime rate misidentified, in some editions, the university where Daniel S. Nagin, who discussed law enforcement issues, is a criminologist. It is Carnegie Mellon University, not Case Western Reserve University.

Full text:   Employers advertised the most job openings in nearly 14 years in November, the Labor Department said on Tuesday, suggesting that businesses are confident in strong economic growth. Job openings rose 2.9 percent to 4.97 million in November, the most since January 2001. A second report on Tuesday from the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business group, added to the positive outlook, showing that small-business optimism rose in December to its highest level since October 2006. However, a measure of average hourly pay fell in December, according to Friday's monthly jobs report. Wages increased only 1.7 percent in the last year, barely ahead of the 1.3 percent rate of inflation. The two reports "suggest that labor market conditions are even stronger than we previously believed and leaves the slowdown in wage growth looking even odder," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics.

Full text:   Hands down, 2014 was the best year for the labor market since the Great Recession hit in late 2007.
But it would be wrong to simply root for more of the same. Recent progress does not so much point a way forward as highlight weaknesses that need to be corrected and risks that need to be avoided in order not to backslide.
The December employment report, released Friday, showed that 252,000 jobs were added last month, bringing the job creation total for 2014 to nearly three million -- well ahead of tallies from the past seven years. And yet, employment growth still lags population growth by 5.6 million jobs, a gap that will take roughly two years to fill at 2014's average pace of monthly job creation.
Even more disturbing, job growth in December was heavily skewed toward low-wage work. In all, nearly a million of the jobs created in 2014 -- a third of the total -- were in low-wage sectors, including retail, restaurants, bars and hotels, temporary work services, home health care and nursing homes.
Poor job quality is one of the reasons that wage growth has been relentlessly sluggish. Last November's unexpectedly large wage increase was revised down in the December report, which also showed average hourly wages declining last month by 5 cents. Over all, wages rose a mere 1.7 percent in 2014, barely outpacing inflation.
Clearly then, the economy needs faster job growth, better jobs and higher pay. But how? President Obama will lay out economic policy prescriptions in his State of the Union speech later this month, and Republican leaders will have their own ideas, which will, one hopes, go beyond saying no to Mr. Obama and calling for tax cuts.
Still, given longstanding partisan divisions, what politicians don't do may prove to be more important than what they do. The new Republican majority in Congress, for instance, has to avoid the temptation to turn basic acts of governance -- replenishing the Highway Trust Fund (before its depletion in May), raising the federal debt limit (probably in late summer) and passing a budget (next fall) -- into serial fiscal crises. As the economist Jared Bernstein recently noted, a big reason the labor market improved last year is that the fiscal austerity and budget battles that hurt growth in 2013 no longer exerted a drag on growth in 2014.
The Federal Reserve can help the labor market by delaying any interest rate increase until clear signs of inflationary pressure emerge in wages and prices. For now, the Fed is projecting steadily higher inflation as the labor market improves and oil prices rise, a scenario that suggests rate increases sooner rather than later. But the Fed could be wrong. The labor market could remain stuck in a low-wage rut while the effects of low oil prices -- including a stronger dollar and global economic weakness -- dent what growth there has been in manufacturing and other higher-paying sectors. A premature rate hike would make that bad situation much worse.
It would be great to bolster low-wage jobs with a higher federal minimum wage in 2015 and to foster middle-class jobs with robust infrastructure spending, increased support for public employment and enhanced protections for collective bargaining. At the very least, however, it is imperative not to undo the progress to date with reactionary politics and erroneous policy.

Full text:   GOOD news! Oil prices have dropped through the floor.
Or is it bad news?
That depends entirely on whose news you're talking about.
For most of us, the most immediate impact of the price of a barrel of crude dipping below $50 is lower prices at the fuel pump. It wasn't long ago that I paid more than $3.50 a gallon to gas up; during my visit to Texas over the holidays, I marveled at a gas-station receipt for $1.96 a gallon. I'm thinking of having it framed. Or maybe bronzed.
I'm getting a little teary here.
Today's prices made filling up the tank -- a big tank, because the rental agency upgraded me to an S.U.V. from the more economical car I'd asked for -- something close to a tawdry thrill.
But great as that was for me, cheap oil isn't good for everybody. For example, it's part of what sent the Russian ruble into a tailspin. That, in turn, is bad news for Vladimir V. Putin. (Which many people would see as good news -- a problem he can't fix by jailing somebody or taking off his shirt. But I digress.) Many nations and states balance their budgets on oil revenue, and, closer to home, many stock portfolios invest heavily in the energy sector.
Tracking the pros and the cons of falling energy prices can give you a bad case of whiplash. For example, damage to energy industries' prospects is good news to those who want to see us move away from investment in fossil fuels and hope to curb climate change. Yet low oil prices make renewable energy sources like solar and wind less attractive financially, making it harder to curb climate change.
On the other hand, the lower prices could also allow the government to finally raise the gas tax. After all, this tax finances highway construction, and it hasn't been raised for two decades. But -- ha-ha! -- who am I kidding? We don't raise taxes in this country.
Oh, it's good to laugh.
Anyway, the situation may lead consumers to spend more, adding power to the economy. After all, cheaper gas prices can put hundreds of dollars a year into a family's pockets. But if that happens, we could get inflation.
It's good! It's bad! Who knows?
The strangest effect of low energy prices is that for every dollar off the cost of a barrel of oil, American consumers seem to lose an I.Q. point. We turn away from economical, fuel-saving cars and go back to our beloved gas guzzlers, as if we believe low prices will last forever. That is the triumph of hope over experience.
Still, it can be liberating, throwing caution and common sense to the wind. It may be time for me to finally abandon gas sippers like the Smart and the Honda Civic and to buy the cars I've hankered for as part of my American birthright. So I've been looking into used Hummers. They make a real statement: A 2003 version of the humongous H2 was once said to get just 10 miles per gallon in the city.
G.M. announced in 2010 that it was discontinuing the brand -- another sign that car companies are underestimating the guzzle lust of the American consumer. Even discontinued, Hummers have returned! The Washington Post reported that sales of used Hummers and other beasts have jumped as gas prices have fallen.
I could buy something even bigger -- say, the kind of tour bus that rock stars use, with lavish quarters in the back for sleeping and partying. I missed my chance last year to buy one of Willie Nelson's old "Honeysuckle Rose" buses, which sold for $80,000 -- a steal, considering that you might get a contact high from the leftover pot smoke wafting out of the old upholstery.
But why settle for secondhand when I could buy something new? The Bugatti Veyron gets about eight miles a gallon in the city. At almost $2 million, however, it's out of even my imagination's price range. Instead, I could spring for a four-wheel drive Cadillac Escalade, some models of which get 14 m.p.g. in the city; starting at less than $77,000, they are so much more reasonable.
I could pay for one of those instead of, say, sending my youngest to college. After all, don't I deserve the best? And if we're not going to fix our highways or the environment, what kind of future is he going to have, anyway?
Here's the problem, though. Once I start, I can't stop. Why settle for a ho-hum Hummer when, if I really want to impress the neighbors, I can buy an actual military armored transport vehicle?
I spent time in Ferguson, Mo., last year, and let me tell you that nothing quite makes an impression like an MRAP -- a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle -- grinding its way down a city street. Yes, these monsters cost the military hundreds of thousands of dollars. But local police departments and school districts have gotten them for a few thousand bucks each -- less than I paid for my Smart car -- or even free. I'd probably have to claim to be a police department to get a good deal, but with all the money saved on gas, I can hire lawyers who can convince the government of anything.
And these vehicles are a prudent choice: There's probably plenty of room in back for those big packages of toilet paper from Costco.
CLEARLY, there is money to be made from this thinking. I am not the only stupid person out there. I am not even a leading indicator of stupidity. If I want to consume conspicuously, plenty of others must be ready to consume not just conspicuously, but also flagrantly, even idiotically. Smart guys can profit from the excess of others.
Sure, you could be boring and look into energy mutual funds, on the assumption that things will turn up again sometime. But isn't it better to bet on guzzling and consumption -- to create a portfolio based on big honking vehicles and wretched excess?
Wall Street, this is your métier. Nobody knows excess like y'all do. Will you step up? Everybody talks about trying to get in on the smart money. But there have got to be even bigger profits on betting dumb.
This won't last. We've all been here before, and know that what goes down will go up again. But until it does, let's party -- and profit.

Abstract: Others include more exotic offerings like commodities, hedge funds, private equity and direct investments in real estate. The diversity of T.D.F. investment approaches reflects differences in philosophies among investment companies, said Christopher L. Jones, chief investment officer at Financial Engines, a company in Sunnyvale, Calif., that advises participants in 401(k) plans and similar retirement accounts.

Full text:   Deborah L. Lemmerman, vice president for human resources at Hebrew SeniorLife in Boston, believes in the benefits of target-date retirement funds. Over the last 15 years, in her current post and in previous ones, she has seen employees embrace these investments.
At Hebrew SeniorLife, a nonprofit organization providing housing and health care for the elderly, about 30 percent of the assets in its retirement plan are invested in such funds. Ms. Lemmerman also invests in target-date funds herself.
The reason for this popularity? Simplicity, she said.
Employees just pick a fund based on their expected retirement year; typically, the funds are offered in five- or 10-year increments: 2015, 2020, 2025 and so forth. The fund's manager then adjusts the underlying investments as that year approaches, typically decreasing the portion of stocks and increasing the portion of bonds and other kinds of investments.
As an adage in the mutual fund industry goes, a shareholder in a target-date fund can just set it and forget it.
But while the ease is appealing, it can obscure complexities and risks, investment experts say. Target-date funds can allocate their customers' retirement savings to a sometimes bewildering array of securities and use a variety of investing strategies and glide paths, as the gradual asset allocations are known. Overlooking that diversity is like ignoring the differences among a beagle, a bloodhound and a bull mastiff.
"Target-date funds are conceptually simple, but there are few constraints on how they have to be designed, so you end up with lots of different approaches," said Jonathan M. Reuter, a finance professor at Boston College's Carroll School of Management. "There has been a movement, for example, by firms to broaden what it means to invest in equities. Some companies' definitions have expanded to include commodities as well as real estate and emerging-market equities. And managers, in taking that broader view, are often adding risk to the portfolios."
In a recent study of target-date funds, or T.D.F.s, Professor Reuter and another Boston College professor, Pierluigi Balduzzi, documented a wide range of returns and risks across funds intended for people retiring the same year.
In 2008, for example, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell by 38.5 percent, an Oppenheimer fund designed for 2010 retirees fell by 41 percent, while a 2010 Wells Fargo fund lost only 11 percent. (Full disclosure: I'm a part-time adjunct professor at Boston College.)
The professors attributed their findings partly to efforts by newer funds to distinguish themselves in a crowded market. Some funds bet more heavily on riskier fare, such as investments in stocks of small-capitalization companies and emerging markets, they said.
"If regulators had assumed that T.D.F.s with the same target date would provide investors with the same exposure to risk, they were mistaken," the scholars wrote.
Target-date funds can be hard for nonprofessionals to evaluate, Professor Reuter said. Typically, one would be structured as a fund of funds -- that is, a fund that invests in a group of underlying funds. So, to assess one, you also have to examine its component funds.
In general, T.D.F.s based on index funds, rather than actively managed funds, are less risky, he said. Likewise, cheaper funds also tend to be have lower risk. "More expensive T.D.F.s tend to invest in more expensive underlying active funds, which tend to focus on riskier asset classes," he said.
Consumers certainly have plenty of options -- and plenty of investment approaches -- to choose among. A recent Morningstar report on the sector included 36 fund companies.
Some target-date funds, like those offered by Vanguard, invest passively, trying to replicate the broad stock and bond markets' returns. Others, like those offered by T. Rowe Price and American Funds, invest actively
Some funds stick mostly with stocks, bonds and cash. Others include more exotic offerings like commodities, hedge funds, private equity and direct investments in real estate.
The diversity of T.D.F. investment approaches reflects differences in philosophies among investment companies, said Christopher L. Jones, chief investment officer at Financial Engines, a company in Sunnyvale, Calif., that advises participants in 401(k) plans and similar retirement accounts. (Financial Engines is retained both by employers and investment companies that administer retirement plans. Its clients include Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Vanguard.)
A greater variety of securities isn't necessarily better, Mr. Jones cautioned. "Most individuals don't need additional exposure to commodities and real estate," he said. A "lot of these more esoteric investments just add cost without adding significant benefits."
Managers of funds that invest in less-common sorts of securities offer a different view. Their reasoning tends to boil down to a single word: diversification. By spreading their bets more broadly, they say, they better insulate their funds from losses in any particular asset class.
Vineer Bhansali, a managing director at Pimco who oversees the company's target-date funds, said his company includes commodities in its T.D.F.s because they tend to perform well during periods of high inflation, while stocks and bonds don't. Thus the Pimco RealRetirement 2015 fund had invested 2 percent of its assets in commodities at midyear 2014 and can invest as much as 10 percent in them.
Pimco's funds also typically include smaller allocations of stocks and bigger ones of bonds than the typical target-date fund, according to Mr. Bhansali. Many funds invest too much in stocks and so expose their customers to the possibility of big losses when the stock market sinks, he said.
"We're trying to provide protection against shocks and high inflation," he said. Over the three years through 2014, Pimco's 2015 fund returned an annualized average of 4.55 percent, compared with an annualized average of 7.54 percent for its average Morningstar peer.
The managers at Manning & Napier can use an even more unusual security: single-stock options, a kind of derivative. They do this to try to earn extra return for their shareholders, said Jeffrey S. Coons, the company's president and co-director of research.
If you're investing in stocks, as the fund managers at Manning & Napier also do, you have to determine prices at which you're willing to buy and sell, he said. Incorporating stock options is similar: You're just selling someone else the right to buy a stock from you, or sell it to you, at a particular price. When an option pays off, "you're earning an additional premium to something you'd be doing anyway," he said.
At the end of November 2014, alternative strategies like options writing accounted for about 4 percent of the assets invested in Manning & Napier Target 2015 Series fund. The K shares of the fund, which began in 2012, returned 3.54 percent last year, compared with 4.89 percent for its average Morningstar peer.
Even more varied in their investment approaches are T.D.F.s offered by Principal Funds. Their managers' menu of choices includes timber, infrastructure, master limited partnerships that invest in oil drillers and transporters, and long-short strategies. Such a big tool kit gives the potential for protection in a greater variety of market and economic environments, said Jeffrey R. Tyler, a Principal vice president and portfolio manager.
As people get close to retirement, for example, they tend to worry more about inflation eating away at their savings. "So you want to manage against inflation risk, and we use real assets like timber to provide that," Mr. Tyler said.
More complicated approaches, however, tend to bring higher costs. The retail share classes of Pimco's, Manning & Napier's and Principal's target-date funds carry expense ratios above 1 percent; by comparison, the Fidelity Freedom Index funds have a ratio of just 0.16 percent, The average asset-weighted expense ratio in Morningstar's recent report was 0.84 percent.
"Generally, the rule is cheaper is better," said Janet Yang, Morningstar's director of multiasset strategies. "Fees are the aspect of your performance that you can control."
In 2006, Congress passed a law that enabled target-date funds to become default investment options in employee-directed retirement accounts like 401(k) plans. The funds have surged in popularity since. Morningstar's report found that in 2013, T.D.F.s accounted for a third of new assets flowing into the mutual funds of companies offering them.
Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Vanguard together control three-quarters of the assets in target-date funds, Morningstar said.
The offerings range from Vanguard's straight-ahead simplicity -- its T.D.F.s invest in five of its index funds -- to Fidelity's host of options. Fidelity T.D.F.s can invest in more than 20 Fidelity funds, including commodity and emerging-market debt offerings.
In 2012, Vallapuzha Sandhya wrote her dissertation at Georgia State University on target-date funds. Today, she follows them as a researcher for Financial Engines. She said she feared that the default rule, combined with the set-it-and-forget-it nature of T.D.F.s, might have made investing in them too easy and lulled people into ignoring the risks.
"A T.D.F. can do a lot of work for you," Ms. Sandhya said, "but you can't rely on it blindly."
MS. LEMMERMAN at Hebrew SeniorLife agreed but said that, at least in retirement plans, investors should be getting help from their employers. A plan sponsor is supposed to vet any investment before making it one of its retirement-plan options.
She also said she had seen an unexpected benefit of target-date funds through her own investing: Her Vanguard funds had helped her to become more patient with her retirement money, particularly during the stock market's plunge in 2008.
"I didn't touch my target-date funds then," she said. "I knew that I was in them for the long run and that professionals were deciding how to invest for me. Where I do give more input, with my other investments, I was more concerned. I stopped putting money into equities for a while, but I left the target-date funds alone."

Abstract: Crude oil prices plunged 41.4 percent for the quarter, to end the year at a five-year low after several large producers, first Saudi Arabia and then other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, indicated that they had no intention of curbing production to prop up prices. Vigorous central bank support should benefit European and Asian markets, in his view, and the Fed's withdrawal shows that American growth is back on track, although he, too, advised investors not to expect a smooth ride.

Full text:   Stocks ended the fourth quarter of 2014 near record highs, but they traveled a circuitous route to get there -- falling, then soaring, then falling again before making a strong late run. Bonds went in either direction, depending on the quality of the vehicle used for the trip. And in the quarter's biggest surprise, oil headed due south.
Crude oil prices plunged 41.4 percent for the quarter, to end the year at a five-year low after several large producers, first Saudi Arabia and then other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, indicated that they had no intention of curbing production to prop up prices. The move was a reminder of how powerful market forces and the law of supply and demand can be.
The Econ 101 refresher course was well timed, nearly coinciding with another significant event: The Federal Reserve signaled to the markets that it would wean them off the stimulus that had helped support them for several years. The central bank suspended its program of bond purchases, or quantitative easing, in October and hinted last month that it would let short-term interest rates rise by midyear.
The stock market took the policy changes and oil price decline in stride. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished 2014 at 2,058.90, up 4.4 percent for the quarter and 11.4 percent for the year.
The rally helped the average domestic stock fund tracked by Morningstar to rise 4.3 percent in the quarter, but most other broad stock fund categories declined. The average international stock fund fell 2 percent, pulled down by losses of 2.7 percent for portfolios that focus on Europe and 2.3 percent for Asia funds. Diversified emerging-market funds were down 4.9 percent, on average.
The declines were attributable partly to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of assets denominated in other currencies. Foreign stock markets did not perform well enough to make up for the weakness in other currencies.
Domestic funds were more the exception than the rule for another reason: The United States is seen to stand apart when it comes to economic progress and central bank policies. The American economy has displayed unusual strength, including an upward revision of third-quarter economic growth to a 5 percent annual rate, and the Fed is looking to tighten credit.
Japanese and Chinese authorities, by contrast, responded to persistent sluggishness by accelerating bond purchase programs in the fourth quarter or by taking other extraordinary measures. The European Central Bank is expected to follow suit, since the region's economy remains weak.
The United States may be strong enough to support the global economy, some investment advisers say. But it's also possible that other regions may be so weak that they will drag down the American economy with them.
"When we look ahead to 2015, one thing that seems likely is that it's not going to be steady as she goes," said Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at GMO, an investment management firm. "The world is going to go one way or the other."
Investors trying to determine which way things will break will receive little guidance from the sharp drop in oil prices, Mr. Inker added. It's a portentous event for the global economy, but it's hard to know what it portends.
Cheaper oil "has got to be a good thing, net, for most of the developed world and a fair chunk of the emerging world," he said. But if the decline hints at a deceleration of growth and broader deflation, he warned, "we're going to look back and say that the global economy came unstuck in the second half of 2014, but we didn't realize it."
Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors, is more optimistic. Vigorous central bank support should benefit European and Asian markets, in his view, and the Fed's withdrawal shows that American growth is back on track, although he, too, advised investors not to expect a smooth ride.
"With the U.S. economy still healthy and the eurozone and Japan likely to exceed low economic expectations," Mr. Baur said, "we'd suggest overweighting each area's equities in one's global portfolio and underweighting the rest of the world." That would mean emerging markets, which he warned "face significant headwinds in 2015 with tighter Fed policy, a stronger dollar, a slower-growing Chinese economy and local financial stress and squeezed profits."
His outlook isn't ideal for the United States, either, in the short run. American stocks could suffer a 15 percent correction early in the year as investors adjust to a less generous Fed, he warned, before bouncing back to end 2015 with a net return in the high single digits.
Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families, encourages staying big and local.
"We're still overweight the U.S., with the bulk of exposure in large-capitalization stocks," she said. "We don't think the dollar rally is over, and to the degree that you get a rally in Europe, you're going to lose out on the currency. The surprise in 2015 might be not more dollar strength but the degree of dollar strength."
The dollar has been especially strong against the Japanese yen, one reason behind the bullish stance that John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, has toward Japan's economy and stock market. He says corporate profits are benefiting from the Bank of Japan's weak-yen policy and from Abenomics, measures to stimulate the economy introduced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
"Abenomics has been a miracle for the corporate sector," Mr. Vail said. "Taxes have been cut, and profit margins" are rising rapidly, "higher than in 1988."
The resurgence may have escaped notice because the yen's decline has limited the rise in Japanese stock prices when expressed in dollars, but Mr. Vail expects the exchange rate to stabilize while profits and stocks will keep rising, creating a sweet spot for investors.
Asian stocks in general "have a greater deal to offer" than American ones, as Mr. Vail sees it. He says South Korea, in particular, is "moving in the right direction."
The belief that the Fed will raise interest rates helps account for the dollar's strength against the yen and other currencies. But Komal S. Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an investment consulting firm, wouldn't count on a Fed rate increase anytime soon or on the economy, in the United States or elsewhere, displaying robust growth.
"I said there wouldn't be an increase in interest rates in 2014 when the consensus was that the Fed would hike, and they won't hike this year, either," he predicted.
To show why it won't need or want to, he highlighted extremely low government bond yields worldwide, which imply that investors foresee almost no inflation for several years. He also pointed to recent weakness in the junk-bond market as a warning for the global economy. Yields have risen on the debt of riskier issuers, especially energy companies suddenly facing lower revenue. "If we have a series of defaults in the energy sector, there could be spillover effects elsewhere," Mr. Sri-Kumar said.
Fourth-quarter fund results indicate a flight to safety by bond investors. Funds that hold long-term government issues rose a robust 8.8 percent, but declines in high-yield and emerging-market portfolios left the average bond fund nursing a loss of 0.1 percent.
European government bond yields could continue to fall if the European Central Bank picks up where the Fed left off and introduces a bond-purchasing program early this year.
"The eurozone requires a weaker euro for many countries to regain competitiveness, so the E.C.B. is going to start purchasing sovereign paper in the first quarter," Mr. Sri-Kumar said. "There should be one more burst of yield decline."
Mr. Inker likewise foresees quantitative easing "as a possible way to reduce some of the real strain in Europe." He acknowledged, however, that a new source of strain -- a familiar one, really -- has emerged.
The Greek Parliament was dissolved in late December after the ruling party lost a crucial vote. That party backs the austerity program introduced in 2012 as a condition for the debt bailout that kept the country in the eurozone. A general election will be held on Jan. 25, with voters expected to back a coalition led by a party that wants to renegotiate the bailout terms, something that Germany and other large European Union members would probably resist.
"This could get kind of scary," Mr. Inker said. "Fringe parties are getting significant support throughout Europe. If they kick out the elites, it's not clear what happens."
Whatever impact central bank policies have on the real world, they have worked wonders for the markets. Mr. Sri-Kumar questioned how much more bang the bankers could get for their trillions of bucks.
"They've carried the distortion as far as it can go," he said. "Central banks may lose the ability to keep postponing the inevitable through increasing the money supply. If we had normal interest rates, stock and bond prices wouldn't be where they are."
He encourages staying in United States Treasury bonds, which he expects to rally, with 10-year yields falling to 1.75 percent from their year-end level of 2.17 percent. European government debt should do well too, in his opinion, but American investors could lose money if the euro continues to drop. As for stocks, he would stick to the safest sectors, including consumer staples, utilities and health care.
Mr. Inker agreed that investors should be "somewhat more conservatively positioned than normal." With American stock and bond prices so high, that means looking abroad, especially to the developing world. But he acknowledged a conundrum: While foreign markets are cheaper, their economies appear more fragile, so it's hard to know which direction to take.
"You can either have scary stuff that's cheap," he said, "or stuff that allows you to sleep at night but where it's hard to see how you'll get much return on it."

Full text:   Gasoline prices have fallen more than 40 percent since the end of June thanks to the collapse of global oil prices. That makes this the perfect time for Congress to overcome its longstanding terror of offending the nation's motorists and raise the tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. The results could only be beneficial: for the nation's roads, bridges and transit systems, which badly need repair; for the budget; and, to the extent that higher taxes encourage greater fuel efficiency, for the climate.
The federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon on gas and 24.4 cents on diesel has not been increased since 1993. That has severely shortchanged the Highway Trust Fund, which is expected to run out of money in May if Congress does not transfer more into it or raise fuel taxes. If the federal tax on gasoline had simply kept up with inflation, it would be 30 cents today.
There is little doubt that the nation's road and transit systems could use more help. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave them a nearly failing grade of D in 2013; the state of bridges is somewhat better, earning a C-plus. The country's inadequate road and transit systems cost it billions through increased delays, extra fuel costs and auto repair bills. Poor road conditions are also said to play a significant factor in about one-third of all traffic fatalities, or about 10,000 deaths a year.
Some lawmakers, including some Republicans, are concerned enough about these trends to discuss an increase in fuel taxes. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, has proposed increasing the tax, and Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and a big supporter of the energy industry, has said he is willing to consider it. Some state leaders are also considering raising their own fuel taxes. Lawmakers in Michigan have put a gas tax increase on the ballot for a May election, and Iowa lawmakers are also talking about a higher tax.
The Obama administration has not thrown its support behind an increase because it is afraid, it seems, of political blowback. A White House spokesman said last week that the administration would prefer to find the money for roads, bridges, transit and other public works by closing corporate tax loopholes. That approach would require a much larger compromise with Republicans on tax policy, which seems unlikely. More important, it would not create the kind of dedicated and ongoing source of revenue the country's transportation system needs.
A modest increase in the gas tax phased in over a few months or a year would hardly be noticeable to most Americans, especially now that drivers have seen the cost of gasoline fall so much and so quickly -- although some way should be found to offset the tax increase for low-income Americans, who would suffer most. The average retail price of gasoline in the United States was $2.308 a gallon for the week ended Jan. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration; that is down from $3.778 at the end of June. The E.I.A. estimates that the average American household will spend $550 less on gas this year compared with 2014.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that Congress would have to raise fuel taxes by between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon to meet all of the obligations of the Highway Trust Fund. If lawmakers went with a 15-cent hike, that would add just $3 to the cost of a 20-gallon fill-up once the increase was fully phased in. To put that into context, Americans are saving nearly $30 on average for every 20 gallons of gas they buy thanks to the drop in oil prices. That is a small price to pay for better roads, bridges and transit systems.

Full text:   Investing in rapidly developing economies is an inherently risky proposition. That is why more than a decade ago, investors embraced what seemed a prudent approach: focusing on the BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- which have the largest and most liquid stock markets in the emerging-market world.
Late last year, though, the BRIC strategy hit a wall as a worrisome series of developments unfolded.
First, as the Chinese economy continued to decelerate, global growth expectations dropped, pushing down commodity prices. Then crude oil fell more than 40 percent in the fourth quarter, dropping below $50 last week.
As a result, share values tumbled for mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest in markets closely dependent on oil and other commodities. The iShares MSCI Brazil Capped E.T.F., for instance, fell by about 15 percent in the fourth quarter, while the iShares MSCI Russia Capped E.T.F. was down by more than 30 percent. That put pressure on BRIC-oriented funds in general, which sank 7 percent last year, more than double the loss experienced by the broader emerging markets.
"The heyday of the BRICs -- that's over," said Arjun Jayaraman, head of quantitative research at Causeway Capital Management in Los Angeles.
Mr. Jayaraman said that back in the 2000s, the BRIC markets represented opportunities driven by the so-called commodity supercycle. That was when rapid growth in countries like China and India drove up demand for natural resources, turbocharging the fortunes of developing nations that were big exporters of raw materials. Among the winners were Russia and Latin America, including Brazil.
In general, strong growth shored up emerging-market currencies, improved the financial standing of developing nations and raised corporate profits in these regions. That virtuous cycle, though, has now morphed into a more vicious one.
"China was a real locomotive for the commodity-exporting countries in the emerging world," noted Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS. But with that engine slowing considerably, those commodity-producing nations "don't face quite as clear a future as they once did."
That's why investors can no longer focus merely on the biggest markets or even just the commodity-producing nations.
"When the old BRIC theme was going full throttle, it lifted the boats of countries that supplied into that commodity story," said Henrik Strabo, head of international investments at Rainier Investment Management in Seattle. "But now you're seeing a divergence in the emerging markets, and you have to be very selective."
Investors should start by focusing on countries that are net importers of oil and other commodities, money managers say. Falling energy costs are expected to bolster profits of companies based in those markets, and households should benefit because consumers will have more money to spend on discretionary items. Government budgets are also likely to get some help, Mr. Strabo said.
India is a prime example. "India is far and away the best macroeconomic story among the major emerging markets," said Lewis Kaufman, manager of the Thornburg Developing World fund. With oil and commodity prices sinking, that story is likely to become better.
Unlike China, which has excess capacity in major sectors of its economy, India is only now embarking on major infrastructure initiatives, just as prices on steel, copper and other commodities are weaker than they have been in several years.
What's more, India is the world's third-biggest importer of oil. "As oil prices have fallen, that has helped lower India's current account deficit to under 2 percent of G.D.P.," Mr. Kaufman said. Concerns about inflation have eased while the government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been able to reduce fuel subsidies without hurting economic growth.
One way to tell which economies are more fundamentally sound is to look at the volatile currency markets.
For much of the past decade, the currencies of developing nations enjoyed relative strength, as these countries' economies were growing faster than those of the United States and Europe while also being less mired in debt. But as global economic risks have risen, investors have begun shifting out of emerging-market currencies and into the United States dollar.
Consider Russia, where it now takes twice as many rubles to buy $1 as it did a year ago. Not only has this hurt Russian consumers, but it also forced the country's central bank to raise interest rates sharply last month, to 17 percent from 10.5 percent, to protect the currency.
If other central banks in the emerging-market world followed Russia's lead, the higher rates could further brake economies that were already slowing.
"We are entering a period of rising rates, so people need to gravitate toward the stronger currencies and countries that are running current-account and fiscal surpluses," said Mr. Jayaraman at Causeway, adding that he liked Taiwan and South Korea for that reason. At the same time, he said investors should be careful with Russia, Turkey and possibly Brazil.
What are other economic signs to look for?
"You want to see a vibrant consumer that's benefiting from what's happening" in countries with strong finances and therefore relatively stable currencies, said Michael Kass, manager of the Baron Emerging Markets fund. In addition to India, Mr. Kass cited the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan as examples.
Edward A. Gray, co-manager of the Delaware International Value Equity fund, also thought that the Philippines and India looked attractive. But, he said, "we're not gung-ho to increase our emerging-market exposure right away."
Mr. Gray noted that years of cheap credit had sent money pouring into the developing world, making some of these countries vulnerable to turbulence now. "It's still an awfully troublesome time for this part of the world," he said.

Abstract: Robust job growth and the lowest unemployment rate since June 2008 suggest a rapidly improving economy, possibly persuading the Fed that it should move sooner rather than later to raise rates to lessen the risk of speculative bubbles or future inflation.

Full text:   The nation's economy is entering 2015 in its best shape since the recession, but the improving job market has so far failed to help most Americans earn significantly more at work.
On Friday, the Labor Department reported that employers added another 252,000 workers to their payrolls in December, capping a year in which total employment rose by 2.95 million, the largest advance since 1999.
The unemployment rate also improved, edging down last month to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent in November. The rate plunged just over a full percentage point between 2013 and 2014, the largest decline since 1984.
But a drop in average hourly earnings last month, after a healthy gain in November, sidetracked hopes that a tighter labor market was beginning to lead to broader wage gains.
"The rising tide of this economic wind at our back has to lift more boats," Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez said in a telephone interview. The nation's wage situation, he said, is a crucial part of the "unfinished business" of the nation's economic recovery, which began around the middle of 2009.
Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said the decline in wages came despite December gains in construction and health care jobs and other jobs that typically offered good salaries.
"This is still a buyer's market in terms of labor," she said. "For all the good news on unemployment and the number of jobs we've created, if these wage numbers are to be believed, employers still have their pick."
For the Federal Reserve, the mixed message from the jobs reports makes the timing of its first interest rate increase in years more problematic. Robust job growth and the lowest unemployment rate since June 2008 suggest a rapidly improving economy, possibly persuading the Fed that it should move sooner rather than later to raise rates to lessen the risk of speculative bubbles or future inflation.
"If the activity data continue to improve, as we expect," Paul Dales, a senior economist for Capital Economics, said in a note to clients, "then the Fed may not wait for wage growth to rise and could still raise rates as soon as March."
Yet as long as wages lag and ordinary Americans are not enjoying much of the fruits of an improving economy, the Fed should stand pat, many economists say.
"The economy clearly has no wage or price pressures that would point towards an early liftoff on interest rates," Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote in a blog post.
William Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said he worried that the Fed would raise interest rates too soon, hurting small businesses that could hire more workers as long as they maintained ready access to low-interest loans.
"We need a financial environment where that can take place," he said. "If that gets interrupted, hiring is going to get choked off too early."
Still, economic prospects are clearly improving. Even in the absence of better wage gains, declining oil prices may help bolster purchasing power. One economist likened the lower prices to the equivalent of a pay raise of about $1,000 a person for the year, if prices stay low.
The drop in oil prices represents a substantial transfer of income from oil producers to oil consumers, said Kevin Logan, a chief economist for HSBC Bank. While some American oil producers are shutting unprofitable rigs and planning job cuts that could damage oil- and shale-producing regions like Louisiana and North Dakota, the overall economic effect for the nation is positive.
"Every dollar gained is a dollar lost, but the benefits are widespread and the losses are concentrated and will be small," Mr. Logan said.
There are other encouraging signs that the recovery is on solid footing.
"At the current pace of job growth, the economy should be closing in on a 5 percent unemployment rate by this time next year, which is consistent with full employment," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "Wage growth should also pick up more broadly in coming months."
Better, higher-paying jobs are already are being created. Business and professional services have been adding jobs in recent months, though last month many were in the lower-paying administrative category.
Hiring has been vigorous in the health care industry, and last month construction jobs increased. Manufacturing job growth has more than doubled to 16,000 a month in the last year, and those jobs generally have an average weekly paycheck about $170 higher than other private sector jobs, Jason Furman, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a blog post.
Mr. Furman said the estimated 0.7 percent increase in real earnings in 2014 is a bit higher than the average annual increase of 0.5 percent from 2000 through 2007, the period of the last expansion. He calculated the figures using the Consumer Price Index inflationary measures through November, as well as consensus projections for December.
"But there is more work to be done to raise wages and address longer-standing challenges around family incomes," Mr. Furman said.
In addition to December's new jobs, the number of jobs created in November was revised upward to 353,000 from 321,000.
Overall job growth last year averaged 246,000 a month, after 194,000 a month in 2013.
But more than eight million workers are still looking for full-time employment, while many others have reluctantly accepted part-time work. The share of men in their prime working years who are not working has more than tripled since the 1960s. Long-term unemployment remains highly elevated, and the work force participation rate, already at historically low levels, slipped in December.
Eventually, better wages should draw more people to the working world, said the American Action Forum, which summed up Friday's economic data as, "Job, No Money."
"A strong labor market attracts people to participate and pays them rising wages," the right-leaning policy group said in a release. "It is hard to say the labor market is strong despite the robust top-line numbers. The U.S. economy is healing, but not yet healthy."
The frustration over wages was evident despite the other positive indicators.
"The good news is that in 2014, people were increasingly finding jobs," said Elise Gould, a senior economist for the Economic Policy Institute, in a statement. "The bad news is that we are still digging our way out of the recession, and wage growth remains stagnant and untouched by recovery."
Even as the economic recovery advances toward its sixth anniversary with a strong tailwind, it faces several hurdles. The strong dollar -- at its highest point in years -- is hailed by many as a sign of America's improving economic conditions. But the dollar's strength comes with consequences. American manufacturers may lose their competitive edge as the stronger dollar makes their goods more expensive compared to those from other countries. Demand for American products could wane, and exports over all could suffer.
Another potential threat for the United States is the overall weakness in the global economy. Europe's economy is stagnant, China's is slowing and Japan's is struggling to emerge from a recent downturn.
"There's a risk we could see slower job growth if much of the world goes into recession," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide. "It's unlikely, but there's a chance."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's bond-buying campaign continues to produce one clear benefit: a windfall for taxpayers.
The Fed, which turns over most of its profits to the Treasury Department, said on Friday that last year, it transferred an estimated $98.7 billion, a record. The Fed's profits have been large enough to significantly restrain the growth of the federal debt, cutting aggregate deficits by about 8 percent since 2010.
But the good times are drawing to a close. The Fed's earnings will decrease as it raises its benchmark interest rate, a process that Fed officials say they are likely to begin later this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that the Fed's annual transfers could reach a low point of just $8 billion in 2018.
The Fed did not buy the bonds to make money. It has amassed more than $4 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to stimulate economic growth by holding down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The Fed says the campaign has helped people buy cars and refinance mortgages. Some independent experts, however, see scant evidence of an economic lift.
The purchases are undoubtedly lucrative, in large part because the Fed pays for the bonds with money that it creates, rather like a restaurant with the unusual power to create hamburgers from nothing. As a result, the interest payments on those bonds are very nearly pure profit, which the central bank is required by law to remit to the Treasury Department after subtracting its operating expenses.
The Fed has sent Treasury $421 billion over the last five years.
The Fed's portfolio consists of government debt -- Treasury securities and mortgage bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- so the Fed is effectively refunding interest payments, reducing federal borrowing costs.
Over the next several years, the Fed's expenses are likely to rise.
Last year, the Fed spent about $4.9 billion on its own operations and provided $563 million in funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which assumed some of the Fed's regulatory responsibilities after the financial crisis.
The Fed also paid banks about $6.9 billion in interest on deposits they keep with the central bank. And as the Fed retreats from its stimulus campaign by raising its benchmark interest rates, it plans to sharply increase those payments.
Banks must maintain reserve accounts with the Fed in proportion to their outstanding loans and other assets, but they earn interest on any excess. Those excess reserves have ballooned as the Fed has bought bonds from the banks because the Fed's payments have significantly outpaced lending growth.
As it begins to raise its benchmark interest rate, the Fed plans to increase those payments as a check on lending growth. When a bank makes a loan, some of its excess reserves become mandatory reserves, reducing revenue. So banks will make loans only if the likely return exceeds the lost income from the Fed.
In effect, the Fed plans to build a dam between the money that it has created to buy bonds and the rest of the money that circulates through the economy.
Fed officials have repeatedly expressed confidence that the dam will hold, but the strategy is untested -- Congress only granted the Fed authority to pay interest on excess reserves in 2008 -- and some critics see a danger of flooding. They warn that the Fed may fail to check loan growth, leading to runaway inflation.
"As the economy grows, the massive amount of money sitting on the sidelines will be activated; the velocity of money will accelerate," Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in a speech last year. "If it does so too quickly, we might create inflation or financial market instability or both."
Comparing the Fed's challenge to the proverbial difficulty of passing a camel through the eye of a needle, Mr. Fisher said, "The eye of the needle of pulling off a clean exit is narrow; the camel is already too fat."
Paying banks billions of dollars not to make loans also may expose the Fed to sharp political criticism, particularly because foreign banks hold a large share of the excess reserves and thus stand to receive much of the payments.
Foreign banks like Deutsche Bank, UBS and the Bank of China held about 43 percent of excess reserves at the end of 2013, according to a report last year by the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank for central banks.
The Fed has said the decline in profits could be large enough in the coming years that it might not be able to transfer any money for the first time since 1934.
Marvin Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, contended in a paper last year that the Fed should retain some of its current earnings as a reserve against the possibility of losses. Fed officials have adopted a cosmetic version of that strategy, emphasizing in public remarks that lower profits or even losses should be seen in the context of the present windfall.

Full text:   European leaders and central bankers have been saying for years that their economic policies would soon revive the economies of the eurozone. It seems that investors have finally stopped believing those fairy tales.
The euro has been sliding against the dollar for much of the last 12 months and, this week, fell to a nine-year low, after the European Union published depressing economic data. One euro was trading at $1.1815 Thursday afternoon, down from $1.3588 at the start of 2013. The currency has fallen because of a growing fear among investors that the eurozone -- 19 countries -- is stuck in an economic quagmire. Its leaders are not doing much to pull it out.
For a time, European leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany found a convenient excuse in the weakened economies of Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal. Their argument went something like this: Europe will rebound once politicians in countries on the "periphery" of the eurozone streamline their systems and reduce their deficits. The nations did much of what was asked: They made severe cuts to public services, pensions and other spending; passed laws to make it easier for companies and governments to fire people; and raised taxes.
Some of these peripheral nations are indeed growing again. But the sacrifices they have been forced to make have come at great cost to them. In Greece and Spain, unemployment remains very high, at about 25 percent, and deflation, which is defined as a broad decline in consumer prices, has been a reality for months.
Meanwhile, the problems of the periphery have metastasized and now even the "core" is faltering. Unemployment has stopped falling and remains high in most eurozone nations. Consumer prices declined by 0.2 percent in December, the first time they have fallen across the currency union since 2009. Germany, France and Italy -- its three largest economies -- contracted or barely grew in the second and third quarters of 2014.
And there is little reason to expect a quick recovery since the governments of these nations are doing little or nothing to help. A recently announced European Union investment fund, for example, is so small that it will not come close to replacing the drop in government and private capital spending since the crisis. Officials at the European Central Bank, who helped stabilize the eurozone in recent years, have been saying they will do more by, for instance, buying bonds and other assets that would pump money into the economy, but they have not yet delivered.
Given this grim backdrop, the euro's tumble is to be expected. The Japanese yen and the British pound have also slid against the dollar in recent months as their countries' economies have lagged that of the United States. For Americans, a weaker euro will lower the cost of European vacations, wine and cheese. But the region's frail economy will reduce demand for American goods and services, undermining the modest recovery here.
If anything, the euro's decline should serve as a mini-economic stimulus because it lowers the cost of goods and services produced in the zone for consumers in the rest of the world. A depreciating currency will, of course, make imports costlier. But that is desirable because inflation is already so low in the eurozone. The currency markets are telling us something important: European leaders are not doing enough.

Full text:   The stock market is bouncing back from a tough start to 2015.
Investors sent shares sharply higher for a second straight day on Thursday, erasing heavy losses from the first few days of the year.
The gains were driven by a combination of positive domestic economic news and rising hopes for stimulus from Europe's central bank. The price of oil is also showing signs of stabilizing after six months of heavy losses, and there is renewed confidence that the Federal Reserve will keep supporting the economy as growth outside the United States appears to be flagging.
The wild swings in stock prices will probably be more common this year as investors try to anticipate when, if at all, the Fed will start to raise interest rates, said J. J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.
"People will have to get used to volatility at a higher level," Mr. Kinahan said. "It's going to be one of the primary stories for 2015."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 36.24 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,062.14. The index is now up 0.2 percent for the year, after falling 2.7 percent in the first three days of trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 323.35 points, or 1.8 percent, to 17,907.87. The Nasdaq gained 85.72 points, or 1.8 percent, to 4,736.19.
Comments from Charles Evans, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, late Wednesday gave stocks a lift. Mr. Evans said that the Fed shouldn't rush to raise interest rates because inflation was likely to remain tame for several years, according to Bloomberg News. The prospect of more stimulus from central banks around the world is also driving the rebound.
Pressure is rising on the European Central Bank to support the region's flagging economy. European data on Wednesday showed that consumer prices fell in December for the first time since 2009.
Many analysts expect the bank to announce a plan this month to buy European government bonds. Such a move, known as quantitative easing, is intended to hold down long-term interest rates and stimulate borrowing and spending.
"Oddly enough, the market was helped by some of the weaker data out of the eurozone," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. "In many ways, the bad news was the good news."
Investors also got encouraging news on hiring Thursday. A report showed that fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, which is a sign that employers expect the economy to keep growing, prompting them to hold on to workers. The Labor Department said Thursday that applications for unemployment benefits fell by 4,000 last week, to 294,000.
Economists forecast that a government report Friday will show that private employers added 243,000 jobs last month.
Among individual stocks, Constellation Brands was one of the day's biggest gainers. The company, which owns the Corona and Modelo beer brands, said earnings for the quarter ended Nov. 30 climbed thanks to increased beer sales. The earnings surpassed the expectations of Wall Street analysts, and the company also raised its full-year profit forecast. The stock gained $4.59, or 4.5 percent, to $107.64.
In energy trading, oil ended the day fractionally higher after fluctuating between small gains and losses for most of the day. United States crude oil gained 14 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $48.79 a barrel. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, fell 19 cents to close at $50.96 in London.
A large drop in the price of oil earlier in the week helped prompt a big sell-off in the stock market. The price has fallen by more than half since June last year as traders try to price in a glut of supply.
In bond trading, prices fell. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.02 percent from 1.97 percent on Wednesday.
The dollar rose against most major currencies. Against the euro, it rose to its highest point in nine years, and closed at $1.1787.
In metals trading, gold edged down $2.20 to $1,208.50 an ounce.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- China is increasingly likely to take new action to bolster growth, economists said, after figures released on Friday showed that inflation in the country remains near its lowest levels in five years.
Sluggish economic growth and falling prices for oil and other key commodities are resulting in weakening inflation in some of the world's biggest economies. On Wednesday, data from the eurozone highlighted the risk of deflation after prices fell 0.2 percent in December, turning negative for the first time since 2009, during the global financial crisis.
In China, prices are falling because of weak domestic demand and the downturn in commodity markets. For example, prices for coal, iron ore and copper are at their lowest levels in at least five years, and China is the world's biggest consumer of all three.
Consumer prices in China rose a meager 1.5 percent in December from a year earlier, the official statistics agency said Friday. The slight uptick from November's 1.5 percent increase was because of a spike in prices of fresh fruit and vegetables. Producer prices continued to fall for the 34th consecutive month, declining 3.3 percent from a year earlier, driven by declining commodity prices.
The easing inflationary pressure gives the central bank more room to attempt to lift growth and experiment with financial liberalization. In November, the central bank, the People's Bank of China, cut benchmark interest rates for the first time since the summer of 2012. Analysts expect more rate cuts to follow in the coming months, as China's economy is forecast to have grown in 2014 at its slowest pace in over two decades. Final figures for last year's gross domestic product are scheduled to be released on Jan. 20.
"Tepid domestic demand and falling commodity and energy prices are expected to bring consumer price index inflation down to 1.5 percent while producer prices decline further," Tao Wang, an economist at UBS, wrote Tuesday in a research note on economic forecasts for 2015. "We believe rising deflationary pressure will spur the central bank to cut benchmark lending rates," Ms. Wang wrote.
The growth outlook varies considerably across the world's major economies. The recovery in the United States continues to see strong growth and declining unemployment, but Japan is in a recession and the eurozone economy grew at an anemic 0.2 percent annualized pace in the third quarter compared with the second quarter.
In China, the picture is more complicated. The economy is expected to have grown last year at its slowest annual pace since 1990, but forecast at 7.4 percent, the increase in China's G.D.P. remains the fastest of any major economy.
China's president, Xi Jinping, has said that the world should get used to this "new normal" of China growing at a slower but more sustainable pace. Policy makers hope to curb China's reliance on credit-fueled investment and government spending, replacing them with consumer demand as a crucial driver of growth.
But the continued weak price increases signal a potential risk that China could tip into deflation, where an economy becomes trapped in broad and persistent price declines that depresses spending and curtails employment, curbing overall growth.
Wary of these risks, economists generally expect the central bank to respond with more interest rate cuts. They are divided, however, over whether this would also include a move to allow banks to lend out more of the cash that they are currently required to hold on reserve -- a reduction of the so-called reserve requirement ratio.
"China's central bank appears to be reluctant to cut reserve requirement ratio to counter falling prices and economic slowdown," Li-Gang Liu, the chief China economist at the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group, wrote Friday in a research note.
"Chinese authorities will need to use both structural reform measures as well as monetary policy tools to head off the risk of deflation, especially when domestic demand remains weak and commodity and energy prices continue to fall," he wrote, adding that such structural measures could include making China's water, energy and utility prices more market driven.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Oh, and Europe -- whose central bank, unlike the Fed under Bernanke's leadership, took those inflation warnings to heart and raised interest rates in 2011 -- is now experiencing outright deflation, with terrifying implications for its economic and political outlook.

Full text:   Many of us in the econ biz were wondering how the new leaders of Congress would respond to the sharp increase in American economic growth that, we now know, began last spring. After years of insisting that President Obama is responsible for a weak economy, they couldn't say the truth -- that short-run economic performance has very little to do with who holds the White House. So what would they say?
Well, I didn't see that one coming: They're claiming credit. Never mind the fact that all of the good data refer to a period before the midterm elections. Mitch McConnell, the new Senate majority leader, says that he did it, that growth reflected "the expectation of a new Republican Congress."
The response of the Democratic National Committee -- "Hahahahahahaha" -- seems appropriate. I mean, talk about voodoo economics: Mr. McConnell is claiming not just that he can create prosperity without, you know, actually passing any legislation, but that he can reach back in time and create prosperity before even taking power. But while Mr. McConnell's self-aggrandizement is funny, it's also scary, because it's a symptom of his party's epistemic closure. Republicans know many things that aren't so, and no amount of contrary evidence will get them to change their minds.
At least Mr. McConnell didn't do what many of his colleagues have done when faced with inconvenient facts: resort to conspiracy theories.
Consider, for example, how some Republicans dealt with good news about health reform. Before Obamacare went into effect, they overwhelmingly insisted that it would be a disaster, that more people would lose insurance than would gain it. They were, of course, delighted by the technical problems that initially crippled the program's website. But those problems were fixed, and enrollment soared. Their response? "They are cooking the books," declared Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, who now leads the Senate Republican Policy Committee.
But that was then. At this point we have multiple independent confirmations -- most recently from Gallup -- that Obamacare has dramatically expanded insurance coverage. So what do they say now? The law "will collapse under its own weight," says Representative Paul Ryan, the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Speaking of Mr. Ryan: Almost four years have passed since he and many others in his party lambasted Ben Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, for policies that they claimed would lead to high inflation and "debase the dollar." The inflation never materialized, and the dollar proceeded to strengthen, but Mr. Ryan gave no sign of having been chastened -- and many conservatives, including favorite intellectuals like Niall Ferguson of Harvard, became "inflation truthers," insisting that the government is hiding price rises.
Oh, and Europe -- whose central bank, unlike the Fed under Bernanke's leadership, took those inflation warnings to heart and raised interest rates in 2011 -- is now experiencing outright deflation, with terrifying implications for its economic and political outlook.
Then there's climate change. It appears that 2014 was the hottest year yet, which should close the door on silly claims that global warming has stopped. But it won't matter to Senator James Inhofe, who now leads a crucial environmental committee and has long insisted that all the science in this field is a liberal hoax.
Now, everyone makes predictions that turn out to have been wrong; it's a complicated world out there, and nobody's perfect. The point, however, is that Congress is now controlled by men who never acknowledge error, let alone learn from their mistakes.
In some cases, they may not even know that they were wrong. After all, conservative news media are not exactly known for their balanced coverage; if your picture of how health reform is working is based on Fox News, you probably have a sense that it has been a vast disaster, even though the reality is one of success that has surprised even the law's supporters.
The main point, however, is that we're looking at a political subculture in which ideological tenets are simply not to be questioned, no matter what. Supply-side economics is valid no matter what actually happens to the economy, guaranteed health insurance must be a failure even if it's working, and anyone who points out the troubling facts is ipso facto an enemy.
And we're not talking about marginal figures. You sometimes hear claims that the old-fashioned Republican establishment is making a comeback, that Tea Party extremists are on the run and we can get back to bipartisan cooperation. But that is a fantasy. We can't have meaningful cooperation when we can't agree on reality, when even establishment figures in the Republican Party essentially believe that facts have a liberal bias.

Full text:   PARIS -- Europe's economy has reached a psychological inflection point.
On Wednesday, an official report showed that consumer prices in the eurozone fell 0.2 percent in December from a year earlier, the first time they have turned negative since the dark days of the global financial crisis in 2009.
It is an outcome that economists have been predicting for more than a year and a trend that has long been complicating Europe's recovery.
Now, the latest data is adding concerns that Europe is headed for a new financial and economic crisis. Unemployment remains persistently high. The euro has been particularly weak. And the political upheaval in Greece is prompting talk about the stability of the 19-country euro currency union.
With the outlook deteriorating, pressure is mounting for the European Central Bank take more aggressive action to avoid a downward price spiral that could undermine the economy for years to come. Top officials have already been signaling that they could announce a major bond-buying program later this month.
But the question raised by many economists is whether the European Central Bank has waited too long to act, and whether its arsenal is powerful enough to address the eurozone's fundamental problem -- a dearth of demand from businesses and consumers for goods and services. Even the bank's president, Mario Draghi, has said that it alone cannot shoulder the burden of restarting growth.
"The eurozone is suffering from a profound malaise," said Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a think tank in London. "It's already in a deflationary trap of the kind we saw in Japan in the 1990s, but it's less well equipped than the Japanese to deal with it," he added, citing the institutional challenges of managing a currency bloc of 19 nations.
The situation in Europe does not appear to meet the classical definition of deflation, a widespread, protracted and self-sustaining decline in prices. And the continued global collapse of crude oil prices contributed significantly to the decline, blurring somewhat the implications of the inflation report for the 19-country euro currency union.
But the trend is dangerous. The low inflation environment was already a signal of a listless economy, with consumers spending little despite low prices and companies having scant incentive to invest in their businesses.
If prices actually fall for an extended period, consumers might delay purchase in hopes of getting a better deal later, and businesses would see little reason to make products that would be worth less with each passing month.
"We're not yet in a self-sustaining spiral," said Gilles Moec, chief European economist at Bank of America in London. "But we're close."
The labor market provides one illustration of what makes Europe's situation particularly complicated to fix.
A separate official report on Wednesday showed that the eurozone jobless rate remained at 11.5 percent in November, around the level at which it has been for the last year. But overall numbers don't give a complete picture of what's happening in each country, where fortunes are diverging.
In Germany, which has the bloc's biggest economy, unemployment fell to 6.4 percent in December from 6.5 percent in November. But in the second- and third-largest of the eurozone economies, France and Italy, the jobless rates climbed, with Italian unemployment reaching a new high of 13.4 percent.
And in Greece and Spain, about a quarter of the population remains without work, a level consistent with economic depression.
Analysts said on Wednesday that it was now a certainty that the European Central Bank would announce aggressive new measures when it meets in Frankfurt on Jan. 22. They expect the central bank to say it is ready to begin effectively printing money that it would use to buy eurozone government bonds, even if it does not put the measures into practice for several months.
In doing so, the bank would follow an unconventional policy similar to the quantitative easing used by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the American economy.
But quantitative easing is a divisive issue in Europe because of questions about how to allocate the bond buying among eurozone countries, and who would pay if a government defaulted on bonds held by the central bank. That uncertainty is a main reason that Germany does not want to put its taxpayers at risk of having to bail out the bloc's weaker neighbors.
The central bank has an official goal of trying to keep inflation at just below 2 percent, which it considers an optimal level for a healthy economy. But the bank has not met that target in two years.
Japan's experience in the 1990s showed that traditional monetary policy instruments are largely ineffective with nominal interest rates at zero, as they essentially are now in the eurozone.
Another way to address the problem might be for eurozone countries to drop their insistence on balancing budgets and to instead use tax cuts and public spending to create demand.
So far, though, European officials appear to be holding their course.
"Yes, the eurozone is going through a period of low inflation," Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and president of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance officials, said in a statement in response to a New York Times query. "But one of the most important reasons for the current low inflation rate is the falling oil price. Core inflation -- excluding oil prices -- has recently slightly increased."
The core inflation rate, which excludes energy and food prices, ticked up to 0.8 percent in December from 0.7 percent the month before, according to Wednesday's data.
The German government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which has taken a tough line against coordinated economic stimulus, indicated that the latest data had not altered its thinking. A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said in Berlin on Wednesday that Germany would not revise its analysis that there was no risk of deflation in the country. That statement came despite a report on Monday showing that German consumer prices rose 0.1 percent last month.
Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, on Wednesday defended the German view, saying that the danger was being overstated in light of the debt overload that was behind the global and European financial crisis that developed in 2008.
"It's inevitable after the bursting of a debt bubble that inflation is low, as consumers and business repay their debts and spend only hesitantly," he said.
Some of the weakness in prices reflects lower labor costs in the weaker "peripheral" eurozone members, he said, something that can make their economies more competitive. "We do not have harmful deflation," he said.
There is no question, though, that the eurozone is ailing. The bloc's economy expanded 0.6 percent in the third quarter of 2014 on an annualized basis. That is far short of the United States economy's 5.0 percent growth, and recent data suggest that the eurozone pace has been slowing.
That stark difference is one reason the value of the euro currency has been plunging compared to the dollar in recent weeks. It fell again on Wednesday after the inflation report, declining more than 0.5 percent to $1.1816 -- its lowest level in nine years. As was the case the last time the euro was this low, fund managers are moving investments to the United States in expectations of a better return on their money.
Consumer prices in the eurozone had not contracted on an annual basis since October 2009, when the slack global economy made the bottom fall out of the market for oil and other commodities. December's negative rate was down from the 0.3 percent increase in November.
Well before eurozone consumer prices tipped below zero, the region's low inflation rate had been raising alarms.
Economists with the International Monetary Fund warned early last year that the difference between ultralow inflation, which they called lowflation, and outright deflation was mainly a matter of degrees, as the weak price pressures could "scupper the nascent recovery and pressure the most fragile countries."
Mr. Draghi, the central bank president, said last week in an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt that the risk of deflation "cannot be ruled out completely, but it is limited."
"We are not there yet," Mr. Draghi said. "But we need to tackle this risk."
Investors have been snapping up government bonds of eurozone countries amid expectations that a European Central Bank purchasing program would make them more valuable. Yields on German, French and Belgian bonds have all hit record lows this week.
Ireland on Wednesday was able to issue seven-year bonds at a yield of 0.867 percent, an astonishingly low rate for a country that was bailed out by the I.M.F. and the European Union in 2010.
Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, wrote in a note on Wednesday that the contraction in consumer prices "is a severe blow to the credibility" of the European Central Bank.
"The E.C.B.'s hand has been forced," he said. "Anything less than a firm pledge by its president, Mario Draghi, that sovereign quantitative easing is imminent will be taken very badly by markets."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials spoke with growing optimism about the strength of the economy at the December meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, according to an official account published on Wednesday.
Some officials cited the strength of recent economic data, including surveys of consumer and business confidence and the growth of payrolls, as evidence that growth may finally exceed their expectations after years of disappointment.
Others said they expected a "quite large" boost from falling oil prices.
The signs of newfound optimism were tempered, however, by concern that the weakness of the global economy, and the anemic response of foreign governments, could weigh on domestic growth.
And the tone of the December meeting continued a pattern in which the Fed entered almost every year since the financial crisis expressing confidence that the economy was finally gaining momentum.
As a result, the account of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee made clear that Fed officials remain determined to err on the side of caution by continuing to suppress interest rates. Most officials do not expect to raise the Fed's benchmark rate before the middle of the year.
The Fed issued a statement after the December meeting saying it would be patient in deciding when to start raising the rate. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said at a news conference after the statement was released that a first increase would probably not be made before the committee's third meeting of the year, in late April.
A wide range of economists share the Fed's cautious optimism that the economy, which has slowly gained strength in recent years, will continue to do so. A survey of professional forecasters by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported an average expectation of 3 percent economic growth this year.
Fed officials saw the woes of other countries as the greatest risk to this forecast, according to the account of the December meeting, which was published after the standard three-week delay.
Most officials agreed that falling oil prices would do the domestic economy more good than harm, leading to increased spending and job growth. But they worried about the consequences for foreign economies and the stability of financial markets.
"Participants generally regarded the net effect of the recent decline in energy prices as likely to be positive for economic activity and employment," the account said. "However, many of them thought that a further deterioration in the foreign economic situation could result in slower domestic economic growth than they currently expected."
The account said these concerns were "nearly balanced" by recent signs that domestic growth "may end up showing more momentum than anticipated."
The labor market has grown steadily in recent months, making it easier for Americans to find jobs. The economy added 321,000 jobs in November, the strongest month in nearly three years. The December data will be released on Friday.
Most Fed officials have concluded that the labor market is now strong enough to start raising interest rates, but they have waited because of the sluggish pace of inflation. The meeting account emphasized that the damage from the recession remained sufficiently substantial that recent job growth was not yet driving up wages. "Most participants saw no clear evidence of a broad-based acceleration in wages," it said.
Falling oil prices, meanwhile, are suppressing price inflation.
By the Fed's preferred measure, inflation was just 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in November. Oil prices have put further downward pressure on inflation.
And the meeting account said that "a number of participants" expressed concern that inflation would not rebound to the 2 percent annual pace the Fed has established as its target.
Yet the account emphasized that most Fed officials remained convinced that inflation will rebound -- and they may begin raising the benchmark interest rate before they are certain.
"The committee might begin normalization at a time when core inflation was near current levels," the meeting account said, "although in that circumstance participants would want to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back toward 2 percent over time."

Full text:   The United States economy is accelerating, unemployment is falling and wages are even beginning to creep higher.
Yet a huge bond market with a strong track record for predicting economic problems is flashing a warning sign right now.
The prices of Treasury bonds are rallying fiercely. The slide in oil prices has elevated concerns about growth in the global economy, and investors, as they do in times of stress and uncertainty, are seeking out the safety of government bonds.
The rally in global government debt is pushing their yields, which move in the opposite direction from their price, to astonishing lows. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note -- a benchmark for mortgages and other interest rates -- fell below 2 percent on Tuesday. Any investor holding that security would be paid only 1.94 percent each year, for the next 10 years. In the past, such a return would have been considered unthinkably slight.
In Europe, where the economies are weaker than in the United States, yields are even lower. The yield on the German 10-year note, for instance, fell to 0.44 percent on Tuesday. And Japan's 10-year government security now yields an almost nonexistent 0.28 percent.
"Make no mistake, these low levels of rates are challenging the notion that we are going to see robust and constant growth," said George Goncalves, a bond market analyst with Nomura.
In other words, the bond market is raising the specter that a period of economic growth that may have already felt lackluster to many Americans could be on the verge of losing steam.
But just how worried should one be? After all, the bond market's pessimism might be overdone.
The United States economy grew at an impressive 5 percent in the third quarter of last year. And though the stock market has fallen from its highs in recent days, it is still trading on valuations that suggest investors see few hurdles to continued growth in corporate profits.
Also, this is Wall Street, where investors often stampede into popular trades without giving too much thought to fundamentals. And the bond market does not always get its economic predictions right. A vicious sell-off in Treasury bonds in 1994 turned out to be a false signal in a decade of almost uninterrupted growth. More recently, the yield on the 10-year Treasury plummeted to 1.39 percent in 2012, substantially lower than it is right now, and the economy did not collapse in the following months.
One of the reasons the big economies did not stall badly in 2012 was that central banks, perhaps taking their cue from red flags in the bond markets, reinvigorated their stimulus policies. Crucially, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said that year that he would do "whatever it takes" to prevent the euro from coming apart.
And now, once again, bond investors are hanging on European policy makers doing more. The economies of the countries that share the euro seem perilously stuck at low levels of growth. Inflation for those countries was 0.3 percent in November, a level that appears to have deeply unsettled Mr. Draghi.
"If inflation remains low for a long time, people might expect prices to fall even further and postpone their spending," he said in an interview last week with Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper. "We are not there yet. But we need to tackle this risk."
One way that Mr. Draghi can tackle that risk is to persuade skeptical policy makers at the European Central Bank to vote in favor of the sort of all-in government bond-buying program that the United States deployed. He appears to be getting closer to gaining such backing -- and anticipation of such a program in the markets could be driving up the prices of the bonds that the European Central Bank would buy. Analysts say that the low yields in Europe are prompting investors to shift some of their holdings into higher-yielding United States Treasury securities.
But even a big bond-buying program in Europe -- and continued stimulus in Japan -- might not be enough to make bond markets optimistic about global economic growth.
Bearishness about growth has been evident in other markets. Stocks, which fell sharply on Monday, declined again on Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 17.97 points, or 0.89 percent. The more narrow Dow Jones industrial average ended down 130.1 points, or 0.74 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index closed down 59.84 points, or 1.29 percent.
Crude oil extended its slide, falling another 2.11 percent, to $47.93 a barrel.
In the Treasury market, the price of the 10-year note rose 27/32, driving its yield down to 1.94 percent. The price of the two-year note rose 2/32 to yield 0.63 percent, while the price of the 30-year bond surged 2 9/32, to yield 2.50 percent.
It is in this market where the bearishness appears especially entrenched. Specifically, investors point out that the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has fallen by more than the yields on bonds that mature, or pay off investors, well before the 10-year note. This trend, known as a "flattening of the yield curve," is often taken as a sign that investors think that the Federal Reserve is going to tighten policy before the economy is ready.
Raising interest rates, the theory goes, will shore up yields on Treasury bonds that mature in one or two years. But increasing rates could stifle growth and inflation, weighing on the yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which is substantially more sensitive to such economic forces. And the Fed has signaled that it might be ready to raise interest rates later this year.
"They might end up overthinking things, being too clever by half, and end up raising rates too soon," Jeffrey Gundlach, one of the most successful bond investors, said in a recent presentation.
The action in the bond market, however, points to a bigger question: Why haven't economies managed to grow more strongly after so many years of low bond yields? In the past, when the central bank slashed interest rates and bond yields fell, it would set off a robust revival in economic activity.
Some bond investors say the stimulus from the central banks has a decreasing effect because, each time the stimulus occurs, it increases indebtedness and stokes speculation in financial markets that fails to translate into growth in the real economy.
"The power of additional and cheaper credit to add to economic growth and financial asset bull markets has been underappreciated by investors since 1981," William H. Gross, the famed bond fund manager, now at Janus, wrote in his monthly outlook on Tuesday. "There comes a time, however, when zero-based, and in some cases negative yields, fail to generate sufficient economic growth," he added.
Bond market analysts, however, offer some solace by saying Treasury bonds are not necessarily forecasting an actual recession.
"We're in the seventh inning of a business cycle and it may be coming to an end soon," Mr. Goncalves, the analyst, said. "It is not calamity but a slowness that could linger for some time."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The value of the euro fell to its lowest level in years on Monday, prompting sharp declines in European stocks and creating uneasiness about whether the region is on the verge of a new economic and financial crisis.
The continued plunge, to a nine-year low against the dollar, came on the same day that global oil prices also resumed their descent, hitting prices not seen in more than five years. While cheap oil can be a good thing for consumers and energy-intensive industries, the growing worry is that the decline signals lower demand and portends a global economic slowdown.
In Europe, "there's probably as much fear as 2012," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, referring to a period when worries were rampant that the euro currency union would unravel.
Mr. Paulsen said such worries were misplaced. And in fact there should be a lot for Europeans to like about the drop in oil prices and Monday's decline of the euro to $1.19 -- a 15 percent fall against the dollar since May.
Products from the eurozone will become more affordable to foreign buyers, even as the energy needed to make those products becomes cheaper. Mr. Paulsen and some other economists said that can only quicken the eurozone's lethargic economic pulse. New data on Monday from Germany showed that inflation in the eurozone remains at worrisomely low levels, the latest sign of a despondent economy.
Other economists say that while the net effect is positive, much of the benefit may be canceled out by negative consequences -- for example, a slump in world demand for exports, including from the eurozone.
And one reason for the continued decline in the euro is the much more robust growth of the United States economy, which is prompting global investors to dump euros in favor of dollars.
"I'm taking this quite cautiously," Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Nomura, said of oil prices. "If oil weakness is due to lower demand, we should be very worried."
European stock markets reflected that worry on Monday, led by a sell-off in shares of energy companies that carried over to the United States when Wall Street opened.
At least initially, investors reacted to the new dips in the euro and oil prices with alarm. The benchmark stock indexes in France, Italy and Germany all fell more than 2 percent. Energy-related stocks were among the biggest losers. The German electricity suppliers E.ON and RWE and chemical maker BASF all fell more than 4 percent.
The further declines in the euro and in oil did not change expectations that when the European Central Bank meets on Jan. 22 that it would unveil further stimulus, broad-based purchases of government bonds, so-called quantitative easing.
When deciding policy, E.C.B. officials are probably focused on the inflation rate more than the value of the euro or the price of oil, and the German data indicated that inflation continues to fall to levels considered dangerously close to deflation -- a downward price spiral that is poisonous for corporate profits.
German inflation was just 0.1 percent in December, according to an estimate by the government statistics office.
An official estimate of inflation in the eurozone as a whole is to be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the rate to fall to close to zero or even below it, putting further pressure on the European Central Bank to act.
The fate of the eurozone economy depends on which school of economic thought turns out to be right, something that probably will not become clear for several months.
Eurozone companies that earn revenue in dollars will enjoy a surge in profits, said Mr. Cailloux of Nomura, simply because dollar sales will translate into more euros in the quarterly earnings report. But it doesn't necessarily follow, he said, that companies will use the profits to expand European operations and help cut the eurozone's 11.5 percent unemployment rate.
There are still many economists and public officials, though, who maintain that in fact cheap oil and a cheap currency are overwhelmingly good for Europe. One of them is Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and an influential member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank.
"The cheaper oil price works like a stimulus program," he said in an interview published Sunday by the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper. "Consumers and companies have to spend less and can consume and invest more."
The statement was a signal by Mr. Weidmann that he remains skeptical about whether more E.C.B. stimulus wasneeded.
While a majority of the E.C.B. Governing Council appears to support embarking on a quantitative easing program, members may be reluctant to risk alienating Mr. Weidmann and the larger German public whose views he represents. Germany worries that it might get stuck paying a big part of the bill if the European Central Bank loses money on any eurozone government bonds it might buy as part of quantitative easing.
Whether cheap oil and a weak euro help Europe may depend on how long the low prices last. If companies believe that low prices are temporary, they may be in no hurry to invest in expansion and hiring more people.
"We're not seeing any change in the market behavior of our customers," Wolfgang Bernhard, chief executive of Daimler Trucks and Buses, said in an emailed statement. "So far no one believes that the prices will stay so low forever."
There is also the fact that eurozone countries tend to be net importers of oil and natural gas -- which is usually priced in dollars -- meaning that their weak currency may not buy as much fuel in the future.
Still, gasoline prices for European consumers are significantly lower than they were a few months ago. Pump prices in Germany are down 9 percent since June.
Whether economists believe that cheap oil will be good for Europe often depends on how they explain why oil is cheap.
Mr. Cailloux cites weak demand as an important cause, which is bad news for the eurozone because of the region's dependence on trade. He also pointed out that oil-producing countries are important customers for goods from Germany and other eurozone countries.
"The demand from recycling those petrodollars is going to be weaker," Mr. Cailloux said. "Russia comes to mind."
Those who contend that oil is cheap because of abundant supply are more optimistic. Mr. Paulsen of Wells Fargo belongs to that camp.
He argued that the eurozone was poised to benefit from a virtuous combination of low interest rates on loans, cheap oil and a competitive boost from the weak euro.
"It's the equivalent of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus," Mr. Paulsen said. "I think we're going to find out Europe bounces this year rather than melts away."
Mr. Paulsen said some of the declines in European stock prices on Monday were a beginning-of-year correction after big gains in 2014. But he conceded, "It's just panic at the moment."

Abstract: Firms that must pay workers and buy raw materials in now-depreciated currencies like the euro and yen are effectively getting cost savings even without having to cut pay or renegotiate with suppliers. In that sense, for the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, the falling currency values could have a welcome effect of helping prices rise a bit faster, at least temporarily.

Full text:   It just might be time to book that vacation in Paris you've been thinking about.
That is one practical conclusion to draw from a remarkable set of shifts in global currencies that started in the second half of last year and has continued in the early trading days of 2015. The seemingly inexorable rise of the dollar versus the euro and most other currencies has broad implications for the global economy this year and beyond.
The euro traded below $1.19 at times on Monday, the lowest level in nine years (it was $1.39 as recently as May). The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against six other major alternatives, is up almost 15 percent since June 30. Those swings are big enough to reshape the terms of economic interaction among the most powerful nations on earth -- and will affect almost any company or individual doing business across national borders.
The underlying causes are straightforward enough. The United States economy is doing far better than most other advanced countries, achieving a recently revised 5 percent G.D.P. growth in the third quarter. The Federal Reserve is planning to raise interest rates this year, at a time its counterparts in Europe and Japan are pushing toward easier money.
But the consequences are quite a bit more varied, some straight from Econ 101 and others unique to the current circumstances.
Trouble for U.S. exporters? For American companies that compete globally and derive much of their income from overseas, things have gotten a lot tougher in the last few months.
If you are United States-based Boeing competing with European Airbus to sell jumbo jets around the world, or a California winemaker trying to persuade global buyers your product is better than its French and Italian counterparts, your competitiveness has fallen. Firms that must pay workers and buy raw materials in now-depreciated currencies like the euro and yen are effectively getting cost savings even without having to cut pay or renegotiate with suppliers.
That said, because the currency appreciation has its roots in an improving domestic economy, American manufacturers are hardly panicking. We've heard little complaining -- so far at least -- from business interests complaining that other countries are engaging in currency wars.
"The dollar is strengthening in many ways for the right reasons," said Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, "because we're one of the brighter spots in the world. That will present a challenge in terms of growing exports, but at least to the extent we're strengthening it's because the U.S. economy is getting better."
That said, if the appreciation goes much further, don't be surprised if U.S. exporters start to pressure the government to apply diplomatic pressure to reverse the slide.
A less powerful stimulus from oil price declines overseas. One reason the United States economic expansion is picking up is that plummeting oil prices (and the lower gasoline prices that result) are leaving Americans with more money in their pockets.
But oil prices are almost always quoted in dollars, so the dollar appreciation exaggerates somewhat the extent to which oil prices are falling for most people around the world.
In Europe, notably, the benchmark price of Brent crude oil has fallen 53 percent when measured in dollars since June 30, but only 46 percent when measured in euros. Cheaper oil will be good for consumers everywhere, but the strong dollar means the shift is sharpest for Americans.
Even less U.S. inflation pressure -- but a bit of help for Europe and Japan. One of the most intractable realities of the last several years is that inflation has been consistently below the 2 percent that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks aim for.
Inflation has been a bit below in the case of the United States (with 1.2 percent inflation in the last reading), and way below in Europe (a mere 0.1 percent in Germany, the government statistics agency said Monday). The rise in the dollar and decline in other currencies will tend to push U.S. inflation down and European and Japanese inflation up.
A more expensive dollar will mean cheaper imported goods for Americans, while making imports more expensive for those overseas. While major central banks don't normally make currency values the explicit focus of their policies, they are supposed to account for whatever impact their fluctuations have on inflation.
In that sense, for the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, the falling currency values could have a welcome effect of helping prices rise a bit faster, at least temporarily. For the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, it could mean even lower inflation and more latitude, should its leaders choose, to wait longer before raising interest rates.
A different travel landscape. Americans thinking of traveling overseas are winners in the currency swings. Conversely, travel-related firms that cater to foreigners in the United States are losers.
This is really a variation of the point above about a strong dollar creating challenges for exporters, in the sense that a Japanese tourist who visits California and spends $5,000 has pretty much the same impact, in terms of trade and balance of payments effects, as our California winemaker shipping $5,000 worth of wine to Tokyo.
But as people make their summer plans, the fact that, for example, European destinations are 12.5 percent cheaper than they were six months ago in dollar terms could both make locations abroad more attractive to Americans and U.S. travel less attractive to would-be foreign visitors.
The effect shouldn't be enormous, argues David Huether, the senior vice president for research at the U.S. Travel Association; their analysis suggests that a 10 percent rise in the dollar should translate into only a 0.2 percent drop in the number of visitors from abroad.
"The value of the dollar will have some impact, but I think travel will be less impacted than other goods and services, where a piece of steel is a piece of steel," said Mr. Huether, arguing that the United States' distinct offerings are attractive enough that travelers will pay a higher price to visit.
Barring a reversal in currencies, 2015 is shaping up to be a year of testing just how high a price they're willing to pay.

Full text:   STRONG AUTO SALES REPORT IS PREDICTED FOR DECEMBER
Analysts expect December vehicle sales in the United States to be up again when automakers report their numbers on Monday, possibly yielding the highest December total since 2006. Over all, 2014 is set to be one of the industry's most successful years in some time, as low gas prices and surging demand for sport utility vehicles powered sales that analysts estimate could reach nearly 17 million vehicles nationwide. For the second year in a row, small S.U.V.s will be the fastest growing area for American buyers, according to Kelley Blue Book, and full-size trucks are expected to top two million sold for the first time since 2007. But automakers also dealt with safety problems during the year that resulted in more than 60 million vehicles being recalled nationwide -- one out of every five on the road. AARON M. KESSLER
FED NOTES MAY SHED LIGHT ON INTEREST RATE DISSENT
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee ended 2014 on an unusually contentious note. Most officials wanted to start raising the Fed's benchmark interest rate around the middle of 2015. But three officials dissented at the committee's last meeting in mid-December. Two argued for greater urgency; one argued for more patience. On Wednesday, the Fed plans to publish an account of the meeting that may provide more information about those disagreements. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM
INFLATION AND JOBLESS DATA TO BE RELEASED IN EUROPE
European economic data will be in the spotlight on Wednesday, when Eurostat is to announce initial estimates of eurozone December inflation and the November jobless rate. With oil prices falling and the region's economy sputtering along, demand has been insufficient to restore labor market growth and keep consumer prices near the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices to have declined 0.1 percent from December 2013, and the unemployment rate to have remained flat at around 11.5 percent. Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, and his colleagues on the bank's policy board are widely expected to respond, possibly as early as this month, by announcing large-scale purchases of bonds, a policy known as quantitative easing. DAVID JOLLY
MORE U.S. JOBS EXPECTED IN DECEMBER FIGURES
On Friday, the Labor Department will report on job creation and the unemployment rate in December. Economists estimate that employers added 250,000 positions in December and that the unemployment rate fell 0.1 percent to 5.7 percent. Nevertheless, November's payroll growth was surprisingly strong at 321,000, so another upside surprise would echo other recent signs of renewed economic strength. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

Full text:   Suddenly, or so it seems, the U.S. economy is looking better. Things have been looking up for a while, but at this point the signs of improvement -- job gains, rapidly growing G.D.P., rising public confidence -- are unmistakable.
The improving economy is surely one factor in President Obama's rising approval rating. And there's a palpable sense of panic among Republicans, despite their victory in the midterms. They expected to run in 2016 against a record of failure; what do they do if the economy is looking pretty good?
Well, that's their problem. What I want to ask instead is whether any of this makes sense. How much influence does the occupant of the White House have on the economy, anyway? The standard answer among economists, at least when they aren't being political hacks, is: not much. But is this time different?
To understand why economists usually downplay the economic role of presidents, let's revisit a much-mythologized episode in U.S. economic history: the recession and recovery of the 1980s.
On the right, of course, the 1980s are remembered as an age of miracles wrought by the blessed Reagan, who cut taxes, conjured up the magic of the marketplace and led the nation to job gains never matched before or since. In reality, the 16 million jobs America added during the Reagan years were only slightly more than the 14 million added over the previous eight years. And a later president -- Bill something-or-other -- presided over the creation of 22 million jobs. But who's counting?
In any case, however, serious analyses of the Reagan-era business cycle place very little weight on Reagan, and emphasize instead the role of the Federal Reserve, which sets monetary policy and is largely independent of the political process. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Fed, under the leadership of Paul Volcker, was determined to bring inflation down, even at a heavy price; it tightened policy, sending interest rates sky high, with mortgage rates going above 18 percent. What followed was a severe recession that drove unemployment to double digits but also broke the wage-price spiral.
Then the Fed decided that America had suffered enough. It loosened the reins, sending interest rates plummeting and housing starts soaring. And the economy bounced back. Reagan got the political credit for "morning in America," but Mr. Volcker was actually responsible for both the slump and the boom.
The point is that normally the Fed, not the White House, rules the economy. Should we apply the same rule to the Obama years?
Not quite.
For one thing, the Fed has had a hard time gaining traction in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, because the aftermath of a huge housing and mortgage bubble has left private spending relatively unresponsive to interest rates. This time around, monetary policy really needed help from a temporary increase in government spending, which meant that the president could have made a big difference. And he did, for a while; politically, the Obama stimulus may have been a failure, but an overwhelming majority of economists believe that it helped mitigate the slump.
Since then, however, scorched-earth Republican opposition has more than reversed that initial effort. In fact, federal spending adjusted for inflation and population growth is lower now than it was when Mr. Obama took office; at the same point in the Reagan years, it was up more than 20 percent. So much, then, for fiscal policy.
There is, however, another sense in which Mr. Obama has arguably made a big difference. The Fed has had a hard time getting traction, but it has at least made an effort to boost the economy -- and it has done so despite ferocious attacks from conservatives, who have accused it again and again of "debasing the dollar" and setting the stage for runaway inflation. Without Mr. Obama to shield its independence, the Fed might well have been bullied into raising interest rates, which would have been disastrous. So the president has indirectly aided the economy by helping to fend off the hard-money mob.
Last but not least, even if you think Mr. Obama deserves little or no credit for good economic news, the fact is his opponents have spent years claiming that his bad attitude -- he has been known to suggest, now and then, that some bankers have behaved badly -- is somehow responsible for the economy's weakness. Now that he's presiding over unexpected economic strength, they can't just turn around and assert his irrelevance.
So is the president responsible for the accelerating recovery? No. Can we nonetheless say that we're doing better than we would be if the other party held the White House? Yes. Do those who were blaming Mr. Obama for all our economic ills now look like knaves and fools? Yes, they do. And that's because they are.
