Abstract: National income, as calculated by the Commerce Department, is similar to gross domestic product but excludes some items, most notably an estimate of depreciation. Besides the ones shown in the charts, there are other categories included in national income, including rental income and net interest income, so the figures shown do not add up to 100 percent.

Full text: THESE are the worst of times for workers, and the best of times for companies. At least that is one way to read the newly revised national economic statistics.
The Commerce Department last week reduced its estimates of economic growth in 2010 and early 2011. At the same time, it said corporate income was much better than it had thought. Using newly available data from 2009 corporate tax returns, the department raised its estimates of corporate profits by 8.3 percent for 2009 and 10.8 percent for 2010.
The new figures indicate that corporate profits accounted for 14 percent of the total national income in 2010, the highest proportion ever recorded. The previous peak, of 13.6 percent, was set in 1942 when the need for war materials filled the order books of companies at the same time as the government imposed wage and price controls, holding down the costs companies had to pay.
In the first quarter of 2011, the latest figures available, the new estimates indicate corporate profits accounted for 14.2 percent of national income, well above the 13.1 percent that had previously been estimated.
The news is not so good for smaller enterprises. The government category for many such businesses, known as proprietors and partnerships, is based on the type of tax returns filed, and is not completely accurate because some large enterprises file partnership tax returns while some smaller ones file as corporations. But it is generally used as a proxy for small business.
The latest figures indicate the smaller businesses' share of national income fell to a 17-year low of 7.7 percent in 2009, but recovered to 8.3 percent in 2010 and in the first quarter of this year.
Employees have always received more than half the total national income, until now. In 2010, the percentage of national income devoted to wages and salaries fell to 49.9 percent, and it slipped a little more to 49.6 percent in the first quarter of this year. That continued decline may help explain the economic worries of many Americans who have jobs but still fear they are falling behind.
The figure for wages and salaries reflects only what employees are directly paid, and does not include the cost paid by employers for benefits, which has been steadily rising over the years. It is thus not an accurate gauge from the point of view of employers, for whom a dollar spent on health insurance premiums is no less real than one spent on wages.
Adding the two categories together may provide a better view of the share of national income going to workers or being spent for their benefit.
The 2010 total, of 62.1 percent, is not close to the record low share of 54.5 percent, set in 1929, the first year for which numbers are available. But it is the lowest for any full year since 1965. In the first quarter of 2011, it slipped further, to 61.7 percent.
National income, as calculated by the Commerce Department, is similar to gross domestic product but excludes some items, most notably an estimate of depreciation. Besides the ones shown in the charts, there are other categories included in national income, including rental income and net interest income, so the figures shown do not add up to 100 percent.
One way to look at recent trends is to compare the total income figures for 2010 with those of 2006, before the economy began to slide into recession. In nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation, national income was 6.7 percent higher in 2010 -- a gain that did not come close to matching the 8.2 percent rise in the consumer price index.
Total employee compensation, including benefits, rose 6.6 percent, although wages and salaries gained only 5.6 percent. Corporate profits were 11.9 percent higher, while proprietors' income was down 8.5 percent. Corporate profits more than kept up with inflation. Other categories of income did not.
It can be misleading to look at shares of income without examining their magnitude. A small share of a big pie may be larger than a big share of a small pie. The record high share for wages and salaries, of 59.7 percent, came in 1932. Worker pay was plunging in those days, but not as fast as corporate profits. Companies as a group lost money that year.
Nonetheless, President John F. Kennedy's observation that a rising tide lifts all boats is no longer as true as it once was.
There have been 10 years when corporate profits as a share of national income exceeded 13 percent -- 1941, '42, '43, '50, '51, '55, '65, '66, 2006 and 2010. In eight of those years, the economy, as measured by real gross national product, grew at a rate of greater than 6 percent.
The exceptions were 2006, when real growth was just 2.7 percent, and 2010, when it was 3 percent.
Similarly, in the past, unemployment was generally low when corporate profits were high. In 2006, the unemployment rate ended the year at 4.4 percent -- and that was higher than it had been in other postwar years when the corporate share of national income was high. At the end of 2010, the jobless rate was 9.4 percent. On Friday, the government reported that the rate was 9.1 percent in July.

Abstract: [...] while expensive stores turned in strong results, including a startling 15.6 percent increase at Saks Fifth Avenue, almost double what analysts had predicted, middle- and low-end stores were largely dependent on marked-down summer clothes for their increases. While gas prices have tempered a bit, they were still a dollar higher this July than a year ago, said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis at MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks gasoline prices and use along with overall consumer spending.

Full text: New data from July shows that the retail economy is locked on two tracks: one for businesses that cater to the well-to-do, and the other for everyone else.
Sales at stores open at least a year, as reported Thursday, rose 4.4 percent in July at the 25 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters. But while expensive stores turned in strong results, including a startling 15.6 percent increase at Saks Fifth Avenue, almost double what analysts had predicted, middle- and low-end stores were largely dependent on marked-down summer clothes for their increases.
"There's definitely been a split," said Ken Perkins, the president of the research firm Retail Metrics.
The divide has extended all the way to grocery stores, a manifestation of what Safeway's chief executive, Steven A. Burd, has described as a "bifurcated recovery."
"I can't give you a quantitative percentage, but my guess basically splits our customers as about 25 percent recession's over with, times are good, spending as they always did," he said in a recent call with investors. "And then the other 75 percent, really very cautious and very concerned."
Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Macy's, which owns Bloomingdale's, have outperformed other department stores throughout the year, mostly on the spending power of well-off shoppers, Mr. Perkins said. "They've been seeing better wage gains, more stability, and their confidence level is higher," he said.
Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus reported July increases of 6.6 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively. Saks said several major categories, including women's apparel, women's shoes, men's apparel and men's accessories, were big contributors to its increase. Nordstrom said women's shoes, dresses and cosmetics were popular, and the average purchase price increased compared with July of last year, even as visits fell.
At the other end of the retail scale, there has been a lack of confidence among shoppers.
There is "uncertainty affecting our customers, especially the lower income customer," said John Cato, chairman, president and chief executive of the Cato Corporation, in a statement. Cato sells budget fashion, and its same-store sales fell 3 percent; analysts had expected a 1 percent decline.
Kohl's, the midtier department store, also missed analyst expectations, by a margin of 8.1 percentage points. It reported a decline of 4.6 percent, saying that footwear and the children's department did worse than other categories.
Retail executives say poorer people are not buying at the end of the month, suggesting they are heavily dependent on month-to-month paychecks.
"In a soft economy like we're experiencing, the difference in sales between the beginning of the pay period and the end of the pay period is approaching double digits," said Mr. Burd of Safeway. "I've never seen that in 20 years."
With higher prices on gas, food and clothing, lower-end consumers just do not have much extra cash.
Safeway said its food inflation was up 2 percent in the second quarter. Clothing retailers are entering a season where prices are going to be higher than usual, because they paid for fall's merchandise when cotton was very expensive. Other raw-material costs are also increasing.
While gas prices have tempered a bit, they were still a dollar higher this July than a year ago, said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis at MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks gasoline prices and use along with overall consumer spending.
That dollar a gallon means money "that's being spent on the gasoline category or sector that's coming from other areas -- high gas prices do matter, and in July, it was about a $10 billion bill," he said.
In July shoppers went to air-conditioned malls to get out of the heat, but when they visited mid- and lower-end stores, they bought items to wear right away, not fall clothes. And they did not buy much of anything toward the end of the month. For instance, at J. C. Penney, where same-store sales rose 3.3 percent in July, there was "particular strength in the sales of 'wear now' summer apparel and fashion accessories," the company said. At Ross Stores, where same-store sales increased 7 percent, dresses were the top-performing category, with sales increasing in the high teens.
"Late July slowed materially, as shoppers were in search of 'wear now' product, and macro uncertainty affected consumer sentiment," Adrienne Tennant, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, wrote in a research note after same-store results were reported.
That is a troubling sign for back-to-school sales, which traditionally account for the second most important retail season, after the Christmas holiday.
Some schools start as early as July, and "generally, in early back-to-school markets, you would see a preponderance of early back-to-school and fall products" selling well, said Joel Bines, managing director in the global retail practice at the consultancy AlixPartners. But this year, the 100-degree weather in much of the country had shoppers skipping purchases of traditional sweaters, vests and other back-to-school items.
"Fall is not on anyone's mind, anywhere in the country, right now," Mr. Bines said.

Full text: NEW DELHI -- India's most powerful politician, Sonia Gandhi, has flown to the United States for surgery, said a spokesman for the governing Congress Party, which Mrs. Gandhi leads.
The nature of her illness was not disclosed, but the spokesman, Janardan Dwivedi, told reporters here that "generally her condition is satisfactory, but her operation has not taken place as yet."
Mr. Dwivedi would not disclose what operation Ms. Gandhi would undergo or when. He did say that she was expected to recuperate abroad for two or three weeks. He did not say whether that would be in the United States.
Mrs. Gandhi, 64, the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has transformed herself from a shy, foreign-born homemaker to a formidable political force. Though she holds no formal position in the government, she is without question the most powerful figure in the Congress Party, her influence far eclipsing that of Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister.
Mrs. Gandhi is deeply influential, especially on social policy. With the help of a quasi-governmental kitchen cabinet called the National Advisory Council, she has pushed expensive but popular social welfare programs that were an important factor in her party's election victory in 2009.
In 2004, when she led the Congress Party to power after six years in opposition, she resisted calls to become prime minister, instead choosing Mr. Singh, a soft-spoken economist who had ushered in economic reforms as finance minister in 1991.
Information about the Gandhi family is tightly guarded, but Mrs. Gandhi is not known to suffer from any major illnesses.
Her absence from India comes at a difficult time. The government is battling multiple corruption scandals and struggling to combat rising inflation and slumping economic growth.
Her son and heir apparent, Rahul, will lead the party in her absence along with three other senior Congress Party leaders, Mr. Dwivedi said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Retreating on Every Front: Time to Say It: Double Dip May Be Happening

Full text: Double dip may be back.
It has been three decades since the United States suffered a recession that followed on the heels of the previous one. But it could be happening again. The unrelenting negative economic news of the past two weeks has painted a picture of a United States economy that fell further and recovered less than we had thought.
When what may eventually be known as Great Recession I hit the country, there was general political agreement that it was incumbent on the government to fight back by stimulating the economy. It did, and the recession ended.
But Great Recession II, if that is what we are entering, has provoked a completely different response. Now the politicians are squabbling over how much to cut spending. After months of wrangling, they passed a bill aimed at forcing more reductions in spending over the next decade.
If this is the beginning of a new double dip, it will have two significant things in common with the dual recessions of 1980 and 1981-82.
In each case the first recession was caused in large part by a sudden withdrawal of credit from the economy. The recovery came when credit conditions recovered.
And in each case the second recession began at a time when the usual government policies to fight economic weakness were deemed unavailable. Then, the need to fight inflation ruled out an easier monetary policy. Now, the perceived need to reduce government spending rules out a more accommodating fiscal policy.
The American economy fell into what was at first a fairly mild recession at the end of 2007. But the downturn turned into a worldwide plunge after the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 led to the vanishing of credit for nearly all borrowers not deemed super-safe. Banks in the United States and other countries needed bailouts to survive.
The unavailability of credit caused a decline in world trade volumes of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression, and nearly every economy went into recession.
But it turned out that businesses overreacted. While sales to customers fell, they did not decline as much as production did.
That fact set the stage for an economic rebound that began in mid-2009, with the National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of such things, determining that the recession ended in June of that year. Manufacturers around the world reported rapidly rising orders.
Until recently, most observers believed the American economy was in a slow recovery, albeit one with very disappointing job growth. The official figures on gross domestic product showed the United States economy grew to a record size in the final three months of 2010, having erased the loss of 4.1 percent in G.D.P. from top to bottom.
Then last week the government announced its annual revision to the numbers for the last several years. New government surveys indicated Americans had spent less than previously estimated in 2009 and 2010 on a wide range of things, including food, clothing and computers. Tax returns showed Americans even cut back on gambling. The recession now appears to have been deeper -- a top-to-bottom fall of 5.1 percent -- and the recovery even less impressive. The economy is still smaller than it was in 2007.
In June, more American manufacturers said new orders fell than rose, according to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management. The margin was small, but the survey had shown rising orders for 24 consecutive months. Manufacturers in most European countries, including Germany and Britain, also reported weaker new orders.
Back in 1980, a recession was started when the government -- despairing of its failure to bring down surging inflation rates -- invoked controls aimed at limiting the expansion of credit and making it more costly for banks to make loans. Those controls proved to be far more effective than anyone expected, and the economy promptly tanked. In July the credit controls were ended, and the economic research bureau later determined that the recession ended that month.
By the first quarter of 1981 the economy was larger than it had been at the previous peak.
But little had been done about inflation, and the Federal Reserve was determined to slay that dragon. With interest rates high, home sales plunged in late 1981 to the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1963. Now they are even lower.
There is, of course, no assurance that a new recession has begun or will do so soon, and a positive jobs report on Friday morning could revive some optimism. But concerns have grown that the essential problems that led to the 2007-09 recession were not solved, just as inflation remained high throughout the 1980 downturn. Housing prices have not recovered, and millions of Americans owe more in mortgage debt than their homes are worth. Extremely low interest rates helped to push up corporate profits, but companies have hired relatively few people.
In any other cycle, the recent spate of poor economic news would have resulted in politicians vying with one another to propose programs to revive growth. President Obama has called for more spending on infrastructure, but there appears to be little chance Congress will take any action. The focus in Washington is now on deciding where to reduce spending, not increase it.
There have been some hints that the Federal Reserve might be willing to resume purchasing government bonds, which it stopped doing in June, despite opposition from conservative members of Congress. But the revised economic data may indicate that the previous program -- known as QE2, for quantitative easing -- had even less impact than had been thought. With short-term interest rates near zero, the Fed's monetary policy options are limited.
Government stimulus programs historically have often appeared to be accomplishing little until the cumulative effect suddenly helps to power a self-sustaining recovery. This time, the best hope may be that the stimulus we have already had will prove to have been enough.

Learning To Live With Debt

Abstract: [...] a tax credit would encourage homeownership without simultaneously providing more incentives for households to accumulate more debt. [...] lower corporate income tax rates, he said, could offset reductions in the deductibility of interest "without simultaneously providing incentives for corporations to acquire leverage." "A financial system with dangerously low capital levels -- hence prone to major collapses -- creates a nontransparent contingent liability for the federal budget in the United States," said Simon Johnson, an M.I.T. economist and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, in Congressional testimony last week.

Full text: Debt can kill. But you can't live without it.
Seldom have those twin realities been as stark as they are now. It was excessive debt brought on by too-easy credit that brought down the American economy and allowed some European countries to borrow money they will never be able to pay back. It is fear of debt that threatens to keep the United States from doing much to prevent a double dip recession.
A considerable part of the current economic strain stems from the fact that the credit overhang continues to haunt borrowers around the world. The lenders may have been bailed out, but the borrowers were not -- or at least not enough to return them to health. Millions of Americans remain underwater on mortgage loans. Countries that lack printing presses for their own currency find themselves unable to borrow from private lenders.
In the long run, inflation may be a significant part of the solution, enabling borrowers to pay back dollars and euros that are worth a lot less than the ones they borrowed. The soaring price of gold, now around $1,650 an ounce, makes sense only if you assume something like that is going to happen.
But for now, such inflation is not on the horizon. To get by, the sad reality is that those who can raise capital may need to do so for the benefit of others. Germany has grudgingly moved toward that with the latest bailout of Greece, but the United States -- which now pays 2.4 percent to borrow money for 10 years, more than a percentage point less than it paid six months ago -- seemingly has no desire to try to save its own economy, let alone anyone else's.
The effort to slash spending with the possibility of a new recession looming may be foolish. Larry Summers, the economist and former Treasury secretary, pointed out in The Financial Times this week that tax receipts over the next decade would be about $1 trillion lower -- and debt that much larger -- if economic growth were shaved by half a percentage point a year. That is about the same amount that the bill passed this week claims it will save.
It appears that not much of that saving will be in the next couple of years, although the further cuts promised late this year could change that.
What is needed now is both a willingness to spend to offset the impact of the last debt debacle and a determined effort to ensure it does not happen again. But those efforts are stalling. Banks are lobbying with some success in both the United States and Europe to delay and weaken capital requirements.
And the American government shows no interest in doing anything about the incentives in current law that favor borrowing over equity. If you buy a house with the largest mortgage possible, you will pay lower taxes than if you borrowed less. Companies pay interest on loans out of pretax income, so the more they owe, the less they pay in taxes. But dividends are paid out of after-tax money.
"The U.S. tax system encourages household leverage and bank leverage, even though both are potentially destabilizing," is the way Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, put it in a recent speech. He offered a rather modest suggestion: lower the proportion of interest payments that are deductible.
There are, of course, claims that both tax policies produce greater good for the society, by encouraging homeownership and corporate investment. He suggested "replacing the mortgage interest deduction with a tax credit that offsets part of a buyer's down payment toward a home purchase. Such a tax credit would encourage homeownership without simultaneously providing more incentives for households to accumulate more debt." And lower corporate income tax rates, he said, could offset reductions in the deductibility of interest "without simultaneously providing incentives for corporations to acquire leverage."
The fact that those suggestions have virtually no political support reflects one of the great political and economic challenges of this era: Governments now feel a need to encourage economic growth, but don't want to spend money. Encouraging leverage seems like a good idea.
But it does have major risks. "A financial system with dangerously low capital levels -- hence prone to major collapses -- creates a nontransparent contingent liability for the federal budget in the United States," said Simon Johnson, an M.I.T. economist and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, in Congressional testimony last week. "This can only lead to further instability, deep recessions, and damage to our fiscal balance sheet, in a version of what the Bank of England refers to as a 'doom loop.' "
In plain English, he means Uncle Sam will get stuck with the debt when banks blow up. The fact that happened in the recent cycle is a major cause of the rising debt that seems so alarming to those who demand immediate cuts in spending totally unrelated to the financial crisis.
To hear banks tell it, every extra dollar of capital that they are forced to hold is one dollar less they can lend, and one dollar less of economic growth that the world desperately needs.
Economically, that may not make much sense. Anat Admati, a Stanford economist, argues that capital rules may force banks to change the mix of financing, but not the level. They can, she argues, simply issue more equity and have the same amount of money available to lend. And, she suggests, they will be a lot safer.
Such a strategy would reverse decades of growing leverage on bank balance sheets, and it could mean lower returns on equity, which is often the measure banks use in setting executive compensation. It would make bank failures much less likely, but "too big to fail" institutions may see little need for it.
Bank capital rules historically were a cause of the problem at least as much as they were an effort to deal with it. It is not only the level of required capital that matters, but the way it is computed. The rules allow banks to measure "risk-adjusted assets," so they have to hold little or no capital against low risk assets. That may make sense in theory, but in practice it was possible for banks to game the system by loading up on assets that were measured as very low risk even if they were not.
That was one reason so many banks thousands of miles away from the United States owned large amounts of securities backed by American subprime mortgages. The rating agencies said they were AAA, so profits could be earned at no cost to capital. Whoops.
Similarly, the old rules said that banks could lend to their own governments with zero risk. In Europe, that was extended to include all governments in the European Union. Now there is much hand-wringing over the fact that banks have huge exposures to Greece and other peripheral euro zone countries, and must raise large amounts of new capital.
You might think new rules would do something about that. But bank regulations are set by governments, and governments want to be able to borrow as cheaply as possible. On July 20, the European Commission proposed new rules for bank capital. Those rules specified that loans to member states should be treated as having zero risk, so long as the country was borrowing in its local currency.
That was one day before a European summit ended in an agreement that will cause banks to take substantial losses on euro-denominated loans to Greece.
In Europe they want to pretend that some risky assets are really perfectly safe. In the United States, fear that this country could somehow be a new Greece was whipped up to justify inaction in the face of evidence that the economy could be in danger of sliding into a new recession. Stock markets sold off around the world over the last two weeks, with Thursday the worst day yet.
Charting a course that ameliorates the problems left by the last leverage fiasco while minimizing the chances for a new one was never going to be easy. So far, neither Europe nor the United States is doing a very good job.

Full text: In case you had any doubts, Thursday's more than 500-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average and the drop in interest rates to near-record lows confirmed it: The economy isn't recovering, and Washington has been worrying about the wrong things.
It's not just that the threat of a double-dip recession has become very real. It's now impossible to deny the obvious, which is that we are not now and have never been on the road to recovery.
For two years, officials at the Federal Reserve, international organizations and, sad to say, within the Obama administration have insisted that the economy was on the mend. Every setback was attributed to temporary factors -- It's the Greeks! It's the tsunami! -- that would soon fade away. And the focus of policy turned from jobs and growth to the supposedly urgent issue of deficit reduction.
But the economy wasn't on the mend.
Yes, officially the recession ended two years ago, and the economy did indeed pull out of a terrifying tailspin. But at no point has growth looked remotely adequate given the depth of the initial plunge. In particular, when employment falls as much as it did from 2007 to 2009, you need a lot of job growth to make up the lost ground. And that just hasn't happened.
Consider one crucial measure, the ratio of employment to population. In June 2007, around 63 percent of adults were employed. In June 2009, the official end of the recession, that number was down to 59.4. As of June 2011, two years into the alleged recovery, the number was: 58.2.
These may sound like dry statistics, but they reflect a truly terrible reality. Not only are vast numbers of Americans unemployed or underemployed, for the first time since the Great Depression many American workers are facing the prospect of very-long-term -- maybe permanent -- unemployment. Among other things, the rise in long-term unemployment will reduce future government revenues, so we're not even acting sensibly in purely fiscal terms. But, more important, it's a human catastrophe.
And why should we be surprised at this catastrophe? Where was growth supposed to come from? Consumers, still burdened by the debt that they ran up during the housing bubble, aren't ready to spend. Businesses see no reason to expand given the lack of consumer demand. And thanks to that deficit obsession, government, which could and should be supporting the economy in its time of need, has been pulling back.
Now it looks as if it's all about to get even worse. So what's the response?
To turn this disaster around, a lot of people are going to have to admit, to themselves at least, that they've been wrong and need to change their priorities, right away.
Of course, some players won't change. Republicans won't stop screaming about the deficit because they weren't sincere in the first place: Their deficit hawkery was a club with which to beat their political opponents, nothing more -- as became obvious whenever any rise in taxes on the rich was suggested. And they're not going to give up that club.
But the policy disaster of the past two years wasn't just the result of G.O.P. obstructionism, which wouldn't have been so effective if the policy elite -- including at least some senior figures in the Obama administration -- hadn't agreed that deficit reduction, not job creation, should be our main priority. Nor should we let Ben Bernanke and his colleagues off the hook: The Fed has by no means done all it could, partly because it was more concerned with hypothetical inflation than with real unemployment, partly because it let itself be intimidated by the Ron Paul types.
Well, it's time for all that to stop. Those plunging interest rates and stock prices say that the markets aren't worried about either U.S. solvency or inflation. They're worried about U.S. lack of growth. And they're right, even if on Wednesday the White House press secretary chose, inexplicably, to declare that there's no threat of a double-dip recession.
Earlier this week, the word was that the Obama administration would "pivot" to jobs now that the debt ceiling has been raised. But what that pivot would mean, as far as I can tell, was proposing some minor measures that would be more symbolic than substantive. And, at this point, that kind of proposal would just make President Obama look ridiculous.
The point is that it's now time -- long past time -- to get serious about the real crisis the economy faces. The Fed needs to stop making excuses, while the president needs to come up with real job-creation proposals. And if Republicans block those proposals, he needs to make a Harry Truman-style campaign against the do-nothing G.O.P.
This might or might not work. But we already know what isn't working: the economic policy of the past two years -- and the millions of Americans who should have jobs, but don't.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Once again seeking to calm market tension, the European Central Bank intervened unexpectedly in bond markets on Thursday in an effort to prevent the region's debt crisis from engulfing Italy.
The show of force initially bolstered Italian and Spanish bonds. But the move appeared to backfire as stock markets in Europe and the United States fell sharply after Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank's president, warned of dangers ahead, while the modest scale of the bank's bond-buying apparently fell short of what investors considered adequate.
Compounding the tension, a top European official said that a deal reached two weeks ago to ease the debt crisis was not working and urged leaders to consider bolstering the region's existing bailout fund.
European leaders decided last month to authorize the European Financial Stability Facility -- the European Union's bailout fund -- to buy bonds in open markets, relieving the central bank of that responsibility. But it will take months before the rescue fund is able to start making purchases. In addition, European leaders did not increase the size of the fund, leaving questions about whether it would be up to the task if a country as big as Italy or Spain needed help.
The European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, has been pushing euro zone leaders to do more. In a letter released Thursday, he called for a "rapid reassessment of all elements" related to the stability fund, so that it was "equipped with the means for dealing with contagious risk."
He also criticized European politicians for "the undisciplined communication and the complexity and incompleteness" of the package agreed to at the summit meeting on July 21.
"Markets remain to be convinced that we are taking the appropriate steps to resolve the crisis," he wrote. "Whatever the factors behind the lack of success, it is clear that we are no longer managing a crisis just in the euro area periphery."
As part of its response to the crisis, the central bank also moved to prop up weaker banks that may be having trouble raising cash, expanding its lending to euro zone institutions at the benchmark interest rate. The central bank left that rate unchanged at 1.5 percent, while the Bank of England left its benchmark rate at a record low of 0.5 percent.
Mr. Trichet declined to say what bonds the bank was buying or how much. He said the bank acted in response to "renewed tensions in some financial markets in the euro area." It was the first such intervention since March.
Traders said the central bank had bought Irish and Portuguese government debt during the day. But the bank did not buy bonds of Italy and Spain, two countries with huge bond markets and now seen as most vulnerable in the region.
The move to buy Portuguese and Irish debt made little sense, given that they are insulated by their official bailouts and no longer have to raise money on the market, said Michael Leister, a fixed-income analyst at WestLB in Dusseldorf, Germany.
Mr. Trichet, however, had "opened the door to acting on behalf of Spain and Italy," he added. The yield on 10-year Italian debt rose 11 basis points, to 6.19 percent. Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds rose three basis points, to 6.28 percent. Earlier, Spain sold 3.3 billion euros, or $4.7 billion, of bonds due in 2014 with demand more than twice the level of supply. But the average yield rose to 4.813 percent from 4.037 percent at a comparable auction in June.
"Over all, sentiment hasn't changed yet," Mr. Leister said after the central bank had acted. "Everyone's afraid that the debt spiral will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. And the E.C.B. is the only institution with the firepower to stop the situation in the short term."
The central bank first began buying bonds in the open market in May 2010 but tapered off the interventions earlier this year, a move investors may have interpreted as a lack of resolve. Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Stamford, Conn., warned Thursday that half-hearted forays into the bond market "will fail, just like they did last year."
"In each case, the debt crisis got worse instead of better," he wrote in a note.
The central bank also responded to signs of stress in interbank markets when institutions, wary of each other's exposure to troubled government paper, became reluctant to lend to each other. One worrisome sign was a surge in the cost at which European banks borrow dollars in the open foreign exchange market.
Mr. Trichet said that next week the central bank would lend banks as much cash as they wanted for six months at the benchmark interest rate, assuming the banks could provide collateral. A six-month term is longer than is customary.
Speaking to reporters Thursday after a regular meeting of the bank's governing council, Mr. Trichet also gave a more subdued view of the European economy.
"As expected, recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months, following the strong growth rate in the first quarter," he said. While he expected moderate growth to continue, he said, "uncertainty is particularly high."
Nonetheless, some analysts said they still expected the bank to raise its benchmark rate for the 17-nation euro zone again this year, after Mr. Trichet retires at the end of October, handing the presidency to Mario Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy. The central bank has raised its main rate in two steps since April, from 1 percent to the current 1.5 percent, in an attempt to head off rising inflation.
"The E.C.B. gave the impression that further rate hikes are necessary," Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said. "However, the E.C.B. would probably immediately refrain from raising interest rates if the sovereign debt crisis escalated."
Mr. Trichet beseeched political leaders to speed up efforts to cut their budget deficits and remove impediments to growth, like overly protected labor markets. "The key for everything is to get ahead of the curve, in fiscal policy and structural reform," he said.
With Italy in danger of being swept over the same waterfall as Greece, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Thursday pledged sweeping changes to increase growth.
He said the measures would include privatization, infrastructure projects, cutting administrative hurdles, streamlining the government, and carrying out a "historic" change to Italy's constitution that would require balanced budgets.
"We want to adopt a comprehensive pact" between the government, labor unions and businesses "absolutely by September," Mr. Berlusconi said, a day after addressing Parliament.
Mr. Berlusconi played down growing fears that Italy could become the next country at risk in the spreading European debt crisis. "I don't think the crisis will get worse," he said. "We should not be afraid about the current level of spreads because they only affect a small part of the public debt at any moment, which overall remains at the interest rates it was placed at years ago."
At a news conference later, the Italian finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, said Italy was in contact with the European Union, International Monetary Fund and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on strategies for growth.
Mr. Berlusconi interrupted Mr. Tremonti, to add, "And the E.C.B." Mr. Tremonti looked taken aback and said, "I think it's important, but not involved." He suggested the hope the bank would buy some Italian bonds.

Full text: MasterCard said second-quarter profit jumped 33 percent, as inflation in the United States lifted spending volume and more international consumers used debit and credit cards.
Its shares rose 13.39 percent, or $39.98, to close at $338.47 on the news.
MasterCard said signing up two big banks -- SunTrust Banks and Banco Santander's American affiliate Sovereign Bank -- to offer MasterCard debit cards had helped increase revenue in the second quarter. The two banks previously offered Visa debit cards.
MasterCard executives told analysts on a conference call that the company had benefited from overseas customers using debit and credit cards instead of cash to make payments.
United States economic weakness is now translating to slower inflation or even deflation, which could cut into the dollar size of transactions that MasterCard processes in the coming quarters. But analysts said the company's expanding international business can offset any domestic slowdown.
"They're getting strength from other areas," said Shannon Stemm, a financial services analyst with Edward Jones.
MasterCard on Wednesday reported second-quarter net income of $608 million or $4.76 a share, up from $458 million, or $3.49 a share, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected $4.23 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Visa also beat analysts' expectations when it reported quarterly results last week.
MasterCard executives said they would alter their debit interchange fee structure before new industry fee caps were imposed on those charges later this year.
The fees are charged to merchants for processing customers' debit card transactions. The so-called Durbin amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law placed a cap on those fees and takes effect later this year.
Last week, Visa said it would introduce a flat network participation fee, and lowered the per-transaction rate for processing all United States transactions.
MasterCard's revenue increased 22 percent to $1.7 billion as its cross-border and overseas business grew.
Over all, MasterCard's cross-border transactions rose 19.3 percent, and processed transactions increased 17.4 percent.
The company said it also gained from new processing business in the Netherlands and Brazil.
Total operating expenses increased 20 percent to $782 million. MasterCard said the rise was because of higher personnel costs related to acquisitions.

Abstract: The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal debt is likely to exceed 100 percent of the nation's annual economic output by 2021, largely because of the rising cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. [...] the two sides could not agree to include extensions of payroll tax cuts or unemployment benefits, both scheduled to expire at the end of the year.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- There is something you should know about the deal to cut federal spending that President Obama signed into law on Tuesday: It does not actually reduce federal spending.
By the end of the 10-year deal, the federal debt would be much larger than it is today.
Indeed, both the government and its debts will continue to grow faster than the American economy, primarily because the new law does not address federal spending on health care.
That is the reason that the ratings agency Standard & Poor's and its rivals still are threatening to remove the United States from their lists of risk-free borrowers, although the other agencies, Moody's and Fitch, both said Tuesday that they would watch and wait for now.
It is also the reason that many conservative Republicans refused to vote for the agreement, calling it a grossly inadequate answer to a pressing problem.
"The current deal to raise the debt ceiling doesn't stop us from going over the fiscal cliff," Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, wrote Monday in an open letter explaining his opposition. "At best, it slows us from going over it at 80 m.p.h. to going over it at 60 m.p.h.."
Proponents of the deal counter that it is an important first step, constrained by the political realities of divided government. Republicans want to reduce the debt solely through cuts in spending, while Democrats favor a mix of cuts and increased revenues.
Both parties are pointing to the 2012 elections as a national referendum on how to proceed.
"Is this the deal I would have preferred? No," Mr. Obama said Sunday in announcing the agreement. "But this compromise does make a serious down payment on the deficit reduction we need, and gives each party a strong incentive to get a balanced plan done before the end of the year."
The problem facing the nation has been clear for some time. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal debt is likely to exceed 100 percent of the nation's annual economic output by 2021, largely because of the rising cost of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
Americans will face higher taxes, particularly as investors begin to demand higher interest rates. Economists disagree about the amount of debt a nation can safely carry relative to the size of its economy, but there is widespread concern that 100 percent is too much, and that the weight of debt would begin to suppress economic activity.
Stabilizing that ratio would require about $4 trillion in cuts over the next decade, according to a number of independent analysts. That is also the target that S.&P. declared the nation must meet, and it was the goal of the "grand bargain" that Mr. Obama tried to reach last month with Speaker John A. Boehner.
The deal they reached instead contains cuts of at least $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years. By the end of that period, the federal debt could equal as much as 80 percent of economic activity, and rising. That assumes Congress chooses to preserve all of the Bush-era tax cuts, but even if Democrats succeeded in rolling back cuts for the wealthy, the ratio could reach 76 percent, and rising.
"This was a huge missed opportunity," said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "Any sensible solution requires that you need to stabilize the debt so that it's not growing faster than the economy."
Ms. MacGuineas, like many independent observers, also is concerned that the government is cutting back on spending too quickly. The debt-ceiling deal would reduce spending by only a few billion dollars this year. But the two sides could not agree to include extensions of payroll tax cuts or unemployment benefits, both scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Stimulus spending also is winding down.
"We needed to be more aware that we didn't derail the economy in the short run, and we needed more deficit reduction in the long run," she said. If the deal undermines the economic recovery, she noted, the decline in tax revenues could worsen the problem.
Although it does not solve the basic problem, the deal would impose real constraints on spending. The law creates a bipartisan commission to identify at least $1.2 trillion in spending cuts by Thanksgiving. It also caps the amounts that Congress can spend over the next decade in a trillion-dollar slice of the federal budget called discretionary spending, which includes, among other things, financing for transportation, basic research and the national defense.
To comply with the law, Congress must reduce appropriations by about $25 billion for the budget year that begins in October. The following year, appropriations can increase by $4 billion. Every year thereafter, spending can grow to keep pace with inflation.
The Congressional Budget Office calculated the financial impact of the plan by comparing it to a situation in which spending kept pace with inflation throughout the 10-year period, and concluded that the government would save about $917 billion -- including interest on money it would not need to borrow.
Assuming that the economy continues to grow, the affected government programs will receive an ever-smaller share of the nation's resources. Moreover, discretionary spending includes the cost of health care for veterans, which, like other health care costs, is climbing much faster than inflation, requiring a larger share of the available money with each passing year.
Proponents describe these constraints as necessary and significant.
"We are actually cutting spending," said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. "That's cultural, that's significant, that's a big step in the right direction."
Critics, however, are skeptical that Congress will follow through. They note that Congress imposed similar limits on spending in the 1980s and '90s, only to grant itself repeated exceptions. They said that cutting specific programs would be a more credible strategy.
"It does nothing to address the real drivers of our debt," said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, explaining his decision to vote against the bill. "It eliminates no program, consolidates no duplicative programs, cuts no tax earmarks and reforms no entitlement program."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Medicaid money created quite a nice life for the Levy brothers from Flatbush, Brooklyn.
The brothers, Philip and Joel, earned close to $1 million a year each as the two top executives running a Medicaid-financed nonprofit organization serving the developmentally disabled.
They each had luxury cars paid for with public money. And when their children went to college, they could pass on the tuition bills to their nonprofit group.
Philip H. Levy went as far as charging the organization $50,400 for his daughter's living expenses one year when she attended graduate school at New York University. That money paid not for a dorm room, but rather it helped her buy a co-op apartment in Greenwich Village.
The rise of the Levy brothers, from scruffy bearded social workers in the 1970s to millionaires with homes in the Hamptons, Sutton Place and Palm Beach Gardens, reveals much about New York's system for caring for the developmentally disabled -- those with conditions like cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and autism.
The state spends, by far, more than any other caring for this population: $10 billion this year, and roughly 20 cents of every dollar spent nationally.
More than half of that money goes to private providers like the Levys, with little oversight of their spending.
And the providers have become so big and powerful that they shape much about how the system operates, from what kinds of care are emphasized to how much they will be paid for it.
"They're bigger than government in some ways," said Thomas A. Maul, former commissioner of the state's Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. "That isn't what our system was supposed to be."
The organization run by the Levys, the Young Adult Institute Network, has been among the most aggressive, and is now the largest operator of group homes for the state, collecting more than $1 billion from Medicaid over the past decade and running homes with a total of 700 beds, along with day programs, a school, dental care and transportation for the developmentally disabled.
The organization and the Levys have earned many admirers in the field for the quality and range of their programs. They are known for recruiting and keeping good employees, many of whom spend decades with the organization.
But their spending is seldom scrutinized, and, even when state officials turn up questionable expenses, there are few consequences.
The state, of course, has a financial interest in maintaining and expanding the programs, which bring more federal money and more jobs, especially to areas upstate, where many of the nonprofit organizations are major employers.
At the end of June, two days after The New York Times asked about the spending for his daughter's apartment, Philip Levy, 60, abruptly retired as chief executive. Joel M. Levy, 67, also departed in June, after serving as a $250,000-a-year part-time consultant following his departure from the chief executive's position in 2009.
A spokesman said the changes were unrelated to the inquiry by The Times.
Filling a Vacuum
Philip and Joel Levy were running Saturday night bingo games to support a tiny program for 15 developmentally disabled people in the early 1970s when their whole world changed.
In 1972, Geraldo Rivera, then a young reporter at WABC-TV, found his way inside the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island, a state-run institution that housed some 5,000 developmentally disabled residents in deplorable conditions. His footage showed naked children huddled on floors, feces smeared on walls, and an attendant oddly grinning through the darkness.
Public outrage exploded. A lawsuit brought by a parents group, the New York State Association for Retarded Children, resulted in a court order that forced the state to quickly move thousands of people into smaller community homes.
The state released a wave of public money and turned to nonprofit providers, which opened more than 100 group homes from 1976 through 1979. The Young Adult Institute, founded by a psychologist and his wife in 1957, emerged as a leader, opening and operating a dozen group homes.
The Levy brothers were determined to be a part of the revolution in care, and ascended at the Young Adult Institute, eventually taking over the top jobs in 1979: Joel as executive director and Philip as associate executive director. Their ambition to expand sometimes conflicted with the views of the network's board of directors, made up mostly of parents of children with developmental disabilities, who felt that the organization should remain small and focused on their children.
Over the years, the parents were replaced by professionals from other fields who supported growth.
"They were the most entrepreneurial folks that I ever met," said Barbara B. Blum, who was in charge of the deinstitutionalization effort for New York. "When we were under court order to provide all kinds of services, the Levy brothers recognized the fact that there really was a vacuum, and they walked into it."
Ms. Blum credited the brothers with persuading first-rate dentists, doctors and other medical professionals -- "who wouldn't have touched some of the folks at Willowbrook," she said -- to treat developmentally disabled people.
The Young Adult Institute joined with other nonprofit providers to form a lobbying group, and, as the programs and spending multiplied, the relationship between the state and the providers gradually shifted.
The providers gained more sophistication, expertise and power.
The providers and officials from the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities -- now called the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities -- met monthly to agree on new programs, expansion of existing programs and reimbursement rates. Then, together with the agency officials, they would lobby the Legislature and the governor's office for the money.
The providers became powerful advocates for the people in their care, and savvy strategists, alert to opportunities to increase financing.
In the early 1980s, Paul J. Castellani, a former official at the state agency, was overseeing the design of an algorithm that determined reimbursement rates for each developmentally disabled individual, based on his or her level of impairment. The formula was supposed to be closely held. But state officials suspected that a consultant to the providers had learned that vision problems greatly increased the rates paid.
Suddenly, the nonprofit providers began reporting a big increase in the number of individuals in their care who had trouble seeing. "We called it the day everyone went blind," said Mr. Castellani, the author of a book about the New York system of caring for the developmentally disabled.
The Levys were especially resourceful. As state financing for creating new group homes slowed in the early 1990s, they expanded into other services for developmentally disabled people, including a preschool and kindergarten, medical clinics and a jobs program. In 1998, revenue at their organization topped $100 million for the first time.
That year, the state resumed its effort to establish group homes, offering a new wave of financing for nonprofit groups to develop them, even as other states shifted their focus to less expensive care, like helping people find and stay in apartments of their own. The Young Adult Institute was again among the biggest developers, adding some 250 beds in group homes over the next decade.
And its group homes tend to be among the most expensive run by nonprofit providers, at least according to the documents the organization submits to Medicaid.
Inflated Costs
On the 11th floor inside the Young Adult Institute's busy West 34th Street headquarters in Manhattan, a team of fund-raisers works year-round to plan the organization's biggest annual events: a gala dinner at the Pierre hotel off Fifth Avenue that attracts celebrities like Al Roker and Harry Smith, and a Central Park fun run and walk.
But at the end of each year, from 1999 to 2010, when it came time for the organization to seek its Medicaid reimbursements, those fund-raising employees suddenly became group home administrative workers on accounting records, allowing for federal reimbursement of their salaries, according to federal prosecutors.
Prosecutors also said the organization submitted documents falsely asserting that all of its group home regional directors were licensed social workers -- again inflating reimbursements for their salaries from Medicaid.
The prosecutors, from the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, with assistance from the New York attorney general's office, brought a federal false claims lawsuit under seal in 2009 against the organization for the practices, which were brought to their attention by a whistle-blower, Richard Faden, the nonprofit group's longtime budget director. Mr. Faden, who was involved in the preparation of the documents, told prosecutors that for years expenses had been pumped up on annual financial reports to win higher reimbursements from Medicaid.
Last January, the organization agreed to pay $18 million in restitution and penalties to settle the suit, denying wrongdoing and saying it had made errors "under the complex cost-reporting rules that apply to Y.A.I.'s residential services." A spokesman last week added that the organization had decided that the settlement would be less costly and disruptive than protracted litigation.
In June, the nonprofit group submitted a plan to the state, saying it would repay the money in part by keeping its executive salaries flat for a period of years. Last month, the state rejected that proposal, saying it expected executive pay to be reduced.
Records show that, over the years, the organization and other providers have had remarkable success in winning appeals for higher Medicaid reimbursements from the state, resulting in more than $100 million in additional spending on group home care in the state over the past decade.
The nonprofit groups have wide latitude in appeals. If they can show they lost money, they can apply for more financing for, say, a resident who requires extra attention for behavioral problems or develops a medical issue, or for expenses like utilities that exceed their budget.
The appeals system generally receives little scrutiny. But in 1995, the Commission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons With Disabilities, a state watchdog agency, released a report that found deep flaws in the process, including that the Young Adult Institute and six other nonprofit groups had been granted rate appeals to cover "excessive administrative costs."
The report was not received warmly by the nonprofit providers and their allies in Albany. The following year, the commission's budget was slashed by the Legislature.
The Young Adult Institute won more than $1 million in Medicaid appeals over the past seven years for a single group home -- a residence on East 35th Street -- one of the most expensive homes of its kind in the state. For care of the 28 developmentally disabled people housed there, whose needs are among the most acute in the nonprofit system, the organization received $7.2 million in 2010, or $700 per person per night.
Over all, the organization's rates for group homes at the intermediate care level, which require higher levels of care and supervision, rose by 48 percent from 2004 to 2010. Rates for similar group homes run by nonprofit providers around the state increased by 37 percent during the same period, while inflation was 15 percent.
'Medicaid Moguls'
Mr. Castellani, the former Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities official, calls them "Medicaid moguls" -- the nonprofit executives who have prospered while providing services to 135,000 developmentally disabled people in New York.
At the top of the class are the executives at the Young Adult Institute. No organization in the field in New York has paid its executives as well. Four of its executives received compensation in excess of $500,000 in 2009; none of its competitors had more than one executive at that level, according to a review by The Times of tax returns of the 100 largest providers.
That year, the last for which tax filings are available, Joel Levy collected more than $1 million and Philip was close behind, with $916,647. The chief operating officers, Thomas Dern and Stephen Freeman, earned $551,682 and $578,938.
Similar-sized nonprofit groups in New York pay an average salary to chief executives of $493,000, according to the Economic Research Institute, an executive compensation consulting company that advises companies, nonprofit groups and the Internal Revenue Service.
The Young Adult Institute also pays for its top executives to lease vehicles for personal and professional use. Accounting obtained by the state showed leases for two Lexuses and a Volvo. A spokesman declined to provide details about the cars, except to say the executives are allowed to select their own vehicles within certain price ranges.
Marcella C. Fava, who led the organization's board for more than 20 years, said the compensation was based on the findings of companies that specialize in compensation analyses.
She said the companies surveyed salaries among nonprofit organizations within the field, but also made allowances for the Young Adult Institute's "singular" size and complexity.
"Our retention programs have worked," she said, speaking of the broader management. "We've got a more experienced management team than, I think, any other agency."
Linda M. Lampkin, research director of the Economic Research Institute, was puzzled by Ms. Fava's explanation, saying her organization's database of tax returns filed by every nonprofit organization in the country shows nothing close to the Levys' compensation.
"If you look at what others are being paid, I don't know where their comparisons are coming from, because I can't find anything," she said.
At the Young Adult Institute, there were other elements of compensation within those big numbers, like the tuition compensation: for eight years ending in 2004, the organization directly covered the costs of college for children of several senior-level executives, including Philip Levy and Mr. Freeman.
The existence of the tuition program was discovered in 2009 by the state's Commission for Quality Care during a limited review of the organization in response to a tip. The results were never publicly released but were obtained by The Times under the state's Freedom of Information Law.
After The Times discovered property records showing the purchase of the co-op apartment for Philip Levy's daughter, the organization confirmed that the money from the tuition program had been used to buy her the West 12th Street home.
The Young Adult Institute spokesman declined to say how much was spent on education expenses, but in its final year, the program provided $132,611 to cover tuition for four children of three executives, including Philip Levy.
Ms. Fava said it was viewed as an attractive benefit for top executives. Several were confronting big college tuition bills at about the same time.
"This seemed to be a really nice retention tool," Ms. Fava said. "It had a quality to it, we're going to help you pay for your kids' college. So, sure, we could have increased their salary or given them a bonus. But this had a nicer, you know, cultural component to it."
The report also noted that a Young Adult Institute affiliate, the New York League for Early Learning, had paid the Levy brothers consulting fees of about $50,000 a year from 2007 through 2009, on top of their salaries. And it questioned other expenses, including lunches and dinners for executives and the $1,468 that Philip Levy spent to stay for two nights at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2008, which he said was for a meeting with a possible donor.
The commission, which has no enforcement powers, suggested that the organization's board "consider carefully" whether certain expenditures "are compatible with the obligation of the board to act as a faithful steward of public funds." More than 95 percent of the organization's revenue comes from government sources, primarily Medicaid.
In June, two days after The Times e-mailed a Young Adult Institute spokesman seeking more detail about the tuition program, the Levy brothers ended their employment there. The organization announced the departures two weeks later in a press release, saying Philip Levy was retiring, but quoting him as saying he was looking forward "to a new stage of my career." The spokesman, Jesse Derris, said that Joel Levy's departure as a consultant had been expected, and that Philip Levy had been unable to come to terms on a new contract with the group's board.
The Levys appear to be financially well prepared for the next phase of their lives. Each received deferred compensation totaling about $1.8 million in 2008 and 2009.
Courtney Burke, commissioner of the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, last week took a step toward reining in high executive salaries at the nonprofit groups. She sent a one-page letter to them on Tuesday seeking their assistance to develop "a consistent and rational model of compensation."
"Given the heightened concerns about the growth of Medicaid and Medicare, this compensation guidance should be established sooner rather than later," she wrote.
A spokesman for Ms. Burke said that if the providers were unable to agree on an approach, her office had the authority to write compensation standards into state regulations and contracts with providers.
Whatever concerns exist about executive compensation, the Young Adult Institute clearly has fans among families of developmentally disabled people.
Margaret Puddington said her 30-year-old son, Mark, had been participating in its programs for several years before he moved into a Young Adult Institute group home four years ago. Ms. Puddington said the organization excelled at hiring caring people, investing in training and supervising programs.
"Mark loves his life," she said. "I don't know what higher compliment there could be. He loves his staff. He loves his housemates. He loves his activities. They watch over him very, very carefully all the time."
During an interview at his office in May, Philip Levy declined to discuss his compensation or that of his brother. He repeatedly said how much he loved his work and said the public money had been well spent on services.
There was no indication during the interview that he would depart weeks later. "I think one of the things New York has to do is puff out its chest a bit and say, 'We are incredibly proud that we created the best system of care for people with developmental disabilities anywhere in this country,' " he said.

The rise of the Levy brothers, from scruffy bearded social workers in the 1970s to millionaires with homes in the Hamptons, Sutton Place and Palm Beach Gardens, reveals much about New York's system for caring for the developmentally disabled -- those with conditions like cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and autism.
The state spends, by far, more than any other caring for this population: $10 billion this year, and roughly 20 cents of every dollar spent nationally.
More than half of that money goes to private providers like the Levys, with little oversight of their spending.
And the providers have become so big and powerful that they shape much about how the system operates, from what kinds of care are emphasized to how much they will be paid for it.
"They're bigger than government in some ways," said Thomas A. Maul, former commissioner of the state's Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. "That isn't what our system was supposed to be."
The organization run by the Levys, the Young Adult Institute Network, has been among the most aggressive, and is now the largest operator of group homes for the state, collecting more than $1 billion from Medicaid over the past decade and running homes with a total of 700 beds, along with day programs, a school, dental care and transportation for the developmentally disabled.
The organization and the Levys have earned many admirers in the field for the quality and range of their programs. They are known for recruiting and keeping good employees, many of whom spend decades with the organization.
But their spending is seldom scrutinized, and, even when state officials turn up questionable expenses, there are few consequences.
The state, of course, has a financial interest in maintaining and expanding the programs, which bring more federal money and more jobs, especially to areas upstate, where many of the nonprofit organizations are major employers.
At the end of June, two days after The New York Times asked about the spending for his daughter's apartment, Philip Levy, 60, abruptly retired as chief executive. Joel M. Levy, 67, also departed in June, after serving as a $250,000-a-year part-time consultant following his departure from the chief executive's position in 2009.
A spokesman said the changes were unrelated to the inquiry by The Times.
Filling a Vacuum
Philip and Joel Levy were running Saturday night bingo games to support a tiny program for 15 developmentally disabled people in the early 1970s when their whole world changed.
In 1972, Geraldo Rivera, then a young reporter at WABC-TV, found his way inside the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island, a state-run institution that housed some 5,000 developmentally disabled residents in deplorable conditions. His footage showed naked children huddled on floors, feces smeared on walls, and an attendant oddly grinning through the darkness.
Public outrage exploded. A lawsuit brought by a parents group, the New York State Association for Retarded Children, resulted in a court order that forced the state to quickly move thousands of people into smaller community homes.
The state released a wave of public money and turned to nonprofit providers, which opened more than 100 group homes from 1976 through 1979. The Young Adult Institute, founded by a psychologist and his wife in 1957, emerged as a leader, opening and operating a dozen group homes.
The Levy brothers were determined to be a part of the revolution in care, and ascended at the Young Adult Institute, eventually taking over the top jobs in 1979: Joel as executive director and Philip as associate executive director. Their ambition to expand sometimes conflicted with the views of the network's board of directors, made up mostly of parents of children with developmental disabilities, who felt that the organization should remain small and focused on their children.
Over the years, the parents were replaced by professionals from other fields who supported growth.
"They were the most entrepreneurial folks that I ever met," said Barbara B. Blum, who was in charge of the deinstitutionalization effort for New York. "When we were under court order to provide all kinds of services, the Levy brothers recognized the fact that there really was a vacuum, and they walked into it."
Ms. Blum credited the brothers with persuading first-rate dentists, doctors and other medical professionals -- "who wouldn't have touched some of the folks at Willowbrook," she said -- to treat developmentally disabled people.
The Young Adult Institute joined with other nonprofit providers to form a lobbying group, and, as the programs and spending multiplied, the relationship between the state and the providers gradually shifted.
The providers gained more sophistication, expertise and power.
The providers and officials from the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities -- now called the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities -- met monthly to agree on new programs, expansion of existing programs and reimbursement rates. Then, together with the agency officials, they would lobby the Legislature and the governor's office for the money.
The providers became powerful advocates for the people in their care, and savvy strategists, alert to opportunities to increase financing.
In the early 1980s, Paul J. Castellani, a former official at the state agency, was overseeing the design of an algorithm that determined reimbursement rates for each developmentally disabled individual, based on his or her level of impairment. The formula was supposed to be closely held. But state officials suspected that a consultant to the providers had learned that vision problems greatly increased the rates paid.
Suddenly, the nonprofit providers began reporting a big increase in the number of individuals in their care who had trouble seeing. "We called it the day everyone went blind," said Mr. Castellani, the author of a book about the New York system of caring for the developmentally disabled.
The Levys were especially resourceful. As state financing for creating new group homes slowed in the early 1990s, they expanded into other services for developmentally disabled people, including a preschool and kindergarten, medical clinics and a jobs program. In 1998, revenue at their organization topped $100 million for the first time.
That year, the state resumed its effort to establish group homes, offering a new wave of financing for nonprofit groups to develop them, even as other states shifted their focus to less expensive care, like helping people find and stay in apartments of their own. The Young Adult Institute was again among the biggest developers, adding some 250 beds in group homes over the next decade.
And its group homes tend to be among the most expensive run by nonprofit providers, at least according to the documents the organization submits to Medicaid.
Inflated Costs
On the 11th floor inside the Young Adult Institute's busy West 34th Street headquarters in Manhattan, a team of fund-raisers works year-round to plan the organization's biggest annual events: a gala dinner at the Pierre hotel off Fifth Avenue that attracts celebrities like Al Roker and Harry Smith, and a Central Park fun run and walk.
But at the end of each year, from 1999 to 2010, when it came time for the organization to seek its Medicaid reimbursements, those fund-raising employees suddenly became group home administrative workers on accounting records, allowing for federal reimbursement of their salaries, according to federal prosecutors.
Prosecutors also said the organization submitted documents falsely asserting that all of its group home regional directors were licensed social workers -- again inflating reimbursements for their salaries from Medicaid.
The prosecutors, from the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, with assistance from the New York attorney general's office, brought a federal false claims lawsuit under seal in 2009 against the organization for the practices, which were brought to their attention by a whistle-blower, Richard Fagan, the nonprofit group's longtime budget director. Mr. Fagan, who was involved in the preparation of the documents, told prosecutors that for years expenses had been pumped up on annual financial reports to win higher reimbursements from Medicaid.
Last January, the organization agreed to pay $18 million in restitution and penalties to settle the suit, denying wrongdoing and saying it had made errors "under the complex cost-reporting rules that apply to Y.A.I.'s residential services." A spokesman last week added that the organization had decided that the settlement would be less costly and disruptive than protracted litigation.
In June, the nonprofit group submitted a plan to the state, saying it would repay the money in part by keeping its executive salaries flat for a period of years. Last month, the state rejected that proposal, saying it expected executive pay to be reduced.
Records show that, over the years, the organization and other providers have had remarkable success in winning appeals for higher Medicaid reimbursements from the state, resulting in more than $100 million in additional spending on group home care in the state over the past decade.
The nonprofit groups have wide latitude in appeals. If they can show they lost money, they can apply for more financing for, say, a resident who requires extra attention for behavioral problems or develops a medical issue, or for expenses like utilities that exceed their budget.
The appeals system generally receives little scrutiny. But in 1995, the Commission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons With Disabilities, a state watchdog agency, released a report that found deep flaws in the process, including that the Young Adult Institute and six other nonprofit groups had been granted rate appeals to cover "excessive administrative costs."
The report was not received warmly by the nonprofit providers and their allies in Albany. The following year, the commission's budget was slashed by the Legislature.
The Young Adult Institute won more than $1 million in Medicaid appeals over the past seven years for a single group home -- a residence on East 35th Street -- one of the most expensive homes of its kind in the state. For care of the 28 developmentally disabled people housed there, whose needs are among the most acute in the nonprofit system, the organization received $7.2 million in 2010, or $700 per person per night.
Over all, the organization's rates for group homes at the intermediate care level, which require higher levels of care and supervision, rose by 48 percent from 2004 to 2010. Rates for similar group homes run by nonprofit providers around the state increased by 37 percent during the same period, while inflation was 15 percent.
'Medicaid Moguls'
Mr. Castellani, the former Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities official, calls them "Medicaid moguls" -- the nonprofit executives who have prospered while providing services to 135,000 developmentally disabled people in New York.
At the top of the class are the executives at the Young Adult Institute. No organization in the field in New York has paid its executives as well. Four of its executives received compensation in excess of $500,000 in 2009; none of its competitors had more than one executive at that level, according to a review by The Times of tax returns of the 100 largest providers.
That year, the last for which tax filings are available, Joel Levy collected more than $1 million and Philip was close behind, with $916,647. The chief operating officers, Thomas Dern and Stephen Freeman, earned $551,682 and $578,938.
Similar-sized nonprofit groups in New York pay an average salary to chief executives of $493,000, according to the Economic Research Institute, an executive compensation consulting company that advises companies, nonprofit groups and the Internal Revenue Service.
The Young Adult Institute also pays for its top executives to lease vehicles for personal and professional use. Accounting obtained by the state showed leases for two Lexuses and a Volvo. A spokesman declined to provide details about the cars, except to say the executives are allowed to select their own vehicles within certain price ranges.
Marcella C. Fava, who led the organization's board for more than 20 years, said the compensation was based on the findings of companies that specialize in compensation analyses.
She said the companies surveyed salaries among nonprofit organizations within the field, but also made allowances for the Young Adult Institute's "singular" size and complexity.
"Our retention programs have worked," she said, speaking of the broader management. "We've got a more experienced management team than, I think, any other agency."
Linda M. Lampkin, research director of the Economic Research Institute, was puzzled by Ms. Fava's explanation, saying her organization's database of tax returns filed by every nonprofit organization in the country shows nothing close to the Levys' compensation.
"If you look at what others are being paid, I don't know where their comparisons are coming from, because I can't find anything," she said.
At the Young Adult Institute, there were other elements of compensation within those big numbers, like the tuition compensation: for eight years ending in 2004, the organization directly covered the costs of college for children of several senior-level executives, including Philip Levy and Mr. Freeman.
The existence of the tuition program was discovered in 2009 by the state's Commission for Quality Care during a limited review of the organization in response to a tip. The results were never publicly released but were obtained by The Times under the state's Freedom of Information Law.
After The Times discovered property records showing the purchase of the co-op apartment for Philip Levy's daughter, the organization confirmed that the money from the tuition program had been used to buy her the West 12th Street home.
The Young Adult Institute spokesman declined to say how much was spent on education expenses, but in its final year, the program provided $132,611 to cover tuition for four children of three executives, including Philip Levy.
Ms. Fava said it was viewed as an attractive benefit for top executives. Several were confronting big college tuition bills at about the same time.
"This seemed to be a really nice retention tool," Ms. Fava said. "It had a quality to it, we're going to help you pay for your kids' college. So, sure, we could have increased their salary or given them a bonus. But this had a nicer, you know, cultural component to it."
The report also noted that a Young Adult Institute affiliate, the New York League for Early Learning, had paid the Levy brothers consulting fees of about $50,000 a year from 2007 through 2009, on top of their salaries. And it questioned other expenses, including lunches and dinners for executives and the $1,468 that Philip Levy spent to stay for two nights at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2008, which he said was for a meeting with a possible donor.
The commission, which has no enforcement powers, suggested that the organization's board "consider carefully" whether certain expenditures "are compatible with the obligation of the board to act as a faithful steward of public funds." More than 95 percent of the organization's revenue comes from government sources, primarily Medicaid.
In June, two days after The Times e-mailed a Young Adult Institute spokesman seeking more detail about the tuition program, the Levy brothers ended their employment there. The organization announced the departures two weeks later in a press release, saying Philip Levy was retiring, but quoting him as saying he was looking forward "to a new stage of my career." The spokesman, Jesse Derris, said that Joel Levy's departure as a consultant had been expected, and that Philip Levy had been unable to come to terms on a new contract with the group's board.
The Levys appear to be financially well prepared for the next phase of their lives. Each received deferred compensation totaling about $1.8 million in 2008 and 2009.
Courtney Burke, commissioner of the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, last week took a step toward reining in high executive salaries at the nonprofit groups. She sent a one-page letter to them on Tuesday seeking their assistance to develop "a consistent and rational model of compensation."
"Given the heightened concerns about the growth of Medicaid and Medicare, this compensation guidance should be established sooner rather than later," she wrote.
A spokesman for Ms. Burke said that if the providers were unable to agree on an approach, her office had the authority to write compensation standards into state regulations and contracts with providers.
Whatever concerns exist about executive compensation, the Young Adult Institute clearly has fans among families of developmentally disabled people.
Margaret Puddington said her 30-year-old son, Mark, had been participating in its programs for several years before he moved into a Young Adult Institute group home four years ago. Ms. Puddington said the organization excelled at hiring caring people, investing in training and supervising programs.
"Mark loves his life," she said. "I don't know what higher compliment there could be. He loves his staff. He loves his housemates. He loves his activities. They watch over him very, very carefully all the time."
During an interview at his office in May, Philip Levy declined to discuss his compensation or that of his brother. He repeatedly said how much he loved his work and said the public money had been well spent on services.
There was no indication during the interview that he would depart weeks later. "I think one of the things New York has to do is puff out its chest a bit and say, 'We are incredibly proud that we created the best system of care for people with developmental disabilities anywhere in this country,' " he said.

Full text: AS returns dried up for domestic stocks over the past decade, investors began to take their money overseas. But economic growth seems to be drying up in Europe, thanks to the debt crisis and resulting austerity measures there. So do investors need to rethink their exposure abroad?
The answer is far from simple, market strategists say.
For starters, Europe is hard to avoid -- stocks there account for around a quarter of the world's total market capitalization. Moreover, investors who are thinking of shifting money out of the region don't have many attractive alternatives in the global markets, money managers say.
Japan's economy, for one, is expected to contract this year in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of the country, according to a report this month by the International Monetary Fund. Central banks in many fast-growing emerging markets like China and Brazil, meanwhile, have started to increase interest rates to tame inflation overseas, which have led to losses in their stock markets.
At the same time, European stocks have held up remarkably well despite the debt crisis and expectations that gross domestic product in the euro zone will grow at an annual rate of less than 2 percent from now to 2014.
So far this year, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe index has returned around 6 percent, outpacing the 4 percent total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 index of domestic shares.
To be sure, much of that gain is a product of a surprisingly resilient euro, which is up nearly 8 percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year. But even after the currency effect is stripped out, European stocks have still lost only about 1 percent for the year in total returns.
"I would have guessed, given all the economic problems over there, that the European stock market would have run into more trouble," said Robert C. Doll, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, the investment manager.
If individual investors are considering reducing their exposure to Europe, they should first weigh making smaller moves that can reduce risk without upsetting their overall asset allocation plans, strategists say.
"Our take is that you have to have money in Europe," said Lewis J. Altfest, chief investment officer at Altfest Personal Wealth Management, "but you can focus on certain areas of Europe that are healthier."
Mr. Altfest noted, for instance, that Germany's economy has been stronger than most, and that it has avoided the debt worries plaguing nations like Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain.
What's more, he said German companies might actually benefit from the crisis if fear of potential defaults by such countries leads to a weaker currency. "A cheaper euro means a more competitive Germany when it comes to trade outside of Europe," he said, noting that a falling currency would make German exports cheaper for foreign customers.
Mr. Altfest said investors could move a small portion of their holdings in a broad-based European stock fund to a fund that tracks only the German market. The iShares MSCI Germany Index fund, for instance, has returned nearly 10 percent so far this year, based in dollars.
Alec Young, international equity strategist at S.& P. Equity Research, has been recommending a "surgical approach" to European exposure. He said, for instance, that investors should avoid bank shares.
About 23 percent of Europe's market capitalization is in financial stocks -- a sector whose companies own European sovereign debt and are thus vulnerable in the event of defaults. Shares of Banco Popolare of Italy and Commerzbank of Germany, for example, have lost about half their value this year.
But investors can reduce their exposure to European financials by turning to professionally managed mutual funds that underweight the sector relative to the broad market, he said.
Mr. Young also recommends an emphasis on dividend-paying European stocks, because it's unclear whether American investors can keep counting on a currency boost on their investments. Without that boost, he said, European stock returns may be flat, so having a dividend strategy could provide some gains.
FINALLY, focusing on shares of high-quality multinational companies could offer an added level of safety for European portfolios, said Charles de Vaulx, a portfolio manager at International Value Advisers.
Mr. de Vaulx says he hasn't had to trim his portfolio's European stake because so many of his holdings are globally oriented companies whose growth is tied to consumers outside the region.
"Many stocks in Europe have little do with Greece," he said.
For example, the British spirit maker Diageo, whose brands include Guinness and Johnnie Walker, sells products in about 180 countries. And the food and beverage giant Nestle, based in Switzerland, generates nearly 40 percent of its sales from emerging markets.
Simon Hallett, chief investment officer at Harding Loevner, an asset management firm, agrees with this approach. "We tend to own companies in Europe that are very multinational and that aren't reliant on their domestic markets," he said.
As a result, he said, "we don't think it makes any sense to change our strategy."

Abstract: In a comment letter filed with regulators last week, David Stevens, the president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, warned that the requirements on down payments and debt-to-income ratios were "unnecessary and not worth the societal costs of excluding far too many qualified borrowers from the most affordable mortgage loans to achieve homeownership." The net worth of white households fell only 16 percent. [...] yet, Mr. Stevens noted in his letter that the mortgage bankers were "working in harmony with a very wide coalition of consumer advocates, civil rights groups and other industry associations, to educate policy makers and legislators concerning this rule."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
YOU'D think the mortgage bust would qualify as a teachable moment.
But some people refuse to learn from mistakes -- a list that apparently includes certain mortgage bankers. Their industry is fighting a new rule that might prevent a repeat of the lending binge that helped drive our economy off a cliff.
In case you just arrived from another planet: America's mortgage mania was fueled by home loans with poisonous features that made them virtually impossible to repay. It was fun while it lasted, at least for the financial types who profited by making dubious loans and selling them to investors.
But the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul last year barred lenders from making home loans before determining that people could probably repay them.
(It's depressing that we have to legislate common sense, but, hey, that's the world we live in.)
Dodd-Frank also required regulators to define the characteristics of loans that would most likely be repaid. The idea was to ensure that banks had skin in the game when they bundled risky mortgages into securities.
The proposal was this: If a mortgage security contains only high-quality loans, the banks can sell the entire offering. If the investments included riskier mortgages, the underwriters must keep 5 percent of the issue on their own books.
Basically, Wall Street would have to eat a bit of its own cooking.
Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the comptroller of the currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development all agreed on what makes a mortgage most likely to perform well. They examined how different types of loans defaulted, and the attributes of the borrowers in question. Then they invited the public to comment on their proposal; that comment period ends tomorrow.
One attribute of safer loans, the regulators found, was that homeowners had made a down payment of at least 20 percent. Another was that their monthly housing debt payments did not exceed 28 percent of their monthly income, and that their total monthly debt payments did not exceed 36 percent.
In other words, regulators said, a relatively low-risk mortgage should look an awful lot like the ones that local banks made before the days of securitization on steroids. Regulators also said that the origination costs on low-risk mortgages should no more than 3 percent of the amount borrowed.
THE mortgage industry squawked. It would prefer that we return to the days of high-fee, anything-goes lending. That is not surprising. But what is surprising is that mortgage bankers are leaning on the same tired argument -- that saner lending requirements will undermine the goal of expanding homeownership.
In a comment letter filed with regulators last week, David Stevens, the president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, warned that the requirements on down payments and debt-to-income ratios were "unnecessary and not worth the societal costs of excluding far too many qualified borrowers from the most affordable mortgage loans to achieve homeownership."
Mr. Stevens, who last March left his job as federal housing commissioner at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, didn't mention the enormous costs associated with reckless lending. We are still tallying the bills, but to date, taxpayers have funneled $154 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Investors have suffered even greater damage.
While we are discussing societal costs, let's not forget how minority borrowers and first-time homebuyers were the targets of predatory lenders who lured them into toxic loans loaded with fees.
A study issued last week on the widening wealth gap between minorities and white Americans points to the costs of predatory lending. Conducted by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization, the study noted that housing woes were the principal cause of precipitous declines in household net worth among both Hispanics and blacks from 2005 through 2009. The organization found that, adjusted for inflation, the median wealth of Hispanic households fell by two-thirds during that period. The wealth of black households declined 53 percent. The net worth of white households fell only 16 percent.
And yet, Mr. Stevens noted in his letter that the mortgage bankers were "working in harmony with a very wide coalition of consumer advocates, civil rights groups and other industry associations, to educate policy makers and legislators concerning this rule."
One wonders how people who have lost their homes because of abusive lending practices feel about their "advocates" forming an alliance with mortgage lenders on this issue.
Mr. Stevens also argues that restricting mortgage fees to 3 percent, as proposed, would hurt borrowers by reducing their access to credit. Noting that his association opposes excessive fees, he wrote that his group "knows of no data evidencing that points and fees have affected borrowers' ability to repay their loans."
He told a different story when he was at HUD overseeing the portfolio of loans insured by the F.H.A.
Testifying before Congress in May 2010, Mr. Stevens cited five years of F.H.A. data showing that loans in which the seller of the property helped defray a borrower's origination costs by more than 3 percent, known as a sellers' concession, experienced significantly greater default rates.
In 2008, for example, F.H.A.'s insurance claims on loans where sellers covered 3 percent to 6 percent of buyers' costs were 50 percent higher than claims on loans where concessions from sellers fell below 3 percent.
The higher concessions created "incentives to inflate appraised value," Mr. Stevens testified. In other words, high costs do have consequences.
Mr. Stevens, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
As the advocate of the mortgage banking industry, Mr. Stevens is entitled to express the industry's views. But it would be troubling if such arguments gained traction with regulators. In the years leading up to the crisis, the Mortgage Bankers Association and other financial trade groups persuaded regulators to postpone or water down rules that could have reined in subprime lending relatively early. We all know the consequences -- and surely do not need to repeat past mistakes.

Full text: NOT so long ago, the National Debt Clock, perched above the Avenue of the Americas, a block east of Times Square, was running backward.
It seems remarkable now, with all the End Times talk of debt ceilings and default, but it was only 11 years ago that the owners of that electronic totem, the Durst family, simply pulled the plug. The clock, a fixture since 1989, went dark after the federal government ended its 2000 fiscal year with a record $236.4 billion budget surplus.
Today, well -- you know. We face the largest budget deficit the nation has ever known: $1.6 trillion, the equivalent of about 11 percent of our economy. And, whatever Washington does, many economists say the situation will grow only worse, particularly as Americans age and Medicare costs spiral higher.
But there is, in theory, a happy solution to our debt troubles. It's called economic growth. No need to raise taxes or cut programs. Just get the economy growing the way it used to.
Good luck with that. Growth is in short supply these days, as new, dismal numbers underscored on Friday. Revised data showed that the recession took an even bigger bite of the economy than we thought. And economists are sizing up the risks of another recession.
"The basic issue is that the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal track," says Dean Maki, the chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. "From that point, none of the choices are fun." The most obvious choices, Mr. Maki says, are to reduce spending (ouch), raise taxes (yuck), let inflation run (gasp) or default (thud).
We wouldn't need any of that if we could restore economic growth. If that happened, Americans would become richer and pay more taxes. Et voila! -- we'd pay down the debt painlessly.
Crazy as that might sound, particularly given Friday's figures, the possibility isn't some economic equivalent of that nice big farm where your childhood dog Skip was sent to run free. There are precedents.
Before its economy crashed, Ireland was a star of this sort of debt reduction. In the 1980s, Ireland's debt dwarfed its economy. Over the next two decades, though, that debt shrank to about a quarter of gross domestic product, largely because the economy went gangbusters.
"Ireland went from being, you know, the emerging market in a European context, to a very dynamic economy," says Carmen Reinhart, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and co-author of "This Time Is Different," a history of debt crises.
The United States has done the same in the past, too. After World War II, gross federal debt reached 122 percent of G.D.P., the highest ratio on record. But over the next 40 years, it fell to about 33 percent. That wasn't because some blue-ribbon panel prescribed austerity; it was because the American economy became much, much richer.
The same happened during the prosperous 1990s, which began with deficits and ended with surpluses. Former President Bill Clinton is often credited for that turnabout, as he engineered higher tax rates. But most economists attribute the surplus years primarily to extraordinarily rapid growth.
It would be lovely to repeat that experience today, and send our federal debt off to that farm with Skip.
But the structure of America's federal spending is different now than it was in, say, the immediate postwar decades. Back then, growth helped to erase the debt. But remember that in the 1950s, the United States didn't have Medicare. The population was younger, and Americans didn't live as long.
Given the health spending obligations we face, and the debt overhang we're already dealing with, growth rates would have to acquire something like Ludicrous Speed, as in the movie "Spaceballs," to keep up. And, near term, even modest speed is unlikely.
Usually after a recession, growth snaps back quickly and the economy makes up for ground lost -- and then some. That's not the case this time, at least so far. In the 60 years before the Great Recession, the economy expanded at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent. In the second quarter of this year, it grew at less than half of that pace, putting us further and further behind where we would be if the economy were functioning normally.
These doldrums won't last forever, but many predict that economic growth to come will be somewhat slower than it was before the recession, for many of the same reasons that our debt is growing so quickly -- the aging of the population, for instance.
While it may be difficult or impossible to grow our way out of debt, the G.D.P. figures announced on Friday suggest that we could quite possibly shrink our way into bankruptcy. The austerity measures that Congress is debating would almost certainly slow growth further. That, in turn, might actually worsen the debt problem -- the exact opposite of what their proponents suggest.
Economists agree that in the long run, fiscal discipline is good for growth. When the budget is in order, the country isn't weighed down by the burden of paying down burgeoning entitlements. Companies can worry less about being surprised by, say, higher taxes, and proceed to hire new workers. More manageable federal debt also helps to keep interest rates low, which is generally good for growth. And, again, what's good for growth is generally good for the debt.
The problem is that reducing spending or raising taxes just now would hurt the already fragile economy. Another recession would not only be painful for ordinary Americans but would actually worsen the debt problem by reducing tax revenue.
Don't believe it? Consider this: Of the $12.7 trillion in additional federal debt that was accumulated over the last decade, about a third came from the souring economy.
Back in the Great Depression, Washington tightened its belt with disastrous results. Congress severely reduced spending in 1937, plunging the economy back into the hole. Ultimately, that meant even more federal borrowing.
Today, Wall Street is worried that the United States will lose its AAA rating, whatever happens in Washington. Last week's sign of the apocalypse: While we were moping about the debt mess in Washington, Uruguay -- Uruguay! -- was putting its fiscal house in order. Standard & Poor's, which has been threatening to cut the United States' credit rating, raised its assessment of Uruguay.
Granted, it's still a junkyard BB+. But it makes you wonder: If Montevideo can gets its act together, why can't Washington?
In a perfect world, Washington might lay out plans to reduce spending or cut taxes in the future, giving us a collective heads-up, and then phase in those measures a few years from now -- when, hopefully, the economy is on a firmer footing.
The problem, of course, is credibility, which the ratings agencies have demanded. Would Washington follow through? Congress has promised fiscal discipline for decades, only to undo its promises before the reckoning. Fiscal discipline is painful, unpopular and, in today's Washington, as elusive as the prosperity we once had.
William Easterly, a development economist at New York University, notes that countries that undertake fiscal consolidation in the midst of a crisis -- like the one Washington is in right now -- tend to be penny-wise and pound-foolish.
For example, during the debt crises of the 1980s in Latin America, many countries in that region cut back on easy targets, like telecommunications and transportation. Those decisions later impeded those countries' ability to function and to collect the tax revenue they needed to keep current with their creditors. Britain likewise axed spending on transportation maintenance and operations in the 1980s, which led to much more expensive repairs to roadways and other infrastructure later.
ON the other hand, the paragon of thoughtful, growth-minded fiscal consolidation is Canada, according to Paolo Mauro, a division chief at the International Monetary Fund and editor of "Chipping Away at Public Debt: Sources of Failure and Keys to Success in Fiscal Adjustment."
Rather than making decisions under the gun, Canada in 1994 undertook a comprehensive, McKinsey-style review of all of its federal spending over the course of a year to determine "where they were getting value for their money, rather than just doing across-the-board cuts," Mr. Mauro says.
Policy makers telegraphed their conclusions and medium-term plans for reform, and subsequently pared down Canada's debt level from one of the highest in the Group of Seven to the lowest. Since Canada cut federal fat judiciously, it reduced its debt without much harm to growth.
American policy makers might learn a thing or two from Canada's patient, hysteria-free pruning, at least once another clock -- the counting down to an American downgrade or default -- stops ticking.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- New budget talks between top Congressional Republicans and President Obama made progress late Saturday, suddenly stirring optimism that a last-minute deal could be reached to avert a potential federal default that threatened significant economic and political consequences.
After a tense day of Congressional floor fights and angry exchanges, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, called off a planned showdown vote set for after midnight, but said he would convene the Senate at noon on Sunday for a vote an hour later. He said he wanted to give the new negotiations a chance to produce a plan to raise the federal debt limit in exchange for spending cuts and the creation of a new Congressional committee that would try to assemble a long-range deficit-cutting proposal.
"There are many elements to be finalized and there is still a distance to go before an arrangement can be completed," said Mr. Reid, who just a few hours earlier had played down talk of any agreement. "But I believe we should give everyone as much room as possible to do their work."
Mr. Reid's announcement set off an almost audible sigh of relief on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers and their aides had been bracing for an overnight clash over the debt following a day that had seen a heated House vote and lawmakers trudging from office to office in search of an answer to the impasse.
The first indication off a softening of the hard lines that have marked weeks of partisan wrangling over the debt limit came in the afternoon when the two leading Congressional Republicans announced that they had reopened fiscal talks with the White House and expected their last-ditch drive to produce a compromise.
Following the House's sharp rejection of a proposal by Mr. Reid to raise the debt limit and cut spending, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and a linchpin in efforts to reach a deal, said he and Speaker John A. Boehner were "now fully engaged" in efforts with the White House to find a resolution that would tie an increase in the debt limit to spending cuts and other conditions.
"I'm confident and optimistic that we're going to get an agreement in the very near future and resolve this crisis in the best interests of the American people," said Mr. McConnell, who noted he was personally talking to both Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a favorite partner in past negotiations.
Mr. Boehner, who would have to steer a compromise through the House, said he based his confidence on the prospect of an agreement on the sense that "we're dealing with reasonable, responsible people who want this crisis to end as quickly as possible."
A Democratic official with knowledge of the talks said that Mr. McConnell called Mr. Biden early Saturday afternoon, the first conversation between the two men since Wednesday. The official said they talked at least four more times on Saturday as they tried to work out an agreement.
The deal they were discussing, this person said, resembled the bill that Mr. Boehner won approval for in the House on Friday more than it did the one that Mr. Reid had proposed.
It would immediately raise the debt ceiling by about $1 trillion, accompanied by a similar range of spending cuts, and set up a new bipartisan committee that would work to find deeper cuts in exchange for a second debt limit increase that would extend through the 2012 election.
A failure of the new committee to win enactment of its proposal could then set off automatic spending cuts across the board, including to entitlement programs. Other ideas were swirling around the Capitol as lawmakers searched for a way to avoid default. One of Mr. Reid's top lieutenants said he saw at least a glimmer of hope.
"We are a long way from any sort of negotiated agreement," said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, "but there is certainly a more positive feeling about reaching an agreement than I've felt in a long time."
The flurry of activity came as anxiety built up in many corners, including among Wall Street investors worried about the effects on the markets and active-duty soldiers worried about their paychecks.
After Mr. McConnell sounded a hopeful note, Mr. Reid called members of the Senate to the floor to hear him dispute the claims by his Republican counterpart and accuse Republicans of failing to enter into serious negotiations even as the Treasury risked running out of money to pay all its bills after Tuesday.
"The speaker and Republican leader should know that merely saying you have an agreement in front of television cameras doesn't make it so," Mr. Reid said after returning from a visit to the White House with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House.
Trying to build momentum for his own proposal, Mr. Reid and fellow Democrats were working to win over Republican senators to support his plan to raise the debt ceiling through 2012 and circumvent Mr. McConnell.
"Americans are watching us and demanding a result that is balanced," Mr. Reid said.
The Senate Democrats' efforts were set back Saturday when 43 of the 47 Republican senators signed a letter to Mr. Reid saying they would not back his proposal, which would allow a $2.4 trillion increase in the debt ceiling in two stages while establishing a new Congressional committee to explore deeper spending cuts. The numbers signaled that without changes in the plan, Mr. Reid would not be able to overcome a Republican filibuster, which requires 60 votes.
House Republicans signaled their disapproval of the Reid plan by holding a symbolic vote on Saturday, rejecting it by a 246 to 173 vote, in a move intended to show it had no chance of passing in that chamber. About a dozen Democrats joined Republicans in rejecting the Reid plan.
The pre-emptive vote could strengthen Mr. McConnell's hand as he seeks to shape any final compromise.
At the White House and in talks in Congressional offices and corridors, most of the attention was focused on finding a way to define the precise conditions under which the president could get a second increase in the debt limit that would be needed early in 2012 under both Republican and Democratic proposals. Officials in both parties said another idea that had surfaced was to require a change in Social Security policy if the new committee deadlocked, providing an incentive for the new committee to act on its own.
Under the proposal that the Congressional Budget Office said could save more than $100 billion over 10 years, a different measure of inflation would be used to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits. Supporters say the alternative measure of inflation is more accurate because it reflects what happens when prices rise; advocates for the elderly say the proposal is a backdoor way of cutting benefits.
Members of both parties took the floor to push for compromise, noting that the two sides were not far apart on major elements of their deficit-reduction plans.
"Failure should not be an option for us in this case, and it's time we started finding common ground," said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia.
The unusual Saturday session came after a week of brinkmanship on Capitol Hill. On Friday, Mr. Boehner managed to pass his own House bill, along party lines, just a day after suspending the vote as the Republican leadership tried frantically to line up enough votes for passage. But the Senate swiftly rejected that plan late Friday.
While some of the back-and-forth between the House and Senate and the party leaders was typical of the late stages of a negotiation, the combative and unyielding tone in both chambers of Congress was creating more pessimism in the rank and file about the prospects that a final agreement could be struck and cleared before Tuesday.
Even if a measure is able to win significant bipartisan endorsement in the Senate, the reception in the House could be different with the Treasury Department's Tuesday deadline for increasing the debt limit at hand. But how to push a plan by House conservatives remained a major question mark.
At the Treasury Department, Secretary Timothy F. Geithner met with top advisers on Saturday on contingency plans for managing the financial consequences of Congressional inaction. "No one will be pleased," said one adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Treasury Department calculates that the government will exhaust its ability to borrow money at the end of Tuesday, forcing the government to pay its bills from a dwindling pile of cash. Independent analysts estimate the government has enough money on hand to pay all of its bills for another week, more or less, before it starts missing payments.
Mr. Obama has repeatedly called on Congress to raise the borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling, by Tuesday to avoid any uncertainty about the government's ability to meet its obligations. Financial markets are particularly concerned about the payment of interest on the federal debt. A default on those obligations could precipitate a global financial crisis.
The painful negotiations to resolve the crisis have caught the attention of troops in Afghanistan, where Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was quizzed repeatedly on Saturday by soldiers and Marines worried about their paychecks.
In Kandahar and Helmand Provinces, Admiral Mullen said it remained uncertain where money would be found if the government defaulted. Regardless of budget talks in Washington, the mission for American troops in Afghanistan would not halt, he said.
"We're going to continue to come to work," he said.

What's With All the Bernanke Bashing?

Abstract: Mr. Bernanke became the Fed chairman in February 2006. [...] the inflation measure favored by the Fed -- the price index for personal consumption, excluding food and energy -- has averaged 1.9 percent, annualized.

Full text: POOR Ben Bernanke.
He left a comfortable professorship at Princeton to run the Federal Reserve -- and this is what he gets.
Mr. Bernanke has worked tirelessly to shepherd the economy through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and yet, for all his efforts, seems vastly underappreciated.
CNBC recently asked people, "Do you have confidence in the way Ben Bernanke is handling the economy?" Ninety-five percent of the respondents said no.
Yes, the CNBC survey was hardly scientific. Nonetheless, it reflected the deep unease that many Americans feel about our central bank and its policies. Critics on both the left and right see much to dislike in how Mr. Bernanke and his Fed colleagues have been doing their jobs.
Let's review the complaints.
Critics on the left look at the depth of the recent recession and the meager economic recovery we are experiencing and argue that the Fed should have done more. They fear that the United States might slip into a long malaise akin to Japan's lost decade, in which unemployment remains high and the risks of deflation deter people from borrowing, investing and returning the economy to its potential.
Critics on the right, meanwhile, worry that the Fed has increased the nation's monetary base at a historically unprecedented pace while keeping interest rates near zero -- an approach that they say will eventually ignite inflation. Some in this camp have gone so far as to propose repealing the Fed's dual mandate of simultaneously maintaining price stability -- that is, holding inflation at bay -- while maximizing sustainable employment. Better, these people say, to replace those twin goals with a single-minded focus on inflation.
Yet Mr. Bernanke's record shows that the fears of both sides have been exaggerated.
Mr. Bernanke became the Fed chairman in February 2006. Since then, the inflation measure favored by the Fed -- the price index for personal consumption, excluding food and energy -- has averaged 1.9 percent, annualized. A broader price index that includes food and energy has averaged 2.1 percent.
Either way, the outcome is remarkably close to the Fed's unofficial inflation target of 2 percent. So, despite the economic turmoil of the last five years, the Fed has kept inflation on track.
Of course, this record could come undone in future years. Yet the signals in the financial markets are reassuring. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury bond, for instance, is now about 2.8 percent. A 10-year inflation-protected Treasury bond yields about 0.4 percent.
The difference between those yields, the so-called "break-even inflation rate," is the inflation rate at which the two bonds earn the same return. That figure is now a bit over 2 percent, a sign that the market does not expect inflation in the coming decade to differ much from that experienced over the last five years. Inflation expectations are anchored at close to their target rate.
Could the Fed have done substantially more to avoid the recession and promote recovery? Probably not. The Fed used its main weapon against recession -- cuts in short-term interest rates -- aggressively as the depth of the downturn became apparent. And it turned to various unconventional weapons as well, including two rounds of quantitative easing -- essentially buying bonds -- in an attempt to lower long-term interest rates.
A few economists have argued, with some logic, that the employment picture would be brighter if the Fed raised its target for inflation above 2 percent. They say higher expected inflation would lower real interest rates, thus encouraging borrowing. That, in turn, would expand the aggregate demand for goods and services. With more demand for their products, companies would increase hiring.
Even if that were true, a higher inflation target is a political nonstarter. Economists are divided about whether a higher target makes sense, and the public would likely oppose a more rapidly rising cost of living. If Chairman Bernanke ever suggested increasing inflation to, say, 4 percent, he would quickly return to being Professor Bernanke.
What the Fed could do, however, is codify its projected price path of 2 percent. That is, the Fed could announce that, hereafter, it would aim for a price level that rises 2 percent a year. And it would promise to pursue policies to get back to the target price path if shocks to the economy ever pushed the actual price level away from it.
Such an announcement could help mollify critics on both the left and right. If we started to see the Japanese-style deflation that the left fears, the Fed would maintain a loose monetary policy and even allow a bit of extra inflation to make up for past tracking errors. If we faced the high inflation that worries the right, the Fed would be committed to raising interest rates aggressively to bring inflation back on target.
MORE important, an announced target path for inflation would add more certainty to the economy. Americans planning their retirement would have a better sense about the cost of living a decade or two hence. Companies borrowing in the bond market could more accurately pin down the real cost of financing their investment projects.
Mr. Bernanke cannot remove all of the uncertainty that households and businesses face, but he can eliminate one small piece of it. Less uncertainty would, other things being equal, encourage spending and promote more rapid recovery. It might even raise Mr. Bernanke's approval ratings a bit.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The economy slowed to a snail's pace in the first half of 2011, underscoring a growing risk that the recovery itself may hang in the balance with budget and debt decisions in Washington.
The broadest measure of the economy, known as the gross domestic product, grew at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the first half of 2011, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. The figures for the first quarter and the second quarter, 0.4 percent and 1.3 percent respectively, were well below what economists were expecting, and signified a sharp slowdown from the early months of the recovery.
The government also revised data going all the way back to 2003 that showed the recession was deeper, and the recovery weaker, than initially believed.
"There's nothing that you can look at here that is signaling some revival in growth in the second half of the year, and in fact we may see another catastrophically weak quarter next quarter if things go wrong next week," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, referring to the debt ceiling talks.
With so little growth, the economy can hardly withstand further shocks from home or abroad, and worrisome signals continue to emanate from heavily indebted European countries.
If the domestic economy were to contract, any new recession would originate on President Obama's watch -- unlike the last one, which began a year before he was elected.
If Congress leaves existing budget plans intact, some of the government's economic assistance, like the payroll tax cut, will phase out and thereby act as a drag on growth.
And by many economists' thinking, whatever additional budget cuts Congress eventually agrees to (or does not) will weaken the economy even further.
On the one hand, if legislators cannot come to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling by Tuesday, the United States may be unable to pay all its bills. Borrowing costs across the economy could then surge, because so many interest rates are pegged to how much it costs the federal government to borrow. The forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers has predicted that the resulting financial mayhem would most likely plunge the economy back into recession.
On the other hand, if legislators do reach an agreement, it will probably include austerity measures that could chip away at the already fragile recovery. Spending cuts -- particularly if they take effect sooner rather than later, as some of the House's more conservative members want -- will weaken the economy, since so many industries and workers are directly or indirectly dependent on government activity.
Macroeconomic Advisers has estimated that the plan of Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who serves as majority leader, for example, could shave a half a percentage point off growth as its spending cuts peak.
Citing the debt reductions that Congress undertook in 1937 and that ushered in the most severe phase of the Great Depression, some economists fear that imposing austerity measures too soon could likewise result in a recessionary relapse.
Simply prolonging the debt negotiations could also damage prospects for growth in the third quarter, as businesses and families wait to make big purchases until the threat of a federal default subsides.
"The business and consumer uncertainty over whether the government will be able to pay its bills is the biggest thing weighing around our neck right now," said Austan Goolsbee, the departing chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The economy is smaller today than it was before the Great Recession began in 2007, though the country's labor force and production capacity have grown. The outlook for digging out of that hole is getting weaker by the day, and analysts across Wall Street have already begun slashing their forecasts for output and job growth for the rest of this year. Usually, a sharp recession is followed by a sharp recovery, meaning the recovery growth rate is far faster than the long-term average growth rate; last quarter, though, output grew at less than half of the average rate seen in the 60 years preceding the Great Recession.
Particularly distressing to economists is that consumer spending -- which, alongside housing, usually leads the way in a recovery -- has been extraordinarily weak in recent quarters. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending in the second quarter barely budged, increasing just 0.1 percent at an annual rate, the Commerce Department report showed.
"People are spending more, but that spending is being absorbed in higher prices, not in buying more stuff," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.
Even the brightest parts of the latest report were bittersweet. For example, motor vehicle output fell much less than was predicted after the natural disasters in Japan disrupted supply chains. But that means there will probably be a less buoyant bounce in coming months in autos, which economists were counting on to raise growth rates later this year.
Some economists cautioned not to read too much into this figure, though, or any individual quarterly number from the last report. The Commerce Department will probably make substantial revisions to the latest numbers, just as it did on Friday for the data released over the previous decade. Among the more jarring revisions in its latest report was the downgrade for growth in the first quarter of this year, from the original estimate of a 1.9 percent annual growth rate to a rate of just 0.4 percent.
"Sometimes it feels like I'm a physicist who's been flipped into a different universe trying to explain these revisions, rather than an economist tracking output growth," said Mr. Ryding. "The economy is clearly performing poorly, though we don't know quite how poorly because these individual quarterly revisions can sometimes be something of a joke."
The slow growth rate is largely responsible for stubbornly high joblessness across the country. Businesses are sitting on a lot of cash, but are still reluctant to hire because there is so much uncertainty about the future of the economy and whether they will continue to have a steady flow of customers. As of June, 14 million Americans were actively looking for work, and the average duration of unemployment has been climbing to record highs month after month.
Slow growth takes not only a human toll, but a fiscal one. Tax revenues do not expand enough to pay down the nation's debt.
Given some festering inflation concerns, it also seems unlikely that the Federal Reserve will swoop in with another round of monetary easing to invigorate the economy.
"There's not going to be additional monetary stimulus, and it's hard to imagine any fiscal stimulus given the current discussion in Washington," Mr. Ryding said. "So what's going to get us out of this? The inevitable conclusion is time, and that's not very satisfactory."

Full text: All the political wrangling over the budget in Washington has been focused on one theme: how much the government should cut and when those cuts should take effect.
But for all of the difficulty lawmakers are having now, their hardest decisions may come this fall when they do battle over which government programs to cut back. And one program that has already been put on the table for discussion is Social Security, even though it has not contributed to the budget deficit.
There is no question the program needs to be tweaked so it can remain solvent for decades to come. And experts say the problem is not that difficult to solve, as long as it is dealt with relatively soon.
The proposed changes would have tinkered with one of the most beloved features of Social Security: the cost of living adjustment, which helps benefits keep pace with inflation so the elderly maintain their purchasing power. The proposed changes would link benefits to a new measure of inflation -- one that is projected to rise more slowly than the current index.
"It amounts to a benefit cut," Alicia H. Munnell, the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, said.
The proposal, which emerged as a potential bargaining chip earlier in the budget debate, caused Social Security preservationists to cringe. And that is a big reason they argue that any changes should not be fast-tracked as part of the broader deficit debate.
If no changes are made, the program's reserves are now projected to be exhausted in 2036, a year earlier than last year's projection. Then the taxes collected would be enough to pay only about 75 percent of benefits through 2085, according to the latest annual report from the agency's trustees.
The shortfall can largely be attributed to demographic shifts. The coming wave of baby boomers will strain the system, while the number of workers paying into the system is declining. On top of that, people are living longer, and the weak economy is not helping matters.
Changing the cost of living adjustment is just one of several ways to bolster Social Security's finances. Suggestions have included gradually increasing the retirement age or raising the amount of income subject to Social Security payroll taxes.
The Obama administration's deficit-reduction commission proposed switching to the new type of index because, members said, it would be more accurate. Unlike the current measure, it takes into account that people tend to change their buying habits when prices rise, substituting cheaper items for more expensive ones. If, for instance, the price of apples goes up, people may instead buy pears, if they are cheaper. The current index assumes that if the price of apples go up, people will just buy fewer apples.
But there is a question of whether the elderly and disabled can make the same substitutions as working people. "If you are down to paying your rent and your food, and the price of your food goes up, you probably just eat less," Ms. Munnell said.
In addition, the slower rise in benefits would compound over time. That means the older that retirees grew, the bigger the pinch they would feel, especially people who depended heavily on the program. About 43 percent of single people and 22 percent of married couples rely on the benefits for more than 90 percent of their income, the Social Security Administration says. More than half of couples and 73 percent of singles draw more than half their income from the program.
So how much would this cost? Over the last decade or so, the "chained CPI-U" -- that is the name of the new proposed index -- has risen 0.3 percentage points a year less than the measure used now, according to Stephen Goss, the chief actuary at Social Security. And he expects that would continue in the future.
Consider a worker who retired at 65. After 10 years, the worker would receive 3.7 percent less in benefits than he would receive under the current system; after 20 years, 6.5 percent; and 9.2 percent after 30 years, according to Mr. Goss's calculations. (He ran the numbers in response to a request by Representative Xavier Becerra, a Democrat from California who is the ranking member of the Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security).
Let's assume the retiree had a monthly benefit of $1,261, or $15,132 annually. But as he aged, his benefits would not rise as quickly as they would have under the current system. At 75, he would receive $560 less a year under the new system compared with the current one. At 85, he would receive $984 less, and, at 95, he would receive $1,394 a year less. These changes would resolve about 23 percent of the program's current shortfall, according to Social Security's actuaries.
But what is most irksome to some critics is that the proposed index has been called "more accurate." It may be more accurate for the broader population, they say, but that doesn't necessarily hold for retirees. (It would, however, save $112 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office).
If accuracy, and not cost savings, is the goal, they suggest further analysis of an experimental "elderly" index that accounts for the fact that older people spend a greater share of their budget on medical care. That index is estimated to increase about 0.2 percentage point more each year than the broader indexes. In fact, Ms. Munnell said that moving to the elderly index -- and adding the mechanism to account for substituting cheaper items when prices rise -- might make more sense.
Referring to the chained CPI-U index, Ms. Munnell said, "It's not the worst proposal that could be put in place," especially when considering that other ideas, like providing an increase in benefits at age 85, could offset some of the reduction. "It's just that people aren't candid when they talk about it. That's the real problem."
And that is the issue hanging like a dark cloud over the broader discussion to bolster Social Security, especially in such a politically charged atmosphere.
Many people misunderstand how the program operates. Payroll taxes stream into the trust fund that is used to pay current retirees' benefits. When there is a surplus, that money is invested in a special type of Treasury bond that pays interest to the trust fund. At the end of last year, the trust fund had about $2.6 trillion. And though last year was the first year since 1983 that the fund paid out more than it received in tax revenue, it still continued to grow because of the interest accrued -- and it is estimated to continue to grow through 2022.
Since the money in the trust fund is held in Treasury securities, taxes collected are essentially being lent to the federal government to pay for whatever it wants (and this allows the government to borrow less from the public). That is where some of the confusion comes into play about how Social Security is used to pay for things that are unrelated to the program. But it is really no different from China lending the government money by investing in Treasuries.
"Social Security does not, and cannot by law, add a penny to the federal debt," said Nancy Altman, co-director of Social Security Works, an advocacy organization that promotes the preservation of the program. "It, by law, cannot pay benefits unless it has sufficient income to cover the cost, and it has no borrowing authority to make up any shortfall."
And, she added, it is not in crisis. "Its long-range funding shortfall should be dealt with on its own legislative vehicle, separate from deficit-reduction talks and after those talks are concluded," she added.
The budget proposal from the bipartisan group of Congressmen known as the Gang of Six and the president's deficit-cutting commission did state that Social Security should be reformed for its own sake -- and that any savings must go toward solvency. There are many ideas on how to achieve that balance. Here's hoping our leaders will evaluate them on their own merit.

CHART: Using the Inflation Rate to Tweak Social Security: A proposal to change Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment surfaced as part of the budget debate. Currently, benefits are pegged to a variant of the Consumer Price Index, the CPI-W, which was the only index that existed when benefits were first adjusted for inflation. Lawmakers have proposed switching to the chained CPI-U, which is projected to rise more slowly. Some advocates say a variation of the CPI-E (an experimental index that tracks the spending habits of those 62 and older) would be a better measure, since it reflects that older people spend more on health care.

On All Levels of the Economy, Concern About the Impasse: For Consumers, Volatility And Then Market Corrections

Full text: This is not yet one of those stuff-your-money-in-a-mattress moments.
Still, the talk in Washington of a federal budget crisis and possible default has given rise to all sorts of consumer fears of doomsday scenarios. Missed Social Security payments. Spikes in interest rates. Draconian cuts in government services.
But the most likely outcome, experts said in interviews this week, is that the nation's credit rating will be downgraded a notch. And if that turns out to be the case, investors and borrowers should be able to ride out any volatility.
Over the last few days, financial advisers have tried to allay investor fears by sending notes to clients with the same message they have delivered in past periods of market uncertainty: As long as you're diversified across different investments, the best action, in this case, is inaction.
The financial markets may become more volatile in the near-term, they say. And interest rates on several types of consumer loans can be expected to tick modestly higher because the rates track government-issued debt. But a credit downgrade is unlikely to cause a major shock to the system.
That said, the only investment that did not plunge in the 2008 market crisis was Treasuries, and they could conceivably lose some of their luster. "Sometimes I worry that a U.S. debt downgrade could have long-term negative psychological consequences as Americans realize the greatest power on earth is, alas, a mere mortal too," said Milo Benningfield, a certified financial planner in San Francisco. But "we're still looking pretty good relative to most everyone else in the world."
That does not mean there will not be a wide ripple effect, at least in the short term. The magnitude of the deficit reductions and their effect on the broader economy are another wild card. But in the near term, here's what investors and consumers can expect, and some advice from experts.
STOCKS AND BOND INVESTMENTS Both the stock and bond markets are expected to endure a period of volatility if the nation's debt drops a notch from its AAA perch. "Once a plan is in place, we would expect the markets to return to normal, and for investors to focus on more fundamental issues like long-term earnings growth and the economic health of countries around the globe," said Gus Sauter, chief investment officer at Vanguard.
"That said, it's simply not possible to gauge precisely how the equity and fixed income markets would react and for how long, so the best course of action is to ignore the headlines and maintain a long-term approach."
That sort of advice might come as cold comfort to people on the cusp of retirement, and for whom the memories of the recent downturn are fresh. That is why many advisers suggest that people who are living off their investments set aside enough cash so that they are not forced to sell investments during a rough patch.
"This is certainly creating a lot of concern, and the games being played in Washington by Congress are increasing the stress," said Diahann Lassus, a financial planner in New Providence, N.J. "Cash reserves are very important for both retirees and pre-retirees." She suggests six months to two years in cash, depending on the investor's age and specific situation.
A downgrade may cause Treasury yields to move modestly higher, which, in turn, may cause corporate, municipal and other bond issues to follow suit. Budget cuts, though, may have a more serious effect, depending on their severity. "If they really make some severe cuts, that is deleterious to the municipal bond space," said Marilyn Cohen, chief executive of Envision Capital Management, which manages bond portfolios. "That means less trickle-down to the states, cities and counties."
But if there are not enough cuts, she said, that could also cause the broader bond market to swoon.
MONEY MARKET FUNDS These funds hold 40 to 45 percent of the shorter-term Treasury debt outstanding, according to Deborah A. Cunningham, chief investment officer for money markets at Federated Investors. But if the nation's debt rating were downgraded, these funds would not be required to sell the Treasuries they hold. In fact, a fund would not be required to sell in the event of a default, either, as long as the fund deems the securities to be safe and able to make their interest payments.
"The money market world asset flow, what comes in and goes out, has been pretty benign," Ms. Cunningham said.
And she said she would not expect a downgrade to change those flows in any significant way. "The debt that is held in money market funds is so short in maturity that a downgrade will just not be an event that causes any kind of pricing concerns. As such, there shouldn't be issues for investors."
HOME LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS Fixed-rate mortgages generally track the 10-year Treasury note, whose interest rates would rise in the event of a downgrade. "The concern behind rates rising comes from the risk that investors -- foreign and domestic -- would rush to sell U.S. debt," said Cameron Findlay, chief economist at LendingTree.com, noting that a sell-off would push the price of the debt lower, while causing its yield to rise. "So the question then is by what magnitude, and that remains the unanswered element everyone is struggling with."
Shortly after a downgrade, he said, he would expect interest rates to spike a bit, though he said he did not expect rates on fixed-rate mortgages to rise more than half a percentage point to a full percentage point, at most. Nor did he expect a rise in rates to affect the pace of lending. After all, stricter credit standards are making lending difficult.
But once the federal debt issue is resolved, he said he expected mortgage rates to fall back to the range they are in now. Rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage averaged 4.52 percent for the week ending July 21, according to Freddie Mac. Though adjustable-rate mortgages typically do not track the 10-year Treasury note, experts said those rates could still move modestly higher.
Home equity lines of credit, meanwhile, track the prime rate, which is generally pegged to the federal funds rate. "Do we expect that to increase any time soon?" he asked. "We don't. But if the risk of inflation increases, then, of course, the risk is that you will see that index start to increase."
Credit cards are also pegged to the prime rate, so any increase in interest rates is more likely to be a result of broader economic factors or a decision by lenders to increase their profit margins. But as Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said, lenders must give borrowers at least 45 days' notice before raising their interest rate, and that can be applied only to new balances.
STUDENT LOANSThe interest rates on most private student loans are pegged to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which is influenced by Treasury yields. So if the yields on government securities rise, student loan rates could rise as well, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the FinAid and Fastweb Web sites. Borrowers taking out new loans, however, might see a greater increase in costs because of activity in the securities market backed by student loans.
Federal student loans are made by the government, which sells Treasuries to raise money to finance them. The government profits on the interest from the loans. If the government's cost of borrowing rose, the government's profit would decrease. But for now, since the interest rates are fixed, students would not necessarily see their costs rise unless Congress passed legislation to raise rates, he said. And then, the higher rates could apply only to new loans, he added.
The deficit reduction plan, which is likely to cut education spending, could have a broader effect on student lending. Some proposals, for instance, would cut subsidized interest on loans to graduate and professional students.
Experts also recommended contacting local representatives in Congress. "Let your Congressional leaders know you are paying attention by writing, e-mailing or calling them," Ms. Lassus, the financial planner, said.

Full text: MUMBAI, India -- The central bank of India raised its benchmark interest rates more than expected on Tuesday, saying that it was far more concerned about inflation than it was about slowing economic growth.
The Reserve Bank of India raised its repo rate, the rate at which it lends money to commercial banks, by 0.5 percentage point, to 8 percent, its 11th increase since October 2009. Most analysts were expecting an increase of 0.25 point.
"Policy needs to persist with a firm anti-inflationary stance" to counter inflation of nearly 9 percent, the central bank said, noting that while economic growth had moderated, "there is no evidence of a sharp or broad-based slowdown as yet."
The benchmark Nifty 50-stock index fell 1.9 percent Tuesday. The Indian rupee climbed modestly against the dollar.
The Reserve Bank of India's move is likely to slow one of the fastest-growing major emerging economies at a time when growth also appears to be easing in developed economies like Europe, Japan and the United States. Policy makers in China, another major fast-growing emerging market, are also trying to cool the economy amid inflation concerns.
"We certainly have a far more hawkish central bank than we had six or seven months back, when there was a conscious effort to balance growth and inflation," said Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, a large Indian lender.
The Indian economy expanded at a rate of 8.5 percent in its last fiscal year, which ended in March. Some analysts say growth could slow to 7.5 percent in the current business year. The central bank held to its own forecast of 8 percent growth on Tuesday.
In its statement, the central bank was clear that it remained focused on bringing down India's inflation rate, one of the highest in the world. In May, India's consumer price index climbed 8.7 percent from the same period a year earlier, down from 9.4 percent in April.
The central bank said it would like to limit inflation to 4 to 5 percent.
"Several indicators such as exports and imports, indirect tax collections, corporate sales and earnings, and demand for bank credit suggest that demand is moderating, but only gradually," the central bank said. "As such, demand side inflationary pressures continue to prevail."
The policy statement appears to put the central bank at odds with Indian fiscal policy makers, who have been emphasizing the need for faster growth and have suggested that inflation will soon subside.
Last week, the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, invited Indian reporters and editors to his office to offer assurances that the government's reform agenda had not been paralyzed by a series of corruption scandals and that the economy would indeed grow 8.5 percent, down from a previous government forecast of 9 percent.
In its statement Tuesday, the central bank subtly sought to put the onus for the persistently high inflation on the government, saying it needed to do better in areas in which it has struggled to make progress.
"It is important to recognize that in the absence of appropriate actions for addressing supply bottlenecks, especially in food and infrastructure, questions about the ability of the economy to sustain the current growth rate without significant inflationary pressures come to the fore," the Reserve Bank of India said.
Mr. Barua of HDFC Bank said the central bank appeared to believe that it had no choice but to act more forcefully, but he warned that the high interest rates could significantly slow the economy.
"It's the monetary policy's job to pick up the slack, which worked to a point," he said. "But there is every possibility of monetary policy overdoing things."

Abstract: If Republicans agreed to raise revenues from wealthy taxpayers and corporations, Mr. Obama was willing to reduce Medicare spending $250 billion over a decade and slowly phase in an increase in the eligibility age to 67 from 65, shrink Medicaid by $110 billion, and change the formula for cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security, which would more accurately reflect inflation, economists say, but would also mean smaller increases.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Leaders of both parties have said for months that the need to raise the nation's borrowing limit offered a "unique opportunity" for a bipartisan deal that would constrain the mounting federal debt.
Instead, it is shaping up to be a lost opportunity.
Whatever deal Congress and President Obama devise in this final week to allow the government to keep paying its bills after Aug. 2 and avert an economy-rattling default, it almost certainly will fall short of the compromise that Mr. Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, nearly struck last week -- before details of the negotiations leaked, opponents in both parties protested and Mr. Boehner left the table.
The difference between that attempted "grand bargain" and what Congress is coming up with is not just a matter of dollars. Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner did tentatively agree to more than $3 trillion in savings over 10 years -- at least hundreds of billions more than is called for in the fallback plans now bandied about in Congress to clear the way for a vote to increase the $14.3 trillion borrowing ceiling by next Tuesday.
But the more significant difference is in where the savings would come from. The Congressional proposals mainly seek caps on annual spending for domestic and military programs and no additional revenues.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner tentatively agreed to raise $800 billion in revenues after 2013 by overhauling the tax code and getting significant future savings from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- the entitlement programs whose growth as the population ages is driving long-term projections of unsustainable debt. While Republicans rebelled at the idea of tax increases, the package's total spending cuts exceeded new revenues by more than three to one.
The Obama-Boehner package still could serve as the basis for a bigger and more comprehensive debt-reduction deal. But that probably would not be before the 2012 elections, people in both parties say, given House Republicans' unyielding stand against higher taxes.
More likely, they say, the debate over what Mr. Boehner called their "different visions for our country" will define next year's elections, along with the blame game if the two parties remain at loggerheads. How it plays out could determine both Mr. Boehner's future as speaker and Mr. Obama's as president.
Each believed his party would benefit politically by a comprehensive deal, not least by easing many Americans' pox-on-both-your-houses frustration with Washington gridlock -- a threat to incumbents -- and by avoiding blame for an economic crisis.
And while Mr. Obama also seeks to appeal to independent voters who make the difference in presidential elections, many Democrats complain he is too willing to compromise, potentially disillusioning their party's voters and muddying the case against Republicans for proposing much deeper entitlement program cuts. Mr. Boehner's problem is that some otherwise persuadable Republicans worry less about the general election than party primaries, and fear they could draw a conservative rival by supporting a deal with Mr. Obama.
"If that means more to you than getting a plan and stabilizing this economy, you've really got to wonder why you're there," said Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader who was a co-chairman of the bipartisan fiscal commission Mr. Obama set up last year.
A package like the one Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner were discussing would be the most ambitious deficit-reduction effort in memory. Former Republican lawmakers who fought in the deficit-cutting wars of the 1980s and 1990s, including Mr. Simpson, express puzzlement or dismay at House Republicans' willingness to let the tax issue stop them from taking Mr. Obama's offers on reducing entitlement spending, especially since the new revenues would flow from an overhaul of the tax code that would lower most rates.
"If I were there," said Mickey Edwards, a House Republican leader in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, "I would say, 'My God, declare victory.' "
If Republicans agreed to raise revenues from wealthy taxpayers and corporations, Mr. Obama was willing to reduce Medicare spending $250 billion over a decade and slowly phase in an increase in the eligibility age to 67 from 65, shrink Medicaid by $110 billion, and change the formula for cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security, which would more accurately reflect inflation, economists say, but would also mean smaller increases.
Left untested is whether Mr. Obama could have sold his compromise to Democrats. "I have no doubt that if it came up, the votes would be there," said Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado. But the vocal opposition of liberal and labor groups suggest it would not be easy.
"This is morally wrong and Congress should not allow it to happen," Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said in a statement last Thursday.
A full picture of the shelved compromise shows how close the two leaders were and how far each was willing to go in confronting their parties' sacred cows -- Mr. Obama on entitlement spending and Mr. Boehner on taxes. On paper about $59 billion in spending cuts separated them, a relative pittance in terms of projected spending for the decade. Most of that difference was over Medicaid; Mr. Boehner wanted $40 billion more in cuts than Mr. Obama.
But taxes were the rub: Mr. Boehner has said he quit when Mr. Obama insisted on $400 billion more in revenues above the $800 billion they had agreed to.
The $800 billion roughly reflected savings if the Bush-era tax cuts for high incomes are not extended after 2012, though the deal was not explicit about that, given potential Republican opposition. Rather, it called for Congress to overhaul the tax code to eliminate or reduce popular breaks for corporations and individuals, and to use the new revenues mostly to lower tax rates -- leaving the $800 billion for deficit reduction.
Mr. Obama sought $400 billion more after the so-called Gang of Six senators, including three of the Senate's most conservative Republicans, proposed a debt-reduction plan calling for more new revenues than Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner had been discussing -- leaving the president more vulnerable to rebellion from within his own party.
On Fox News on Sunday, Mr. Boehner said his "last offer," including $800 billion in new revenues, "is still on the table." But it was not "doable" before Congress had to raise the debt limit, he said, so he went to work with lawmakers on a fallback.
As for Mr. Obama, his endorsement on Monday of a separate proposal from the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, signaled that he, too, had given up on getting a grand bargain, for now.

Full text: Microsoft needs to concentrate on a different kind of search: finding a buyer for Bing, its online search business. Bing is the industry's distant No. 2 after Google. It has become a distraction for the software giant -- one that costs shareholders dearly. The division that houses Bing lost $2.6 billion in the latest fiscal year. Facebook, or even Apple, might make a better home for Bing. A sale would be a boon for Microsoft's investors.
Microsoft has been pouring money into Bing. The company thinks search makes its offerings in everything from mobile phones to business software more compelling. Perhaps, but there is little evidence to date. And Bing and sites it powers like Yahoo still control only about 27 percent of the United States market; Google has more than twice as much.
Advertisers do not want a monopoly in search, which should assure Bing of future revenue. And Google may be partly hamstrung as a competitor by antitrust inquiries worldwide. But the business has more value to a buyer that could bring it traffic.
How much? Microsoft's online services unit, of which Bing is the main component, had $2.5 billion of sales in the year that ended June 30. Google is valued at about six times sales. At a 25 percent discount to Google, the unit would be worth about $11 billion.
Moreover, there are potential buyers. Facebook already works with Bing. It might be interested in buying the site, keeping more traffic onsite, and perhaps using its data to better tweak search results. That would be a potent weapon in its fight with Google, which recently introduced a rival social network, Google+. Apple might even be interested, given its growing online ambitions, evidenced by its consideration of a bid for Hulu.
In a deal, Microsoft could either get paper in a highly coveted company or cash, which Microsoft, to its credit, has been good about returning to shareholders. Equally, it could buy back stock, as the company trades at nine times estimated earnings, almost a 20 percent discount to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock average.
On top of any proceeds a sale would bring, it would stanch losses like last year's $2.6 billion. Without that, Microsoft would have made 10 percent more profit. That is something that should excite even jaded Microsoft investors.
Rethinking Debt
Standard & Poor's could choose to cut America's AAA rating even if Congress does a debt ceiling deal. That would force a rethink. The 18 other top-rated sovereigns are either caught up in the European mess or are tiny. Without the "risk-free" benchmark of Treasuries, even ultracautious bond investors would have to get used to credit risk.
America's $7.8 trillion of Treasury bonds, notes and inflation-protected securities, together with more than $5 trillion of federal housing agency paper and the debt of several insurers, would all be affected if America's rating slipped to AA, according to S.&P.
For bond investors fixated on AAA credits, there is not much capacity elsewhere to pick up the slack. Other top-rated sovereign entities include the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Liechtenstein, which are tiny. Even the largest of them, Germany, has only 2 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) of public debt outstanding. Moreover, six of the entities are euro zone members, and several others are closely connected to the European Union's debt troubles. Only Australia, Canada, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland hold top ratings without such blemishes, but all five have relatively small amounts of debt.
Top-rated companies do exist, but in the United States there are only four of them. That is nowhere near enough to absorb investor demand -- even assuming that buyers could get used to relying on corporate, rather than government, credit.
Money market funds, obliged to hold almost all their assets in AAA credits, might be spared a huge sell-off in a downgrade because their rules refer to short-term ratings, and S.& P.'s threat might only apply longer term. For other investors, adjusting portfolio holdings, and even their guiding rules, to include the United States and other AA-rated names should require only modest changes, though banks and some insurers might have to raise capital. And the United States government bond market would still be there, even if interest-rate comparisons with Treasury yields would have to contemplate negative numbers as well as positive.
The biggest impact could be psychological: there would no longer be a globally accepted liquid benchmark viewed as "risk-free." Fifty years of thinking, and computer models, would need tweaking.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
William Klein's story may sound familiar to his fellow graduates. After earning his bachelor's in history from the College at Brockport, he found himself living in his parents' Buffalo home, working the same $7.25-an-hour waiter job he had in high school.
It wasn't that there weren't other jobs out there. It's that they all seemed to want more education. Even tutoring at a for-profit learning center or leading tours at a historic site required a master's. "It's pretty apparent that with the degree I have right now, there are not too many jobs I would want to commit to," Mr. Klein says.
So this fall, he will sharpen his marketability at Rutgers' new master's program in Jewish studies (think teaching, museums and fund-raising in the Jewish community). Jewish studies may not be the first thing that comes to mind as being the road to career advancement, and Mr. Klein is not sure exactly where the degree will lead him (he'd like to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in the Middle East). But he is sure of this: he needs a master's. Browse professional job listings and it's "bachelor's required, master's preferred."
Call it credential inflation. Once derided as the consolation prize for failing to finish a Ph.D. or just a way to kill time waiting out economic downturns, the master's is now the fastest-growing degree. The number awarded, about 657,000 in 2009, has more than doubled since the 1980s, and the rate of increase has quickened substantially in the last couple of years, says Debra W. Stewart, president of the Council of Graduate Schools. Nearly 2 in 25 people age 25 and over have a master's, about the same proportion that had a bachelor's or higher in 1960.
"Several years ago it became very clear to us that master's education was moving very rapidly to become the entry degree in many professions," Dr. Stewart says. The sheen has come, in part, because the degrees are newly specific and utilitarian. These are not your general master's in policy or administration. Even the M.B.A., observed one business school dean, "is kind of too broad in the current environment." Now, you have the M.S. in supply chain management, and in managing mission-driven organizations. There's an M.S. in skeletal and dental bioarchaeology, and an M.A. in learning and thinking.
The degree of the moment is the professional science master's, or P.S.M., combining job-specific training with business skills. Where only a handful of programs existed a few years ago, there are now 239, with scores in development. Florida's university system, for example, plans 28 by 2013, clustered in areas integral to the state's economy, including simulation (yes, like Disney, but applied to fields like medicine and defense). And there could be many more, says Patricia J. Bishop, vice provost and dean of graduate studies at the University of Central Florida. "Who knows when we'll be done?"
While many new master's are in so-called STEM areas -- science, technology, engineering and math -- humanities departments, once allergic to applied degrees, are recognizing that not everyone is ivory tower-bound and are drafting credentials for resume boosting.
"There is a trend toward thinking about professionalizing degrees," acknowledges Carol B. Lynch, director of professional master's programs at the Council of Graduate Schools. "At some point you need to get out of the library and out into the real world. If you are not giving people the skills to do that, we are not doing our job."
This, she says, has led to master's in public history (for work at a historical society or museum), in art (for managing galleries) and in music (for choir directors or the business side of music). Language departments are tweaking master's degrees so graduates, with a portfolio of cultural knowledge and language skills, can land jobs with multinational companies.
So what's going on here? Have jobs, as Dr. Stewart puts it, "skilled up"? Or have we lost the ability to figure things out without a syllabus? Or perhaps all this amped-up degree-getting just represents job market "signaling" -- the economist A. Michael Spence's Nobel-worthy notion that degrees are less valuable for what you learn than for broadcasting your go-get-'em qualities.
"There is definitely some devaluing of the college degree going on," says Eric A. Hanushek, an education economist at the Hoover Institution, and that gives the master's extra signaling power. "We are going deeper into the pool of high school graduates for college attendance," making a bachelor's no longer an adequate screening measure of achievement for employers.
Colleges are turning out more graduates than the market can bear, and a master's is essential for job seekers to stand out -- that, or a diploma from an elite undergraduate college, says Richard K. Vedder, professor of economics at Ohio University and director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity.
Not only are we developing "the overeducated American," he says, but the cost is borne by the students getting those degrees. "The beneficiaries are the colleges and the employers," he says. Employers get employees with more training (that they don't pay for), and universities fill seats. In his own department, he says, a master's in financial economics can be a "cash cow" because it draws on existing faculty ("we give them a little extra money to do an overload") and they charge higher tuition than for undergraduate work. "We have incentives to want to do this," he says. He calls the proliferation of master's degrees evidence of "credentialing gone amok." He says, "In 20 years, you'll need a Ph.D. to be a janitor."
Among the new breed of master's, there are indeed ample fields, including construction management and fire science and administration, where job experience used to count more than book learning. Internships built into many of these degrees look suspiciously like old-fashioned on-the-job training.
Walter Stroupe, a retired police first lieutenant and chairman of the department of criminal justice at West Virginia State University, acknowledges that no one needs to get the new master's degree in law enforcement administration the school is offering beginning this fall. In fact, he concedes, you don't even need a college degree in West Virginia to become a police officer, typically the first step to positions as sheriff and police chief.
Still, Dr. Stroupe says, there are tricky issues in police work that deserve deeper discussion. "As a law enforcement officer, you can get tunnel vision and only see things from your perspective," he says. "What does a police officer do when they go up to a car and someone is videotaping them on a cellphone?" The master's experience, he hopes, will wrangle with such questions and "elevate the professionalism" among the police in the state.
These new degrees address a labor problem, adds David King, dean of graduate studies and research at the State University of New York at Oswego, and director of the Professional Science Master's Program, which oversees P.S.M. degrees across the SUNY system.
"There are several million job vacancies in the country right now, but they don't line up with skills," he says. Each P.S.M. degree, he says, is developed with advisers from the very companies where students may someday work. "We are bringing the curriculum to the market, instead of expecting the market to come to us," he says.
That's why John McGloon, who manages the technical writing and "user experience" team at Welch Allyn, the medical device company, helped shape the master's in human-computer interaction at Oswego. He says employers constantly fear hiring someone who lacks proper skills or doesn't mesh. Having input may mean better job candidates. This summer, Mr. McGloon has three SUNY Oswego interns. "We plug them right into the team," he says. "Not only can you gauge their training, you can judge the team fit, which is hard to do in an interview."
While jobs at Welch Allyn may not require a master's, the degree has been used as a sorting mechanism. After posting an opening for a technical writer, Mr. McGloon received "dozens and dozens" of resumes. Those in charge of hiring wondered where to start. "I said, 'Half of our applicants have master's. That's our first cut.' "
Laura Georgianna, in charge of employee development at Welch Allyn, confirms that given two otherwise equal resumes, the master's wins. A master's degree "doesn't guarantee that someone will be much more successful," she says. "It says that this person is committed and dedicated to the work and has committed to the deep dive. It gives you further assurance that this is something they have thought about and want."
The exposure to workplaces, and those doing the hiring, makes master's programs appealing to students. "The networking has been unbelievable," says Omar Holguin. His 2009 B.S. in engineering yielded only a job at a concrete mixing company. At the University of Texas, El Paso, which is offering a new master's in construction management, he's interning with a company doing work he's actually interested in, on energy efficiency.
There may be logic in trying to better match higher education to labor needs, but Dr. Vedder is concerned by the shift of graduate work from intellectual pursuit to a skill-based "ticket to a vocation." What's happening to academic reflection? Must knowledge be demonstrable to be valuable?
The questions matter, not just to the world of jobs, but also to the world of ideas. Nancy Sinkoff, chairwoman of the Jewish studies department at Rutgers, says its master's, which starts this fall, will position students for jobs but be about inquiry and deep learning.
"I would imagine in the museum world, I would want to hire someone with content," she says hopefully. "To say, 'I have a master's in Jewish studies,' what better credential to have when you are on the market?"
"This will make you more marketable," she is convinced. "This is how we are selling it."
Whether employers will intuit the value of a master's in Jewish studies is unclear. The history department at the University of Central Florida has learned that just because a content-rich syllabus includes applied skills (and internships) doesn't mean students will be hired. "Right now, yes, it's very hard to get a job" with a master's in public history, says Rosalind J. Beiler, chairwoman of the history department, noting that the downturn hurt employers like museums and historical societies.
The university is revamping its master's in public history, a field that interprets academic history for general audiences, to emphasize new-media skills in the hopes of yielding more job placements. "That is precisely the reason we are going in that direction," she says.
"Digital humanities," as this broad movement is called, is leading faculty members to seek fresh ways to make history more accessible and relevant in their teaching and research. A professor of Middle Eastern history, for example, has made podcasts of local Iraqi war veterans in a course on the history of Iraq.
It may be uncomfortable for academia to bend itself to the marketplace, but more institutions are trying.
In what could be a sign of things to come, the German department at the University of Colorado, Boulder, is proposing a Ph.D. aimed at professionals. Candidates, perhaps with an eye toward the European Union, would develop cultural understanding useful in international business and organizations. It would be time-limited to four years -- not the current "12-year ticket to oblivion," says John A. Stevenson, dean of the graduate school. And yes, it would include study abroad and internships.
Dr. Stevenson sees a model here that other humanities departments may want to emulate.
It does, however, prompt the question: Will the Ph.D. become the new master's?
Correction: August 7, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the university that is revamping its master's in public history. It is the University of Central Florida, not the University of South Florida.

Abstract: Justifying a Tax At least 30 cities and states have considered taxes on soda or all sugar-sweetened beverages, and they're a logical target: of the 278 additional calories Americans on average consumed per day between 1977 and 2001, more than 40 percent came from soda, "fruit" drinks, mixes like Kool-Aid and Crystal Light, and beverages like Red Bull, Gatorade and dubious offerings like Vitamin Water, which contains half as much sugar as Coke.

Full text: Mark Bittman writes about food for the opinion section.
WHAT will it take to get Americans to change our eating habits? The need is indisputable, since heart disease, diabetes and cancer are all in large part caused by the Standard American Diet. (Yes, it's SAD.)
Though experts increasingly recommend a diet high in plants and low in animal products and processed foods, ours is quite the opposite, and there's little disagreement that changing it could improve our health and save tens of millions of lives.
And -- not inconsequential during the current struggle over deficits and spending -- a sane diet could save tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars in health care costs.
Yet the food industry appears incapable of marketing healthier foods. And whether its leaders are confused or just stalling doesn't matter, because the fixes are not really their problem. Their mission is not public health but profit, so they'll continue to sell the health-damaging food that's most profitable, until the market or another force skews things otherwise. That "other force" should be the federal government, fulfilling its role as an agent of the public good and establishing a bold national fix.
Rather than subsidizing the production of unhealthful foods, we should turn the tables and tax things like soda, French fries, doughnuts and hyperprocessed snacks. The resulting income should be earmarked for a program that encourages a sound diet for Americans by making healthy food more affordable and widely available.
The average American consumes 44.7 gallons of soft drinks annually. (Although that includes diet sodas, it does not include noncarbonated sweetened beverages, which add up to at least 17 gallons a person per year.) Sweetened drinks could be taxed at 2 cents per ounce, so a six-pack of Pepsi would cost $1.44 more than it does now. An equivalent tax on fries might be 50 cents per serving; a quarter extra for a doughnut. (We have experts who can figure out how "bad" a food should be to qualify, and what the rate should be; right now they're busy calculating ethanol subsidies. Diet sodas would not be taxed.)
Simply put: taxes would reduce consumption of unhealthful foods and generate billions of dollars annually. That money could be used to subsidize the purchase of staple foods like seasonal greens, vegetables, whole grains, dried legumes and fruit.
We could sell those staples cheap -- let's say for 50 cents a pound -- and almost everywhere: drugstores, street corners, convenience stores, bodegas, supermarkets, liquor stores, even schools, libraries and other community centers.
This program would, of course, upset the processed food industry. Oh well. It would also bug those who might resent paying more for soda and chips and argue that their right to eat whatever they wanted was being breached. But public health is the role of the government, and our diet is right up there with any other public responsibility you can name, from water treatment to mass transit.
Some advocates for the poor say taxes like these are unfair because low-income people pay a higher percentage of their income for food and would find it more difficult to buy soda or junk. But since poor people suffer disproportionately from the cost of high-quality, fresh foods, subsidizing those foods would be particularly beneficial to them.
Right now it's harder for many people to buy fruit than Froot Loops; chips and Coke are a common breakfast. And since the rate of diabetes continues to soar -- one-third of all Americans either have diabetes or are pre-diabetic, most with Type 2 diabetes, the kind associated with bad eating habits -- and because our health care bills are on the verge of becoming truly insurmountable, this is urgent for economic sanity as well as national health.
Justifying a Tax
At least 30 cities and states have considered taxes on soda or all sugar-sweetened beverages, and they're a logical target: of the 278 additional calories Americans on average consumed per day between 1977 and 2001, more than 40 percent came from soda, "fruit" drinks, mixes like Kool-Aid and Crystal Light, and beverages like Red Bull, Gatorade and dubious offerings like Vitamin Water, which contains half as much sugar as Coke.
Some states already have taxes on soda -- mostly low, ineffective sales taxes paid at the register. The current talk is of excise taxes, levied before purchase.
"Excise taxes have the benefit of being incorporated into the shelf price, and that's where consumers make their purchasing decisions," says Lisa Powell, a senior research scientist at the Institute for Health Research and Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "And, as per-unit taxes, they avoid volume discounts and are ultimately more effective in raising prices, so they have greater impact."
Much of the research on beverage taxes comes from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale. Its projections indicate that taxes become significant at the equivalent of about a penny an ounce, a level at which three very good things should begin to happen: the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages should decrease, as should the incidence of disease and therefore public health costs; and money could be raised for other uses.
Even in the current antitax climate, we'll probably see new, significant soda taxes soon, somewhere; Philadelphia, New York (city and state) and San Francisco all considered them last year, and the scenario for such a tax spreading could be similar to that of legalized gambling: once the income stream becomes apparent, it will seem irresistible to cash-strapped governments.
Currently, instead of taxing sodas and other unhealthful food, we subsidize them (with, I might note, tax dollars!). Direct subsidies to farmers for crops like corn (used, for example, to make now-ubiquitous high-fructose corn syrup) and soybeans (vegetable oil) keep the prices of many unhealthful foods and beverages artificially low. There are indirect subsidies as well, because prices of junk foods don't reflect the costs of repairing our health and the environment.
Other countries are considering or have already started programs to tax foods with negative effects on health. Denmark's saturated-fat tax is going into effect Oct. 1, and Romania passed (and then un-passed) something similar; earlier this month, a French minister raised the idea of tripling the value added tax on soda. Meanwhile, Hungary is proposing a new tax on foods with "too much" sugar, salt or fat, while increasing taxes on liquor and soft drinks, all to pay for state-financed health care; and Brazil's Fome Zero (Zero Hunger) program features subsidized produce markets and state-sponsored low-cost restaurants.
Putting all of those elements together could create a national program that would make progress on a half-dozen problems at once -- disease, budget, health care, environment, food access and more -- while paying for itself. The benefits are staggering, and though it would take a level of political will that's rarely seen, it's hardly a moonshot.
The need is dire: efforts to shift the national diet have failed, because education alone is no match for marketing dollars that push the very foods that are the worst for us. (The fast-food industry alone spent more than $4 billion on marketing in 2009; the Department of Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion is asking for about a third of a percent of that in 2012: $13 million.) As a result, the percentage of obese adults has more than doubled over the last 30 years; the percentage of obese children has tripled. We eat nearly 10 percent more animal products than we did a generation or two ago, and though there may be value in eating at least some animal products, we could perhaps live with reduced consumption of triple bacon cheeseburgers.
Government and Public Health
Health-related obesity costs are projected to reach $344 billion by 2018 -- with roughly 60 percent of that cost borne by the federal government. For a precedent in attacking this problem, look at the action government took in the case of tobacco.
The historic 1998 tobacco settlement, in which the states settled health-related lawsuits against tobacco companies, and the companies agreed to curtail marketing and finance antismoking efforts, was far from perfect, but consider the results. More than half of all Americans who once smoked have quit and smoking rates are about half of what they were in the 1960s.
It's true that you don't need to smoke and you do need to eat. But you don't need sugary beverages (or the associated fries), which have been linked not only to Type 2 diabetes and increased obesity but also to cardiovascular diseases and decreased intake of valuable nutrients like calcium. It also appears that liquid calories provide less feeling of fullness; in other words, when you drink a soda it's probably in addition to your other calorie intake, not instead of it.
To counter arguments about their nutritional worthlessness, expect to see "fortified" sodas -- a la Red Bull, whose vitamins allegedly "support mental and physical performance" -- and "improved" junk foods (Less Sugar! Higher Fiber!). Indeed, there may be reasons to make nutritionally worthless foods less so, but it's better to decrease their consumption.
Forcing sales of junk food down through taxes isn't ideal. First off, we'll have to listen to nanny-state arguments, which can be countered by the acceptance of the anti-tobacco movement as well as a dozen other successful public health measures. Then there are the predictions of job loss at soda distributorships, but the same predictions were made about the tobacco industry, and those were wrong. (For that matter, the same predictions were made around the nickel deposit on bottles, which most shoppers don't even notice.) Ultimately, however, both consumers and government will be more than reimbursed in the form of cheaper healthy staples, lowered health care costs and better health. And that's a big deal.
The Resulting Benefits
A study by Y. Claire Wang, an assistant professor at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, predicted that a penny tax per ounce on sugar-sweetened beverages in New York State would save $3 billion in health care costs over the course of a decade, prevent something like 37,000 cases of diabetes and bring in $1 billion annually. Another study shows that a two-cent tax per ounce in Illinois would reduce obesity in youth by 18 percent, save nearly $350 million and bring in over $800 million taxes annually.
Scaled nationally, as it should be, the projected benefits are even more impressive; one study suggests that a national penny-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would generate at least $13 billion a year in income while cutting consumption by 24 percent. And those numbers would swell dramatically if the tax were extended to more kinds of junk or doubled to two cents an ounce. (The Rudd Center has a nifty revenue calculator online that lets you play with the numbers yourself.)
A 20 percent increase in the price of sugary drinks nationally could result in about a 20 percent decrease in consumption, which in the next decade could prevent 1.5 million Americans from becoming obese and 400,000 cases of diabetes, saving about $30 billion.
It's fun -- inspiring, even -- to think about implementing a program like this. First off, though the reduced costs of healthy foods obviously benefit the poor most, lower prices across the board keep things simpler and all of us, especially children whose habits are just developing, could use help in eating differently. The program would also bring much needed encouragement to farmers, including subsidies, if necessary, to grow staples instead of commodity crops.
Other ideas: We could convert refrigerated soda machines to vending machines that dispense grapes and carrots, as has already been done in Japan and Iowa. We could provide recipes, cooking lessons, even cookware for those who can't afford it. Television public-service announcements could promote healthier eating. (Currently, 86 percent of food ads now seen by children are for foods high in sugar, fat or sodium.)
Money could be returned to communities for local spending on gyms, pools, jogging and bike trails; and for other activities at food distribution centers; for Meals on Wheels in those towns with a large elderly population, or for Head Start for those with more children; for supermarkets and farmers' markets where needed. And more.
By profiting as a society from the foods that are making us sick and using those funds to make us healthy, the United States would gain the same kind of prestige that we did by attacking smoking. We could institute a national, comprehensive program that would make us a world leader in preventing chronic or "lifestyle" diseases, which for the first time in history kill more people than communicable ones. By doing so, we'd not only repair some of the damage we have caused by first inventing and then exporting the Standard American Diet, we'd also set a new standard for the rest of the world to follow.

Full text: John Githongo is the chief executive of Inuka Kenya Trust and chairman of the Africa Institute for Governing With Integrity. He was Kenya's permanent secretary for governance and ethics from 2003 to 2005.
Nairobi, Kenya
ACROSS the Middle East and North Africa, superficial political calm has been shattered by convulsions of rage. Idealistic young protesters have toppled some of the most ruthless and well-resourced political strongmen on the planet. In sub-Saharan Africa, many are asking: will the Arab Spring spread south?
Thus far, the authoritarian leaders who dominate the continent have withstood protests, stubbornly maintaining that tribalism will save them. They and their loyal supporters insist that African societies are so fragmented along ethnic, sectarian and regional lines that it would be impossible today to whip up the perfect Tahrir Square storm; instead, they believe, an outcome like Libya's civil war or the messy departure of Yemen's president is more likely.
And yet many of the underlying realities are the same. As food and fuel prices rise, inflation is driving millions of Africans below the poverty line just when the world's great aggregators of economic data have been preaching the opposite: that growth will benefit all. Radical and growing economic inequality animated much of what was at stake in the various Arab uprisings, and it will play a major role in shaping African politics for years to come.
The Tunisian street vendor who set himself alight was not so different from the disaffected young men of Nairobi's and Kampala's slums. They are Africa's overwhelming majority: poor, marginalized and angry about corruption and soaring food and fuel prices. It is those young men and women who endure the daily humiliations of poverty, struggling to find jobs as elites crow about "growth" and an African renaissance.
But the much-vaunted middle class remains a tiny sliver of the population in most African countries -- one that is largely dependent on state patronage for its survival. Africa's middle class has grown in recent years, but its members are politically and economically vulnerable and their lives can be overturned by the whims of elites who rule instead of govern.
Meanwhile, the poor are assaulted daily by the potent symbols of rising inequality: glitzy malls filled with designer goods and status-enhancing baubles that cost 10 times the monthly minimum wage. Jealousy of ill-gotten gains is particularly acute among members of the giant youth bulge across Africa and the Middle East -- in Kenya, for example, over 78 percent of the population is younger than 34, and that population is growing at one million a year.
Their resentment is only heightened by the tools of the information age, which remind them that they have been excluded from feeding at the trough enjoyed so blatantly by the nouveau riche -- a lifestyle that is showcased by the newly minted wealthy on television, Twitter, Facebook and the Web in infuriating detail. Globalization has changed the aspirations of the poor, and their expectations will follow.
Indeed, it is resentment of the president's son's Ferrari, more than envy of Europe and America's comparative wealth, that is driving young Africans into the streets to challenge their kleptocratic governments. If the Arab revolutions have taught us anything, it is that inequality and perceptions of inequality within poor countries have now replaced poverty as the No. 1 development challenge facing the world. And consequently, the struggle to mitigate inequality, rather than "making poverty history" through debt relief has become the most urgent task. Narrowing wealth disparities within nations rather than among them is now paramount.
The world has seen a dramatic decline in global poverty over the last decade. The total number of poor people around the world fell to under 900 million in 2010 from over 1.3 billion in 2005 -- most of them in China. Although the Chinese Communist Party celebrates the nation's economic progress, it also recognizes that growth has been far from evenly distributed. The latest Chinese development plan specifically confronts inequality and attempts to mitigate it. African leaders have yet to catch on, and consequently inequality has been left to fester.
Across the world, as growth has spread and accelerated, so has inequality. It is clear that growth is often not enough to guarantee stable, cohesive societies. Rather than create a rising tide that lifts all boats, it can actually increase inequality in a society. And inequality, unlike poverty, is far more easily politicized, ethnicized and militarized, especially in African countries with heterogeneous populations and weak judicial and regulatory institutions. It is also far more combustible because it creates an identifiable enemy -- a class that benefits disproportionately because of its unfair access to those who wield power. Mismanaging it can be catastrophic.
Steady economic growth and urbanization, combined with high levels of youth unemployment and conspicuous consumption on the part of the corrupt ruling elite, create a situation in which growth exacerbates political volatility instead of quelling it. China, with its highly centralized system of economic management and ruthlessly efficient security machine, has been able to keep a lid on the contradictions thus far.
But as African countries grow, despite the unevenly shared benefits of that growth, the expectations of the poor and the aspiring middle class will continue to advance -- aided by social media -- and both groups will only become more angry and predisposed to protest as they perceive the stark inequalities surrounding them.
That is precisely what happened in Tunisia and Egypt. It is no coincidence that five Arab countries -- including Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco -- were among the top 10 listed in the United Nations Human Development Report's assessment of progress last year. Their advances were largely due to decades of improvements in health and education. Indeed, in 1970, according to research by Mwangi Kimenyi of the Brookings Institution, life expectancy in Tunisia was lower than in Congo Republic -- and there were fewer children in school in Morocco than in Malawi.
The Arab Spring occurred at a moment when economic development had outpaced political development in much of the region; ossified political systems no longer satisfied a population yearning for modern freedoms. The explosive democratization in the Arab world, therefore, is a result of development's success, not its failure. An authoritarian country cannot grow itself out of its fundamental underlying political contradictions. Eventually, a democratic deficit sets in.
A country can experience economic growth and get all the hardware of governance right (education, health, infrastructure, sanitation) while getting all the software wrong (basic freedoms, leadership, mitigating inequalities, addressing the youths' demands). Eventually the system crashes. We've seen it in North Africa and the Middle East. And Kenya's postelection meltdown in 2007-8 came on the heels of a five-year economic boom. It was also a period of particularly parochial and backward politics, which laid the groundwork for violent polarization along ethnic lines.
IMPROVED macroeconomic management, higher commodity prices and a generally positive economic trajectory since the late 1990s could spare sub-Saharan Africa from the spasms erupting throughout the Arab world. But this growth is taking place in a region where the capacity to create jobs in the formal sector has been woefully inadequate; and antediluvian elites have mastered the manipulation of ethnic, linguistic, religious and regional differences to maintain their grip on power. Their rule has turned systemic inequalities and, more important, perceptions of inequality, into potent triggers for violence.
The supreme irony of the Arab Spring is that the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, Malawi and other countries have, in their alarmed reaction to events in North Africa, helped bring the revolution south, at least as an idea. In Kenya, youth groups agitating against soaring commodity prices include "revolution" in their names and slogans. In Uganda, opposition attempts to hold demonstrations against spiraling food prices as well as a mass "walk to work" protest have been met with irrationally disproportionate violence that reveals the deep fears of the country's leaders. And last week, Malawi's police killed at least 18 anti-regime protesters.
By 2025, sub-Saharan Africa will be home to a quarter of the world's people under the age of 24, and their anger is growing. For Africa's youth, many of them educated and unemployed, the future seemingly holds no hope under the current arrangement. Speak to them of G.D.P. growth and their reactions are visceral. "The economy is growing for whom?" they ask. "Not for us!"
For now, their demonstrations have been easily dispersed. But if their complaints merge with long-festering ethnic and regional grievances, that could lead to a far more volatile uprising.
The idea of revolution has arrived, among the minority of youth with access to social media but also among the masses via the poor man's Facebook: FM radio. And their geriatric presidents and prime ministers are nervous.

Full text: Dalian, China
IT was the hot new thing on Wall Street -- one of those exotic investments that seem to promise untold riches for the lucky few.
And, like so many hot new things, it went cold fast.
Such was the fabulous stock-market flameout of a company called Rino International, an untested enterprise that, until recently, would have raised nary an eyebrow in the United States.
But over the last few years, Rino International and scores of other young Chinese companies slipped into the United States stock market through the back door. Rino's American stockholders later lost hundreds of millions of dollars when accusations surfaced that the company had fudged its books. All told, investors' losses on these Chinese ventures have stretched into the billions.
How companies like Rino wormed their way into the temples of American capitalism is a story for these financial times. Even amid the wreckage of the 2007-8 financial collapse, an ecosystem of Wall Street enablers -- bankers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, auditors -- spirited Chinese companies to the United States. With some deft financial maneuvers, these businesses essentially went public while sidestepping the usual rules. Before long, many were trading on the Nasdaq stock market, alongside the likes of Google.
It was all perfectly legal. With bankers' help, the Chinese companies executed what are known as reverse mergers. They bought American companies that were merely shells and assumed those companies' stock tickers -- sort of the Wall Street equivalent of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." The strategy let them avoid reviews with state and federal regulators that are normally required for initial public stock offerings.
At issue now is who should bear responsibility for the bursting of yet another Wall Street bubble. Should it be the Chinese executives and their bankers, who engineered the deals and celebrated these companies? Or should it be the investors, who bought these stocks when, in hindsight, the risks seemed clear enough? The lawsuits are flying.
Next to Bernard L. Madoff and the sins of the subprime era, the supposed shenanigans of a few Chinese companies might seem like small beer. But the developments underscore fundamental questions that came to the fore in the financial crisis: What do the people who create and sell investments owe to those who buy the investments? And where, if anywhere, are the regulators?
Dozens of Chinese companies that, like Rino, entered the United States market via reverse mergers have since been accused of fraud or shoddy accounting. The shares of at least 19 of them have been suspended or delisted by Nasdaq, wiping out billions of dollars in stock market value. Shares of Rino, which were flying high at $35 in 2009, have been removed from the exchange.
Laurence M. Rosen, whose law firm has filed a class-action suit against Rino International, says Rino's bankers failed investors. Wall Street didn't do its homework, he says.
"This is egregious," Mr. Rosen says. "They said they did due diligence but were fooled -- but they weren't doing any solid due diligence."
Rino has been accused of creating phony business contracts and wildly inflating its sales, among other things. Executives at Rino International, which is based here in Dalian and makes industrial pollution control systems, declined to comment, beyond saying that it is conducting business as usual.
THERE is not much to see outside the headquarters of Rino International here. The company resides in a bland corporate park that is home to a number of other Chinese businesses. A guard stands watch at the gated entrance. Inside, workers load steel beams onto trucks. The bang and hum of factory work rises from workshops.
Dalian, a seaport city in northeastern China with a population of about six million, in recent years has developed into a fast-growing hub of machine manufacturing, petrochemicals, oil refining and electronics. Driving this growth have been companies like Rino, whose name means "green promise" in Chinese.
For international investors, Rino was an alluring equation: "China" plus "environment" equals profit. Like many other Chinese companies, Rino faced obstacles in borrowing money from the state-owned banks that dominate the country's economic life. It also confronted hurdles in going public on stock markets in Shanghai or Shenzhen, where share prices have gyrated wildly.
And so the entrepreneurs behind Rino -- Zou Dejun and his wife, Qiu Jianping -- turned to Wall Street.
The matchmaker in this transcontinental deal was an American, Chris Bickel, who earned handsome finder's fees for bringing Chinese companies to the attention of investment bankers and lawyers back in New York. Working from China with a small New York financial advisory firm, Douglas Financial, Mr. Bickel helped package Rino International for its Wall Street debut.
"We determined at the time that this was a significant market and they had the technology," Mr. Bickel recalls, adding that any possible improprieties arose later.
As part of the plan, Rino got new handlers in New York: a law firm, an investor relations firm, a new auditor. To complete the package, the company named as its chief financial officer Bruce Richardson, an American businessman who had spent more than a decade in Shanghai. Mr. Richardson declined to comment.
To gain entry to an American stock market without an I.P.O., Rino needed to find an American shell. Enter Glenn A. Little, a Texas entrepreneur who specialized in buying up defunct companies and selling them in reverse mergers.
In 2002, Mr. Little paid about $100,000 to buy Jade Mountain, a failed medical devices company that had once been publicly traded. Jade Mountain, based in Nevada, had no business operations, no debt, no liabilities. What it had was a current stock registration.
Mr. Little himself was so enamored with Rino that rather than take payment in cash, he asked for shares in Rino. The bankers' pitch seemed irresistible, he recalls, all the more because several big institutions, including Bank of America, were investing in Rino, too.
"They gave me a book and it had the two most exciting words you could hear: 'China' and 'pollution,' " Mr. Little says. "They had audited financials, big-name lawyers and Bank of America."
In October 2007, soon after Rino acquired Jade Mountain, Bank of America and about a dozen other investors, including Alder Capital, a hedge fund, bought Rino shares in what is known as a private placement. That sale raised $25 million. Before long, Rino stock was trading on the over-the-counter market for about $4.50 a share.
Over the next several years, Rino reported ever-higher quarterly profits. It expanded its business and its product line. Word spread on Wall Street: Rino was a company to watch.
David N. Feldman, a New York lawyer and the author of "Reverse Mergers and Other Alternatives to Traditional I.P.O.'s," says that such reverse mergers reflected a confluence of two powerful forces. One the one hand, Chinese companies were desperate to raise capital. On the other, American investors were desperate to tap into China's fast-growing economy. "A lot of this is about access to capital," Mr. Feldman says.
ALAN GREENSPAN and Diana Ross were headliners at a September 2009 investment conference held by an investment bank that is little known outside financial circles: Rodman & Renshaw.
Founded in 2002, Rodman has carved a niche for itself as the Goldman Sachs of private placements -- sales of new stocks or bonds that circumvent the public markets. The hurdles for these private sales are lower than for public offerings, the theory being that the buyers -- large, supposedly sophisticated investors -- can do their own homework.
Like many investors, Rodman smelled opportunity in China, and in 2009, when Rino wanted to raise more money in the United States, the bank gave the Chinese company a prominent place at its gala. The presentation served as Rino's splashy debut before thousands of investors.
A few months later, Rodman helped Rino raise $100 million in a deal that valued the Chinese company at nearly $1 billion. From there, however, Rino's stock price began to decline. In November 2010, it fell off a cliff.
That month, Muddy Waters Research, a firm that has grabbed Wall Street attention by digging up dirt on Chinese companies, released a scathing report on Rino. It said Rino had vastly overstated its revenue, fabricated contracts and diverted tens of millions of dollars to its own executives.
Rino later owned up to some of the findings and cautioned that its financial statements from 2008, 2009 and early 2010 "should no longer be relied upon." Eventually, the S.E.C. suspended trading in its stock.
Representatives of Rodman & Renshaw, which itself went public by assuming the ticker of a defunct company, declined to comment.
WHEN it comes to China, the question on many investors' minds is how fast its economy can keep growing. Beijing has been trying to head off a new surge in inflation.
Back in the United States, there has been an explosion of class-action lawsuits, many of which are aimed at auditors and investment banks that brought Chinese companies to American markets. Everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else: lawyers are blaming the bankers, and the bankers are blaming the auditors, and the auditors are blaming executives in China.
Fanning the flames is an army of private investigators, bloggers and Wall Street short-sellers that hope to profit from the stock-market implosions, like Muddy Waters. In the aftermath of the China meltdown, reverse mergers have slowed sharply, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned investors of risks associated with such deals. S.E.C. officials met Chinese regulators two weeks ago in Beijing to discuss auditing rules for such companies.
Chinese regulators are worried. "I hate these scandals; everybody hates them," Liu Qingsong, deputy director of the research center of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said this month at a conference in Singapore, as reported by Reuters. "The scandals are very damaging to the reputation of all Chinese companies in the U.S." Yet, for many, China seems irresistible, with money to be made and, invariably, lost. Since 1990, the benchmark stock index on the Shanghai exchange has soared 27-fold, despite a crash in 2008 and a lot of ups and downs in between.
One question that won't go away is whether investors can really trust the numbers in China. Even investors like John A. Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made a killing on the subprime collapse, have lost big in China.
Michael Licosati, a founder of Alder Capital, bought shares in Rino. Today, convinced that fraud is rampant in China, he is betting against such stocks.
"You cannot compare the capitalist system in the U.S. with the capitalist system in China," he says. Bank of America, another early Rino investor, declined to comment.
In Dalian, Ms. Qiu, Rino's chairwoman and the wife of its C.E.O., says only that it is business as usual at the company. "What I can tell you is that our company is doing well and the operation has been very normal," she says.
Inside the gated compound, workers in tarred jerseys and goggles weld and drive screws. Back in New York, Rino's shares are frozen at 40 cents.

Full text: THE worse things get, the better it looks for gold. That's been the pattern this summer.
Worried about Greece, the future of the euro, the debt ceiling in the United States, or maybe even about the entire global economy? Buy gold bullion.
Plenty of investors, at least, have been thinking that way, driving the price of gold to nominal, if not inflation-adjusted, highs.
Last week, as separate teams of high-level negotiators sought solutions to the Greek debt crisis and to the debt-ceiling morass in Washington, gold crossed $1,600 an ounce for the first time ever.
While the price fell on signs of progress on these nettlesome issues, gold ended the week at $1,602.60. (That's well below its 1980 inflation-adjusted peak of $2,516, said Edward Yardeni, an independent economist.) Gold hasn't been flying this high since the halcyon days of supply-side economics early in the Reagan administration.
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is hardly a gold bug, but he has taken notice. In response to brisk questioning by Representative Ron Paul -- the Texas Republican who is running for president for the third time, and has advocated a return to the gold standard -- Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that he is paying attention to gold prices.
"I think the reason people hold gold is as protection against what we call 'tail risk' -- really, really bad outcomes," Mr. Bernanke said at a Congressional hearing this month. "To the extent that the last few years have made people more worried about the potential of a major crisis, then they have gold as a protection."
In a recent column, I noted that some experts don't consider gold an appropriate asset in a typical diversified investment portfolio, partly because it generates no earnings, yet holding it entails cost. Gold is, however, certainly a financial asset, held by many central banks and prized by many private investors around the world.
Jeffrey Sica, for example, president of SICA Wealth Management in Morristown, N.J., is bullish about gold and other commodities -- and bearish about nearly every other asset class.
"Right now, I think gold looks better than ever," he said. His reasoning mirrors Mr. Bernanke's, at least in this way: Mr. Sica say that he sees a painfully high probability of unfortunate events occurring in the months ahead, and that he believes gold will provide some shelter.
He departs sharply from the central banker's views, though, in saying that the Fed's expansionary policy known as quantitative easing "just hasn't worked." Furthermore, he expects the economy to weaken further, and the European sovereign debt crisis "to be with us for some time, regardless of whatever is arranged short term, and it will end up hurting many banks."
While there may be what he calls a "relief rally" if the immediate crises seem to be resolved, he says that there has been a "general loss of confidence in the ability of central banks and governments to manage the economy."
"That will continue to give gold and other precious metals a boost," he adds.
Even at central banks, gold's standing has risen in some respects lately. In June, UBS held a gathering of managers of central bank reserves, multilateral institutions and sovereign wealth funds, and found that a plurality believed gold would be the best-performing asset class through the end of 2011.
WHAT'S more, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist for UBS Investment Bank, a majority said they expected that the dollar would no longer be the most important reserve currency in the world in 25 years. Instead, they expected that "a portfolio of currencies" would replace it. Less than 10 percent envisioned gold ascending to that role.
Still, the World Gold Council, which tracks gold stocks, says the world's central banks already hold roughly 29,000 tons of gold. Only about 166,000 tons have been mined throughout world history, the council says, so the central banks hold a significant portion of it.
Why? Most of it is a legacy of the time when major currencies were pegged to gold -- in the days before Aug. 15, 1971, when President Richard M. Nixon took the United States off the gold standard. With more than 8,000 tons, the United States has more official gold stocks than any other country, the council says.
The United States ought to use that hoard to return the dollar to a gold standard, says Jeffrey Bell, who is trying to make this an issue in the 2012 presidential campaign. Mr. Bell has advocated the gold standard for years -- and did so as the Republican senatorial candidate in New Jersey in 1978.
He was defeated by Bill Bradley, sometimes known as Dollar Bill because of his solid performance as a basketball player for the New York Knicks.
Mr. Bell recalls ruefully: "I used to hold up a dollar bill at campaign rallies and say, there's nothing behind this now, we have to put something solid behind it. History shows that I lost."
Lewis E. Lehrman, a friend and ally of Mr. Bell's, says a gold standard would require the government to balance its budget and its current account. He says that, among other things, it would have made it impossible to accumulate the enormous private-sector debt load that led to the financial crisis of 2007.
Mr. Lehrman, once the president of the Rite Aid Corporation and now a philanthropist and historian, ran for governor of New York in 1982 but was defeated in the general election by Mario Cuomo. In a telephone interview last week, Mr. Lehrman said, "The debts in the American banking system that were amassed simply would not have been feasible if you had direct convertibility of currency into gold."
He acknowledges that returning to a gold standard won't happen overnight. But, he says, it will happen, "because the failure of all of the other approaches will become evident to the American people."
The last apex of the back-to-gold movement was perhaps in 1980. It may have been a signal that the price of gold was about to peak. Could we be approaching a turning point now? "You could make that argument," Mr. Bell says. "The big question is whether the government and the Federal Reserve will be able to get the economy under control without a return to gold."

Abstract: Mr. Obama said Mr. Boehner had stopped returning his calls when it became clear that rank-and-file House Republicans would not agree to raise revenues on wealthy Americans as part of a debt-reduction deal, despite Mr. Obama's concessions on reducing future spending for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The breakdown was the second time this month that Mr. Boehner had walked away from the table with Mr. Obama after word of their private talks was leaked to the news media, provoking protests from Republican lawmakers and antitax conservative groups.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Negotiations over a broad deficit reduction plan collapsed in acrimony on Friday after Speaker John A. Boehner suddenly broke off talks with President Obama, raising the risk of an economy-shaking default.
The latest turn in the summer's epic clash between the White House and Congressional Republicans came little more than a week before the government hits its borrowing ceiling, and set off accusations from both sides about who was to blame.
A visibly angry President Obama, in a hastily scheduled White House news conference, demanded that Congressional leaders come to the White House on Saturday morning. "I want them here at 11 a.m. tomorrow," he said. "They are going to have to explain to me how it is that we are going to avoid default."
Mr. Obama said Mr. Boehner had stopped returning his calls when it became clear that rank-and-file House Republicans would not agree to raise revenues on wealthy Americans as part of a debt-reduction deal, despite Mr. Obama's concessions on reducing future spending for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Both sides have sought a deficit-reduction agreement as part of the essential vote to raise the government's $14.3 trillion debt limit, which will be reached Aug. 2.
In a letter to his Republican colleagues on Friday night, Mr. Boehner said, "A deal was never reached, and was never really close." He added: "In the end, we couldn't connect. Not because of different personalities, but because of different visions for our country."
The speaker said Mr. Obama wanted to raise taxes too high and would not make "fundamental changes" to entitlement benefit programs like Medicare.
But according to a White House official, Mr. Obama had agreed over the coming decade to cut $250 billion from Medicare spending and $310 billion from other domestic entitlement programs, like farm subsidies and education programs. And Mr. Obama was willing to change the formula for Social Security cost-of living adjustments, which many economists say would more accurately reflect inflation, for savings of about $125 billion more.
All of Mr. Obama's concessions on the benefit programs were contingent, however, on Mr. Boehner and Republicans agreeing to higher taxes for wealthy individuals and corporations.
At the news conference, Mr. Obama said Republicans were forfeiting an "extraordinarily fair deal" to trim the deficit and raise the debt ceiling. "I have gone out of my way to make compromises," the president added.
"Essentially what we had offered Speaker Boehner was over a trillion dollars in cuts to discretionary spending, both domestic and defense," Mr. Obama said. "We then offered an additional $650 billion in cuts to entitlement programs Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. We believed that it was possible to shape those in a way that preserved the integrity of the system, made them available for the next generation and did not affect current beneficiaries in an adverse way."
Republicans, though, said that the White House pushed for more revenue midway through the talks. "The White House moved the goal posts," Mr. Boehner said in a news conference.
The breakdown was the second time this month that Mr. Boehner had walked away from the table with Mr. Obama after word of their private talks was leaked to the news media, provoking protests from Republican lawmakers and antitax conservative groups.
"I've been left at the altar now a couple of times," Mr. Obama said. "And I think that one of the questions that the Republican Party is going to have to ask itself is, Can they say yes to anything?"
This time, however, Mr. Obama had also faced a firestorm from within his party, because of the spending cuts he was considering with Mr. Boehner.
Hours before the tempest, the three top stewards of the nation's financial system -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner; Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- had met to discuss how to react to shield the economy from the blow if Congress failed to raise the debt limit. But in a joint statement, they said they remained confident Congress would act.
Mr. Obama, too, said he thought that default could be avoided. "I am less confident at this point that people are willing to step up to the plate and actually deal with the underlying problem of debt and deficits," he said at his news conference.
Mr. Boehner said he would work now with Senate leaders on a plan to raise the debt limit.
Just what form the new legislative proposal will take was uncertain, as lawmakers and their top aides had only opened talks about how to proceed. Some expected it to be built upon an earlier plan by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who employed an arcane process to allow a debt limit increase to occur over the objections of Congress.
But in a statement, Mr. McConnell noted that the speaker had expressed an interest in trying to find a "new path forward" with Senate Democrats, suggesting that he wanted to go in a different direction than the McConnell plan, which had drawn stiff opposition in the House. It could still provide a last-ditch alternative if all else fails.
Even before the day's events, deep pessimism had settled over Washington as the two main alternatives to an Obama-Boehner proposal were either defeated or shelved. First, Mr. McConnell shelved the approach he was working on with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, amid growing resistance in both parties.
And as expected, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted down a measure that House Republicans approved earlier in the week that would force the government to shrink to the smallest level in many decades. Many House Republicans have said they would not approve an increase in the debt limit without the "cut, cap and balance" package becoming law, too.
Republican officials said the talks between the administration and the speaker had produced consensus on some major issues.
But they said the negotiations were complicated by this week's release of a separate deficit-cutting plan by a bipartisan Senate group, the so-called Gang of Six, that proposed more tax revenues than agreed upon by Republicans and the White House. The officials, speaking on background, said that this development led Mr. Obama to push for additional revenues as well, and the differences could not be bridged.
Democrats said that, to their chagrin, Mr. Obama pushed for more entitlement savings than even the Gang of Six supported.
Earlier Friday, in a public event at the University of Maryland, in College Park, Mr. Obama for the first time addressed, and ruled out, the idea that in an emergency the Constitution would empower him to raise the debt limit to prevent default and, as he put it, "basically ignore" the federal law requiring that the debt ceiling be set by statute.
The argument of "the constitutional option," which President Bill Clinton, like Mr. Obama a former constitutional law instructor, endorsed this week, is based on the Fourteenth Amendment's provision that the validity of the United States debt "shall not be questioned." "I have talked to my lawyers," Mr. Obama said, and "they are not persuaded that that is a winning argument."
But with the Aug. 2 deadline now looming, lawmakers were bracing for the worst in what Senator Mark Pryor called a "cliff-hanger moment."
"The unthinkable could happen," said Mr. Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat. "The 80 million bills the federal government pays could come to a screeching halt.
"That means millions of seniors may not receive their Social Security checks in the mail. Troops may not receive paychecks."
"Americans and leaders all over the world are now watching," he added. "The question for Congress remains: Will we rise to the occasion, or will we fail?"

Abstract: [...] they probably have the elements that have been part of just about every recent bipartisan debt proposal: some sort of tax reform that lowers overall rates while raising revenue by closing loopholes; cuts in the level of entitlement spending without much fundamental reform; a freeze on domestic discretionary spending. The compromise put together by Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, that's been floating around is a ploy to evade responsibility.

Full text: Imagine you're a member of Congress. You have your own preferred way to reduce debt. If you're a Democrat, it probably involves protecting Medicare and raising taxes. If you're a Republican, it probably involves cutting spending, reforming Medicare and keeping taxes low.
Your plan is going nowhere. There just aren't the votes. Meanwhile, the debt ceiling is fast approaching and a national catastrophe could be just weeks away.
At the last minute, two bipartisan approaches heave into view. In the Senate, the "Gang of Six" produces one Grand Bargain. Meanwhile, President Obama and John Boehner, the House speaker, have been quietly working on another. They suddenly seem close to a deal.
There's a lot you don't know about these two Grand Bargains. But they probably have the elements that have been part of just about every recent bipartisan debt proposal: some sort of tax reform that lowers overall rates while raising revenue by closing loopholes; cuts in the level of entitlement spending without much fundamental reform; a freeze on domestic discretionary spending. Mostly, there will be vagueness. The specifics of what exactly will be cut and who will be taxed will not be filled in.
You are being asked to support a foggy approach, not a specific plan. You are being asked to do this even though you have no faith in the other party and limited faith in the leadership of your own. You are being asked to risk your political life for an approach that bears little resemblance to what you would ideally prefer.
Do you do this? I think you do.
You do it because all the other options are worse. Doing nothing could lead to default and the end of American economic supremacy. The compromise put together by Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, that's been floating around is a ploy to evade responsibility. Punting with some small package would spook the markets and reflect dishonor on yourself.
You do it because even though you are unhappy, you see that people on the other end of the political spectrum are also unhappy. If you're a conservative, you see that some liberals, according to Barbara Mikulski, are "volcanic" with rage at Obama. If you're a Democrat, you see the Tea Party-types sniping at Boehner and some Republican presidential candidates completely stonewalling a deal. These signs make you feel better.
You do it because while the Grand Bargains won't solve most of our fiscal problems. They will produce some incremental progress. We won't fundamentally address the debt until we control health care inflation. But there is no agreement on how to do this, and it's unrealistic to hold up an incremental deal just because no permanent one is on offer.
Both Grand Bargains produce real fiscal progress. They aim for $3 trillion or $4 trillion in debt reduction. Boehner and Obama have talked about raising the Medicare eligibility age and reducing Social Security benefit increases. The White House is offering big cuts in exchange for some revenue increases, or small cuts in exchange for few or none. The Gang of Six has a less-compelling blend of cuts, but it would repeal the Class Act, a health care Ponzi scheme. It would force committees across Congress to cut spending, and it would introduce an enforcement mechanism if they don't. Sure there's chicanery, but compared with any recent real-life budget, from Republican or Democratic administrations, these approaches are models of fiscal rectitude.
You do it because both bargains would boost growth. The tax code really is a travesty and a drag on the country's economic dynamism. Any serious effort to simplify the code, strip out tax expenditures and reduce rates would have significant positive effects -- even if it raised some tax revenues along the way.
You do it because you know the political climate will be worse for a deal in 2013. If you're a Republican, you know Obama might win re-election, and even if the G.O.P. swept everything, you know your party wouldn't have the guts to cut entitlements unilaterally (that's why the cut, cap and balance bill didn't mention the specific programs that would face the ax). If you're a Democrat, you know Obama might lose, and, even if he doesn't, the Senate will likely tilt rightward.
Mostly you do it because you want to live in a country than can govern itself. Over the past few weeks, Washington has seemed dysfunctional. Public disgust has risen to epic levels. Yet through all this, serious people -- Barack Obama, John Boehner, the members of the Gang of Six -- have soldiered on. They've been responsible and brave. If you're a Democrat, you hate to see domestic cuts. If you're a Republican, you loathe revenue increases, even little ones.
But this is the next step in the journey toward economic health. Standing still is not an option. Keep your reservations in mind, but let the mission continue.

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "The Pentagon's Financial Drawdown," by Gordon R. England (Op-Ed, July 15): The president's proposed reduction of $400 billion in Pentagon spending over a decade should not be referred to as a "cut." It is measured relative to the Pentagon's unrealistic plans, not against current levels of spending. In fact, the $400 billion can be accommodated while letting the current budget grow with inflation.
An across-the-board reduction in the rate of growth of Pentagon spending will not "result in a hollowed-out force that will embolden our enemies," as Mr. England suggests. Over the last few years, United States military spending has been at post-World War II record levels, and it is almost as large as the military budgets of the rest of the world combined.
A small course correction will not significantly change this spending gap, regardless of how it is carried out.

Abstract: According to widespread reports, White House officials talked about raising the Medicare eligibility age, cutting Social Security by changing the inflation index, freezing domestic discretionary spending and offering to pre-empt the end of the Bush tax cuts in exchange for a broad tax-reform process. Controlling the White House and Congress, perhaps they will have the guts to cut Medicare unilaterally, reform the welfare state and herald in an era of conservative greatness.

Full text: Over the past months, Republicans enjoyed enormous advantages. Opinion polls showed that voters are eager to reduce the federal debt, and they want to do it mostly but not entirely through spending cuts.
There was a Democratic president eager to move to the center. He floated certain ideas that would be normally unheard of from a Democrat. According to widespread reports, White House officials talked about raising the Medicare eligibility age, cutting Social Security by changing the inflation index, freezing domestic discretionary spending and offering to pre-empt the end of the Bush tax cuts in exchange for a broad tax-reform process.
The Democratic offers were slippery, and President Obama didn't put them in writing. But John Boehner, the House speaker, thought they were serious. The liberal activists thought they were alarmingly serious. I can tell you from my reporting that White House officials took them seriously.
The combined effect would have been to reduce the size of government by $3 trillion over a decade. That's a number roughly three times larger than the cost of the Obama health care law. It also would have brutally fractured the Democratic Party.
But the Republican Party decided not to pursue this deal, or even seriously consider it. Instead what happened was this: Conservatives told themselves how steadfast they were being for a few weeks. Then morale crumbled.
This week, Republicans will probably pass a balanced budget Constitutional amendment that has zero chance of becoming law. Then they may end up clinging to a no mas Senate compromise. This proposal would pocket cuts that have already been agreed on, and it would eliminate leverage for future cuts and make them less likely.
It could be that this has been a glorious moment in Republican history. It could be that having persuaded independents that they are a prudent party, Republicans will sweep the next election. Controlling the White House and Congress, perhaps they will have the guts to cut Medicare unilaterally, reform the welfare state and herald in an era of conservative greatness.
But it's much more likely that Republicans will come to regret this missed opportunity. So let us pause to identify the people who decided not to seize the chance to usher in the largest cut in the size of government in American history. They fall into a few categories:
The Beltway Bandits. American conservatism now has a rich network of Washington interest groups adept at arousing elderly donors and attracting rich lobbying contracts. For example, Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform has been instrumental in every recent G.O.P. setback. He was a Newt Gingrich strategist in the 1990s, a major Jack Abramoff companion in the 2000s and he enforced the no-compromise orthodoxy that binds the party today.
Norquist is the Zelig of Republican catastrophe. His method is always the same. He enforces rigid ultimatums that make governance, or even thinking, impossible.
The Big Government Blowhards. The talk-radio jocks are not in the business of promoting conservative governance. They are in the business of building an audience by stroking the pleasure centers of their listeners.
They mostly give pseudo Crispin's Day speeches to battalions of the like-minded from the safety of the conservative ghetto. To keep audience share, they need to portray politics as a cataclysmic, Manichaean struggle. A series of compromises that steadily advance conservative aims would muddy their story lines and be death to their ratings.
The Show Horses. Republicans now have a group of political celebrities who are marvelously uninterested in actually producing results. Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann produce tweets, not laws. They have created a climate in which purity is prized over practicality.
The Permanent Campaigners. For many legislators, the purpose of being in Congress is not to pass laws. It's to create clear contrasts you can take into the next election campaign. It's not to take responsibility for the state of the country and make it better. It's to pass responsibility onto the other party and force them to take as many difficult votes as possible.
All of these groups share the same mentality. They do not see politics as the art of the possible. They do not believe in seizing opportunities to make steady, messy progress toward conservative goals. They believe that politics is a cataclysmic struggle. They believe that if they can remain pure in their faith then someday their party will win a total and permanent victory over its foes. They believe they are Gods of the New Dawn.
Fortunately, there are still practical conservatives in the G.O.P., who believe in results, who believe in intelligent compromise. If people someday decide the events of the past weeks have been a debacle, then practical conservatives may regain control.

Commission to Set Raises for Judges in New York State Is Flooded With Suggestions

Full text: What is the price of administering justice?
That may sound like an existential question. But for a state panel beginning its task of setting salaries for New York's judges, the issue is less of soaring philosophical debate than of convoluted calculations.
Would $220,836 be the proper salary for a judge who now earns $136,700, as one argument filed with the commission suggested? What about $195,754?
The seven members of the commission indicated last week in their first meeting that they thought their summer math-immersion course would put an end to one of the longest-running arguments in Albany, where state judges, numbering more than 1,200, have been lodging complaints about their pay for years.
The panel, the Judicial Compensation Commission, was created last year after the Legislature had failed for 12 years to agree on a raise for judges. Its decision, due in August, is to have the force of law unless overturned by the Legislature and the governor.
William C. Thompson Jr., the panel's chairman and a former New York City comptroller, told the commissioners that they should assume that their conclusion "on the level of compensation for judges is going to be the level of compensation."
The commission will hold its first -- and probably only -- public hearing on Wednesday in Albany. As a result, its members, appointed by the governor, legislative leaders and the state's chief judge, are being inundated with formulas and charts.
The suggestions include every manner of numerical calculation, with most using as a point of reference the current $136,700 salary of State Supreme Court justices, who handle a wide range of cases, including murder cases and malpractice trials, and whose pay would have risen 41 percent if they had received raises to keep pace with inflation, according to one filing.
Each interest group had its own math. The New York City Bar Association argued that given how expensive it is to live in New York City, Supreme Court justices would have to earn $212,000 to be paid in line with the salaries of other big-city judges across the country.
The New York County Lawyers' Association did another calculation: a $60,000 raise "would increase the state budget by less than 55 one-thousandths of one percent."
Not to be outdone, a coalition of 12 judges' organizations put forth 50 facts justifying a big raise, including salaries in New York City's Sanitation Department: 50 employees in the department earn more than almost all New York judges and nearly as much as the state's chief judge, Jonathan Lippman.
Judge Lippman makes $156,000; an intermediate appeals judge makes $144,000; a criminal court judge makes $125,600. The commissioners said they would keep in place the comparative differences for the various levels of the courts.
One commission member, Mark S. Mulholland, a Long Island lawyer, said in an interview that there were numbers of formulas that people were using to make their cases.
But he insisted he was not overwhelmed by numbers as lawyers sometimes are. "I actually did well in math," he said.
Officials at the state's Office of Court Administration presented the commissioners with their own ways of looking at the numbers, including a comparison of New York's judicial salaries with the salaries of judges in other states. New York came in dead last.
The court administrators suggested setting the salary for a State Supreme Court justice between $192,000 and $220,000, a range seemingly intended to give the commission ample leeway to grant a big raise. If, for example, the commission chose a salary less than $192,000, it could appear fiscally responsible even as it doled out raises of 30 percent or so.
For much of the past dozen years, the discussion of judicial salaries has not drawn much passion. But with the commission tackling the issue at a time of state budget problems, the idea of increasing any state salaries is not popular.
State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview that a raise to $220,000 for judges "may not be consistent with the tough environment that's going on right now." He said that in some areas of the state "if a vacancy occurred, you would have lawyers lining up for Supreme Court at the current salary."
In the media and on the Internet, the prospect of a big judicial raise is beginning to draw fiery comments. Judges deserve a raise, "but 62 percent in one shot?" The New York Post asked in an editorial last week after the court administration officials had filed their submission. "No way," the paper commented.
David Bookstaver, the spokesman for the court system, said the proposal offered the commission a range of salary possibilities based on factors set forth in the law. As for the criticism, Mr. Bookstaver called it "a mischaracterization of our submission."
During the panel's meeting last week, three of the seven commissioners appeared ready to grant judges a large raise quickly, two did not suggest views and two said the size of any raise had to be limited by the state's fiscal troubles. "How much can the state afford?" asked Bill Mulrow, who was appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
In the filings, the formulas and calculations are stitched together with arguments. So far, the most ardent -- and the wordiest-- is the one by the judicial associations, which runs 247 pages. "When someone finds out that you are a judge," it said, "and you have not had a raise in over 12 years, most people say, 'That's crazy.' "

Abstract: Elected to represent a slice of rural West Texas in the State House in 1984, Mr. Perry, a young rancher and former Air Force pilot from Paint Creek, about 60 miles north of Abilene, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative. No matter the label beside his name, the news coverage of Mr. Perry's early years reveals the same ambition and enthusiasm for public office that the governor has brought to the national stage as a potential presidential candidate.

Full text: Gov. Rick Perry, a no-apologies conservative known for slashing government spending and opposing all tax increases, is about as Republican as you can get.
But that was not always the case.
Mr. Perry spent his first six years in politics as a Democrat, in a somewhat forgotten history that is sure to be revived and scrutinized by Republican opponents if he decides to run for president.
A raging liberal he was not. Elected to represent a slice of rural West Texas in the State House in 1984, Mr. Perry, a young rancher and former Air Force pilot from Paint Creek, about 60 miles north of Abilene, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative. He was one of a handful of freshman "pit bulls," so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low.
But Mr. Perry cast some votes and took a few stands that seem to be at odds with his fiscal conservatism today. The most vivid example is his support of the $5.7 billion tax hike in 1987, signed by Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican, opposed by most Republican members. The bill passed the House by a 78-70 vote.
Even without adjusting for inflation, the legislation triggered the largest tax increase ever passed in modern Texas, said Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. Today, taking inflation into account, it would be worth more than $11 billion.
Mr. Craymer said the new taxes were used to plug a huge budget shortfall, with the money representing about 20 percent of the general revenue raised during that two-year budget period.
Almost a quarter-century later, Mr. Perry, as governor, was faced with a similar budget shortfall. But he took a markedly different tack this session, opposing any new taxes and signing a budget that made the first reduction in overall spending on public education since at least 1949.
Mark Miner, Mr. Perry's spokesman, said votes cast decades ago do not undermine the governor's overall record, which he said included the largest property-tax cut in state history, enacted in 2006.
"You can pull votes from the 1980s, but the overall track record is one of fiscal responsibility and conservatism," Mr. Miner said.
As a House Democrat, Mr. Perry was also the co-author of legislation aimed at tripling the amount of money state legislators are paid, House records show. In a 1989 interview with The Abilene Reporter-News, Mr. Perry cited the financial hardships Texas legislators faced trying to make a living back home while making a yearly salary of only $7,200 as part-time lawmakers. Voters rejected the proposal in a statewide referendum.
Mr. Miner said Mr. Perry no longer favored giving legislators a pay increase.
Another political move Mr. Perry made back then: he was a top Texas supporter and organizer in 1988 for Al Gore, who ran as a Southern conservative rather than the populist reformer he eventually became as the 2000 Democratic presidential nominee.
"I came to my senses," Mr. Perry likes to say when asked about his Gore days.
In 1984, fellow Democrats recruited Mr. Perry to run for a State House seat vacated by Representative Joe C. Hanna, according to interviews and news articles. John Sharp, a Democrat and the former state comptroller who was a college friend of Mr. Perry's, recalls getting a call from Clyde H. Wells, then the chairman of the Texas A&M System Board of Regents. Mr. Wells wondered who might make a good replacement for Mr. Hanna.
"I said: 'Yeah, there was a guy in my outfit who's from Haskell. Let's find out if he's still in the Air Force,' " Mr. Sharp recalled saying of Mr. Perry. "Three weeks later, he was in the race."
Mr. Perry easily won and quickly became known as a rising star in the Texas House.
Gib Lewis, Democrat of Fort Worth, then the Speaker, decided to appoint several freshman lawmakers to the House Appropriations Committee -- members he knew he could count on to keep spending low.
"All of them were very conservative guys and had a good head on their shoulders, and that's how I picked 'em," Mr. Lewis said. "When he first came to the Legislature it was predominantly white, Democratic, conservative. He was one of them, and I was, too."
No matter the label beside his name, the news coverage of Mr. Perry's early years reveals the same ambition and enthusiasm for public office that the governor has brought to the national stage as a potential presidential candidate.
In one of the first lengthy newspaper profiles of Mr. Perry, in The Abilene Reporter-News, his fellow Representative Cliff Johnson, now a lobbyist and longtime friend, said of him: "He's one of the top two or three (representatives) of the freshman class. I think the sky is the limit."
At the beginning of his six years in the State House, Mr. Perry shot down the notion that he might switch parties, despite the conservative leanings that put him at odds with his party leaders.
After former United States Representative Kent Hance of Lubbock defected to the Republican Party in 1985, Mr. Perry told the Abilene paper he was "disappointed," saying he planned to change his party rather than defect to the other side.
The gap was obvious by 1989, his last year in the Legislature, when Mr. Perry carried a workers' compensation insurance bill that angered Texas trial lawyers, then a powerful force in state politics. That same year, The Dallas Morning News named Mr. Perry one of the state's 10 best legislators, but he was criticized by another publication.
The liberal Texas Observer called Mr. Perry the "Benedict Arnold of the Democratic Party" for siding too often with Mr. Clements.
"If The Texas Observer ever says anything good about me, then I've been hit on the head and they can send me back home," Mr. Perry said.
Rumors that Mr. Perry would defect to the Republican Party -- and run against Jim Hightower, the populist Democratic agriculture commissioner -- picked up steam by late 1989. On Sept. 29, Mr. Perry made it official at a Capitol news conference. At his side were Fred Meyer, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, and Senator Phil Gramm, a former Democrat, who was aggressively courting would-be converts.
Mr. Perry's timing, now legendary, could not have been better. He was one of only two Republicans elected to nonjudicial statewide office in 1990. Eight years later, Republicans swept every one of them.
"Perry has been a risk taker," said Mr. Hance, the party switcher who became the chancellor of Texas Tech University. "And if you look at Perry's timing in every race, he's been the golden guy."

Full text: I hope you had the chance to read and reread Dudley Clendinen's splendid essay, "The Good Short Life," in The Times's Sunday Review section. Clendinen is dying of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S. If he uses all the available medical technology, it will leave him, in a few years' time, "a conscious but motionless, mute, withered, incontinent mummy of my former self."
Instead of choosing that long, dehumanizing, expensive course, Clendinen has decided to face death as one of life's "most absorbing thrills and challenges." He concludes: "When the music stops -- when I can't tie my bow tie, tell a funny story, walk my dog, talk with Whitney, kiss someone special, or tap out lines like this -- I'll know that Life is over. It's time to be gone."
Clendinen's article is worth reading for the way he defines what life is. Life is not just breathing and existing as a self-enclosed skin bag. It's doing the activities with others you were put on earth to do.
But it's also valuable as a backdrop to the current budget mess. This fiscal crisis is about many things, but one of them is our inability to face death -- our willingness to spend our nation into bankruptcy to extend life for a few more sickly months.
The fiscal crisis is driven largely by health care costs. We have the illusion that in spending so much on health care we are radically improving the quality of our lives. We have the illusion that through advances in medical research we are in the process of eradicating deadly diseases. We have the barely suppressed hope that someday all this spending and innovation will produce something close to immortality.
But that's not actually what we are buying. As Daniel Callahan and Sherwin B. Nuland point out in an essay in The New Republic called "The Quagmire," our health care spending and innovation are not leading us toward a limitless extension of a good life.
Callahan, a co-founder of the Hastings Center, the bioethics research institution, and Nuland, a retired clinical professor of surgery at Yale, point out that more than a generation after Richard Nixon declared the "War on Cancer" in 1971, we remain far from a cure. Despite recent gains, there is no cure on the horizon for heart disease or stroke. A panel at the National Institutes of Health recently concluded that little progress had been made toward finding ways to delay Alzheimer's disease.
Years ago, people hoped that science could delay the onset of morbidity. We would live longer, healthier lives and then die quickly. This is not happening. Most of us will still suffer from chronic diseases for years near the end of life, and then die slowly.
S. Jay Olshansky, one of the leading experts on aging, argues that life expectancy is now leveling off. "We have arrived at a moment," Callahan and Nuland conclude, "where we are making little headway in defeating various kinds of diseases. Instead, our main achievements today consist of devising ways to marginally extend the lives of the very sick."
Others disagree with this pessimistic view of medical progress. But that phrase, "marginally extend the lives of the very sick," should ring in the ears. Many of our budget problems spring from our quest to do that.
The fiscal implications are all around. A large share of our health care spending is devoted to ill patients in the last phases of life. This sort of spending is growing fast. Americans spent $91 billion caring for Alzheimer's patients in 2005. By 2015, according to Callahan and Nuland, the cost of Alzheimer's will rise to $189 billion and by 2050 it is projected to rise to $1 trillion annually -- double what Medicare costs right now.
Obviously, we are never going to cut off Alzheimer's patients and leave them out on a hillside. We are never coercively going to give up on the old and ailing. But it is hard to see us reducing health care inflation seriously unless people and their families are willing to do what Clendinen is doing -- confront death and their obligations to the living.
There are many ways to think about the finitude of life. For years, Callahan has been writing about the social solidarity model -- in which death is accepted as a normal part of the human condition and caring is emphasized as much as curing.
In the online version of this column let me provide links to three other essays, which offer other perspectives on why we should accept the finitude of life and the naturalness of death. They are: "Born Toward Dying," by Richard John Neuhaus, "L'Chaim and Its Limits: Why Not Immortality?" by Leon Kass and "Thinking About Aging," by Gilbert Meilaender.
My only point today is that we think the budget mess is a squabble between partisans in Washington. But in large measure it's about our inability to face death and our willingness as a nation to spend whatever it takes to push it just slightly over the horizon.

Full text: HONG KONG -- China, one of the United States's biggest creditors, urged American policy makers on Thursday to act to protect investors' interests, highlighting rising concerns around the globe about the protracted budget talks taking place in Washington.
Officials in Washington are locked in tense negotiations over the government debt limit, which the Obama administration says must be raised from its current level of $14.29 trillion to allow the government to pay its daily bills and service any debt coming due.
Any failure to pay due debt would effectively amount to a default, which, however briefly, could shake confidence in the American economy and unsettle global financial markets.
Late Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service sharpened attention on such an outcome by warning that it might cut its top rating for the United States. Moody's cited a "rising possibility" that no deal would be reached before the United States government's borrowing authority hits its limit on Aug. 2.
On Thursday, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, repeated a warning that a "huge financial calamity" would occur if President Obama and the Republicans could not agree on a budget deal that allowed the debt ceiling to be raised.
The authorities in Beijing added their voice of concern Thursday, though in more muted terms.
"We hope that the U.S. government adopts responsible policies and measures to guarantee the interests of investors," Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, said in response to questions about the Moody's report.
The comments echoed those made by officials in Beijing in April, when Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook on the United States from stable to negative because of the country's high budget deficit and rising government indebtedness.
China holds more than $1 trillion in United States Treasury securities, making it highly sensitive to any developments that could lower the value of those holdings.
Robin Marshall, director of investment management at Smith & Williamson in London, said the rating agencies were acting aggressively toward indebted sovereign nations, having failed to foresee the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, which foreshadowed the current debt explosion.
The current situation, he said, is creating headaches for governments -- worried either about where to invest or whether they themselves will be downgraded and face higher financing costs -- as well as for investors.
"It raises the question of what is the relevant benchmark?" Mr. Marshall said. "If the U.S. is downgraded, what about Germany, with its increasing liabilities? If you are looking solely at debt-to-G.D.P. levels, you may just be left with countries like Norway, Switzerland and Singapore as triple-A's."
In Europe, reaction was muted on Thursday to the threat to the ratings as the European authorities struggled to contain their own debt crisis, which this week threatened to spread from Greece, Ireland and Portugal and engulf the larger economies of Italy and Spain.
European officials have responded to successive downgrades of euro zone ratings -- Ireland, for example, was downgraded to junk status this week by Moody's -- by criticizing the grip that the ratings agencies have over investors.
And longstanding plans to create a European rating agency have re-emerged. Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, said recently that the agencies might be showing "bias" against Europe.
Some Europeans sense double standards among the ratings agencies. A participant in the Internet forum of Der Spiegel, the German newsmagazine, said Thursday, "It surprises me that the U.S.A. still has a top rating to begin with."
But behind the rhetoric, European governments have united behind the idea that their debt positions are unsustainable and need to be rectified through spending cuts and revenue-raising measures. That leaves no room for the kind of brinkmanship being displayed in Washington regarding debt ceilings and defaults, even though European officials still remain reluctant to admit what investors have been saying for months, that Greece will default.
Mr. Marshall said the balance of opinion still suggested that the agencies should step back from downgrading the United States. "In the end, size and reserve currency status matters," he said, adding the agencies were likely to "pull back from the brink."
In China, Dagong Global Credit Rating, a rating agency that downgraded its assessment of the United States last November, said Thursday that it had placed that rating on a negative watch list, citing the declining solvency of the American government, slow economic growth and high budget deficits.
Dagong is little known outside China, and its views have nowhere near the same effect as those of Moody's or Standard & Poor's on financial markets.
The warning by Moody's that a downgrade was possible was enough to send investors rushing to buy assets seen as safe. Gold for August delivery rose as high as $1,594.90 on Thursday, a record before adjusting for inflation.

Fed Chief Hedges Remarks On Possible New Stimulus

Full text: A day after he helped lift markets with his testimony, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, tempered his words. And in reaction, the markets, too, pulled back.
In remarks before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, Mr. Bernanke said that the central bank was not currently ready to embark on a third round of government bond-buying to stimulate the economy.
"We're not proposing anything today," Mr. Bernanke said. "The main message I want to leave is that this is a serious situation. It involves a significant loss of human and economic potential."
The new comments were interpreted by investors as a slight retreat from his testimony on Wednesday before the House, when Mr. Bernanke said the Fed still had tools to spur growth, and that "we have to keep all the options on the table."
The major indexes, which had been up on Wednesday and Thursday morning, fell after Mr. Bernanke's testimony.
"Bernanke walked the market back a bit" by saying the Fed wasn't prepared to start another bond-buying program, said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays Capital and a former Fed economist. "The market overly interpreted the chairman's remarks yesterday."
Still, Mr. Bernanke did not totally discount the prospect of such a program. Should the economy turn out to be weaker than expected, the central bank may provide more monetary stimulus, Mr. Bernanke said Thursday. A third round of quantitative easing, referred to as QE3, is an option if a recent economic slowdown persists and deflationary forces re-emerge, he said.
Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed faced different conditions today than it did last August, when he signaled a second round of large-scale asset purchases, which ended last month. At that time, the economy was in danger of stalling, he said, and the Fed was concerned the country might experience deflation, a widespread and prolonged drop in prices, wages and the values of assets like homes and stocks.
"Today the situation is more complex," Mr. Bernanke told lawmakers, adding: "Inflation is higher. Inflation expectations are close to our target. We are uncertain about the near-term developments in the economy. We'd like to see if, in fact, the economy does pick up, as we are projecting."
Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the committee's senior Republican, told Mr. Bernanke that he had concerns that additional bond purchases would fuel inflation.
"The last thing our weak economy needs right now is an inflation scare," he said.
Mr. Shelby had also criticized the Fed in November when it began a $600 billon bond-buying program to rejuvenate the economy, saying the purchases could lead to an inflation surge. Mr. Shelby suggested that bond-buying by the Fed could prompt a wave of speculative buying on Wall Street, leading to asset price bubbles.
Democrats, however, stressed the need to create jobs. Tim Johnson, a Democrat from South Dakota who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, asked Mr. Bernanke why the Fed was not immediately starting a new stimulus program given the weak economic recovery and rising unemployment.
The nation's unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent in June, the third consecutive monthly increase. Employers added 18,000 new jobs, the fewest in nine months.
"We're not prepared at this point to take further action," Mr. Bernanke said, in response to Mr. Johnson's question.
Mr. Bernanke stressed the need to be flexible. The Fed might tighten credit if inflation were to rise more than anticipated, he said.
He also again urged Republicans in Congress and President Obama to come to an agreement to raise the nation's $14.3 trillion borrowing authority.
If a deal is not reached before Aug. 2, the government will not be able to pay its bills and the United States risks losing its top-notch credit rating.
"It's a very important asset and losing that credit rating is, again, I think a self-inflicted wound," Mr. Bernanke said.

China's Growth Slowed To 9.5% in 2nd Quarter

Abstract: Any sharp weakening in China, which has become a key engine for global growth, would be unwelcome news for the rest of the world, especially at a time when the United States and Europe are struggling to reduce heavy debt loads and high unemployment levels, and as Japan is still grappling with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami. The second-quarter G.D.P. data, and retail sales and industrial output figures for June, also released Wednesday, provided "further evidence that China's slowdown since the start of the year remains moderate and gradual," Brian Jackson, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong commented in a research note.

Full text: HONG KONG -- The Chinese economy expanded at an unexpectedly robust pace during the second quarter of this year, data released Wednesday showed, but a slowdown from the sizzling pace of previous quarters also underlined the challenges that now face policy makers in Beijing.
China's economy, the second-largest in the world after that of the United States, grew 9.5 percent compared with the second quarter last year, the National Bureau of Statistics said, and picked up a notch from the first three months of 2011.
The reading is well above what developed economies like those of the United States, Japan and Europe are managing and topped analysts' expectations.
But it was also markedly more modest than the pace recorded in previous quarters: Chinese gross domestic product expanded 9.7 percent compared with the same period a year earlier during the first quarter of 2011 and 9.8 percent in the last three months of 2010.
Much of the cooling has been deliberately engineered by the Chinese authorities and is by no means unwelcome.
Over the past year, Beijing has progressively tightened the spigot on the ample bank lending that has fueled growth but also contributed to sharp increases in property prices and overall consumer prices. The central bank has also raised interest rates five times since October, most recently last week.
Inflation, however, remains elevated, and the authorities now have to strike a careful policy balance. On the one hand, more action is needed to stifle price rises. On the other hand, any excessive tightening risks choking off growth.
The successive economy-cooling steps taken so far have already caused some concern that the Chinese economy could slow more rapidly than intended.
Any sharp weakening in China, which has become a key engine for global growth, would be unwelcome news for the rest of the world, especially at a time when the United States and Europe are struggling to reduce heavy debt loads and high unemployment levels, and as Japan is still grappling with the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami.
However, most economists believe that China is headed for a soft -- rather than a hard -- landing, and the robust figures on Wednesday appeared to support those expectations.
The second-quarter G.D.P. data, and retail sales and industrial output figures for June, also released Wednesday, provided "further evidence that China's slowdown since the start of the year remains moderate and gradual," Brian Jackson, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong commented in a research note. "Although we expect growth will weaken to some extent in the third quarter, today's data reinforces our view that concerns about an imminent 'hard landing' in China are overdone."
Li-Gang Liu, a China economist at ANZ Bank, also was confident about China's prospects. Chinese exports, he wrote in a research note, will be buoyed by demand from Japan after the earthquake; investment will be supported by an ambitious housing project; and domestic consumption was likely to see solid growth.
Financial markets also took the data positively. The Shanghai composite stock index in mainland China rose 1.5 percent Wednesday.
However, inflation remains stubbornly high, at least for now, with data released Saturday showing that consumer prices had risen 6.4 percent in June from the same month last year. The prices of some foodstuffs, like pork, have risen even more sharply.
Inflation has become a major concern for policy makers in Beijing, who worry that such price increases could fuel discontent among ordinary Chinese.
Top officials, including the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, have said repeatedly that tackling inflation is a top policy priority. Earlier this week, Mr. Wen called specifically for more action to raise the supply of pork, a staple for many Chinese families.
A spokesman for the national statistics bureau, Sheng Laiyun, said at a briefing Wednesday that the slowdown in growth had also been driven by the winding down of stimulus measures from past years that succeeded in cushioning the effect of the 2008 global economic crash.
In particular, he said, car sales dropped 20 percent this year after the government canceled a nationwide subsidy to encourage the purchase of fuel-efficient cars and some big cities, like Beijing, imposed limits on new-car purchases.
"Compared to the same time last year, sales of furniture, construction materials and home decoration have all seen an obvious drop. It is a normal response when stimulus policies exit the market," he said. "It's like when a man runs, he can't be dashing all the time. Instead, he needs to slow down for a bit, in order to run better in the future."
Meanwhile, the quandary created by the combination of slower growth and inflation has created uncertainty as to what the next policy moves by Beijing will be.
Some analysts expect the central bank to deliver at least one more small rate increase later this year in a bid to combat inflation. Others believe that the central bank will not want to jeopardize growth and that it is thus unlikely to act.
"The government's desire to maintain growth by sustaining a healthy level of liquidity expansion is counterbalanced by the need to rein in inflation, in part caused by an abundance of liquidity," Jing Ulrich, chairman of global markets for China at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a research note.
However, she added that the data also showed that the Chinese economy was gradually becoming more centered around consumption. This "should support policy makers' efforts to engineer a soft landing" through a combination of monetary tightening policies and pro-consumption measures, as well as changes to social welfare programs.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, gave a subdued account of the economy's health Wednesday and said that the Fed was prepared to expand its economic aid campaign once again, if necessary, though such a step was not imminent.
Less than a month has passed since Mr. Bernanke said at a press conference that the central bank intended to stand back and take the measure of the nation's sluggish recovery. Wednesday's remarks amounted to acknowledgment that so far, the news has been almost uniformly bad.
"I think we have to keep all the options on the table," Mr. Bernanke said in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. "We don't know where the economy is going to go."
He described options, including a public commitment to maintain existing aid programs for a longer period, new asset purchases to drive down interest rates, or steps to encourage banks to withdraw money kept on reserve at the Fed and use it to make loans.
Republicans have criticized the Fed for its efforts to stimulate growth, fearing that it would lose control over inflation. But Representative Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the committee, said on Wednesday that he agreed with Mr. Bernanke.
"I'm glad that you are going to maintain some flexibility, which may be needed, because we don't know what tomorrow will bring," Mr. Bachus said.
Mr. Bernanke made clear that a resumption of the central bank's economic revival campaign faced a high hurdle. He said that the Fed would look for two conditions, economic weakness beyond current expectations, and a renewed threat of deflation.
The first seems obvious. The second, however, may be the more important factor. The Fed's decision to resume asset purchases last summer was made in large part because the central bank feared that prices might begin to decline, a phenomenon that can undermine growth because it causes people to delay purchases, fueling a downward cycle.
Since then, the pace of price increases has rebounded toward levels that economists consider healthy. Indeed, earlier this year, concern shifted to the possibility that prices were rising too fast. While Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials say they believe those increases will abate, there is little risk of deflation -- and therefore little chance of additional efforts.
"In other words, it is a possibility next year if inflation drops back, but not in the short term," Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients.
Members of the Fed's policy-making committee discussed the issue during their most recent meeting, at the end of June, but are divided regarding the costs and benefits, according to minutes of that meeting, which the Fed released on Tuesday.
The Fed released its most recent economic forecast after that meeting, predicting that the economy would expand at a moderate pace of 2.7 to 2.9 percent this year.
In the intervening weeks, the government has reported that employment increased by only 18,000 jobs in June, and that exports were weaker than expected. That has led a number of private forecasters to slash estimates of second-quarter growth. Mr. Bernanke did not update the Fed's own projections, but his remarks reflected greater concern.
"Among the headwinds facing the economy are the slow growth of consumer spending, even after accounting for the effects of food and higher energy prices," Mr. Bernanke said in his prepared testimony. "The ability and willingness of consumers to spend will be an important determinant of the pace of the recovery in coming quarters."
Later, Mr. Bernanke described the Fed's economic projection for the rest of this year -- growth of about 3.5 percent -- and said, "We'll see if that's the case."
Despite the fragile health of the economy, most questions from the members of the committee focused on the political battle over the federal deficit -- a long-term problem that, as Mr. Bernanke told the committee, does not pose an immediate danger to the economy, although he warned that the debt ceiling must be raised immediately.
When Mr. Bernanke was asked about the millions of Americans who cannot find jobs, he took the opportunity to gently chide the committee for its focus. "I think I'd like to make very clear that I think we have two crises in the economy," he said in response. "One of them is the fiscal set of issues that you're all paying a lot of attention to right now, but I think the job situation is another crisis."
The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing unemployment, and some of its critics say that current unemployment rate of 9.2 percent should be a sufficient reason by itself for the central bank to expand its roster of economic aid programs.
Mr. Bernanke noted that the scale of the Fed's existing efforts was unprecedented. The central bank has kept short-term interest rates near zero for more than two years. It also owns more than $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and government debt, the legacy of its two asset-purchase programs to reduce long-term interest rates.
"We are prepared to take further steps if needed," he said.
Mr. Bernanke's account of the Fed's efforts was challenged by Texas Republican Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the central bank. "Spending all this money hasn't helped," Mr. Paul said. The Fed's aid programs benefitted financial companies, he said, while people "lost their job, and they lost their houses and mortgages, and they're still in trouble."
Mr. Paul, who recently announced that he would not run for re-election to focus instead on his presidential campaign, began on a lighter note, suggesting that news of his impending departure might have caused Mr. Bernanke to smile. Amidst the ensuing laughter, Mr. Bernanke was unable to resist.

Abstract: The money at stake far exceeds the amounts that Democrats want to raise by curbing tax breaks for owners of corporate jets, yachts and racehorses -- the populist proposals frequently invoked by Mr. Obama to make the case that he is not seeking tax increases on the middle class. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said the LIFO proposal -- supported by the president's deficit-reduction commission -- would simplify the tax code and establish a standard method of calculating the cost of items that a company sells.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- One of the biggest revenue-raisers proposed by President Obama in negotiations with Congress is what he describes as an arcane change in the tax treatment of business inventories -- things like steel, groceries and oil.
But however complex the details, the effect of the change would be substantial, and in pushing for it Mr. Obama has kicked a hornet's nest. Lobbyists from companies of all sizes are swarming around Congress to kill the proposal, which would prohibit the use of an accounting technique known as last in, first out, or LIFO. The technique is used to determine the cost of goods sold, and therefore the income earned, by a company.
Mr. Obama's proposal, projected to raise $65 billion to $95 billion over 10 years, would increase the taxable income and tax liability of companies that have been using this method of accounting for decades. Small businesses, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and oil companies would be especially hard hit.
At a meeting late last week two dozen business lobbyists, working together as the LIFO Coalition, decided to redouble their efforts against the proposal by making urgent appeals to debt negotiators and lawmakers from both parties and both chambers.
The money at stake far exceeds the amounts that Democrats want to raise by curbing tax breaks for owners of corporate jets, yachts and racehorses -- the populist proposals frequently invoked by Mr. Obama to make the case that he is not seeking tax increases on the middle class.
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said the LIFO proposal -- supported by the president's deficit-reduction commission -- would simplify the tax code and establish a standard method of calculating the cost of items that a company sells. Those costs are typically subtracted from the proceeds of a sale to determine the company's taxable income.
Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, said that in budget negotiations the White House had pushed harder for "repeal of LIFO" than for any other tax proposal. Mr. Kyl was the Senate Republican delegate in talks led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Visiting an Alcoa plant in Iowa last month, Mr. Obama emphasized the importance of creating jobs in manufacturing. But manufacturers say the repeal of LIFO would have just the opposite effect.
"The president's proposal would be devastating," said C. William Jones, vice chairman of O'Neal Industries, a 90-year-old family owned metals company in Birmingham, Ala. "It would increase our tax bill by tens of millions of dollars. Thousands of companies would be affected the same way."
Charles W. Mulford, a professor of accounting at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that at first glance the LIFO proposal looked like "an easy source of revenue." But, he said, "it taxes illusory income, phantom profits that result from inflation."
The LIFO method of accounting is beneficial to companies that face rising costs for the goods they buy or produce. They can assume, for tax purposes, that the goods sold in any given year are the ones most recently acquired. These new items -- the "last in" -- cost the company more than older items in its inventory, so the company's taxable income will be lower.
The Internal Revenue Service has allowed this method of accounting since the 1930s. In practice, according to the Congressional Budget Office, some companies prefer to sell their oldest inventory first, to minimize the risk that a product will become obsolete or be damaged. Under the president's proposal, White House officials say, tax-accounting rules would reflect business practice and economic reality.
But that is not true for all companies. Mr. Jones said his company sold its newest inventory first, pulling giant steel beams off the top of the stack.
"LIFO is not an accounting gimmick or a loophole," Mr. Jones said in an interview. "It's been a readily accepted method of valuing inventory for decades."
Ron Travis Jr., an accountant and vice president at O'Neal, offered an example of how the proposal would wallop his business.
"Assume that I buy a ton of steel for $1,000, buy another ton a few months later for $1,100 and then sell a ton of steel for $1,300,"
Mr. Travis said. "Under the LIFO method of accounting, my profit is $200, and if you assume a 40 percent tax rate, I owe $80 in taxes."
By contrast, Mr. Travis said, under the president's proposal, "my cost would be $1,000, my profit would be $300, and I would owe $120 in taxes."
The president's proposal would also undo the tax benefits that companies have obtained by using the LIFO method of accounting over the years.
"It's a huge retroactive tax," said Jade C. West, senior vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, who is leading the business coalition opposed to the change. "The government would tell companies that they must go back and recalculate the tax savings they have claimed for decades."
The Treasury Department said, in response to a question, that the president's proposal "requires that tax be paid on long-deferred gains." However, it said, the tax could be paid over 10 years.
Mr. Carney, the White House spokesman, estimated that 40 percent of the benefits of the LIFO accounting method went to the oil and gas industry.
"If you're an oil company," Mr. Carney said, "you can sell a barrel of oil today for, let's say, $100 that you bought two years ago for $40. Instead of paying taxes on that $60 profit, you pay taxes on, say, a $2 profit -- if that's what you were able to buy a barrel for yesterday, for $98."
Stephen E. Comstock, the manager of tax policy at the American Petroleum Institute, confirmed that oil refiners would be exposed to significant new costs under the proposal.
As for Mr. Carney's example, Mr. Comstock said: "It's correct as far as it goes, but it does not reflect the flow of crude through a refinery. If I sell more than I purchased or produced, I would have to pay tax on the difference between $40 and $100. The current method of accounting is absolutely fair."

Efforts to Rein In Executive Pay Meet With Little Success

Full text: Executive pay continues to skyrocket despite years of criticism by corporate governance gurus, fierce efforts by unions to temper compensation and calls by politicians to regulate pay.
Given these failures, perhaps it is time to ask whether critics' actions have actually driven executive pay higher.
The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul was supposed to be a victory for those who deplore high executive pay when it is not justified by company performance. The law tries to provide shareholders with more input by requiring that public companies hold "say on pay" votes. These votes are nonbinding, but they allow shareholders to express an opinion on compensation policies.
The rule comes after years of efforts by the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate executive compensation. The S.E.C.'s most robust move occurred in 2006, when the agency mandated rigorous disclosure of compensation, including perks like free country club memberships. A company can now fill 10 to 20 pages in its annual proxy statement detailing executive pay.
These are all well-intentioned efforts to end unjustified, egregious compensation packages and ensure that they do not lead to excessive risk-taking.
But evidence of success is scant. According to the research firm Equilar, the median compensation for chief executives at 200 large companies was $10.8 million in 2010. This was a 26 percent increase from the previous year, which was preceded by a rare decline in 2008.
Still, the Standard & Poor's ExecuComp database shows that executive pay rose about 300 percent from 1992 to 2007. This compares with growth in the same period of about 14 percent in the inflation-adjusted real wages of college graduates, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
The latest "say on pay" endeavor has turned into a costly exercise that validates almost every companies' pay practices. FactSet Sharkrepellent found that through June 30 of this proxy season, shareholders rejected pay plans in only 39 out of 2,502 companies, including well-known companies like Talbots, Hewlett-Packard and Stanley Black & Decker.
Still, this is a 98.5 percent approval rate. I'm sorry, but I'm a bit cynical that 98.5 percent of any group is doing the right thing.
Justice Louis D. Brandeis famously wrote, "Sunlight is the best disinfectant." But for compensation, it has had a perverse effect.
Chief executives tend to view themselves as residents of Lake Wobegon, where all children are above average. Disclosure gives them an arsenal to make perception reality. The compensation details of their counterparts provides them with the leverage to request a higher amount from boards. The result: each year executive pay rises ever higher and the industry average is reset.
Meanwhile, there has been a major movement to ensure that boards appropriately set compensation, with independent directors tasked with the job. Yet even these independent board members are often not in an effective position to push back forcefully. The chief executive runs the company. And a few extra million dollars is often not worth debating when much more is at stake in terms of profits. It doesn't help their objectivity that independent directors may be using the same strategy to increase their salaries at their own full-time jobs.
Instead, compensation becomes a process-driven exercise in which the way it is paid - in cash, options or restricted stock - is most important. The final arbiter then becomes yet more costly pay consultants who rely on the same disclosures to determine excessive compensation.
As owners, shareholders should be the parties with the most interest, but the evidence does not bear this out. It takes time, money and research to effectively monitor executive compensation. For a big institutional shareholder that owns only 1 or 2 percent of a company, the economics just don't make sense.
Instead, pensions, money managers and the like subscribe to Institutional Shareholder Services and other proxy advisory services. But the firms often focus on the structure of compensation and how tied it is to performance, not the absolute amount.
Even then, I.S.S. recommended in this proxy season that shareholders vote no on compensation at only about 12.7 percent of Russell 3000 companies, a recommendation that appears to have been mostly ignored. As of June 30, shareholders have refused to follow 90 percent of I.S.S. recommendations to vote no.
The consequence is that shareholders with a say on pay are validating spiraling executive compensation at significant cost to public companies.
This is not to say things are all bad. There appears to be some give and take on approving pay. Some companies have revised their policies in the days leading up to shareholder votes. Both General Electric and the Walt Disney Company made changes to their compensation structures in the face of dissent.
Moreover, the new regulation has defined clear processes for determining executive compensation to ensure that the country club back-slapping of earlier years is not followed. In Britain and Australia, where say on pay already exists, it has not stopped the upward spiral of compensation, but there are assertions that this has tightened the link between pay and performance.
There is certainly a movement in this direction by companies in the United States, and there is evidence that executive pay is more tightly aligned with performance than it was 20 years ago. Another good sign: almost 80 percent of shareholders who voted on executive pay at Russell 3000 companies endorsed an annual shareholder vote as opposed to one every three years, according to I.S.S.
Executive pay should reward good performance. A man like Steven P. Jobs, who helped create hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth at Apple, should be compensated commensurately. But Philippe P. Dauman at Viacom was awarded $84.5 million, including $31.65 million in restricted stock compensation, last year for grants over five years. Will Viacom really earn enough through "Jersey Shore" spinoffs to justify this number?
In some cases, high compensation is appropriate; other cases, not. It also may be that the current system forces companies to tie pay more tightly to performance (a good thing) while driving up the absolute numbers.
But if the goal of these collective efforts is a reduction in compensation, the results are quite disheartening.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: The Chinese economy expanded at an annual rate of 9.5 percent during the second quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics reported on Wednesday, a figure that, for all its strength, represented a slowdown from the sizzling pace of previous quarters, and underlined the challenges now facing policy makers in Beijing.
China's economy, the second-largest in the world after that of the United States, expanded 9.7 percent year-on-year during the first quarter of 2011, and 9.8 percent in the last three months of 2010.
While the reading was strong compared with the expansion in the United States, Europe and Japan and was slightly firmer than analysts had projected, it underlined how much more moderate China's expansion has become in recent months.
Much of the slowdown has been deliberately engineered by the authorities in Beijing, who have over the last year gradually tightened the spigot on the ample lending that has fueled growth, but also contributed to sharp rises in property prices and overall consumer prices. The central bank has also raised interest rates five times since last October, most recently last week.
The tightening has caused some concern that China's economy could slow down more rapidly than intended, thus weakening what has become a critical pillar of growth for the entire world.
However, most economists believe that China is headed for a soft -- rather than a hard -- landing, and Wednesday's robust figures appeared to support those expectations.
However, inflation remains stubbornly high, at least for now, with data from Saturday showing consumer prices rose 6.4 percent in June from the same month last year. The prices of some foodstuffs, like pork, have risen even more sharply.
Inflation has become a major concern for policy makers in Beijing, who worry that price rises could fuel discontent among the many millions of ordinary Chinese.
The government has repeatedly pledged to lower inflation, and a spokesman for the national statistics bureau repeated this mantra. "We should stick to our effort to control prices," he said, according to The Associated Press.
The combination of slower growth and persistent inflation has put the government in a quandary, analysts say: While more aggressive tightening could mitigate inflation, it also risks stifling economic growth.
"The government's desire to maintain growth by sustaining a healthy level of liquidity expansion is counterbalanced by the need to rein in inflation, in part caused by an abundance of liquidity," Jing Ulrich, chairman of global markets for China at JPMorgan, wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Full text: Stocks closed lower for a third consecutive day on Tuesday as Europe's fiscal woes and a weak start to technology earnings gave investors little reason to buy even after the recent losses.
Moody's downgrade of Ireland's credit rating late in the session provided the latest jolt to investors, reminding them of the scope of Europe's debt problems.
Stocks bounced briefly after the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes with comments by Fed officials suggesting the possibility of more policies to stimulate the economy, but uncertainty over Europe kept investors away from beaten-down shares. On Monday, stocks posted their worst day in a month.
"The Fed gave us a little pop, but people are more worried about the issues in Europe right now," said Steven M. Roge, portfolio manager at R.W. Roge & Company "That said, given the recent losses, I expect us to tread water until we get more clarity on Europe and earnings."
European officials would not rule out default by Greece. Investors feared the crisis could overtake the larger Spanish and Italian economies.
The concern is that bank exposure to troubled euro zone debt will hurt their profits and liquidity. Barclay shares listed in the United States slid 2.5 percent, to $14.60.
European issues resurfaced after Moody's downgraded Ireland's credit rating to junk status, saying it would probably need additional rounds of official financing.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.88 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 12,446.88. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 5.85 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,313.64. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 20.71 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,781.91.
The Nasdaq underperformed the other two indexes, but chip makers' shares fell sharply after Novellus Systems said it expected bookings to continue to fall as chip makers curbed capacity. Novellus fell 11.2 percent to close at $31.75. The semiconductor index lost 2.9 percent.
According to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's June meeting, which were released Tuesday afternoon, some Fed officials are ready to provide more monetary policy easing if the recovery is deemed too sluggish to cut the nation's unemployment rate. But others said the Fed should tighten sooner than expected if recent increases in inflation did not moderate.
The Fed's second round of quantitative easing, which ended in June, contributed to sharp stock gains. Some stock analysts have questioned the market's prospects in a tighter environment.
"People were expecting a flat-out: 'No, this is it. This is the end of the line,' and the fact that the door is still a little bit open provides a little bit of hope," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill.
In an economic report, the Commerce Department said an increase in imports of petroleum products helped widen the United States trade deficit in May to more than $50 billion, its largest gap since late 2008.
The department said that exports of goods and services were $174.9 billion, while imports were $225.1 billion, resulting in a deficit of $50.2 billion. That made it the largest trade deficit since October 2008, when it was $59.5 billion, and was up from a revised $43.6 billion in April. Interest rates were lower for a second straight day.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 102 4/32, and the yield fell to 2.88 percent from 2.92 percent late Monday.

Fed Officials Divided on Need for More Monetary Stimulus

Full text: Federal Reserve policy makers disagreed on whether additional monetary stimulus would be needed even if the outlook for economic growth remained weak, minutes of their meeting last month showed.
"A few members noted that, depending on how economic conditions evolve, the committee might have to consider providing additional monetary stimulus, especially if economic growth remained too slow to meaningfully reduce the unemployment rate in the medium run," the Federal Open Market Committee said in the minutes of its June 21-22 meeting, released Tuesday in Washington.
"On the other hand, a few members viewed the increase in inflation risks as suggesting that economic conditions might well evolve in a way that would warrant the committee taking steps to begin removing policy accommodation sooner than currently anticipated."
Policy makers cut their forecasts for growth this year before a July 8 government report showed that employers added jobs in June at the slowest rate in nine months. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a June 22 news conference that growth would pick up as energy prices subsided and disruptions of parts from Japanese factories eased, while also leaving the door open to additional stimulus. In their meeting, policy makers also agreed on a strategy for withdrawing record monetary stimulus and adopted a new set of communications guidelines.
A divided Federal Open Market Committee means officials are likely to prolong their low interest-rate policy, said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
"The majority view is that they can't ease because inflation is rising, but at the same time they can't tighten because the unemployment rate is too high, so they're on hold," Mr. Low said.
The minutes show some officials have doubts about whether their policy toolkit has anything more to offer. "A few participants expressed uncertainty about the efficacy of monetary policy in current circumstances but disagreed on the implications for future policy," the minutes said.
Some members of the committee "saw the recent configuration of slower growth and higher inflation as suggesting that there might be less slack in labor and product markets than had been thought," the minutes said. In that case, "the withdrawal of monetary accommodation may need to begin sooner than currently anticipated in financial markets."
The Fed's Washington-based governors and regional presidents agreed to complete their $600 billion bond-buying program, known as QE2 for the second round of quantitative easing, as scheduled at the end of June.
"The Fed will be watching and waiting to learn more about the economy," said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase & Company in New York. "One camp is worried about what happens if growth slows more than expected. The other camp is worried about what happens if the rise in inflation isn't transitory."
Policy makers also renewed their pledge to hold interest rates "exceptionally low" for an "extended period." The Fed has kept its target rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. Mr. Bernanke said at the June press conference the Fed would be "prepared to take additional action, obviously, if conditions warranted," including the purchase of more Treasury securities.
"Most" committee members said the rise in inflation would "prove transitory" and that over the medium term inflation would "be subdued as long as commodity prices did not continue to rise rapidly and longer-term inflation expectations remained stable."

An Edge in Airfares

Abstract: [...] the Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group, calculates that domestic tickets in the United States cost about 16 cents a mile, excluding taxes, or at least 19 cents a mile with taxes (using the group's estimate that taxes add 20 percent to the price of a ticket).

Full text: Europe's low-fare carriers may be best known in America for outrageous proposals to charge for bathroom access or offer stand-up seating, both ideas floated by Ryanair that were never adopted.
But travelers who have flown within Europe lately often took away a different impression -- that airline tickets were surprisingly inexpensive, especially compared with prices to fly within the United States.
A one-way ticket between Edinburgh and Dublin, for instance, can cost as little as $40. A one-way ticket from New York to Washington, about the same distance, starts at $65. Both prices, which vary depending on the travel date, include taxes and unavoidable fees, but not baggage and other optional charges.
While it is tough to do a statistically rigorous comparison, especially since the European Union does not collect fare data for its 27 members, there is little doubt that ticket prices have fallen sharply within Europe, despite higher fuel costs, because of an explosion of competition from low-fare airlines like easyJet and Ryanair. Although Southwest Airlines and other carriers have put similar pressure on prices within the United States, anecdotal data suggests that it is still generally more expensive to fly between major cities in America than it is to fly between cities in Europe.
"Even after taxes, you see a better fare per mile in the European Union than you do in the United States," said Mark Milke, a director at the Fraser Institute, a public policy research group in Calgary, Alberta, who published a paper last year comparing the lowest fares available on a sample set of routes.
Using that data, Mr. Milke calculated that airline passengers traveling within a single country in Europe last year were paying about 11 cents a mile, including taxes and fees, or 14 cents a mile to fly between two European countries. In the United States, by contrast, passengers were paying about 23 cents a mile.
Since these figures were based on a limited number of case studies, results from a wider set of data would probably vary. In fact, the Air Transport Association, the airlines' trade group, calculates that domestic tickets in the United States cost about 16 cents a mile, excluding taxes, or at least 19 cents a mile with taxes (using the group's estimate that taxes add 20 percent to the price of a ticket).
Carlos Mestre, deputy head of the European Commission's transport unit, said the European Union did not collect data from airlines that would enable it to calculate a similar cost per mile. But based on information the commission has gathered, it has published numerous reports that say airfares have decreased significantly since the late 1990s, when the European Union began allowing airlines to fly freely among member countries.
"Prices have gone down quite dramatically," Mr. Mestre said, explaining that the rapid expansion of low-fare carriers has increased competition on many routes that were once dominated by a single national airline. The number of routes within Europe has also increased 140 percent from 1992 to 2010.
Low-fare airlines now carry more than a third of all passengers traveling within Europe, forcing older competitors to lower prices, especially on popular routes.
"In Europe, there has been an awful lot more competition in the last 10 years," said Brian Pearce, chief economist for the International Air Transport Association. "That has led to a lot more choice for passengers as well as it being cheaper to travel."
Mr. Pearce said European travelers had benefited from the fact that many large cities had multiple airports, allowing newer airlines access to these markets. That is not so much the case in the United States, where airlines like Southwest have fought to obtain scarce takeoff and landing slots in congested cities like New York.
European airlines also face more competition than their American counterparts from other forms of transportation, particularly Europe's robust rail network.
That competition is likely to increase in the coming years, since the European Commission recently announced an initiative to standardize the information on rail schedules and prices across member countries, making it easier for travelers to compare the cost of airlines versus the train between two cities. On some routes, ferries could be part of that comparison.
Steve Lott, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, said the shorter distances between cities in Europe was another factor influencing the competitive landscape.
"What type of model capitalizes on frequent short-distance flights?" he said. "Low-fare airlines."
Those shorter distances also mean that driving is a viable option for many trips within Europe, especially now that border controls have been lifted, creating further competition for European carriers, Mr. Lott said.
Some analysts also note that Europe is going through a competitive phase that already took place in the United States after airline deregulation in the 1970s.
"They're earlier in a process the U.S. experienced a while ago," William S. Swelbar, a research engineer with the M.I.T. International Center for Air Transportation, said, noting that when adjusted for inflation, the average domestic fare in the United States has declined more than 50 percent since deregulation.
"We have a maturing market and maturing airlines," he said. "As a result we're seeing prices go up."
Others argue that regulatory policies in the United States favor established airlines, stifling competition and making it harder for new carriers to enter the market and succeed.
Mr. Milke is among those who say they believe that rules prohibiting foreign-owned airlines from operating in the United States -- for example, allowing Aer Lingus to fly passengers from Boston to Chicago -- keeps ticket prices higher than they would be if this restriction were dropped.
"Low fares are the result of the removal of barriers to competition," he said. "With lower prices, people travel a lot more, and that creates jobs."

Abstract: After weeks of uncertainty related to bailouts for Greece, the Italian authorities moved to rein in short-selling on the Milan stock exchange as fears mounted that Italy could become the next victim of the sovereign debt crisis.

Full text: Financial and energy companies took a beating on Wall Street on Monday as stocks in the United States followed global markets lower on concerns about the euro zone debt crisis.
Markets in the United States were in line with Asian and European stocks, which fell as investors remained overwhelmed by weak economic data, and European officials met in Brussels to discuss fiscal troubles in the euro zone.
After weeks of uncertainty related to bailouts for Greece, the Italian authorities moved to rein in short-selling on the Milan stock exchange as fears mounted that Italy could become the next victim of the sovereign debt crisis.
"There is so much going on in the world that you almost need a scorecard to keep up," Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, wrote in a research note.
"If Italy becomes more of a problem, then it could spiral out of control and cause the much-feared contagion that some have predicted," Mr. Giddis wrote. "If that is the case, then a global economic slowdown will likely hit our shores here and take the legs out of an already wounded U.S. economy."
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 151.44 points, or 1.20 percent, to 12,505.76. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 24.31 points, or 1.81 percent, to 1,319.49. The Nasdaq composite lost 57.19 points, or 2.00 percent, to 2,802.62.
Even after Monday's losses, however, the Nasdaq and the Dow still rose about 1 percent since July 1, while the S.& P. was slightly lower.
On the broader market in the United States, financial shares were down almost 3 percent, while energy and materials indexes were lower by more than 2 percent.
Brian M. Youngberg, an energy analyst for Edward Jones, said the dollar rise connected with the events in the euro zone was putting downward pressure on oil prices, which in turn was affecting energy stocks. "Everything is revolving around Europe right now in some way," he said.
Citigroup fell 5.3 percent to $39.79; JPMorgan Chase declined 3.2 percent to $39.43, and Bank of America was down 3.27 percent at $10.35.
Google shares fell 0.89 percent to $527.28.
Alcoa was down 2.87 percent at $15.91; Caterpillar fell 2.04 percent to $108.16, and Boeing was down 2.29 percent at $73.35.
As risk aversion stepped up on Monday, United States Treasuries were trading higher. The euro fell to $1.4027 from $1.4204.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 28/32, to 101 23/32, and the yield fell to 2.92 percent, from 3.03 percent late Friday.
"Global issues are still outstanding," said Jason Arnold, a financial analyst with RBC Capital Markets. "Markets were still digesting the jobs numbers from Friday, so I think that it is also a factor." Asian markets, in particular, reacted to the United States government report that just 18,000 jobs were added in June.
In Europe, the Milan Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent on Monday. The FTSE in London was down 1.03 percent, the CAC in Paris was down 2.71 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt was down 2.33 percent.
Another weight on sentiment was the report over the weekend that inflation in China had reached a three-year high.
"It is kind of like this cocktail of disappointing information and data," said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for Russell Investments.
William J. Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates, said that the debt ceiling talks and euro zone problems in particular "put this tone" to the market.
But he and other market analysts are pinning their hopes on the coming corporate reporting season for the second quarter.
"Those things are weighing, and now the hope is we are going to get earnings surprises on the positive side," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Only a few short months ago, JPMorgan Chase traders were on such a roll that they did not have a single losing day in the first quarter.
But when the bank reports its second-quarter results this week, that hot streak will have come to an end. Analysts expect JPMorgan to count an almost 20 percent drop in its sales and trading revenues, reflecting a slowdown in investor activity and the dismal performance of its fixed-income and commodities groups.
Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are expected to report similar news. After helping prop up Wall Street during the financial crisis, core trading revenue is projected to drop, on average, by as much as 25 percent from the first quarter, according to Credit Suisse research.
That will put further pressure on the banks' growth prospects, which are already strained by stagnant loan growth and more stringent regulation. It is also prompting nearly every major Wall Street firm to contemplate another round of layoffs amid growing concerns that at least part of the weak results are permanent.
"We are undoubtedly being impacted by lower levels of activity," said William Tanona, a financial services analyst with UBS. "There is a lot of uncertainty out there."
Together, the five Wall Street banks are still going to take in more than $20 billion from their core trading operations, largely from business done on behalf of clients. For example, the banks routinely help airlines hedge oil prices or bring together buyers and sellers of stock, bonds and other complex securities -- often putting their own money on the line to facilitate a trade. But during the second quarter, the business was particularly hard hit.
Trading volumes fell sharply as investors became unnerved by the running debt crisis in Europe, the political standoff over the debt ceiling in the United States, and lingering concerns over the anemic growth of the broader economy. Even when investors did place their bets, they were far more hesitant to take big risks -- something known on Wall Street as lacking conviction. That meant the banks missed out on the lucrative fees they can generate by selling more high-octane products, like complex options and derivatives.
Fixed-income traders, among the biggest moneymakers for Wall Street, faced a bruising market. In the commodities business, for example, oil, gold and other metals prices had been rising quickly during the early part of the year as investors anticipated high demand for materials to keep the global economy humming. But as cracks in the recovery kept surfacing, prices headed south -- and traders raced to the sidelines. That left most Wall Street desks, which had stocked up on inventory to facilitate trades, holding losing positions.
At JPMorgan, for instance, energy traders were having a gangbuster year, earning several hundred million dollars for its burgeoning commodities unit. Yet when the market turned in early May, they gave back some of those gains, according to market participants. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suffered tens of millions in losses on its interest rate desk when a bet on lower inflation turned against the bank's position.
Mortgage trading did not fare much better. After rallying from highly depressed values for much the last two years, mortgage-backed securities prices fell sharply during the second quarter. The reason? The government started dumping into the market its vast portfolio of mortgage bonds acquired from its rescue of the American International Group, and investors believed the outsize supply would cause values to plummet. (Only recently, when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced it was halting auctions of the A.I.G. mortgage bonds, did prices start to stabilize.)
Although the banks have slowed the spill of red ink from troubled mortgages and other bad loans, they are struggling to increase revenue in their more traditional banking businesses, too.
New financial regulations have chipped away at once-lucrative sources of income, like overdraft charges and credit card penalty fees. Starting this fall, banks are expecting to absorb a multibillion-dollar hit when they are forced to sharply lower the fees they charge each time consumers swipe their debit cards. Higher capital requirements, meanwhile, could further depress profits if some banks are forced to lighten their balance sheets or exit certain businesses altogether.
At the same time, the fragile economy has undermined the banks' bread-and-butter business of lending. Both consumers and businesses have been reluctant to take out new loans. Meanwhile, the surge in mortgage refinancing last year has petered out, even though interest rates remain at historically low levels.
The upshot is that trading, which has long been one of the biggest drivers of revenue at Wall Street firms and a crucial growth engine at financial conglomerates, has become even more critical.
At Goldman Sachs, for example, trading-related businesses made up almost 79 percent of the bank's total revenue in the first quarter of 2011, up from 73 percent in 2007, according to UBS financial research. At a big diversified bank like JPMorgan Chase, sales and trading made up about 21 percent of the bank's total revenue in the first quarter of 2011, up from 14 percent in 2007.
"It's gotten bigger, partly because other businesses aren't firing as vibrantly," Howard Chen, a financial services analyst at Credit Suisse.
This quarter, trading revenue will be up about 10 percent from a year ago. But it is expected to fall sharply from the first quarter, when market conditions were more favorable.
Bank of America hinted at its second-quarter trading results late last month when it announced plans to take a $20 billion hit to help clean up its troubled mortgage business.
Based on the bank's comments, Credit Suisse analysts are forecasting that sales and trading revenues will be down 23 percent from the first quarter, largely from a falloff in the fixed-income businesses. Those figures exclude certain one-time items and accounting charges tied to hedging the bank's own debt and other credit exposures that fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
JPMorgan and Citigroup, meanwhile, could have core sales and trading decline around 20 percent from the first quarter, according to the Credit Suisse research. Morgan Stanley could record a 25 percent drop, while Goldman Sachs, which has a huge fixed-income business, could have core sales and trading revenue fall around 36 percent.
To make up some of the difference, both firms plan to start swinging the corporate ax. Morgan Stanley, which has added hundreds of workers over the last two years in an effort to rebuild its trading franchise, has turned its attention to cuts in its wealth management unit. It announced plans to slash $1 billion in noncompensation expenses over three years and eliminate several hundred low-producing brokers.
Goldman, meanwhile, is planning to announce layoffs as it cuts about 10 percent, or roughly $1 billion, of noncompensation expenses over the next 12 months, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Full text: FRETFULNESS overtook optimism among stock investors in the second quarter. Many markets started the year strongly. Then, as spring turned to summer, recession worries rumbled back in the United States, debt continued to dog Europe, and inflation fears re-emerged in some emerging economies. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.4 percent for the quarter, and several key international markets, including China and India, also chalked up losses.
Amid the worry and woe, managers of three of the quarter's better-performing funds found opportunities in segments that some investors shun: hard-core value stocks, lesser-known Asian markets and biotechnology.
A Strict Focus on Value
Few managers seem to take value-hunting as seriously as those at the Longleaf Partners Small-Cap fund: O. Mason Hawkins and G. Staley Cates. Their fund, which carries an expense ratio of 0.92 percent, returned 3.71 percent in the second quarter.
Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Cates like to buy the sort of dirt-cheap stocks that Warren E. Buffett has famously called "cigar butts." These days, Mr. Buffett typically skips over castoffs, opting to buy pricier fare as long as he's confident that a company has a competitive advantage. But Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Cates still seek those half-smoked stogies. "We'll never compromise the principle about buying really cheaply," Mr. Cates said.
Their refusal to consider anything but bargains means that their fund, which is closed to new investors, can build up a hefty hoard of cash. On May 31, in fact, cash accounted for about 15 percent of its $3.4 billion in assets. "We demand high quality but want a great price, and there typically aren't a lot of those stocks around," Mr. Cates said.
The managers aim for shares that trade for no more than 60 percent of their estimate of value.
Often, that means betting on companies with overlooked assets. Consider Dillard's, the department store chain. When Longleaf bought in several years ago, the stock was trading in the teens, but its real estate alone -- Dillard's owns most of its stores' buildings -- was worth $60 to $70 a share, Mr. Hawkins says. The company was struggling but had laid plans for a turnaround, and the Longleaf managers believed that it could deliver. Their faith has begun to pay off: Dillard's ended the quarter at more than $50 a share.
Longleaf typically owns just a handful of stocks, and Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Cates stick with favorites for years. Thus, at the end of March, the fund had only 22 holdings and an average annual turnover of 17 percent, according to Morningstar.
All Eyes on Asia
Richard H. Gao and Sharat Shroff, co-managers of the Matthews Pacific Tiger fund, are similarly loath to shed holdings. Despite investing in a volatile region -- Asia, minus Japan -- they have been trading less often than the Longleaf managers do. The fund's average annual turnover, measured in March, was 11 percent.
Pacific Tiger's institutional shares returned 4.09 percent in the second quarter. The fund has an expense ratio of 1.09 percent and holds $5.5 billion in assets.
"Our underlying philosophy is that, if you can find solid businesses that can survive economic cycles, then the best way to create shareholder value is to stick with them over several years," Mr. Shroff said.
Tingyi, for example, is a company that Pacific Tiger has held through years of economic ups and downs, he said. A Chinese maker of instant noodles and ready-to-drink teas, it has faced "inflation and commodity-price pressures in the past, and it has always gained market share," he said. "It always manages to emerge stronger."
The fund's investment in Tingyi aims to exploit China's evolution toward an economy geared more to consumption than to exports. In all of their Asia investments, Mr. Gao said, "we don't have much exposure to manufacturing or to companies that rely on export growth or cheap labor."
The fund also has holdings in sectors like health care, which aren't considered consumption plays per se. "Consumption is about share of the consumer's wallet, where his money is going, and increasingly in Asia, that's to health care," Mr. Shroff said.
China and India, two of Asia's burlier economies, account for a big chunk of Pacific Tiger's assets, but Mr. Gao and Mr. Shroff have made outsize bets on other markets, like Indonesia. At the end of May, 8.6 percent of the fund's assets were invested there, more than twice the weighting of their benchmark index.
"We want to find companies that will deliver sustainable growth," Mr. Shroff said. "If we find them in China, so be it. If we find them in Indonesia, so be it."
Banking on Biotech
Like the emerging Asian markets, biotechnology has a reputation as a promising long-term place to invest, if you can stomach the risk.
For Rajiv Kaul, a strong stomach was a condition of employment. His fund, the Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio, must invest at least 80 percent of its assets in biotech. The fund, which has $1.3 billion in assets and an expense ratio of 0.87 percent, returned 10.17 percent in the second quarter.
Mr. Kaul says biotech investing has a riskier reputation than it deserves. Too many people equate the basic science -- which consumes much money and takes years to yield drugs -- with the established, cash-generating companies, he said. "I don't view this as investing in scientific experiments," he said. "I view it as investing in good businesses."
And solid biotechs -- those with money-earning drugs and promising pipelines -- are arguably less risky than other companies because their moneymakers are typically protected by patents, he said. "A lot of the larger biotechs can be pretty predictable because they're making medicines that people have to take," he said.
Consider Genentech, whose products include the breast cancer drug Herceptin. "That's basically a cure -- patients can live normal lives," he said.
Similarly, Amgen, the largest holding in Mr. Kaul's portfolio on March 31, at 18.3 percent of assets, produces a raft of sought-after treatments, including the arthritis drug Enbrel. Mr. Kaul bet big on Amgen because of its healthy cash flows.
"If you look at the cash-flow generation of the industry, the top 20 companies probably account for 90 percent," he said. "Biotech is perceived as risky, but for companies with cash flows, it's much less risky than the broader market."

Re "We Knew They Got Raises. But This?" (July 3), which offered updated figures on executive pay packages for 2010:
Having spent my entire working career in the elementary classroom, I know little about the business world other than what I read in the newspaper. Still, I must wonder whether any C.E.O.'s are worth the pay and bonuses they receive. Sure, in the competitive world of business, a skilled executive should draw more than those who work for him or her, but why do the awards have to be so astronomical?
As a retired California teacher, my pension is modest. Yet I have no complaints: this monthly retirement pay allows me to pay the rent, put food on the table. As skilled as C.E.O.'s must be in management, I wonder if any of them could manage a class of 32 active third graders, keep order, promote learning, teach how to behave and treat others fairly while maintaining his or her sanity in front of the class?

To the Editor:
There is a simple solution to the problem of executive pay that would also help balance the federal budget.
Not that long before Reaganomics, the highest income tax rate in the United States was in the area of 90 percent. If we now instituted a top rate of, say, 75 to 80 percent, adjusted downward for lower earners, we would not only raise badly needed government revenue but would also put an end to excessive executive pay.
Why? No corporate board would approve disproportionately high compensation while knowing that most of the money would go to the I.R.S. Corporate managers would consider that wasteful -- such is the psychology of many of the wealthy.
Runaway executive pay inflation is a fairly recent phenomenon, born of irresponsible tax cuts. Sound tax policy effectively curbs excesses while creating a prosperous society through public benefits.

To the Editor:
My daughter just completed four years of college, graduating with honors. She is one of many graduates seeking employment in this difficult economy. I wonder if any of these extremely well-paid executives would consider giving up some $1 million or $2 million of their pay packages and creating a few entry-level jobs for these young people needing a break.
Such amounts from the executives' huge paychecks would surely not be missed. Cheryl Williams

To the Editor:
According to the theory of trickle-down economics, all of those at the bottom of the economic ladder now have something to cheer about: the steep climb in the pay of our high-end corporate leaders.
Those executives had a median pay gain of 23 percent in 2010, so if the trickle-down idea works, there will surely be plenty to trickle down to all of us. Or, instead, has our economic system evolved from a shared-wealth society into one that benefits the few at the top, while the rest, including many recent public employees, are humiliated by having their pensions, health care benefits, and salaries reduced or frozen by government edict?

Abstract: According to EPFR Global, which tracks fund flows, investors added more than $7 billion to inflation-protected bond funds in the first half of this year, roughly equaling the amount for all of 2010. The big swings in inflation expectations have been most evident in the so-called break-even rate -- which is the difference between yields on 10-year Treasury notes and 10-year TIPS and reflects trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt.

Full text: INVESTORS who placed bets on mutual funds specializing in inflation-protected Treasury securities were among the bond market's biggest winners over the last two years, even as other Treasury funds struggled.
This year, however, the winning streak has faltered a bit as inflation expectations have shifted radically. As the United States economy has slowed, European debt worries have revived and oil prices have fallen back from their recent highs, inflation expectations have moved downward.
For Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, that has not been good news.
"TIPS have gone through a period where just about everything has gone right for them," said Robert Johnson, director of economic analysis at Morningstar. "Now the situation has changed, and they are looking quite expensive."
TIPS pay interest on a principal amount that rises with inflation, so investors are compensated as consumer prices rise. When the securities mature, the investor is paid the adjusted principal amount or the original principal, whichever is greater.
Investors have poured money into TIPS, particularly since last August, amid concerns that the Federal Reserve's plan to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities would fuel inflation. Those fears grew even more frantic early this year when turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa drove crude oil prices well over $100 a barrel, and gasoline prices in the United States began to climb.
According to EPFR Global, which tracks fund flows, investors added more than $7 billion to inflation-protected bond funds in the first half of this year, roughly equaling the amount for all of 2010.
The big swings in inflation expectations have been most evident in the so-called break-even rate -- which is the difference between yields on 10-year Treasury notes and 10-year TIPS and reflects trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt. That rate climbed to a high of 2.67 percent in April, just as crude oil prices peaked at around $114 a barrel, from 1.5 percent last August.
But in May, as signs of an economic slowdown appeared and investors began to anticipate an end to the Fed's bond-buying spree, inflation expectations collapsed. As measured by the break-even rate, expectations for consumer price inflation dropped to 2.14 and the TIPS market stumbled.
TIPS funds returned just 0.3 percent in May, before rebounding in June as worries eased about Greek debt and a sustained slowdown in the United States economy.
For the second quarter, inflation-linked bond funds returned about 3.1 percent according to Morningstar, compared with 3.6 percent for funds that invest in regular long-term government bonds.
Over longer periods, however, TIPS have sometimes outpaced the returns of regular Treasury funds. Over the last five years, inflation-linked bond funds have returned 6.36 percent, annualized, compared with 6.04 percent for intermediate government debt funds and 7.4 percent for long-term government bond funds.
"The TIPS market clearly got a bit exuberant going into the spring," said Daniel O. Shackelford, manager of the $387 million T. Rowe Price Inflation Protected Bond fund. "Over the last several weeks, the market has made an adjustment to more modest inflation expectations," he said.
The T. Rowe Price TIPS fund returned 3.3 percent in the quarter, after gains of 6.29 percent in 2010 and 10.43 percent in 2009.
DESPITE the recent adjustment, analysts say TIPS remain expensive, particularly those with shorter maturities. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, and TIPS maturing in five years, for example, yielded a negative 0.37 percent at the end of the second quarter. That compared with a 1.76 percent yield on a regular five-year Treasury note. Ten-year TIPS yielded 0.69 percent, compared with 3.16 percent for noninflation-linked 10-year Treasury debt.
Managers of TIPS funds say the inflation protection offered by TIPS makes sense for a portion of a portfolio.
"If you buy a two-year Treasury note yielding 40 basis points while inflation is running at 2 percent, that is wealth destruction," Mr. Shackelford said. "TIPS may not be a formula for building wealth; they will do what they were constructed to do, which is to compensate you for increases in consumer prices."
Some money managers say they are shifting into the longer-term end of the TIPS market, where yields for 30-year maturities were 1.7 percent as of the end of June.
"We've been moving out of the intermediate sector of TIPS and buying the long end," said Martin Hegarty, co-head of global inflation-linked portfolios at BlackRock, the New York-based money manager, which oversees $3.6 trillion in assets. Mr. Hegarty said purchases of intermediate-term TIPS, those of 5 to 10 years, by foreign central banks had helped to depress yields in that sector.
The $4 billion BlackRock Inflation Protected Bond fund gained 2.6 percent in the second quarter and 4.66 percent this year through June.
Still, analysts said the current pricing of TIPS should raise at least one red flag. TIPS may be inflation-protected and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, but they are far from being risk-free.
"If the Fed were to make any pre-emptive move against inflation, TIPS could get killed," said Mr. Johnson at Morningstar. "People tend to think TIPS have no risk, but if you sell them before maturity, or if you own a fund that it weighted with longer-term maturities, they can have substantial risk."
Fund managers say that while these problems are real, TIPS may still be useful.
"Investors certainly should not judge TIPS by taking a backward view of how they have performed," said John W. Hollyer, a manager of the $35 billion Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund, which returned 3.4 percent in the second quarter. "They are not a risk-free asset because they have a high sensitivity to changes in interest rates. But if inflation makes a sudden move upward, you will be compensated, and that's important."

Full text: GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Despite a competitive economy in which success increasingly depends on obtaining a college degree, one in four students in this country does not even finish high school in the usual four years.
Matthew Kelly was in danger of becoming one of them.
Tests showed he had a high intellect, but Mr. Kelly regularly skipped homework and was barely passing some of his classes in his early years of high school. He was living in a motel part of the time and both his parents were out of work. His mother, a former nurse, feared that Matthew had so little interest he would drop out without graduating.
Then his guidance counselor suggested he take some courses at a nearby vocational academy for his junior year. For the first time, the sloe-eyed teenager excelled, earning A's and B's in subjects like auto repair, electronics and metals technology. "When it comes to practicality, I can do stuff really well," said Mr. Kelly, now 19.
So well, that he has earned a scholarship to attend a community college this fall. He even talks of pursuing a bachelor's degree in engineering some day, and opening his own business.
Now, federal funding to provide such vocational and technical education is at risk. President Obama has instead made it a priority to raise overall academic standards and college graduation rates, and aims to shrink the small amount of federal spending for vocational training in public high schools and community colleges. That aid comes primarily in the form of Perkins grants to states.
The administration has proposed a 20 percent reduction in its fiscal 2012 budget for career and technical education, to a little more than $1 billion, even as it seeks to increase overall education funding by 11 percent. The only real alternative to public schools for career training is profit-making colleges and trade schools, many of which have been harshly criticized for sending students deeply into debt without improving their job prospects. A little more than one in 10 students in higher education attend a profit-making institution.
Proponents of career education in public high schools and community colleges point to apparent successes like Mr. Kelly and other research to demonstrate that their courses serve a group of students at most risk of being left behind. Without high school, much less college, many young people -- particularly men and members of minority groups -- end up doing low-skill work, relying on their youth and brawn. Those types of jobs were slashed during the downturn, and job prospects often fade altogether as workers age.
In European countries like Germany, Denmark and Switzerland, vocational programs have long been viable choices for a significant portion of teenagers. Yet in the United States, technical courses have often been viewed as the ugly stepchildren of education, backwaters for underachieving or difficult students.
In a speech to the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in April, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said that "at a time when local, state and federal governments are all facing tremendous budget pressure" advocates for vocationally oriented education "must make a compelling case for continued funding."
In his camp are those who say students need to concentrate on basics like math, literacy and history to prepare for college and the jobs of the future, rather than learning a narrow technical craft. In this view, bright students like Mr. Kelly, who have the potential to do college-level work, should be put on that path, or schools will have failed them.
What's more, those in favor of academic reform worry that minority and low-income students will be automatically channeled into vocational courses. A rigorous academic curriculum, they say, is the best way to help all workers remain flexible, climb career ladders and prepare for a wider spectrum of jobs.
Recognizing that employment and income have expanded for those with college degrees, the president has said he wants America to produce the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.
Last year, fewer than a third of all 25- to 29-year-olds in the United States had earned a bachelor's degree or higher. Advocates say the most compelling case for vocational education is that it keeps students interested in school at all. According to data from the Department of Education, about 75 percent of students who start public high school graduate within four or five years. But more than 90 percent of those who concentrate in career-oriented courses, a definition that varies by state, do so, according to statistics compiled by the Office of Vocational and Adult Education. (Eventually, after more years of school or passing a General Educational Development test, about 87 percent of all students complete high school.)
Strong vocational programs that start in high school, advocates say, can help students make the leap to one- or two-year credentials that are increasingly the ticket out of low-skilled, lower-paying jobs. In fact, 27 percent of people who get a vocational license or certificate after high school, whether at a community college or a profit-making institution, earn more than the average for those with a bachelor's degree, according to the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University.
Career and technical education "can prepare you for jobs in which you're going to earn a very solid middle-class income," said William C. Symonds, director of the Pathways to Prosperity Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "That's not to say that you're going to be a hedge fund manager making millions a year, but you will prepare for jobs that will pay more than a living wage."
Mr. Kelly will transfer four vocational credits from Weaver Academy, a public high school in Greensboro that draws students from 15 traditional high schools around the county, to Guilford Technical Community College this fall. He figures that with a two-year degree in computer-integrated machining, he can qualify for jobs operating the sophisticated machines that manufacturers use to make metal parts for the aerospace, automotive, defense and medical industries.
In the Greensboro area, entry-level machining jobs pay $14 to $20 an hour -- roughly $30,000 to $42,000 a year. To Mr. Kelly, whose father, Farrel Kelly, lost his job five years ago repairing textile equipment, that sounds like a healthy wage.
If he can work part-time in college, the younger Mr. Kelly, who lives in a run-down bungalow with his mother and a roommate, is hoping to buy a car and hire an exterminator to eliminate the cockroaches that skitter around their living room floor.
"Depending on which job I get and how well I advance in the company, you can definitely live well," he said. Mr. Kelly recently met a fellow alumnus of Weaver who now works as a machinist at a local aeronautical repair company and was impressed to learn that at age 21, he has already signed a contract to buy a house.
In industries like manufacturing and health care, employers are calling for better career and technical education because they cannot find qualified candidates to fill their openings for machinists, welders and certain categories of nurses, among other jobs. As baby boomers retire and the economy picks up, analysts also expect more demand for medical technicians, dental hygienists and law enforcement workers.
Pushing all young people toward a bachelor's degree could be misguided, some employers say, depriving certain industries of much-needed future workers. "I think there is a stigma in society that says if you don't get a four-year degree you have not achieved," said Matthew Edwards, manager of human resources at Machine Specialties in Whitsett, N.C., which makes precision parts for the aerospace and defense industries and is desperate to hire 10 new machinists. "And I don't think that is true. There are not enough technical people in the workforce for us to grow."
Others question whether the skills shortage is simply a matter of employers not paying enough for qualified workers. In fact, the skills that employers most frequently say are in shortest supply are critical thinking, the ability to work in teams and communication, not specialized training.
"Our clients tell us 'I've found somebody who is an electrician or a technician, but they don't have a global mindset or can't work with people in different cultures,' " said Mara E. Swan, executive vice president for global strategy and talent at ManpowerGroup, a job placement firm. " 'They can't think beyond what I tell them to do.' "
Even as experts debate how to teach such intangible skills, more jobs demand much higher math and reading proficiency than in the past.
In manufacturing, for example, work once performed on low-skilled assembly lines has mostly moved offshore or been automated. The jobs that remain require workers who can interpret blueprints, program computerized machinery and solve problems on the fly. According to a report by the Pioneer Institute, a public policy group, manuals for auto mechanics, plumbers and those who repair appliances are written "up to a Grade 14 reading level."
Yet many young people are not able to compete for these jobs. Nearly two-thirds of students who enter a community college within a few years of high school graduation require remedial math and reading classes, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.
Students who have a hard time grasping academic concepts in a traditional lecture or textbook may learn better in a practical, hands-on setting.
In an analysis of testing data from Massachusetts, Alison L. Fraser, author of the Pioneer Institute study of 27 regional vocational and technical education high schools in the state, found that vocational students vastly improved their passing rates on English and math standardized tests between 2001 and 2007, a period in which the schools focused on integrating academic instruction into technical classes. In fact, by 2007, the vocational students were actually passing at higher rates than students in the rest of the state.
In another study of 200 teachers and 3,000 students in nine states, James R. Stone III, director of the National Research Center for Career & Technical Education at the University of Louisville, similarly found that high school students whose teachers were given specific training in how to incorporate academic concepts into vocational classes scored, on average, 17 to 21 percentile points higher on standardized math tests than students in classes where vocational teachers had not been trained in academic integration.
One group of schools consistently held up as a model are career academies that integrate academics into occupationally-themed courses. Graduates of such academies earned, on average, 11 percent more a year than students from similar backgrounds who graduated from traditional high schools, according to a study by MDRC, formerly the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. The Obama administration says that overall, data about career and technical education is mixed. There are "islands of excellence," said Brenda Dann-Messier, assistant secretary for vocational and adult education, but there is still "uneven quality around the country."
Weaver Academy serves about 700 students a year in everything from heating and air conditioning to computer graphics in north central North Carolina. As furniture and textile production have left the area for Asia, the county has aggressively wooed new industries. Most prominently, Honda Aircraft broke ground in 2007 on its headquarters and a manufacturing plant in Greensboro. The company plans to hire as many as 350 people within a year.
Still, Gene Holder, head of Weaver's metals technology department, has struggled at times to entice students to his classes. "People think that blue-collar jobs are bad," said Mr. Holder, an oak tree of a man with a goatee and aviator glasses who spent 17 years in manufacturing before teaching. "But it is no longer the dirty, wet sweatshop-type thing. You have to really have something going on up here," he added, tapping his head.
Mr. Kelly initially signed up for an automotive mechanics class at Weaver, and added a metals manufacturing class with Mr. Holder simply to fill out his schedule. Drilling small holes at tolerances within one-thousandth of an inch and punching in complex programming codes held his attention more than classroom lectures ever did. "You have to focus on it," he said.
Mr. Kelly completed two industry certifications from the National Institute for Metalworking Skills, a trade group, before graduating in June. "It was a miracle we got him through high school," said his mother, Cynthia Kelly.
Ordinarily, a student with Mr. Kelly's aptitude would have been guided down a more academic track. His guidance counselor, Susan Schirick, said she was grateful that he had found another path, though it was bittersweet.
"Matt came in with zero motivation -- let's face it," Ms. Schirick said. The technical courses, she added, were "a route to get him to see his future."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats, who have thrived for decades as guardians of Social Security, said Thursday that they were not ready to surrender that role to help President Obama get a deal on federal spending and the debt limit.
As word spread that Mr. Obama was considering large savings from the use of a different measure of inflation to reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits, Democrats joined with lobbyists for older Americans to reject the idea. Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said Democrats would oppose changes in Social Security benefits as part of the deficit-reduction talks.
"Any discussion of Social Security should be on a separate track," he said. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said, "Any savings should be plowed back into making Social Security stronger."
Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said, "The proposal would place new burdens on the backs of seniors."
Representative Xavier Becerra of California, a member of the House Democratic leadership, said, "The cuts in Social Security benefits would grow larger as retirees age, and seniors who rely most on Social Security to pay for basic necessities would receive the biggest benefit cuts."
On the Senate floor, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Thursday: "Social Security and Medicare benefits should not be on the table. Social Security is not the cause of the deficit, and beneficiaries should not be made to shoulder the burden of deficit reduction."
In particular, Mr. Whitehouse said, Congress must not "cut benefits through backdoor methods such as lowering the cost-of-living adjustment."
Republicans are concerned about the growth of entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicare. Some, like Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, support the idea of an alternative measure of inflation, known as the chain-weighted version of the Consumer Price Index, because they believe it is more accurate. But the party, waiting to see details, has not taken an official stand.
Lobbyists for older Americans were blistering in their criticism of the proposal, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, could reduce federal spending by more than $110 billion over 10 years.
"This is nothing more than a backdoor benefit cut that Washington hopes Americans won't notice or understand," said Max Richtman, executive vice president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
He said Social Security beneficiaries did not receive a cost-of-living adjustment this year or in 2010 because inflation, as measured by the standard Consumer Price Index, was so low.
AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said last month that it might be open to modest reductions in Social Security benefits for future recipients. But A. Barry Rand, the group's chief executive, tried to quash the inflation adjustment idea, saying that "AARP will not accept any cuts of any kind to Social Security as part of a deal" to reduce the deficit and increase the debt limit.
The proposal under discussion would affect current and future beneficiaries. Any move to exempt current beneficiaries would reduce the amount of savings.
Supporters of the proposal argue that the current measure of inflation overstates increases in the cost of living because it does not adequately reflect how, when faced with higher prices, consumers change their buying habits, substituting cheaper items for more expensive ones.
On the other hand, some economists say the current measure understates the impact of inflation on older Americans, who tend to spend more of their income on health care. Medical prices have been rising faster than the overall price index.
Budget negotiators are also discussing a proposal that would use the alternative measure of inflation to adjust income tax brackets and other provisions of the tax code, like the standard deduction and the personal exemption amount.
This proposal would raise nearly $60 billion over 10 years, as more Americans would find themselves in higher tax brackets.
Republicans, adamantly opposed to any form of tax increase, worry about an increase that might result from using the new measure of inflation to adjust tax brackets.
Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, said he would consider changes in the Social Security benefit formula only as part of a giant deficit-reduction package that included substantial new revenues and cuts in military spending. If the alternative measure of inflation is more accurate, he said, it would be "logical, consistent and desirable" to use it in adjusting tax brackets and Social Security benefits.
Grover G. Norquist, a prominent conservative strategist who is president of Americans for Tax Reform, said he saw a big difference. Reducing Social Security benefits would be a cut in spending, and "that would be fine," Mr. Norquist said. But he said using the new price index to set tax brackets would be a tax increase, in violation of the pledge made by Republican leaders.
Stephen C. Goss, the chief actuary of Social Security, said the alternative inflation measure could reduce annual cost-of-living adjustments so the benefit for a retiree turning 85 in 2035 would be about 7 percent lower. The cuts are cumulative and would have a larger effect on older beneficiaries, who depend more on Social Security as a source of income.
Congressional Democrats said that using a different version of the Consumer Price Index could also reduce Medicare payment rates for some health care providers, including ambulatory surgical centers, clinical laboratories and suppliers of durable medical equipment like wheelchairs and respirators.
In addition, they said, the proposal could eventually increase the number of Medicare beneficiaries who must pay higher premiums because they have incomes above a certain level -- $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for married couples this year.

China Raises Rates Again in an Effort to Slow Inflation

Full text: HONG KONG -- China raised interest rates for the fifth time in nine months Wednesday, the latest in a series of moves aimed at cooling the pace of economic growth and the steep price increases that have accompanied expansion.
The central bank announced that it was raising the key lending and deposit rates in the world's second-largest economy, after the United States, by a quarter of a percentage point. The increase had been widely expected by analysts.
The central bank said the one-year deposit rate would rise to 3.5 percent from 3.25 percent, beginning Thursday. The one-year lending rate was increased to 6.56 percent from 6.31 percent.
Signs that inflation in China has accelerated to levels well above what the Chinese authorities are comfortable with have mounted in recent months and prompted Beijing to step up its efforts at reining in the ample lending that fueled growth and helped fan sharp increases in real estate prices as well as overall inflation.
Data released last month showed that consumer prices rose 5.5 percent in May from a year earlier, and economists widely believe that data for June, due next week, will show an even more substantial increase, of 6 percent or more.
The rate announcement came just weeks after news of the latest in a long line of instructions by Beijing to the nation's banks to extend fewer loans -- the 12th such move since early 2010.
Beijing's gradual cutting back in lending -- by raising reserve-requirement ratios for banks, which reduces the amount of money available for loans -- has had the desired effect of moderating the sizzling pace of growth to a level that most economists here believe points to a soft landing for the Chinese economy.
But many forecasters also say that Beijing now has little room left to increase reserve-requirement ratios much further or to lift interest rates much more. Another small rate increase may come later in the year, but over all, the current round of tightening may soon have run its course, many say.
"The current rate hike could be the last in this tightening cycle" as the Chinese central bank rarely raises rates when inflation starts to fall, economists at Citigroup wrote Wednesday in a research note. "But, if inflation exceeds 6 percent for more than two months, another rate hike is likely this year."
The price rises that have accompanied soaring growth, meanwhile, have so far shown little sign of abating, in part because of sharp increases globally in the costs of raw materials. Natural disasters in China have helped push up the cost of food.
Inflation levels could ebb somewhat later this year but are widely expected to remain elevated, presenting Beijing with a headache. The Chinese authorities are intensely aware that soaring household bills could lead to widespread public dissatisfaction.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood's Fourth of July fireworks were overseas.
The holiday period, a marquee sales time for movie studios, saw Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks bomb in the romantic comedy "Larry Crowne" and the third installment of the "Transformers" series fall notably short of its predecessor in North America. But the international box office continued to sizzle, with fans flocking to "Transformers: Dark of the Moon." Between Tuesday night and Sunday, that Paramount Pictures movie sold an estimated $210 million in tickets overseas, a 51 percent increase over the same opening stretch for "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," the franchise's previous entry, in 2009.
Paramount said that tickets for 3-D shows, which carry a price premium, drove the strong overseas performance for "Dark of the Moon," which set sales records in seven countries, including South Korea with an estimated $28 million. It was Paramount's biggest international opening (in dollars unadjusted for inflation).
"To see this kind of gigantic international start is simply amazing," said Rob Moore, Paramount's vice chairman. Overseas sales for "Revenge of the Fallen," which was not released in 3-D, totaled $434 million, and "Dark of the Moon" could sharply improve on that.
The film was shown at many Imax theaters abroad, and Imax, which broke its global sales records, was jubilant. "It's out of control," said Greg Foster, its chairman of filmed entertainment.
Still, North America was a muddy picture. "Dark of the Moon" took in about $162 million between Tuesday night and Sunday, compared with $200 million for "Revenge of the Fallen" during the comparable period, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing statistics. Monday sales for "Dark of the Moon" were estimated at $18.8 million, lifting its domestic total to $181 million.
Analysts attributed the shortfall -- which came despite higher ticket prices -- to several factors. Audiences in the United States have started to tire of 3-D. About 60 percent of the domestic total for "Dark of the Moon" came from 3-D screenings; the format made up about 70 percent of sales overseas.
Americans, still feeling the pinch of a weak economy, have been going to the movies less often. For the year, domestic ticket sales stand at $5.2 billion, an 8 percent decline from the same period in 2010; attendance is down 9.4 percent.
But confusion overload from "Revenge of the Fallen" and its hard-to-decipher plot was probably the biggest factor. "We needed to win the audience back by telling a better story," Mr. Moore said.
The good news for Paramount, aside from the overseas total, involves audience reaction to "Dark of the Moon." Exit polls show that moviegoers are more satisfied with the film than with its predecessor, which should lead to favorable word of mouth. Sales increased from Friday to Saturday, a sign of positive chatter among fans of the series.
"Dark of the Moon," directed by Michael Bay, cost about $200 million to make and centers on robot aliens clashing over a hidden spacecraft. (The 3-D effects alone contributed about $30 million to the budget.) It was easily No. 1 at the North American box office for the weekend.
"Cars 2," from Pixar Animation Studios, was second in its second weekend with about $25 million in sales (excluding Monday estimates) for a new total of $116 million. "Bad Teacher," the raunchy Sony comedy starring Cameron Diaz, was third with about $14 million for a two-week total of $59.5 million.
Ms. Roberts and Mr. Hanks limped along in fourth place in "Larry Crowne," distributed by Universal Pictures and taking in about $13 million. Vendome Pictures spent about $30 million to make it. The two stars have opened to lower results: "Charlie Wilson's War" sold about $10 million in tickets during its first three days in 2007. But that was a drama released in winter, and analysts had higher expectations for the two in a summer comedy.
The disappointing returns could have been the result of negative reviews and a warm-and-fuzzy marketing campaign that made the film look like something akin to a movie of the week.
Mr. Hanks directed the film, which he wrote with Nia Vardalos ("My Big Fat Greek Wedding"). To help get the movie made he agreed to play the male lead. The story centers on a middle-aged man who goes back to college after losing his job and develops a crush on his teacher, played by Ms. Roberts.
"Monte Carlo," an inexpensive comedic romance from 20th Century Fox starring Selena Gomez, was fifth, taking in about $7.6 million.
The coming weeks will be crucial for Hollywood's hopes of ending its domestic box office slump. Aside from continued sales for "Dark of the Moon," the industry is counting on a potential multiplex monster: Warner Brothers will release "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" in 3-D on July 15.

Full text: IT turns out that the good times are even better than we thought for American chief executives.
A preliminary examination of executive pay in 2010, based on data available as of April 1, found that the paychecks for top American executives were growing again, after shrinking during the 2008-9 recession.
But that study, conducted for The New York Times by Equilar, an executive compensation data firm based in Redwood City, Calif., was just an early snapshot, and there were even more riches to come. Some big companies had not yet disclosed their executive compensation.
So Sunday Business asked Equilar to run the numbers again.
Brace yourself.
The final figures show that the median pay for top executives at 200 big companies last year was $10.8 million. That works out to a 23 percent gain from 2009. The earlier study had put the median pay at a none-too-shabby $9.6 million, up 12 percent.
Total C.E.O. pay hasn't quite returned to its heady, prerecession levels -- but it certainly seems headed there. Despite the soft economy, weak home prices and persistently high unemployment, some top executives are already making more than they were before the economy soured.
Pay skyrocketed last year because many companies brought back cash bonuses, says Aaron Boyd, head of research at Equilar. Cash bonuses, as opposed to those awarded in stock options, jumped by an astounding 38 percent, the final numbers show.
Granted, many American corporations did well last year. Profits were up substantially. As a result, many companies are sharing the wealth, at least with their executives. "We're seeing a lot of that reflected in the pay," Mr. Boyd says.
And at a time of so much tumult in the media business, it might be surprising that some executives in media and communications were among the most richly rewarded last year.
The preliminary and final studies put Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, at the top of the list. Mr. Dauman made $84.5 million last year, after signing a new long-term contract that included one-time stock awards.
Leslie Moonves, of the CBS Corporation, got a 32 percent raise and reaped $56.9 million. Michael White of DirecTV was paid $32.9 million, while Brian L. Roberts of the Comcast Corporation and Robert A. Iger of the Walt Disney Company each received pay packages valued at $28 million.
"Media firms seemed to be paying a lot," said Carol Bowie, head of compensation policy development at ISS Governance, which advises large investors on corporate governance issues like proxy votes. "Media companies in general tend to be high-payers, and they tend to feed off each other."
Other big payers included oil and commodities companies like Exxon Mobil and a few technology giants like Oracle and I.B.M.
Some of the other highly paid executives on the new list who were not in the April survey are Gregg W. Steinhafel of Target, who had a $23.5 million pay package; Michael E. Szymanczyk of Altria, $20.77 million; and Richard C. Adkerson of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, $35.3 million.
Most ordinary Americans aren't getting raises anywhere close to those of these chief executives. Many aren't getting raises at all -- or even regular paychecks. Unemployment is still stuck at more than 9 percent.
In some ways, chief executives seem to live in a world apart when it comes to pay. As long as shareholders think that the top brass is doing a good job, executives tend to be well paid, whatever the state of the broader economy. And some corporate boards were probably particularly generous in 2010 after a few relatively lean years for their top executives. In other words, some of this was makeup pay.
"What is of more concern to shareholders is that it looks like C.E.O. pay is recovering faster than company fortunes," says Paul Hodgson, chief communications officer for GovernanceMetrics International, a ratings and research firm.
According to a report released by GovernanceMetrics in June, the good times for chief executives just keep getting better. Many executives received stock options that were granted in 2008 and 2009, when the stock market was sinking.
Now that the market has recovered from its lows of the financial crisis, many executives are sitting on windfall profits, at least on paper. In addition, cash bonuses for the highest-paid C.E.O.'s are at three times prerecession levels, the report said.
Of course, these sorts of pay figures invariably push the buttons of many ordinary Americans. Yes, workers' 401(k)'s are looking better than they did in some recent years, but many investors still have not recovered from the hit they took during the financial crisis. And, of course, millions are out of work or trying to hold on to their homes -- or both.
And it's not as if most workers are getting fat raises. The average American worker was taking home $752 a week in late 2010, up a mere 0.5 percent from a year earlier. After inflation, workers were actually making less.
On the flip side, some chief executives have consistently taken token salaries -- sometimes, $1 -- choosing instead to rely on their ownership stakes for wealth. These stock riches don't show up on the current pay lists, but they can be huge.
Warren E. Buffett, for instance, saw his stock holdings rise last year by 16 percent, to $46 billion. Other longtime chief executives or founders who are sitting on billions of paper profits include Jeffrey P. Bezos of Amazon.com and Michael S. Dell, the founder of Dell.
Resurgent executive pay has some corporate watchdogs worried that companies have already forgotten the lessons of the bust. Boards have promised to tie executive pay to company success, but by some measures pay is rising faster than performance. The median pay raise for chief executives last year -- 23 percent -- was roughly in line with the increase in net corporate profits. But it far exceeded the median gain in shareholders' total return, which was 16 percent, as well as the median gain in revenue, which was 7 percent.
FOR the moment, shareholders aren't storming executive suites. And while they received a say on pay under new federal rules last year, their votes are nonbinding. In other words, boards can still do as they please.
Pay specialists say companies are taking a hard look at these votes. Still, only about 1.5 percent of the 200 companies in the Equilar study were rebuffed by their shareholders on pay. A vast majority of the votes passed overwhelmingly, with 80 percent or 90 percent support, according to Mr. Boyd of Equilar.
Mr. Boyd says companies are making an effort to explain their pay plans. "We saw companies take it very seriously," he says of the new rule.
In some respects, the mere possibility that shareholders might reject a proposed pay plan is enough to make corporate executives think again. Ms. Bowie of ISS says that outrageous payouts -- such as so-called tax gross-ups, in which companies cover executives' tax bills on perks like corporate jets -- are becoming rarer.
Disney for instance, eliminated tax gross-ups this year in the face of shareholder ire, she said.
Company directors have the power to rein in runaway executive pay, but it is unclear whether either they or shareholders will do so in 2012. "It can be done if there is the will," Ms. Bowie says.

CHARTS: Executive Pay, Revisited: Even Higher Than It First Seemed: According to figures provided by Equilar, a firm that tracks compensation data, median pay for chief executives at 200 of the nation's largest companies rose 23 percent last year, much higher than the preliminary figure of 12 percent calculated in early April.

Media executives, in particular, dominated the top of the highest-paid list, with 6 among the top 10.(Sources: Equilar); Pay Isn't Always Aligned With Performance . . .: Companies have been under pressure to align chief executives' pay to stock performance. But across disparate industries, many top executives were still paid about the same as their peers, regardless of how their companies' shares performed for investors. As a group, media companies outperformed other industries.(Sources: Equilar); . . . And the Big Payoff for Some Is in Stock Holdings: Some executives also built their fortunes through holdings in their companies' stock. As the markets rebounded from the 2008 financial crisis, the rising value of executives' shares and stock options added, in some cases, billions of dollars to their net worth.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON
THE Piper PA-31 Navajo took off into the sultry Miami morning and streaked southward toward the Caribbean. High over Haiti, the cameras inside began to snap.
Behind this reconnaissance mission was, of all things, a financial institution: the World Bank, symbol of globalization and, to many, the hubris of wealthy nations.
But this was hardly some clandestine operation. On the contrary, the aerial photographs taken that January morning in 2010, shortly after a powerful earthquake leveled much of Port-au-Prince, were soon uploaded to the Web for all to see, along with an invitation to help World Bank specialists assess the damage and figure out how to aid Haiti.
The appeal marked a radical departure for the often close-to-the-vest World Bank, which, like its brother, the International Monetary Fund, has been called everything from arrogant to inept. The World Bank, you see, wants the world to know that it is finally opening up, albeit slowly and, at times, a bit painfully.
The I.M.F. has grabbed the hot headlines lately, having become a tabloid fixture after its leader, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was accused of sexually assaulting a housekeeper in a Midtown Manhattan hotel. That allegation began unraveling on Friday, when prosecutors themselves questioned the victim's credibility. Not that Mr. Strauss-Kahn is going back to his old job; last week, the fund named Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, as its next leader.
But while the I.M.F. is busy with scandal and the debt crisis now shaking Europe, officials at the World Bank's headquarters here are confronting some existential questions, including the big one: What exactly are we doing here?
The World Bank's traditional role has been to finance specific projects that foster economic development, whereas the I.M.F.'s goal is to safeguard the global monetary system. But many people, particularly in the developing world, have long questioned whether the economic prescriptions that these two lofty institutions hand down from Washington -- essentially: liberalize, privatize and deregulate -- have done anything but advance the interests of wealthy nations like the United States. That the I.M.F. is now championing deeply unpopular austerity measures for Greece, where street protests continued last week, only sharpens that point.
So it might come as a surprise that the president of the World Bank, Robert B. Zoellick, a career diplomat and member of the Republican foreign-policy elite, argues that the most valuable currency of the World Bank isn't its money -- it is its information.
Created in 1944 and, by custom, headed by an American, the World Bank initially helped finance the reconstruction of war-torn Europe. Since then, it has extended many trillions in loans for a wide variety of projects, be they institutions like schools and hospitals, infrastructure like roads or, controversially, environmentally unfriendly projects like coal-fired power plants and hydroelectric dams. Along the way the World Bank, like the I.M.F., has tinkered with entire economies, sometimes with disastrous results.
Yet the Haiti flights -- which cost about the same as a World Bank report -- were the harbinger of a quiet revolution now gripping this aloof institution.
More than 600 engineers in 21 countries analyzed the data collected over Haiti, and their conclusions -- essentially what to rebuild and where -- have since been used by the Haitian government, relief organizations, companies and myriad others.
"It was like the cowboy West in terms of the boundaries of the project and what we were able to do," says Stuart P. D. Gill, a computational cosmologist and project coordinator for the bank's disaster reduction and recovery labs.
Long regarded as a windowless ivory tower, the World Bank is opening its vast vault of information. True, the bank still lends roughly $57 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30. But it is increasingly competing for influence and power with Wall Street, national governments and smaller regional development banks, who have as much or more money to offer. It is no longer the only game in town.
And so Mr. Zoellick, 57, is wielding knowledge -- lots of it. For more than a year, the bank has been releasing its prized data sets, currently giving public access to more than 7,000 that were previously available only to some 140,000 subscribers -- mostly governments and researchers, who pay to gain access to it.
Those data sets contain all sorts of information about the developing world, whether workaday economic statistics -- gross domestic product, consumer price inflation and the like -- or arcana like how many women are breast-feeding their children in rural Peru.
It is a trove unlike anything else in the world, and, it turns out, highly valuable. For whatever its accuracy or biases, this data essentially defines the economic reality of billions of people and is used in making policies and decisions that have an enormous impact on their lives.
Mr. Zoellick says the bank's newfound openness is part of a push to embrace competition, both internally and externally, as it tries to reduce poverty and foster economic development.
In short, the World Bank, long synonymous with Washington elitism, is taking steps to "democratize development economics," to borrow a phrase from Mr. Zoellick, who is leading what many insiders regard as an assault on the bank's power and prestige.
"We do not have a monopoly on the answers," he said in a speech at Georgetown University last fall. "For too long, prescriptions have flowed one way."
ROBERT ZOELLICK folds his long, lean frame onto a couch in his 12th-floor office in the World Bank headquarters.
When a visitor asks where she should sit, Mr. Zoellick pats his leg and says, "Anywhere but here." Then he smiles, pats the cushion beside him, and adds, "Or here." He then points next door to the I.M.F. headquarters.
It is a joke -- not particularly P.C. -- in reference to Mr. Strauss-Kahn and the legal maelstrom up in New York.
Joking aside, Mr. Zoellick speaks with an ambassadorial gravitas -- not surprising, given that he spent most of his career as a United States diplomat.
Mr. Zoellick came to the job in July 2007, replacing Paul D. Wolfowitz, who resigned after a long string of controversies then ended in a scandal about his relationship with an employee.
A lawyer by training, Mr. Zoellick has made the rounds in Washington, particularly in Republican circles. In the 1980s, at the Treasury Department and the White House, he advised President George H. W. Bush. In the 1990s, he worked at the mortgage giant Fannie Mae, today a potent symbol of all that went wrong in the mortgage business.
Later, as the United States trade representative for President George W. Bush, he was a vocal advocate of free trade. Later still, at the State Department, under Condoleezza Rice, he advocated the war with Iraq and was viewed as an architect of the administration's China policy. He then cooled his heels briefly as a managing director at Goldman Sachs.
Now, he is essentially telling the World Bank's 10,000 employees that he no longer considers their institution to be at the center of the development universe.
"As opposed to some imperious bureaucracy in Washington, we're making things open and accessible to people," he says. "That makes for better performance, it makes for a more open system, it makes for people having a different attitude about the World Bank."
To some World Bank insiders, this amounts to a declaration of war on their decades-old culture, a war that began when Mr. Zoellick arrived and instituted a daily 8:30 a.m. meeting of senior executives -- "a shock to some of the people involved," he recalls.
"It's not been bloody, but it's not been easy, either," says Sanjay Pradhan, vice president of the World Bank Institute, a unit that advises and counsels governments, and that Mr. Zoellick has designated as his strike force in the fight for greater transparency.
He is not the first World Bank leader to struggle to match its practices to its principles. The bank, after all, has had an open-information policy for four decades. James D. Wolfensohn, who ran the bank from 1995 to 2005 and was beloved by employees, even called it the "Knowledge Bank," and during his tenure, it spent $280 million to improve the way it shares information with its staff, client governments and organizations.
But by its own account, the World Bank failed to embed that concept of openness in its own culture, despite significant improvements in technology and tools for sharing information.
"Senior management can announce grand strategies and reorganizations, but it must rely on middle management at the bank to execute them," says David Ian Shaman, a former World Bank official. "Middle management is composed of fiefdoms that are preserved by maintaining the status quo and so has little incentive to implement change."
In a book titled "The World Bank Unveiled: Inside the Revolutionary Struggle for Transparency," Mr. Shaman chronicled his battle during the Wolfensohn era to webcast things like internal policy debates. Bank insiders worried that his Web service, called B-SPAN, would open the bank to criticism and reduce its authority.
"The cultural norm of the bank is to hoard information, and when it does release information, it is either perfect or choreographed for delivery to a specific audience," Mr. Shaman says.
In 2004, for instance, B-SPAN was initially barred from taping a speech given by a development economist, Hernando de Soto, at an event to inaugurate a new policy on information access.
"I was told it would be too controversial," Mr. Shaman recalls. The video ultimately was made but, like B-SPAN itself, it was quietly mothballed when he left the bank a year later.
DAVID ROODMAN, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, has had his own struggles with the World Bank. But as a researcher, he says he understands reluctance among World Bank officials to throw open the doors. The bank's researchers work hard to collect data. If it appears online, they may lose a chance to mine it for their own research papers, and thus lose money and prestige.
"It's the capital basis of your world -- and if you share what you've done and people find mistakes, what's in it for you?" Mr. Roodman says.
People outside the World Bank are eager for its information. Its newly released data -- from economic stats to numbers on landmines -- has attracted more than 4.5 million unique views. Indeed, more people come to its Web site looking for data than anything else.
"I'm astonished by the number of people apparently just waiting for our data to become free," says Shaida Badiee, director of the bank's economic development data group. "I had no idea how big a deal this was going to be."
Mr. Zoellick says that he understands his employees' worries but that opening analysis and research to public scrutiny will lead to fewer mistakes. "There will be, I'm sure over a series of years, bad stories that come out as a result of this, and if you're part of the bad stories, it's probably not going to be something you're going to like," he says. "But my view is that it is far better for the institution and its health to be open."
One day last spring, in the bank's sunlit atrium, Mr. Zoellick's team doled out prizes for a contest called Apps for Development. Software developers worldwide had submitted Web applications based on the bank's data.
The atrium is the bank's agora, home to shows and presentations, and people often arrive in national dress for big events.
But that day, the most exotic people were young developers like Frank van Cappelle, a Dutch national who is a doctoral candidate at the Melbourne Graduate School of Education in Australia. His app, StatPlanet, lets people explore more than 3,000 World Bank economic indicators with interactive maps and graphics. It won the $15,000 first prize.
One finalist was an app to help pregnant mothers use their mobile phones to find World Bank data about maternal health in their countries and languages. Another was a game designed to increase awareness of deforestation.
Mr. van Cappelle says the contest encouraged people to make sense of the bank's information. "There's a lot of data out there right now locked up in databases," he says, "and I think it requires apps like this one and some other apps that have been developed to unlock that prison."
The World Bank promoted the contest partly to remind its own employees that the old barriers are coming down.
"You know, we could have had a hundred smart people sitting here for a year and never come up with a lot of that stuff," Mr. Zoellick says. The bank, he says, is essentially widening the circle of people it can brainstorm with.
Having created models for open-sourcing and crowd-sourcing, the bank is now moving toward mash-ups. A new Mapping for Results program offers interactive maps pinpointing locations of almost 3,000 bank projects in more than 16,000 places worldwide. Links open up pages with information about each project, and users can add overlays that show, say, where infant mortality is highest to see whether the bank's work in those areas matches the need.
The program is sensitive because it involves releasing data provided by client governments and others, but the hope is that it will prompt these parties to link their own data on economic and social development to the site or otherwise make it available.
THE Swedish government, a big public supporter of development projects, has followed suit with a prototype, a Web site with information about where it spends its aid money and the impact its spending has had. "The goal is to achieve as effective poverty reduction as possible," the Swedish government said this year in announcing the effort. "To achieve this goal, development cooperation must be opened up to transparency and ideas from others."
Next week, Kenya, too, will open a Web site giving access to data that, until now, has existed largely in books on the shelves of various ministries. Software developers are already playing with it -- seeking patterns like whether there is any correlation between the government's spending on schools and students' test scores, literacy and matriculation.
"The World Bank has made it easier with what it is doing with open data," says Bitange Ndemo, Kenya's permanent secretary for information.
The broader release of such data will enable more "scientific" policy-making, cut down on corruption in Kenya and engage more people in government by empowering them with knowledge they can use to challenge political leaders, he says.
Asked if there would be resistance to public dissemination of government data, Dr. Ndemo said transparency was inevitable.
Information is valuable, he says, and people will find a way to get it: "This is one of those things, like mobile phones and the Internet, that you cannot control."
Correction: July 10, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the opening of the World Bank's vast storehouse of data misstated the amount of the bank's lending. It was $57 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30 (an unaudited figure), not $170 billion. The article also misstated the age of the bank's president, Robert B. Zoellick. He is 57, not 58.

Full text: The rate of growth in the nation's manufacturing picked up for the first time in four months in June, surprising investors and fueling optimism that the recent economic slowdown will be temporary.
The picture that emerged from other data released on Friday, however, was less encouraging. Although lower gasoline prices helped temper the gloomy mood among consumers last month, their expectations on the economy remained bleak, according to a survey.
While manufacturing has been a sweet spot in the economic recovery, consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the nation's economic activity, has failed to return to robust levels.
The manufacturing report eased fears that the economic recovery could remain sluggish, though some economists cautioned it was too soon to tell if economic growth had turned a corner.
Globally the picture was less cheerful, with purchasing managers' indexes in Asia and Europe sliding to multimonth lows last month.
A fall in construction spending in May, to a more than 10-year low, also tempered the economic outlook. The Census Bureau said construction spending during May was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $753.5 billion, 0.6 percent below the revised April estimate of $757.9 billion.
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 55.3 in June from 53.5 in May, when it had slumped to its lowest level since September 2009. The reading topped expectations for 51.8, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
"It indicates perhaps the biggest weakness will be in May," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital in New York. "It sets the groundwork for acceleration in growth for the second half of the year."
One of the biggest factors behind the increase in the rate of growth was a jump in inventory building by manufacturers, which some economists said could be a sign of confidence that the economic recovery would gather speed later this year.
The employment gauge also rose, but new orders increased only slightly, and exports fell.
The prices paid index fell to its lowest since August 2010, further easing concerns about inflation.
Separate data on consumers was less encouraging as sentiment worsened in June. Falling gasoline prices stabilized the view of consumers of their current economic conditions, but longer-term expectations remained subdued, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey showed.
While small spending gains can be expected in the second half of the year, the trend is more likely to vary between lackluster and zero than lackluster and robust over the next several years, the survey said.
The final reading for the consumer sentiment index was 71.5 in June, down from 74.3 in May, and slightly below the preliminary June figure of 71.8.

Corn Prices Fall Sharply After a Larger-Than-Expected Estimate of Crop

Full text: The nation's farmers have planted the second-largest corn crop in nearly seven decades, the Agriculture Department reported Thursday, setting off a sharp decline in prices.
The size of this year's corn crop will be 92.3 million acres, the department said, 9 percent more than the average annual corn crop over the last decade. The only crop bigger in the last 67 years was planted in 2007.
Many analysts had worried that wet weather this spring would cut the number of corn acres. But high prices encouraged farmers to use more acres for corn, and less for soybeans and wheat.
A larger crop estimate drove corn futures 30 cents lower, to nearly $6.21 per bushel. That is the maximum price change allowed by futures exchanges. Corn rose to a high of $7.99 per bushel in June.
More expensive grain has led to food price increases this year. That could ultimately make everything from beef to cereal to soft drinks more expensive at the supermarket. For all of 2011, the department predicts food prices will rise 3 to 4 percent.
A huge harvest in August could ultimately slow food inflation. It typically takes six months for changes in commodity prices to affect retail food prices in the United States. Analysts said consumers could see some relief at the supermarket by early 2012.
"All of us who perceived tighter supplies up to this point, all of us were proven wrong today," said Jason Ward, an analyst with Northstar Commodity in Minneapolis.
Industry traders had expected 90.8 million acres of corn to be planted. Knowing that far more corn is in the pipeline will likely pull grain prices down significantly this summer, Mr. Ward said.
Farmers chose to plant corn at the expense of this year's soybean crop. They planted 75.2 million acres of soybeans, about 3 percent less than last year.
Farmers have a limited supply of good farmland and usually trade one crop for another on their acreage.
"It seemed to me there was $100 to $150 per acre more money in the corn than there was in the beans," said Tom Kreutzer, who planted 150 acres of corn on his farm near Wakeeney, Kan. "That's the kind of math that a lot of guys were using."
A separate report from the Agriculture Department on Thursday estimated the United States had 3.67 billion bushels of corn in storage. Most analysts were expecting a reserve of 3.3 billion bushels, said John Sanow, an analyst with Telvent in Omaha. If the reserve estimate is accurate, it means backup supplies could be higher this year and next. That would ease fears of a shortage.
Still, in August corn reserves are expected to hit their lowest level since 1995, according to the most recent department estimate. Global demand from ethanol producers and livestock owners has risen faster than farmers' production over the last decade.
Higher corn prices make soybeans and wheat more expensive because farmers plant less of them.
Raised expectations for this fall's corn crop also helped lower soybean prices in trading on Thursday. Soybeans fell 29 cents to $12.94 a bushel.
A bigger crop doesn't guarantee lower food prices. A drought or flood could limit the size of the harvested crop.
Mr. Ward said many of the acres planted this spring were on marginal land that would not yield much grain.
Corn is a key ingredient in feed for poultry and livestock, and a staple in many processed foods. When corn prices rise, food processors and grocers pass along the higher costs to the consumer.
Surging corn and soybean prices are showing up at the grocery store this year.
In May, a sirloin steak cost about 7 percent more than last year, according to the most recent available Bureau of Labor Statistics figures. The price of pork chops jumped 9 percent. The price of spaghetti and macaroni noodles, which often contain soybean meal and corn syrup, jumped 13 percent.

Abstract: According to the lists, the average 2009-10 tuition at a four-year nonprofit college was $21,324.

Full text: Students and families can compare colleges' tuitions, the pace at which they are rising and the net cost of attending each college on a new Web site the Department of Education made public on Thursday, fulfilling a legislative mandate.
The new lists, required by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, show the institutions with the highest and lowest tuitions, the highest and lowest percentage tuition increases over the last two years, and the highest and lowest net price -- that is, the actual price full-time students pay, including room and board, after financial aid like grants and scholarships are taken into account.
In each of several categories -- public and private, for-profit and nonprofit, four-year and two-year -- the most expensive institutions and those whose costs are rising most rapidly will be required to report to the Education Department why their costs are so high and what they plan to do about it.
"This allows students and families to see the highs and lows of the distributions and highlights those good-performing institutions," said David Bergeron, a department official.
Information about colleges that are not among the highest 5 percent or lowest 10 percent in their category, he said, can be found on the department's College Navigator site.
A separate report to be released Thursday shows that community colleges -- long seen as the affordable route to higher education -- are increasingly unaffordable for American families. From 1999 to 2009, tuition at public two-year colleges increased 71 percent, while the median family income declined 4.9 percent, adjusted for inflation, according to a study by the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education.
"We've gotten pretty jaded about this issue, with people saying, 'Look how cheap community colleges are, compared with four-year colleges,' " said Patrick M. Callan, president of the center. "But actually, community colleges, which are supposed to be our safety net institutions, were losing ground even before the economic downturn, with huge tuition increases at a time when family income was declining."
The Education Department data cover a smaller time period, reporting tuition from the academic year that began in the fall of 2009, but calculating increases from 2006 to 2008.
According to the lists, the average 2009-10 tuition at a four-year nonprofit college was $21,324. But the highest-priced institutions were far more costly: Bates College in Maine had the highest tuition last year ($51,300); Wells College, in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, the largest percentage increase in the two years before that (67 percent); and the Art Center College of Design in California the highest net cost for those receiving aid ($29,672).
A spokesman for Bates took issue with the department's methods, noting that its price -- and that of the other four most expensive schools listed -- includes room and board, making for an apples-and-oranges comparison with colleges where tuition is listed separately.
"Bates's average net price, taking into account financial aid, is below that of more than 400 other institutions," noted the spokesman, Roland Adams. "Bates' percentage increase in tuition and fees over the last three academic years is lower than that of more than 800 other institutions."
Indeed, the data are uneven in other respects as well. The net cost numbers, for example, include only full-time, first-time students who received financial aid, a group that at many colleges is not very large.
The average tuition at public four-year colleges was $10,747. Pennsylvania State had the highest tuition ($14,416), Northern New Mexico College the largest percentage increase (51 percent) and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio the highest net price ($24,192).
In another effort to expand consumer information about higher education, the government will require career and vocational colleges' promotional materials to show their tuition and fees, and their students' median debt load, along with rates of graduation and job placement.

Full text: ALMOST a century ago, the United States decided to make high school nearly universal. Around the same time, much of Europe decided that universal high school was a waste. Not everybody, European intellectuals argued, should go to high school.
It's clear who made the right decision. The educated American masses helped create the American century, as the economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz have written. The new ranks of high school graduates made factories more efficient and new industries possible.
Today, we are having an updated version of the same debate. Television, newspapers and blogs are filled with the case against college for the masses: It saddles students with debt; it does not guarantee a good job; it isn't necessary for many jobs. Not everybody, the skeptics say, should go to college.
The argument has the lure of counterintuition and does have grains of truth. Too many teenagers aren't ready to do college-level work. Ultimately, though, the case against mass education is no better than it was a century ago.
The evidence is overwhelming that college is a better investment for most graduates than in the past. A new study even shows that a bachelor's degree pays off for jobs that don't require one: secretaries, plumbers and cashiers. And, beyond money, education seems to make people happier and healthier.
"Sending more young Americans to college is not a panacea," says David Autor, an M.I.T. economist who studies the labor market. "Not sending them to college would be a disaster."
The most unfortunate part of the case against college is that it encourages children, parents and schools to aim low. For those families on the fence -- often deciding whether a student will be the first to attend -- the skepticism becomes one more reason to stop at high school. Only about 33 percent of young adults get a four-year degree today, while another 10 percent receive a two-year degree.
So it's important to dissect the anti-college argument, piece by piece. It obviously starts with money. Tuition numbers can be eye-popping, and student debt has increased significantly. But there are two main reasons college costs aren't usually a problem for those who graduate.
First, many colleges are not very expensive, once financial aid is taken into account. Average net tuition and fees at public four-year colleges this past year were only about $2,000 (though Congress may soon cut federal financial aid).
Second, the returns from a degree have soared. Three decades ago, full-time workers with a bachelor's degree made 40 percent more than those with only a high-school diploma. Last year, the gap reached 83 percent. College graduates, though hardly immune from the downturn, are also far less likely to be unemployed than non-graduates.
Skeptics like to point out that the income gap isn't rising as fast as it once was, especially for college graduates who don't get an advanced degree. But the gap remains enormous -- and bigger than ever. Skipping college because the pace of gains has slowed is akin to skipping your heart medications because the pace of medical improvement isn't what it used to be.
The Hamilton Project, a research group in Washington, has just finished a comparison of college with other investments. It found that college tuition in recent decades has delivered an inflation-adjusted annual return of more than 15 percent. For stocks, the historical return is 7 percent. For real estate, it's less than 1 percent.
Another study being released this weekend -- by Anthony Carnevale and Stephen J. Rose of Georgetown -- breaks down the college premium by occupations and shows that college has big benefits even in many fields where a degree is not crucial.
Construction workers, police officers, plumbers, retail salespeople and secretaries, among others, make significantly more with a degree than without one. Why? Education helps people do higher-skilled work, get jobs with better-paying companies or open their own businesses.
This follows the pattern of the early 20th century, when blue- and white-collar workers alike benefited from having a high-school diploma.
When confronted with such data, skeptics sometimes reply that colleges are mostly a way station for smart people. But that's not right either. Various natural experiments -- like teenagers' proximity to a campus, which affects whether they enroll -- have shown that people do acquire skills in college.
Even a much-quoted recent study casting doubt on college education, by an N.Y.U. sociologist and two other researchers, was not so simple. It found that only 55 percent of freshmen and sophomores made statistically significant progress on an academic test. But the margin of error was large enough that many more may have made progress. Either way, the general skills that colleges teach, like discipline and persistence, may be more important than academics anyway.
None of this means colleges are perfect. Many have abysmal graduation rates. Yet the answer is to improve colleges, not abandon them. Given how much the economy changes, why would a high-school diploma forever satisfy most citizens' educational needs?
Or think about it this way: People tend to be clear-eyed about this debate in their own lives. For instance, when researchers asked low-income teenagers how much more college graduates made than non-graduates, the teenagers made excellent estimates. And in a national survey, 94 percent of parents said they expected their child to go to college.
Then there are the skeptics themselves, the professors, journalists and others who say college is overrated. They, of course, have degrees and often spend tens of thousands of dollars sending their children to expensive colleges.
I don't doubt that the skeptics are well meaning. But, in the end, their case against college is an elitist one -- for me and not for thee. And that's rarely good advice.

Full text: A drumbeat of disappointing data about consumer behavior, factory sales and weak hiring in recent weeks has prompted economists to ratchet down their 2011 economic forecasts to as little as half what they expected at the beginning of the year.
Two months ago, Goldman Sachs projected that the economy would grow at a 4 percent annual rate in the quarter ending in June. The company now expects the government to report no more than 2 percent growth when data for the second quarter is released in a few weeks. Macroeconomic Advisers, a research firm, projected 3.5 percent growth back in April and is now down to just 2.1 percent for this quarter.
Both these firms, well respected in their analysis, have cut their forecasts for the second half of the year as well. Then this week, the Federal Reserve downgraded its projections for the full year, to under 3 percent growth. It started the year with guidance as high as 3.9 percent.
Two years into the official recovery, the economy is still behaving like a plane taxiing indefinitely on the runway. Few economists are predicting an out-and-out return to recession, but the risk has increased, with the health of the American economy depending in part on what is really "transitory."
During the first press conference in the central bank's history two months ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke used the word to describe factors -- including supply chain disruptions after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and rising oil prices -- that were restraining economic growth in the first half of the year. Earlier this week, Mr. Bernanke confessed that "some of these headwinds may be stronger and more persistent than we thought," adding, "we don't have a precise read on why this slower pace of growth is persisting."
Economists say the unexpected shocks from Japan and the Middle East in the first half of the year go only partway toward explaining the deceleration. Many worries remain: housing prices have continued to fall, hiring is weak, wages are flat, growth in emerging economies like China and India is slowing and the debt crisis in Europe could have ripple effects.
What's more, government stimulants like the payroll tax cut and the extension of unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. With the underlying economy undeniably tepid, economists are concerned that further shocks to the system could knock the country off its slow upward trajectory.
"The likelihood of a negative surprise is bigger than the likelihood of a positive surprise," said Jerry A. Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds.
There was a glimmer of hope on Friday when the government reported that orders for appliances and other equipment from manufacturers were higher than expected in May. And the Commerce Department edged up its estimate of growth in the first three months of the year to 1.9 percent, from 1.8 percent.
The slow place of the economy's expansion is not entirely surprising, though it is clearly painful for those who are out of work and whose homes are worth far less than a few years ago. Many economists, most prominently Kenneth S. Rogoff and Carmen M. Reinhart, have emphasized that recovering from a financial crisis takes much longer than from a normal cyclical recession.
Jan Hatzius, the chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, said that in fact, households appeared to be paying down debt largely as expected. "Most of the things that looked like they were improving six months ago still look like they are improving," he said.
Analysts generally expect the economy to pick up in the second half as supplies from Japan come back and car production resumes at some temporarily idled plants. "Parts producers are getting back online a lot quicker than anybody had thought," said Ben Herzon, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers. The firm is forecasting 3.5 percent overall economic growth in the second half of the year, though that is down from its projection at the beginning of the year of 4 to 4.5 percent.
Consumer spending has been lukewarm as people have cut back elsewhere to cover for higher prices at the pump. Although gas prices have eased in the wake of the International Energy Agency's announcement that it would release some emergency stockpiles of oil, there is no guarantee prices won't climb again as turmoil in the Middle East continues. In the meantime, customers remain wary.
"A lot of the factors that will give us a boost in the second half are largely temporary and will run their course at some point," said David Greenlaw, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.
At Young Ford, a car dealership in Charlotte, N.C., David McKinney, operations manager, said that while sales had perked up in the spring, buyers were now holding back. "The psychology is going to take a little while to work through," he said. He added that consumers were having a hard time obtaining satisfactory loan terms.
Many consumers, he said, were simply afraid to make big commitments while uncertainty hung like a haze over the economy. "We need to let the middle class catch the rabbit," he said. "Tell them they can go to work 50 hours a week, go to the beach and send their kids to the college and they'll just keep chasing the rabbit. But now they're not even sure their job will be there."
Economists are waiting to see whether the disappointing Labor Department report of hiring in May -- which showed that employers added just 54,000 jobs, hardly enough to keep up with normal population growth, much less dent the unemployment rate -- was an anomaly or the sign of a significant stall.
Companies have given mixed signs of hiring plans. At United Parcel Service, the package delivery giant, volumes declined slightly in the first quarter, and the company is now hiring only seasonal workers or filling in jobs as people leave, not adding new positions. "Our business model is very simple," said Norman Black, a company spokesman. "Packages equals jobs."
Caterpillar, the large equipment manufacturer, has added 7,300 jobs in this country over the last year. With new factories in Muncie, Ind.; Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Texas, the company will continue to hire in the second half, said Jim Dugan, a company spokesman. But he declined to say how many workers would be added.
Given the clouded outlook on hiring and the potential for further shocks, Mr. Hatzius of Goldman Sachs said that he could not rule out another recession. "We're still a reasonable way off from that," he said. "But I'm not as confident as I would like to be."

Full text: Americans who have wondered whether Illinois, California and other troubled states are slouching toward the fate of Greece may get their answer in the coming months.
Richard Ravitch, who won an emergency appointment as New York's lieutenant governor during the 2009 budget impasse, announced a high-level new project Thursday to untangle the finances of the states and shine a light on their hidden debts.
"Whereas there is enormous public attention to the federal deficit, the problems of the states are very serious and nowhere near very well understood," he said in an interview. "People have to understand this, and address it with the same degree of gravitas as the federal deficit problem."
Mr. Ravitch will lead the project together with Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who is credited with wringing double-digit inflation out of the United States economy in the 1980s.
The project will look into the causes of the current fiscal problems of the states, to what extent they are the result of the 2008 financial crisis, and to what extent they are structural. The difference is important because structural problems will not necessarily go away as soon as the economy picks up again.
In his 17 months as lieutenant governor, Mr. Ravitch expressed concern that New York State's annual budget dramas had become a self-sustaining chain reaction, with each year's batch of accounting gimmicks and one-offs feeding an even bigger deficit the following year. Weaknesses in governmental accounting were making the accumulating shortfalls hard to see.
The new research team will also look at the way states are carrying out "mandates," the services they are required to provide under America's federalist system, like health care for the indigent. Since the 2008 crisis, the states have complained that they are legally bound by mandates they no longer have the resources to carry out. With the Obama administration's fiscal stimulus running out this summer, the stage is being set for a major challenge of federalism.
In addition to studying the cause of the states' problems, the research team will explore possible solutions, but not prescribe any course of action. States are considered sovereigns under law, and imposing new requirements on them is difficult, as the Obama administration has learned through the current court battle over the health care overhaul.
To keep the research from becoming unwieldy, the group will start by studying just five states: New York, Illinois, California, Texas and Virginia. Texas was chosen because it is prosperous but still has a significant budget deficit. Virginia was added to the mix because many observers believe it has the best fiscal practices. Illinois and California are on the list because of their low credit ratings.
New York State is on the agenda because of the size and complexity of its system of public authorities, which operate enterprises like hospital systems and toll roads, and are not bound by the rules that limit the amount of debt the state itself can issue.
Mr. Ravitch became interested in tracking state indebtedness during his abbreviated term as lieutenant governor. Known as a skilled negotiator who helped New York City avert bankruptcy in the mid-1970s, he was brought in to help with a budgeting process that had broken down. He dug into the state's finances, saw that years of budget sleight-of-hand had papered over a major imbalance, and drafted a broad fiscal reform proposal.
His approach was to allow limited borrowing to cover operating expenses only if the state broke with the accounting skullduggery of the past. But his ideas were rejected by Gov. David A. Paterson and then by Andrew M. Cuomo, who was attorney general before becoming governor.
Sidelined, Mr. Ravitch continued to investigate New York State's finances and to look for parallels with other states. He discovered an array of unsound practices, like using long-term debt to pay for short-term expenditures. In some cases, officials were violating conventional accounting practices, like selling public assets and treating the proceeds as found money.
In other cases, special accounting rules for governments were themselves at fault, making it possible for states to promise valuable retirement benefits to their workers without recording the true cost. (The accounting rule-making board for governments is slowly working on changes.)
Mr. Ravitch was surprised at how little uniform, accurate data existed, and eventually he decided to compile a database himself. Since completing his term as lieutenant governor in December, he has been raising the money from nonprofit foundations.
He and Mr. Volcker have assembled an advisory board from both political parties that includes several former cabinet members, Nicholas F. Brady, Joseph A. Califano Jr. and George P. Schulz, and the creator of revenue-sharing, Richard Nathan, among others.
The project will be led by Donald J. Boyd, currently a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany.
Mr. Ravitch unveiled the research initiative in a speech Thursday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which is holding a conference on the issue of fiscal sustainability.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- And at the end of June, the Federal Reserve finished its work and rested.
The nation's central bank said Wednesday that it would complete the planned purchase of $600 billion in Treasury securities next week, then pause its three-year-old economic rescue campaign, leaving in place existing aid programs, but doing nothing more, for now, to bolster growth.
At the same time, the Fed said the economy was expanding less quickly than it had predicted. It now projects a growth rate of 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent in 2011, and 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent in 2012. Both estimates are markedly below its last forecast in April.
As growth has sputtered this year, economists have pointed to higher oil prices, the Japanese earthquake, bad weather, a lack of confidence. The unifying theme was that spending and investment would surge as these temporary impediments subsided. The Fed's latest forecast, however, reflects the surprising weight of deeper and more intractable problems, including unsustainable public and private debts, the wreckage of the housing market and trade imbalances.
Roughly 25 million Americans were unable to find full-time work in May, and the central bank projects that most of those people will remain unemployed for years to come.
"We don't have a precise read on why this slower pace of growth is persisting," the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Wednesday at a news conference. "Some of the headwinds that have been concerning us, like the weakness in the financial sector, problems in the housing sector, balance sheet and deleveraging issues, may be stronger and more persistent than we thought."
The markets had been up for much of the day but began falling after the news conference started. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was as high as 12,207.99 in the morning, turned sharply lower after 2:30 p.m., ending the day down 80.34 points at 12,109.67.
Mr. Bernanke dismissed for now any possibility that the Fed would extend its efforts to stimulate growth, saying that the economy was moving in the right direction. The slow pace of the recovery justified the Fed in continuing its existing efforts, he said, but not more.
The Fed's policy board, the Federal Open Market Committee, voted unanimously to maintain its two-year-old commitment to hold a benchmark interest rate near zero "for an extended period." Mr. Bernanke said the language meant it would not raise interest rates for "at least two or three meetings," pushing back to November the earliest moment rates could rise. Economists consider it likely that the central bank will hold interest rates near zero well into next year.
The board also voted to maintain the Fed's portfolio of more than $2 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities by reinvesting principal payments. The board did not indicate how long this policy would continue, a decision that Mr. Bernanke described as intentional. Fed officials have said that allowing the portfolio to dwindle is likely to be the first step when the central bank decides to begin the withdrawal of its aid programs.
"The economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the committee had expected. Also, recent labor market indicators have been weaker than anticipated," the Fed said before Mr. Bernanke's news conference. "However, the committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline."
Automakers, for example, already are planning sharp increases in production to compensate for the disruptions caused by the Japanese earthquake. Prices for new and used cars have climbed sharply in recent months, suggesting that there is considerable pent-up demand.
The Fed has undertaken a series of unprecedented programs since 2008 to arrest the financial crisis and to revive the economy. The central bank first paused its efforts in the spring of 2010, as the economy appeared to be finding its own momentum, only to begin a new round of aid later in the year, as those signs of progress proved to be fleeting.
Now the Fed is standing back again to see if the economy can grow without constant prodding. "A little bit of time to see what's going to happen is useful in making policy decisions," Mr. Bernanke said. He allowed, however, that the Fed could take additional steps, from declaring a longer period of near-zero interest rates to buying even more assets.
"We suspect that the Fed will stay on the sidelines for this year," Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. "As far as next year is concerned, in an environment where core inflation is falling again and economic growth remains muted, we still think that the Fed is more likely to loosen rather than tighten monetary policy."
The Fed projected that the unemployment rate would stand between 8.6 percent and 8.9 percent at the end of 2011, down slightly from the current rate of 9.1 percent, and that unemployment would be 7.8 percent to 8.2 percent by the end of 2012.
Ordinarily that would be a clear reason for the Fed to intervene. But the central bank increasingly is concerned about inflation. It aims to keep price increases at a steady rate of about 2 percent a year. The prices of oil and other commodities, which spiked this year, have begun to recede. But broader measures of prices have also climbed, exceeding that 2 percent goal.
The Fed's judgment is that those increases are most likely to taper off. The prices of long-term investments continue to reflect little concern about inflation. But the increases have been sufficient to convince the Fed's board -- even members who generally believe in acting aggressively to create jobs -- that the Fed cannot afford to expand aid programs.
The European debt crisis and the debate in Washington over the federal deficit also pose challenges for the Fed's management of the economy. Mr. Bernanke said that a "disorderly default" by Greece or another European country would unsettle financial markets and could have significant consequences for the American economy. He also renewed his warning that short-term cuts in government spending could retard growth, while at the same time urging a long-term deficit reduction plan, which he said could spur short-term growth.
The policy board next meets on Aug. 9.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article understated the size of the Federal Reserve's portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. It is more than $2 trillion, not $2 billion.

Abstract: According to the government's official forecasts, discretionary spending is already slated to shrink significantly. The one we have is caused by the world's highest health costs (by far), the world's largest military (by far), a Social Security program built when most people died by 70 -- and to pay for it all, the lowest tax rates in decades.

Full text: Republicans say they won't raise taxes. Democrats are reluctant to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. So discretionary spending -- the roughly 35 percent of government that includes other social programs and the military -- will have to be a big part of any deal in coming weeks to raise the debt ceiling.
But there is a little problem with discretionary spending.
According to the government's official forecasts, discretionary spending is already slated to shrink significantly. Military spending will fall by 25 percent, as a share of the economy, over the next decade. Domestic programs will shrink even more, and by 2021 they will account for their smallest share of the economy since the 1950s.
I'm guessing you haven't heard of these plans, however. That's probably because plans is a bit of an exaggeration. Assumptions is a better word: per Congress's orders, the baseline budget numbers unrealistically assume that future discretionary spending will grow only with inflation, rather than with population growth and economic growth, too.
As a result, Vice President Joe Biden, Republican leaders and the other deficit negotiators not only have to cut discretionary spending to make progress. They have to cut it even more than the Congressional Budget Office, the keeper of the official numbers, already assumes that spending will be cut.
And the scale of the cuts could do real damage. They could jeopardize food safety, highway quality and F.B.I. investigations. They could hurt the poor at a time when unemployment remains near a three-decade high. They could undermine education and scientific research, the best hopes for future prosperity.
The goal of deficit reduction can't simply be arithmetic. It has to be philosophical, as well. In what ways is the private sector incapable of planting the seeds of future economic growth -- and what, therefore, must the government do? What's the least amount of spending needed to ensure a decent life for even the most vulnerable citizens? Who is in the best position to pay that money?
By many accounts, the debt ceiling negotiators, starting with Mr. Biden and Eric Cantor, the second-ranking House Republican, have made progress. They could potentially get to their goal -- $200 billion in average annual deficit reduction over the next decade -- with a combination of discretionary cuts and tweaks to Medicaid, Medicare and maybe Social Security. President Obama's intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan will help.
But even if the negotiators reach their short-term goal, they won't be close to getting the deficit under control. That would require closer to $500 billion in annual deficit cuts over the next decade.
Eventually, the country will have to confront the deficit we have, rather than the deficit we imagine. The one we imagine is a deficit caused by waste, fraud, abuse, foreign aid, oil industry subsidies and vague out-of-control spending. The one we have is caused by the world's highest health costs (by far), the world's largest military (by far), a Social Security program built when most people died by 70 -- and to pay for it all, the lowest tax rates in decades.
To put it in budgetary terms, the deficit we imagine comes largely from discretionary spending. The one we have comes partly from discretionary spending but mostly from everything else: tax rates, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

Taxes may be the toughest issue politically, but the mechanics of raising taxes are not all that difficult. As the 1990s demonstrated, the economy can grow rapidly even after a modest tax increase. As the last decade showed, a big tax cut doesn't necessarily prevent mediocre growth.
Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury Department official, has pointed out on The New York Times's Economix blog that average federal tax rates are "lower for most taxpayers than they have been since the 1960s." The government could raise about $60 billion a year by letting the high-end Bush tax cuts lapse and tens of billions more by reducing tax breaks for companies and individuals.
On Social Security and Medicare, Washington could start by reducing benefits for the affluent -- that is, the people who have received the biggest pay raises and tax cuts in recent years and whose life expectancy has risen the most. When conservatives like Mitch Daniels, Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiw talk about means-testing benefits, they're talking about exactly this: making the programs more progressive.
Beyond means testing, the most promising strategy on health costs is probably a combination of conservative and liberal ideas.
Medicare could get more serious about refusing to pay for health care that doesn't make people healthier, as the Obama administration has urged. The program could also introduce more incentives for people to choose cost-effective care, as Republicans prefer. Medicare's problems are large enough that every plausible idea deserves a chance.
Discretionary spending, as more than one-third of the federal government, obviously must be part of the solution. In particular, bipartisan budget groups have called for annual military cuts of about $100 billion, or about one-seventh of the total budget, which would begin to reverse the post-9/11 spending bulge. Social programs -- which often fail to achieve their fundamental goals -- could also stand some rigorous scrutiny.
But the problem with the current debate is just how much of the budgetary burden falls on a relatively small part of the government. It isn't just any part of the government, either. It is the part that has the best record of turning today's spending into tomorrow's economic growth.
Tax cuts don't deliver nearly the economic oomph that their advocates claim. Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, central to a decent society as they may be, certainly don't do much to plant the seeds of future prosperity. Discretionary spending really can.
Discretionary spending let the Defense Department build the Internet. It let the National Institutes of Health finance life-saving research. It has helped make possible the semiconductor, the broadband network, the highway system and airports.
If we're smart, we won't just avoid damaging cuts. We will even find a way to increase forms of discretionary spending. As history has shown, economic growth remains the best deficit-reduction strategy of all.

Full text: Global stocks rallied and the euro rose on Tuesday on growing optimism that Greece would be able to hold off a debt default ahead of a vote of confidence in the Greek government.
The vote, held after markets had closed in the United States, was a crucial hurdle that Greece had to clear to avert a debt default. As expected, Parliament reaffirmed its confidence in the administration of Prime Minister George Papandreou in the early morning vote in Athens on Wednesday.
World stocks had tumbled almost 8 percent from three-year highs in early May as the threat of a disorderly restructuring of Greek debt shook global markets and banking shares in Europe and elsewhere.
Euro zone finance ministers said the Greek government had until July 3 to approve reforms to get the next installment of 110 billion euros ($157 billion) in aid from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
"There is increased optimism that one, the prime minister will survive the confidence motion tonight and two, that will pave the way for austerity measures to be passed," said Nick Stamenkovic, a strategist at RIA Capital Markets in London.
"As a result, Greece will get the necessary financing to push the debt restructuring further down the road," Mr. Stamenkovic said. "But the stakes are high."
European shares rose at their fastest pace in two months, and benchmark government debt prices on both sides of the Atlantic fell.
On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 17.16 points, or 1.34 percent, at 1,295.52, posting its largest percentage daily gain in two months.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 109.63 points, or 0.91 percent, at 12,190.01. The Nasdaq composite was up 57.60 points, or 2.19 percent, at 2,687.26.
Earlier in Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top regional shares added 1.5 percent to close at 1,096.95, its biggest gain since April 20. The MSCI world equity index rose 1.6 percent and an index of emerging market stocks gained 1.5 percent.
The Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting that ends Wednesday, when Fed watchers hope to learn more about the United States central bank's policy to deal with an economy that shows signs of slowing while underlying inflation pressures build.
The euro was up 0.01 percent at $1.4410. Even though Mr. Papandreou's cabinet survived the confidence vote, the euro's gain could still be short-lived since it would not necessarily guarantee that Greece would be able to pass new austerity measures on June 28, traders said.
"The picture is so uncertain about the euro zone periphery that it will prevent big investors from taking large directional positions," said Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at UniCredit in Milan. He expected gains to be capped below $1.4450.
Crude oil prices turned negative just before noon in New York trading after the monetary fund warned Spain of considerable risks to its recovery.
The August contract for light crude settled up 54 cents at $94.17.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 6/32 to 101 8/32. The yield rose to 2.98 percent, from 2.96 percent on Monday.
Gold rose for a third day, driven by a weaker dollar and uncertainty over the outcome of the Greek confidence vote.
June gold futures finished up $4.50 at $1,546 an ounce.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- New economic analyses of China provide further indication that the nation's supercharged economy is beginning to slow, and warn that soaring inflation, rising labor costs and mounting local government debt threaten to weaken growth even more.
Several economists in China have recently lowered their growth forecasts for this year and next year to about 8.5 percent, down from earlier forecasts of 9 to 10 percent, while warning about the possibility of a sharp rise in nonperforming loans at the nation's big state-owned banks.
On Monday, for instance, Credit Suisse said data recently released by the Chinese central bank showed that credit in China had expanded at "alarming levels," far more than previous government estimates suggested. Credit Suisse downgraded its profit forecasts for Chinese companies and state-owned banks, as it warned of slowing growth for the overall economy.
The reports come at a time of heightened concern about slower growth in other parts of the world, including the United States, Europe and Japan.
Since the financial crisis, China has been the world's leading growth engine. But for much of the past year, China has been trying to rein in overly aggressive bank lending as way to tame soaring inflation and property prices.
Those tightening measures have not only weakened growth in China, analysts say, but have also begun to expose a host of other problems in the nation's financial system.
While few analysts expect China's growth to slow to below 8 percent in the next year, they still paint a troubling picture. The Chinese stock market has been in a slump for much of the last two years, the property market looks weaker and inflation is running at a 34-month high.
Analysts said exports have begun to show signs of weakness in recent weeks. Credit Suisse said Monday that China's export growth could be flat in the coming months, partly because of weaker demand in the United States and Europe.
Credit Suisse's new figures also indicate that off-balance-sheet lending, much of which took place outside the banking system, pumped a large amount of additional credit into the financial system last year. As a result, Credit Suisse downgraded its ratings of Chinese companies and the big state-controlled banks, and warned of a possible rise in bad loans.
Vincent Chan, the head of China research at Credit Suisse, said that the nation's economy might avoid a "hard landing" but that growth over the next year was likely to be less robust.
"The market consensus is for a soft landing and two or three quarters of slowing down, then a growth rebound," Mr. Chan said in a telephone interview Monday. But, he said, "we're saying that after that, the growth may not re-accelerate and the indebtedness may be more serious."
Early this month, Wang Tao, the chief economist in China at UBS, warned that over the next few years, loans to local government investment companies could result in as much as $460 billion in nonperforming loans.
Although Beijing used state-run banks to bolster growth after the financial crisis hit in late 2008, the central government is ordering them to help rein in growth.
Chinese banks have already raised interest rates and set aside larger reserves. The government is expected to announce additional measures in the coming months.
While those moves could help slow inflation, they will also probably weaken growth by driving up borrowing costs in China. That could hamper private companies and property developers, which have been among China's biggest sources of growth.
Last week, Standard & Poor's, the credit ratings agency, lowered its outlook on Chinese property developers, predicting that in some parts of the country property sales could drop sharply as a result of tighter credit and government curbs.
Another growth driver -- local government investment in infrastructure projects -- has also come under scrutiny from regulators because of worries that overly aggressive spending on new roads, bridges, tunnels, subways and showpiece projects could lead to a wave of nonperforming loans to municipalities.
Businesses, meanwhile, are trying to cope with rising labor costs, energy shortages and higher borrowing costs.
Those conditions could change if the government decided to loosen monetary policies and ramp up growth, the way Beijing did in early 2009. But Mr. Chan at Credit Suisse said the size of China's debt could restrain regulators and lead to a longer period of slower growth.
Asked whether nonperforming loans -- or N.P.L.'s -- are set to rise, Mr. Chan said: "A rise in N.P.L.'s is a must. The question is, how much will they rise?"

Full text: "SOUND familiar?" the e-mail asked. It came from Birinyi Associates, a research firm, and contained a list of financial headlines from several news organizations, including this one.
"Concerns Over Europe Flare Again, Pushing U.S. Shares Lower," one said. "Fear of a Double Dip Could Cause One," said another. "Slowdown Fear Hits Market," a third declared.
There was a catch, however.
Although the headlines aptly described events of the last two months, they were published in May and June 2010. All of them.
What should we make of this odd recurrence? "History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes," as Mark Twain is often reputed to have said. (I've found no compelling evidence that he ever uttered that nifty aphorism. No matter -- the line is too good to resist.)
In a telephone interview, Laszlo Birinyi, the veteran market strategist, said he selected those headlines to make a point. "If you feel you've seen this before, well, you have," he said. "The market is in a correction -- but so what? We've had about five corrections of one kind or another in this bull market. It's not the end of the world."
But during long stretches this spring, it may have seemed that it was. The market managed the barest of gains last week, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edging up a mere 0.3 percent. Until then, it had declined for six consecutive weeks, with the S.& P. dropping almost 7 percent, wiping out nearly all its gains for 2011. Market declines of that duration are unusual: the S.& P. last dropped for six weeks in 2002, with a total decline of almost 15 percent, according to Yardeni Research.
Still, considering the scale of the rally that began in March 2009, the recent losses have been modest. As a technical matter, the decline isn't even a correction, because stocks haven't fallen 10 percent from their recent peak. Over all, the S.& P. 500 remains almost 90 percent above its 2009 low.
Even if the market's fall has not been severe, it could easily become so. There are numerous reasons for this spring's unpleasantness, and they have been alternating in the headlines. On the top of the charts last week: the Greek debt crisis and fears of contagion throughout Europe and beyond.
On Wednesday, for example, Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW in Los Angeles, an asset manager, said that there had been a "very substantial" decline in Treasury yields as investors moved to safer positions. Why? On that particular afternoon, he said, traders worried "that the day of reckoning for Greek bonds" -- in which bondholders take losses as a requirement for bailouts -- "may be coming sooner than the market had expected."
The same day, the Irish finance minister said bondholders should share in the losses of battered Irish banks. And Moody's Investors Service placed three of the largest French banks on review for a downgrade because of their holdings of Greek debt -- illustrating the ramifying effects of the debt problems in Europe.
European officials were thrashing out these issues over the weekend, but other troubles are weighing on the markets, too. Take your pick.
It can be argued that investors have been reacting primarily to a slowdown in economic growth in the United States and other developed countries. Rising interest rates in emerging markets like China, where authorities are trying to control inflation by curbing growth, have not helped, either. Nor has a spike in energy prices, albeit one that has abated in recent weeks.
Americans tend to focus on the domestic economy, which grew at a rate of only 1.8 percent in the first quarter. A Labor Department report on June 1 shook up the markets. It said that unemployment had gone back up to 9.1 percent, and that only 54,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were created in May, down sharply from 244,000 in April.
"The monthly jobs report was probably the single most disturbing piece of data" among many items suggesting that the economy is sputtering, said Rich Bryant, head of Treasury trading at MF Global.
Then there is the awkward timing of the Fed's experiment in quantitative easing, its purchases of longer-term securities. Last August, amid talk that a double-dip recession was imminent, the Fed signaled that it would resume these purchases -- promptly dubbed QE2. That announcement helped end the summer doldrums, sending stocks on another leg upward.
But from the very first, QE2 was scheduled to start winding down at the end of this month. Fed officials now say they may delay actually shrinking their gargantuan portfolio -- it has swollen to more than $2.8 trillion -- until economic conditions improve. Further details may be forthcoming after Fed policy makers meet in Washington this week.
Crucially, however, Fed officials have indicated that they intend to keep short-term interest rates near zero for months to come. If inflation stays low and the economy remains weak, the bond market could well rally further, pushing down yields on 10-year Treasuries to as low as 2.5 percent, Mr. Bryant said.
That assumes timely resolution of another big problem: the dispute over the federal debt ceiling. If Congress doesn't act by Aug. 2, the United States could default on its debt, an event that could be calamitous.
"The market is assuming that won't happen," Mr. Bryant said.
Mr. Rivelle assumes that there will be no default, but that Congress and the White House "will continue wrangling" about budget deficits for months while the economy remains weak. "That would be positive for bonds and negative for stocks," he said.
As for Mr. Birinyi, he cites what he calls "the Cyrano Principle": "If the problem is as obvious as the nose on your face, the chances are that everyone else knows it, too." The markets, he said, are very good at digesting this news and adapting to it. Sooner or later, he says, "unless there is some truly dramatic surprise -- and not just something the market is well aware of" -- stocks will resume what he expects to be a long run higher.

Abstract: State attorneys general are still pressing mortgage servicers for a financial settlement over the widespread fraud and abuse in lending practices. During my tenure at the Internal Revenue Service, the low point came when we discovered that a senior tax partner at KPMG (one of the Big Four, which by virtue of their prominence set standards for the others) had advocated -- in writing -- to leaders of the company's tax practice that KPMG make a "business/strategic decision" to ignore a particular set of I.R.S. disclosure rules.

Full text: Indianapolis
NEARLY a year after President Obama signed into law a huge overhaul of financial regulations, little on Wall Street seems to have changed. Regulators appear to be dragging their feet on finalizing the tough new rules that the law, known as Dodd-Frank, authorized them to write. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has yet to get off the ground. State attorneys general are still pressing mortgage servicers for a financial settlement over the widespread fraud and abuse in lending practices.
It will take decades to fully untangle the causes of the 2008 financial crisis, but as our economy fitfully heals, it would be prudent to ask whether lawyers and accountants offer the same protection against corporate misconduct that they once did.
Three or four decades ago, investors and regulators could rely on these professionals to provide a check on corporate risk-taking. But over time, attorneys and auditors came to see their practices not as independent firms that strengthen the integrity of capitalism, but as businesses measured chiefly by the earnings of their partners.
When my father finished Harvard Law School in 1948, he went to work at one of the best law firms in New York. It was an era in which top-end legal work for the nation's biggest companies was handled by a limited number of firms that drew their entering lawyers from a handful of schools. But that didn't mean instant prosperity for the new attorney. Earning $3,600 a year, my dad shared a two-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village with three classmates. At the time a United States District Court judge was paid a salary of $15,000. Today, a judge's salary has gone up slightly more than tenfold, a bit more than the increase in inflation. A new lawyer at the firm where my father worked, however, is pulling down well over 40 times what my dad first earned.
I also began my career in New York, in 1976, as an auditor with one of what was then the Big Eight (now the Big Four accounting firms). Salaries were increasing, but top-tier accounting and law firms were still operating pretty much as they always had. To be sure, you lived well. But moving up the ladder, you didn't expect to get rich. Wealth was reserved for business owners (and generally for corporate executives), talented investors and investment bankers who risked their own capital. One's stature derived from the respect accorded an independent professional. The mission of the junior accountant or lawyer was clear to all: help clients adhere to professional standards and follow the law. Beyond that, do your best to differentiate your firm based on superior service.
Necessarily, the actions of outside professionals were guided by a cautious orientation. I remember one partner advising a bunch of young auditors examining the financial statements of several of the biggest companies in the world, "If you try hard enough, you can always make the numbers add up." His point was clear: technical compliance alone was not sufficient. Substance mattered.
Recent decades have seen a new model take root: a business plan tied to partner earnings. Obviously, to pay employees more and to increase partner pay to its present, staggering levels, billings needed to grow. Perhaps today's approach to fee generation by leading law firms was best stated in a recent Wall Street Journal article about partners billing over $1,000 per hour. Said one such lawyer, "The underlying principle is if you can get it, get it." Imagine a doctor saying that, for attribution, about an organ transplant.
Understandably, corporate clients are reluctant to pay through the nose for advice on how to color safely within the lines. Whereas concern for a company's reputation on the part of its executives historically served to reinforce the conservative influence of the outside professionals, it is well documented that attitudes have shifted within corporations themselves. One need look no further than General Electric's no-longer-obscure tax department to see how traditional law and accounting functions have morphed into profit centers.
Lawyers and accountants who were once the proud pillars of our financial system have become the happy architects of its circumvention. Nowhere is this more the case than in the world of tax law. Companies (and wealthy individuals) pay handsomely for tax professionals not just to find the lines, but to push them ever outward. During my tenure at the Internal Revenue Service, the low point came when we discovered that a senior tax partner at KPMG (one of the Big Four, which by virtue of their prominence set standards for the others) had advocated -- in writing -- to leaders of the company's tax practice that KPMG make a "business/strategic decision" to ignore a particular set of I.R.S. disclosure rules. The reasoning was that the I.R.S. was unlikely to discover the underlying transactions, and that even if we did, any penalties assessed could be absorbed as a cost of doing business.
Just what role outside professional firms played in the genesis of the financial crisis has not been adequately explored. Perhaps it never will be. But at a minimum, we know that the widespread documentation problems associated with bank foreclosures demonstrate that in too many instances, attorneys and accountants abandoned their duties to assure integrity. Further, it seems unlikely that professionals will, of their own initiative, return anytime soon to their traditional posts as vigilant sentries guaranteeing the financial system's integrity.
WHAT should be done? For starters, Congress should take a hard look at the doctrine of attorney-client privilege as it applies to corporations. Communications pertaining to patents, or threatened or actual litigation, should remain protected. But communications about, say, commercial transactions and financing and even government-mandated filings and disclosures might not. Simply stated, lawyers will be less likely to stretch the acceptable to earn a high fee or secure repeat business if their counsel is subject to more outside scrutiny.
This would no doubt change the way regulators and prosecutors examine the roles of outside lawyers and law firms when investigating significant corporate failures -- a good thing, in my view.
To open this can of worms would touch off howls of outrage from the American Bar Association and others. Nevertheless, such a debate would be healthy, especially when policy makers are struggling to find the proper distinction between the rights and protections afforded companies versus those granted to individuals, notably in the political process.
A second idea is for corporations to reassess their compensation practices for financial and legal executives. Just as some large businesses are moving to separate the position of board chairman from that of chief executive in order to provide for stronger governance, companies might also consider development of a new pay scheme for their financial and legal personnel. This would mean paying handsome, multiyear fixed salaries to the chief financial officer, the general counsel and their top deputies -- but without offering the opportunity for equity participation. Such an approach would sharply limit the temptation to inflate shareholder value at the expense of business substance.
Big businesses have always sought to gain competitive advantage over others and certainly to minimize taxes, as have any number of taxpayers. Fair enough. But we have seen that globalization, business complexity and an unworkable tax code have obscured the understanding of risk. Politicians are reviewing our system of corporate taxation -- none too soon if our nation is to prosper as it has in the past. We should look at all the moving parts in our financial system -- starting with the outside professionals -- not just Wall Street and Washington.

Full text: Consumer sentiment worsened this month on renewed concerns about the outlook for the economy as gloom about job and income prospects persisted, data released Friday showed.
But a separate report suggested that the rate of the recovery could soon pick up after stalling in the first half of the year.
Taking the unexpected soft patch into account, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for economic growth in the United States, warning Washington and debt-ridden European countries that they were "playing with fire" unless they took immediate steps to reduce their budget deficits.
While the I.M.F. thinks downside risks to growth have increased, it still expects the economy to gain speed next year.
Consumer sentiment in the United States declined more than expected in June, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey showed, as consumers remained pessimistic about stagnant incomes and job prospects.
"Job growth is, at best, anemic and the unemployment rate is high. If you've been laid off, it's probably been for a long period of time," said Cary Leahey, economist and managing director at Decision Economics in New York. "That can't help but affect these sentiment figures."
The preliminary reading showed the index at 71.8, down from 74.3 the month before. It was below the median forecast of 74.0 among economists polled by Reuters.
Although the data contained little evidence that a new downturn was under way, the survey found that most consumers believed the recession had not yet ended.
Consumers' view of rising prices was also mixed as the survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to its lowest since February, to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent. But the five-to-10-year inflation outlook was at 3.0 percent, edging up from 2.9 percent.
A separate report showed that a gauge of future economic activity rose more than expected in May, but high gasoline prices and a weak housing market are expected to keep growth moderate.
The independent Conference Board said on Friday its Leading Economic Index increased 0.8 percent to a record high of 114.7, after a revised 0.4 percent fall in April. Economists had expected a rise of 0.2 percent.
The rise in the economic indicators was an encouraging sign after recent sluggish data, and underscored releases on Thursday that showed a better-than-expected picture of the labor and housing markets, but a contraction in Mid-Atlantic factory activity in June.
"This rebound in the leading indicators index is an encouraging sign that the recent slowdown in the economy may be short-lived," Nicholas Tenev, an economist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note.
In its report Friday, the I.M.F. forecast that the gross domestic product in the United States would grow a tepid 2.5 percent this year and 2.7 percent in 2012. In its forecast just two months ago, it had expected 2.8 percent growth in 2011, rising to 2.9 percent in 2012.

Abstract: The weak market sentiment on Thursday prompted Prada, whose high-end handbags and apparel are popular with Asia's increasingly affluent shoppers, to lower its price range to 39.50 to 42.25 Hong Kong dollars, from a previously announced range of 36.50 to 48 Hong Kong dollars, according to a person with direct knowledge of the listing, who spoke anonymously because the information was not yet public.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Two of the most prominent initial public offerings in Asia this year were dealt setbacks on Thursday, as renewed worries about the debt crisis in Greece and the waning growth momentum in China sent stocks sharply lower.
Prada, the Italian luxury fashion house, lowered the price guidance for its listing in Hong Kong amid feeble demand from retail investors, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said Thursday.
And shares in Samsonite, the luggage maker that was founded in the United States 101 years ago, fell sharply on their first trading day in Hong Kong, becoming the latest in a string of global offerings to weather a poor market debut.
Widespread selling across the Asia-Pacific region sent several major stock indexes down by more than 1.5 percent.
The global market sell-off had started on Wednesday, as protests and an imminent cabinet reshuffle in Athens once again fed fears that Greece's debt crisis would escalate and spread. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.5 percent on Wednesday.
Asian markets followed suit on Thursday, with a 1.9 percent drop in Australia and South Korea. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong declined 1.8 percent.
There has been "a complete loss of confidence," said Francis Lun, managing director at Lyncean Holdings in Hong Kong. "With Greece on the verge of default, there are now fears that there will be a wider financial crisis."
In many of the fast-growing emerging nations, inflation pressures and rising interest rates are adding to investor nervousness. On Thursday, India raised its key interest rate for the 10th time since early last year.
Likewise, the authorities in mainland China have been reining in bank lending for the last 18 months, as well as raising interest rates. Another rate increase is widely expected to come within weeks as Beijing continues its battle to contain inflation.
"Liquidity is being squeezed by the government's determination to bring down property prices and tighten rates," Mr. Lun said.
Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific have performed poorly this year as a result. Most major indexes in the region are now below where they began the year, and several stock market debuts have performed poorly. Some companies have even shelved their public offerings as a result.
The weak market sentiment on Thursday prompted Prada, whose high-end handbags and apparel are popular with Asia's increasingly affluent shoppers, to lower its price range to 39.50 to 42.25 Hong Kong dollars, from a previously announced range of 36.50 to 48 Hong Kong dollars, according to a person with direct knowledge of the listing, who spoke anonymously because the information was not yet public.
A price at the upper end of the lowered range would bring Prada $2.3 billion, from the previous maximum of $2.6 billion. Prada is to price its shares on Friday and start listing on the Hong Kong exchange on June 24.
Meanwhile, shares in Samsonite, which had been only moderately oversubscribed, dropped as much as 10.6 percent early in the day. Although they recouped some of those losses later on, the shares were well below the issue price of 14.5 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.86, by late afternoon, closing at 13.38 dollars, down 7.7 percent.
Samsonite, which was bought by the British private equity firm CVC Capital Partners in 2007, had previously been forced to price its shares at the lower end of its indicative range, bringing it proceeds of $1.25 billion, rather than the maximum $1.5 billion it had hoped for.
Still, the decisions by companies like Samsonite and Prada to seek a listing in the Asian financial hub, rather than on an exchange closer to home, reflect an overall shift in the center of economic and financial gravity toward fast-growing countries in Asia.
About a dozen non-Asian companies are aiming to list in Hong Kong this year in a bid to tap a cash-rich investor base and to raise their visibility in what is a central market for their goods.
"We feel at home here," said Tim Parker, the Samsonite chief executive, amid a clatter of camera shutters at a listing ceremony at the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday, adding that the company planned to build its business in China, India and other parts of Asia.

Abstract: The current Securities and Exchange Commission rule, under which companies with 500 or more stockholders must publicly disclose their financial information, can make firms that wish to remain private reluctant to give shares to too many employees. Sluggish American growth, untamed Chinese inflation and corrosion in the euro zone are especially unwelcome for a company whose consumer appeal is predicated on high-end travelers.

Full text: A new plan to ease a disclosure rule that has been burdensome for private companies like Facebook gets it only half right. Tweaking, rather than gutting, the current requirements would be a better way to balance companies accessing capital with investor protection.
The current Securities and Exchange Commission rule, under which companies with 500 or more stockholders must publicly disclose their financial information, can make firms that wish to remain private reluctant to give shares to too many employees. That takes away an important tool for luring new and potentially valuable workers.
And because once they have full disclosure obligations many companies see no reason not to go public, the rule can lead them to take their shares to public markets prematurely. That makes it hard for investors to analyze them and creates short-term performance pressures that can stifle young companies.
A bipartisan bill in Congress would raise the threshold to 1,000 investors and exclude from the count accredited investors -- mainly, institutions or high-net-worth individuals -- and employees.
Yet legislators should have legitimate investor protection concerns, too. There is already a thriving market in shares of private companies, especially new technology firms like Facebook. Operations like SecondMarket and SharesPost allow employees and other insiders to sell shares in hot companies to accredited investors. These secondary markets are relatively new and cry out for scrutiny.
But there is also the disclosure question. Demand Media, LinkedIn and Groupon have all been heavily traded while privately held. All the firms claimed to be profitable in recent years. But when they filed to go public, it turned out that by the S.E.C.'s required standard measures, all three were losing money.
The problem is that hundreds or thousands of investors can't really have inside knowledge. Forcing disclosure on companies costs them money, but markets experience even costlier friction if information isn't freely available. Both 500 and 1,000 are arbitrary limits, and either is probably fine. And carving out employees sounds sensible.
But not counting institutions and wealthier investors toward the threshold figure smacks of favoring big money over small investors. Lawmakers should pick a number, carve out employees only and scrutinize the activity on flourishing secondary markets.
Luxury Listings
Maybe a stock market listing in Hong Kong isn't such a luxury after all. Samsonite, the world's biggest maker of luggage, slipped as much as 11 percent on its first day as a public company. It doesn't look great for Prada, the Italian fashion label, which is poised to price its own offering. And it pokes a hole in the theory that investors in the East can't get enough of glossy Western brands.
Samsonite could hardly have foreseen recent market problems. Hong Kong's benchmark index has slipped 7 percent from its highs in June, and 2 percent since Samsonite's shares were priced on June 10. Sluggish American growth, untamed Chinese inflation and corrosion in the euro zone are especially unwelcome for a company whose consumer appeal is predicated on high-end travelers.
True, Asia is undeniably where future consumers of high-end consumer goods are located. Chinese retail sales grew almost 17 percent year-on-year in May, while consumption in the United States is in a rut. But its equity markets are volatile whenever global risk aversion sets in. Highly discretionary industries and fickle emerging markets go together like pinstripe and tartan.
This provides a poor read-across for Prada, a Samsonite peer also seeking a Hong Kong quote for its shares. Demand for luggage may be more durable than for high heels and handbags. Thanks also to a generous valuation of around 25 times forecast 2011 earnings and a possible exposure to Italian capital gains tax, retail investor enthusiasm for Prada is already cooling.
The big question is whether the luxury initial public offering boom has arrived in China too soon. After all, the cost of equity for companies is lowest where there are stable, well-supervised markets, and where investors and analysts are numerous. Those factors favor Europe and the United States. If Asia's markets no longer can provide a frothy premium, the logic of these luxury listings looks a bit threadbare.

May Consumer Inflation Rose at a Slower Rate

Abstract: The Empire State Manufacturing Survey, released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, indicated that conditions for manufacturers deteriorated in June, as measured by the survey's general business conditions index, which fell 20 points to minus 7.8 points, dipping below zero for the first time since November 2010.

Full text: Consumer prices crept up last month at the slowest pace so far this year, tempered by a decline in energy prices, according to government figures released on Wednesday, while a regional report for New York suggested a decline in manufacturing activity and optimism.
Taken together, the reports reflect the impact of some of the global events that took place in recent months.
"Both of them are reflective of the slowdown in the economy that we have experienced over the last few months," said Russell Price, a senior economist with Ameriprise Financial.
The Labor Department said in its monthly report that the Consumer Price Index, the most widely used gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent in May, compared with 0.4 percent in April, and up 3.6 percent from a year ago before seasonal adjustment.
The monthly rise in the C.P.I. was the lowest since November, when the index was up 0.1 percent, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
Analysts had forecast smaller increases: a monthly rise of 0.1 percent in May and a 3.4 percent rise for the 12-month period.
The overall C.P.I. reflected rising food prices, with the food index up 0.4 percent, the same as the previous month. The energy index fell by 1 percent in May, including a 2.0 percent decrease in the gasoline component, making it the first time gasoline has declined since June 2010.
Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist and now the chief economist at Nationwide, said the C.P.I. data was "not great news" but also "not devastating." While there are no job or income gains to result from such a modest rise, there is still enough inflation to affect consumers' pocketbooks, and businesses are faced with costs pressures but no revenue increases, he noted.
"It is not that inflation is roaring ahead, but there are enough price pressures to put a squeeze on consumers and businesses," he said.
When the traditionally volatile prices for energy and food are stripped out, the core C.P.I. in May recorded its largest increase since July 2008. It was up 0.3 percent in May, compared with 0.2 percent in April, and reached 1.5 percent in the 12-month period, the department said. The monthly indexes for May were above analysts' forecasts of 0.2 percent and 1.4 percent for the year.
Prices for clothes, shelter and new vehicles contributed to the price acceleration last month, the department said, while there were declines in airline fares, tobacco and personal care items.
In another report released on Wednesday, manufacturers in the New York region reflected less optimism about business conditions. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey, released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, indicated that conditions for manufacturers deteriorated in June, as measured by the survey's general business conditions index, which fell 20 points to minus 7.8 points, dipping below zero for the first time since November 2010.
Mr. Ballew, the former Fed economist, said that the C.P.I. and Fed reports add up to a "flat spot" as the economy recovers.
"We have a fragile economy," he said. "It is a reflection that we have a long way to go to correct the imbalances that we are all dealing with."
Analysts had expected a decline in the Empire State index but forecast that it would remain above zero, at 14 points.
In addition, the survey's future general business index fell compared with its level in May, suggesting that optimism about the next six months has deteriorated. It was down 30 points, to 22.5, its lowest level since early 2009, the survey said.
The new-orders and shipments indexes posted steep declines and fell below zero, the report said. The indexes for number of employees, prices paid and prices received were also lower.
Mr. Price noted that automobile production in the United States declined in April after the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan, contributing to a moderation in business activity. Demand has softened because of the recent spike in gasoline prices.
A third report from the Federal Reserve showed that industrial production rose 0.1 percent in May, after no growth in April because of the Mississippi River flooding and the effects on business related to Japan, analysts said. The report showed a 0.4 percent increase in manufacturing production in May that was mostly offset by a 3.3 percent decline in electric utility production.

International Energy Agency Says World Will Increasingly Turn to Americas for Oil

Abstract: The Paris-based organization estimated that the world would increase total oil production every year between 2010 and 2016 by an average 1.1 million barrels a day -- roughly 100,000 barrels short of the expected increase in global demand over the period.

Full text: HOUSTON -- Over the next few years, world consumers are going to become more dependent on North and South America to satisfy their growing thirst for crude oil, according to a forecast to be released Thursday by the International Energy Agency.
The Paris-based organization estimated that the world would increase total oil production every year between 2010 and 2016 by an average 1.1 million barrels a day -- roughly 100,000 barrels short of the expected increase in global demand over the period.
"After the sharp increase in oil demand in the second part of 2010 as the global economy recovered more quickly than anticipated from the recession, we now foresee higher mid-decade demand," the report said.
Tightening oil markets along with spreading unrest in the Middle East have driven oil prices 25 percent higher in the last year. But on Wednesday, concerns about a weakening economy sent prices sharply lower. The benchmark light sweet crude oil in the United States fell $4.56 a barrel to close at $94.81. If a major global downturn occurs and begins a more lasting decline in energy demand and prices, as happened in late 2008 and 2009, it could throw off forecasts.
The report warned that high oil prices "are weighing down on an already-fragile macroeconomic and financial situation" in the developed countries, while burdening the financial health of developing countries and pushing up inflation.
The energy agency predicts that 40 percent of demand growth over the next few years will come from China, with most of the rest coming from elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. The agency expects Europe and the United States to have generally flat energy demand, in large part because their economies are expected to grow less robustly than those in the developing world, while their vehicles should become increasingly efficient.
Saudi Arabia and a handful of other mostly Middle Eastern countries with excess production capacity will have to supply more oil, but global markets will need to rely increasingly on producers outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. With production declining in Mexico and the North Sea, the energy agency suggested that Canada, Brazil, the United States and Colombia would need to take up the slack.
The report projected that by 2016, Canada, already the most important source for United States oil imports, would produce 1.3 million additional barrels a day as it expanded production from the oil sands in Alberta. Brazil is projected to increase production by a million barrels a day because of major new offshore fields in deep waters.
The United States, despite the slowdown in oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster last year and declining production in Alaska, will produce an additional 500,000 barrels a day largely from expanded drilling in oil shale fields in North Dakota and Texas, the agency said.
And Colombia is expected to increase production by 300,000 barrels a day, as a guerrilla insurgency's decline encourages international oil companies to return.
The energy agency cautioned that its optimistic outlook for Canada depended partly on the United States government's approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would take more than 500,000 barrels a day of partly refined Canadian crude from the oil sands to Texas and Louisiana refineries for eventual distribution to the Northeast. Canada will most likely sell the excess crude to China if the pipeline is not approved, but the switch could produce years of delays.
Environmentalists oppose the pipeline because they argue that production of oil from oil sands, which requires the burning of large amounts of natural gas, emits more greenhouse gases than production of most oil products used in the United States.
OPEC will remain a vital source of world oil, the report said, noting that Iraq in particular held the potential to significantly increase exports over the next several years.
In a separate report released last week, BP noted that world oil production rose 1.8 million barrels a day last year, with OPEC and non-OPEC producers each roughly responsible for half the growth.
In a projection for 2030 made earlier in the year, BP said OPEC would be "primarily" responsible for meeting growing demand for liquid fuels, although it mentioned Canadian oil sands, deepwater drilling off Brazil, and the countries that made up the former Soviet Union as promising sources of future supplies.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- The Chinese government is considering plans to subsidize the use of energy-efficient materials and renewable energy technologies in new buildings and is encouraging provincial and municipal governments to impose stricter efficiency standards than the national minimums, Chinese officials said Wednesday.
China's heightened interest in saving energy -- a response to electricity shortages and blackouts this year as well as longer-term security worries about dependence on energy imports -- comes as the country's construction industry continues to barrel ahead at a breathtaking pace. Last year, China consumed eight times as much cement as the world's second-largest consumer, India, and it now leads the world in consumption of steel and other industrial materials by wide margins.
With 13 million to 21 million rural people in China migrating to cities each year -- a number comparable to the 18.9 million people in metropolitan New York -- the real estate industry has been putting up office towers and apartment buildings at a brisk pace but often with little regard for energy efficiency.
Chinese estimates show that the country's commercial office buildings use 10 to 20 percent less electricity per square meter than comparable Western buildings. But the savings tend to come not from better designs but from thermostats set as high as 26 degrees Celsius (79 Fahrenheit) in summer and as low as 18 degrees (64 Fahrenheit) in winter.
Senior executives in the glass manufacturing and other material industries said that Chinese construction companies had long chosen low-cost, less insulated materials because buildings in China tended to change hands so frequently that owners seldom looked at long-term paybacks from electricity savings.
The construction boom is a central reason China passed the United States last year as the world's largest consumer of electricity. China has also passed the United States as the world's largest emitter of global warming gases, although it lags far behind in emissions and electricity consumption per person, because it has more than four times as many people as the United States.
Hao Bin, the building energy-efficiency director at the Chinese Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, said Wednesday that the ministry had already adopted an energy labeling system for new commercial and government buildings but wanted to create fiscal incentives for developers to use more efficient materials and adopt renewable energy. The most effective course seems to lie in subsidies for materials, as government studies have suggested that tax credits would be less effective, he said.
Some Chinese cities and provinces, from Beijing in the northeast to Yunnan in the southwest, already have limited subsidies for construction supplies, including insulation and rooftop solar water heaters. The heaters have water-filled steel tubes that zigzag in front of a reflective surface, which concentrates the sun's rays on the tubes.
The Chinese central government has begun taking preliminary steps to subsidize the installation of rooftop photovoltaic solar panels, but the Finance Ministry has moved slowly because of concerns about the potential cost. China already manufactures more than half the world's solar panels, but exports almost all of them.
Mr. Hao declined to provide a date for the introduction of a national incentive policy for energy-efficient construction materials and did not specify what materials would qualify. But he said that it was a focus of policy planners.
The question that policy makers are asking themselves, he said, is, "How can we have a carrot policy which is supplemented by our labeling system?"
Provincial governments have already begun subsidizing the construction of factories that produce energy-efficient products like triple-layer insulated glass.
Hongda Vacuum, a manufacturer of glass-coating equipment for solar panels and insulated windows, bought valuable land next to a large road six years ago on the outskirts of Changsha in Hunan Province for a third of the cost at the time for industrial land, said Huang Le, a marketing executive for the company. Surging land prices since then meant that the property soon became worth 10 times as much on the market as the price the company had paid for it, with a discount, in 2005, he said in an interview last year.
"We got the discount because we are a good project, something the government really wants to promote," Mr. Huang said, adding that the company could borrow against the value of the land to finance expansion.
The central government has already renovated nearly 5,000 of its own buildings in northern China to install more insulation. It has subsidized similar renovations for buildings owned by provincial, municipal and village governments.
A complication for China is that the latest five-year plan, starting this year, calls for a sharp increase in the construction of low-income housing -- traditionally an industry with low profit margins and a bias toward inexpensive materials -- together with further curbs on the construction of high-end housing.
But Zhou Jiang, a policy researcher for the housing ministry, said Wednesday that energy-efficient materials added only 5 to 10 percent to the cost of a building.
"It is possible we build our low-income housing as green buildings," Mr. Zhou said.
He and Mr. Hao were speaking at the opening of the Global Green Building China Focus 2011 conference in Shanghai.
One point that they did not address was how long it might take for energy-saving materials to pay for themselves in electricity savings. The Chinese government has been holding down electricity prices as an anti-inflation measure even as spot prices for coal, the country's dominant fuel for power generation, have doubled in the last five years.
Chinese electricity companies have responded by limiting the operating hours of coal-fired plants in the last two years and slowing construction of new power plants, causing blackouts that have focused more public attention on the energy efficiency of buildings.
Residential electricity rates in China are half to two-thirds of rates in the United States. Industrial electricity rates in China are officially higher than those in the United States, but large or politically connected users frequently receive discounts.

Full text: HOLLYWOOD, Ala. -- Spider webs line the 50-story cooling towers, parts have been amputated for the scrap value of their nickel or copper, and the control room still has analog dials at Bellefonte 1, a half-built nuclear plant here that was shelved 23 years ago.
This does not seem like a particularly opportune moment to breathe life back into a reactor that was designed before the computer age. But its owner, the quasi-governmental Tennessee Valley Authority, says the plant may be its best bet for generating cleaner and more economical new electricity.
Since an earthquake and tsunami unleashed a nuclear disaster at Japan's Fukushima reactors in March, several countries have distanced themselves from nuclear energy. The German chancellor announced her intention to shutter all of the country's nuclear facilities by 2022, and the Swiss Parliament is heading in the same direction.
A modern reactor project in Texas was canceled after Fukushima, and one in Maryland fell apart last year. And even before the catastrophe in Japan, the nuclear industry as a whole had been suffering from a surfeit of generating capacity, the cheap price of natural gas and the high price of construction.
So why is the Tennessee Valley Authority -- which recently announced it would close 18 antiquated and dirty coal-fired plants -- trying to revive a reactor that for years has served only as a salvage heap?
Right now, said Eric T. Beaumont, a nuclear expert and partner in Copia Capital, a private investment firm in Chicago, "it doesn't seem like the most prudent use of money."
"They should definitely be doing something different," said Louis A. Zeller, science director for the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, a regional advocacy group. He likes to call Bellefonte "the zombie reactor" because it is neither dead nor alive.
Mr. Zeller and other skeptics say that beyond the obvious challenges the nuclear industry faces, the Bellefonte 1 project has inescapable flaws. The reactor is too expensive and too antiquated, they contend, and it lies in an earthquake zone.
But the authority is moving forward, estimating that Bellefonte 1 could be up and running as early as 2020, half a century after it was conceived. Cost estimates for completing the reactor run $4 billion to $5 billion on top of the $4 billion that has already been invested.
Thomas Kilgore, the authority's president and chief executive, said finishing it now would make more sense later. "Why nuclear?" he said. "Once you get the unit built, you've got inflation locked out."
Mr. Beaumont, the industry analyst, said that "based on cost, I absolutely think you can say it's crazy." But that assessment might change over time, he allowed.
The Environmental Protection Agency could force additional coal-generated power plants to close as it polices greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the demand for cleaner sources of energy, he said. The price of natural gas will eventually rise, making nuclear energy more competitive, he added, and at some point, existing nuclear plants will wear out.
T.V.A. executives have another troublesome variable to deal with, unpredictable changes in demand, which is what they say caused them to shut down construction in 1988.
"I can't forecast out 8 or 10 years," Mr. Kilgore said, but "we just know when we get there, Bellefonte 1 is a good economic proposition."
Because the plant already has a precious construction license, albeit from 1974, and because of the authority's independent status, it faces far fewer obstacles than most other reactor builders.
The T.V.A. does not answer to state regulators. It has no shareholders to worry. As a federally chartered corporation established in 1933 as part of the New Deal, it is overseen by nine directors who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Today it supplies electricity across parts of seven states, serving roughly nine million people.
It also enjoys financial advantages that most public utilities lack, borrowing money at rates similar to those paid by the United States Treasury, which is critical for building hugely expensive reactors.
That makes it one of the very few American builders that could pull off a nuclear power comeback in this climate. With the exception of Watts Bar 1, another T.V.A. plant that was mothballed for a time but was finished in 1996, no new reactor construction has been started since the early 1990s. Two new plants in Georgia and South Carolina are awaiting construction permits, and the authority is working on finishing a second Watts Bar reactor similar in vintage to Bellefonte 1 that is expected to be completed next year.
Authority managers have said they would ask their board this summer for money to complete Bellefonte 1; last year the board voted to allocate $248 million just to explore that possibility.
Currently, the T.V.A. gets 60 percent of its energy from fossil fuels, mostly coal, and in addition to the 18 generators it recently agreed to shut at the urging of the E.P.A., it must decide whether to scrub or close several more. The authority's goal is to have 50 percent of its generation come from "low or zero carbon-emitting sources" by 2020, which is why Bellefonte 1 is a dinosaur back in play.
Bellefonte 1 is the most on-again, off-again nuclear project in the country. In 1970, the T.V.A. said that within eight years it would build two nuclear reactors here for $650 million. Construction did not start until 1974, and by 1988, the authority had spent more than six times what it had budgeted.
When it realized there was no immediate need for the power, construction ceased. In 1994, the authority tried to arrange to sell the plant's output to the Philadelphia Electric Company. That deal fell through. In 1997, it tried to make another deal with the Energy Department, which needed a reactor to make tritium for nuclear weapons. But another T.V.A. reactor was enlisted.
Representative Mo Brooks, a Republican whose Congressional district covers northern Alabama, said he was all for completing the plant. "More people have been killed by coal than nuclear, by far, when you talk about the mining, the pollution of the water and the air pollution," he said. "Nuclear's not perfect, but it seems to be better than any alternative."
The City Council in nearby Scottsboro and the Jackson County Commission both adopted resolutions last year favoring either completion of Bellefonte 1 or construction of a new reactor.
Residents say Bellefonte 1 will do wonders for the local economy. Operating the completed plant is expected to take 2,800 workers, which would make it the largest employer in the county.
"Had it not been for the T.V.A., we would still be watching TV by candlelight," said Ron Bailey, the vice president for business development at the Jackson County Chamber of Commerce.
Kayla Thomas, 27, a school cafeteria worker shopping in Scottsboro with her 8-year-old daughter, Trinity, said the region needed a "pick-me-up."
"Even if some of those people are coming from out of town, guess what, they're going to be spending the money here," she said.
The prospect of nuclear accidents does not worry her, Ms. Thomas said. "Anything is going to have its safety issues," she said, using her fingers to draw quote marks in the air around the word safety.

Full text: NEW DELHI -- India's central government, convulsed by a series of corruption scandals, is under increasing pressure to deal with the potentially conflicting challenges of rising inflation and slowing growth.
But any effort to deal with the underlying problems that plague the Indian economy runs directly into powerful political interests.
On Tuesday, India's government said inflation increased 9.1 percent in May, compared with a year earlier, a higher rate than expected.
That came atop troubling economic data indicating India's gross domestic product growth had slowed, as companies spent less, foreign investment dropped and bad loans piled up at some banks.
While India's long-term prospects remain strong, many economists and analysts say the country's central government needs to act quickly to ensure the short-term problems do not intensify. While slower growth could help curb inflation, critics are not confident the government has the policy finesse to address either problem adequately.
India faces "an unpleasant trinity of moderating growth, high inflation and monetary tightening," said Rajeev Malik, senior economist for the investment bank CLSA in Singapore. "It is very important that the government get its act together and begin to do something."
In the first three months of this year, India's annual growth rate of gross domestic product slipped to 7.8 percent -- down from an 8.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, and short of analysts' predictions.
The central government, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has been rocked by allegations of corruption and investigations into sweetheart deals worth billions of dollars between government ministers and businesses of various types -- most notably one involving the award of wireless communications licenses. The scandals have paralyzed decision-making and stalled development projects.
India, the second-fastest growing major economy after China, continues to have long-term forces that should be in its favor.
The country's youthful population, growing middle class and increased demand -- whether for refrigerators and cars, or housing and highways -- mean it could become the world's third-largest economy after China and the United States by 2030, Standard Chartered predicted this month. India's economy currently is currently ranked 10th, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Still, a recent flurry of negative economic indicators has set the stage for a rocky year. Inflation is a worry in most emerging markets, but critics say lapses and policy missteps by the central government have made the problem especially bad in India.
On Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of leading free-market democracies, released a generally upbeat report on India's economic prospects. But it warned that without deeper policy overhauls the country would struggle to sustain its growth targets.
"Moving to a new level of growth will require renewing the momentum of reforms," said Angel Gurria, secretary general of the O.E.C.D. He called for lower barriers to international trade and investment, as well as revamping of the financial sector and the labor market.
Each of those issues is enveloped in a political thicket, though. And the current government has shown little willingness to even try changes. The O.E.C.D. report highlighted India's low spending on health -- just 1 percent of the country's G.D.P. -- and the contrast to the country's high spending on energy subsidies, at 9 percent of G.D.P.
Local investment growth slowed in the second half of the fiscal year that ended March 31 to 4.1 percent, down from a 14.7 percent rate at the beginning of the year.
Just as worrisome for an emerging economy, foreign investment in the first three months of 2011 fell 32 percent from the comparable period a year earlier, down to $3.4 billion, on top of a steep drop for all of 2010.
Meanwhile, bad loans are creeping up at some of India's government-run banks, particularly at the largest, State Bank of India. In the quarter that ended March 31, the bank doubled the amount of provisions for nonperforming assets from the previous quarter, according to Enam Securities in Mumbai.
Car sales, one of India's fastest-growing economic indicators, slowed in May to their slowest rate in two years, according to the Society of Automobile Manufacturers.
Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of India's Planning Commission, acknowledged that the economy was growing slower than the target annual rate of 9 to 9.5 percent set by officials.
He said that getting policy reforms on the agenda had been difficult. Reaching growth targets, he said, "is not going to happen automatically -- there are things that need to be done."
Inflation, meanwhile, threatens to become a bigger problem if agricultural productivity does not improve, said C. Rangarajan, head of the prime minister's Economic Advisory Council.
On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to raise its key borrowing rate for the 10th time since March 2010 -- to 7.5 percent, from the current 7.25 percent. The move may further curb growth but have little effect on inflation, analysts said, because a big inflationary force involves structural problems in India's food distribution, subsidies and infrastructure.
Revising interest rates is generally considered a blunt instrument even in organized economies. In India, where the economy is complicated by factors as diverse as fuel subsidies and infrastructure bottlenecks, the central bank's capacity for precision is even more limited.
Even as food prices skyrocket, the government has failed to fix an agricultural distribution system that means about 40 percent of India's farm output rots before it is eaten, analysts note.
"You still need to develop your farm-to-fork model," said Rohini Malkani, an economist with Citigroup in Mumbai, citing need for improvements in warehousing and transportation. Although the government has noted and discussed these problems, progress has been very limited, she said.
The central government's inaction on infrastructure and food distribution is helping drive up inflation -- even as the government is making the problem worse through farmer-friendly policies like raising minimum prices for food and grains.
"Part of the inflation problem is the government's doing," said Mr. Malik of CLSA. "They've chosen to improve the terms of trade for the rural economy," he said, "and it is coming at the cost of the urban economy."
But Kaushik Basu, the government's chief economic adviser, said in an interview Monday that inflation was a problem all developing countries were facing. "If you look at emerging economies around the world," Mr. Basu said, "India's performance looks pretty run of the mill."
He said recent skepticism about India's growth prospects was overblown.
"Just like you have irrational exuberance, occasionally you have irrational pessimism as well," he said. "My own view is that for the full year, growth will be a little less than what we were forecasting. But all the long-run indicators like investment and savings are going in the right direction."
The government's critics, however, take a harsher view. "The last two years have been a lost opportunity" for India's governing United Progressive Alliance party, Citigroup said this month in a research report.
The party's victory in 2009 fueled high expectations of a strong change-oriented agenda, which would address issues like banking regulation, land acquisition and pension reform. "Two years down the road," Citigroup said, "the U.P.A. has disappointed on most counts."

Abstract: The election is happening during a downturn in the economic cycle, but the core issue is the accumulation of deeper structural problems that this recession has exposed -- unsustainable levels of debt, an inability to generate middle-class incomes, a dysfunctional political system, the steady growth of special-interest sinecures and the gradual loss of national vitality. There would be a targeted working-class basket: early childhood education, technical education, community colleges, an infrastructure bank, asset distribution to help people start businesses, a new wave industrial policy if need be -- anything that might give the working class a leg up.

Full text: I'll be writing a lot about the presidential election over the next 16 months, but at the outset I would just like to remark that I'm opining on this whole campaign under protest. I'm registering a protest because for someone of my Hamiltonian/National Greatness perspective, the two parties contesting this election are unusually pathetic. Their programs are unusually unimaginative. Their policies are unusually incommensurate to the problem at hand.
This election is about how to avert national decline. All other issues flow from that anxiety.
The election is happening during a downturn in the economic cycle, but the core issue is the accumulation of deeper structural problems that this recession has exposed -- unsustainable levels of debt, an inability to generate middle-class incomes, a dysfunctional political system, the steady growth of special-interest sinecures and the gradual loss of national vitality.
The number of business start-ups per capita has been falling steadily for the past three decades. Workers' share of national income has been declining since 1983. Male wages have been stagnant for about 40 years. The American working class -- those without a college degree -- is being decimated, economically and socially. In 1960, for example, 83 percent of those in the working class were married. Now only 48 percent are.
Voters are certainly aware of the scope of the challenges before them. Their pessimism and anxiety does not just reflect the ebb and flow of the business cycle, but is deeper and more pervasive. Trust in institutions is at historic lows. Large majorities think the country is on the wrong track, and have for years. Large pluralities believe their children will have fewer opportunities than they do.
Voters are in the market for new movements and new combinations, yet the two parties have grown more rigid.
The Republican growth agenda -- tax cuts and nothing else -- is stupefyingly boring, fiscally irresponsible and politically impossible. Gigantic tax cuts -- if they were affordable -- might boost overall growth, but they would do nothing to address the structural problems that are causing a working-class crisis.
Republican politicians don't design policies to meet specific needs, or even to help their own working-class voters. They use policies as signaling devices -- as ways to reassure the base that they are 100 percent orthodox and rigidly loyal. Republicans have taken a pragmatic policy proposal from 1980 and sanctified it as their core purity test for 2012.
As for the Democrats, they offer practically nothing. They acknowledge huge problems like wage stagnation and then offer... light rail! Solar panels! It was telling that the Democrats offered no budget this year, even though they are supposedly running the country. That's because they too are trapped in a bygone era.
Mentally, they are living in the era of affluence, but, actually, they are living in the era of austerity. They still have these grand spending ideas, but there is no longer any money to pay for them and there won't be for decades. Democrats dream New Deal dreams, propose nothing and try to win elections by making sure nobody ever touches Medicare.
Covering this upcoming election is like covering a competition between two Soviet refrigerator companies, cold-war relics offering products that never change.
If there were a Hamiltonian Party, it would be offering a multifaceted reinvigoration agenda. It would grab growth ideas from all spots on the political spectrum and blend them together. Its program would be based on the essential political logic: If you want to get anything passed, you have to offer an intertwined package that smashes the Big Government vs. Small Government orthodoxies and gives everybody something they want.
This reinvigoration package would have four baskets. There would be an entitlement reform package designed to redistribute money from health care and the elderly toward innovation and the young. Unless we get health care inflation under control by replacing the perverse fee-for-service incentive structure, there will be no money for anything else.
There would be a targeted working-class basket: early childhood education, technical education, community colleges, an infrastructure bank, asset distribution to help people start businesses, a new wave industrial policy if need be -- anything that might give the working class a leg up.
There would be a political corruption basket. The Tea Parties are right about the unholy alliance between business and government that is polluting the country. It's time to drain the swamp by simplifying the tax code and streamlining the regulations businesses use to squash their smaller competitors.
There would also be a pro-business basket: lower corporate rates, a sane visa policy for skilled immigrants, a sane patent and permitting system, more money for research.
The Hamiltonian agenda would be pro-market, in its place, and pro-government, in its place. In 2012, on the other hand, we're going to see another clash of the same old categories. I'll be covering it, but I protest.

Full text: Every once in a while a politician comes up with an idea that's so bad, so wrongheaded, that you're almost grateful. For really bad ideas can help illustrate the extent to which policy discourse has gone off the rails.
And so it was with Senator Joseph Lieberman's proposal, released last week, to raise the age for Medicare eligibility from 65 to 67.
Like Republicans who want to end Medicare as we know it and replace it with (grossly inadequate) insurance vouchers, Mr. Lieberman describes his proposal as a way to save Medicare. It wouldn't actually do that. But more to the point, our goal shouldn't be to "save Medicare," whatever that means. It should be to ensure that Americans get the health care they need, at a cost the nation can afford.
And here's what you need to know: Medicare actually saves money -- a lot of money -- compared with relying on private insurance companies. And this in turn means that pushing people out of Medicare, in addition to depriving many Americans of needed care, would almost surely end up increasing total health care costs.
The idea of Medicare as a money-saving program may seem hard to grasp. After all, hasn't Medicare spending risen dramatically over time? Yes, it has: adjusting for overall inflation, Medicare spending per beneficiary rose more than 400 percent from 1969 to 2009.
But inflation-adjusted premiums on private health insurance rose more than 700 percent over the same period. So while it's true that Medicare has done an inadequate job of controlling costs, the private sector has done much worse. And if we deny Medicare to 65- and 66-year-olds, we'll be forcing them to get private insurance -- if they can -- that will cost much more than it would have cost to provide the same coverage through Medicare.
By the way, we have direct evidence about the higher costs of private insurance via the Medicare Advantage program, which allows Medicare beneficiaries to get their coverage through the private sector. This was supposed to save money; in fact, the program costs taxpayers substantially more per beneficiary than traditional Medicare.
And then there's the international evidence. The United States has the most privatized health care system in the advanced world; it also has, by far, the most expensive care, without gaining any clear advantage in quality for all that spending. Health is one area in which the public sector consistently does a better job than the private sector at controlling costs.
Indeed, as the economist (and former Reagan adviser) Bruce Bartlett points out, high U.S. private spending on health care, compared with spending in other advanced countries, just about wipes out any benefit we might receive from our relatively low tax burden. So where's the gain from pushing seniors out of an admittedly expensive system, Medicare, into even more expensive private health insurance?
Wait, it gets worse. Not every 65- or 66-year-old denied Medicare would be able to get private coverage -- in fact, many would find themselves uninsured. So what would these seniors do?
Well, as the health economists Austin Frakt and Aaron Carroll document, right now Americans in their early 60s without health insurance routinely delay needed care, only to become very expensive Medicare recipients once they reach 65. This pattern would be even stronger and more destructive if Medicare eligibility were delayed. As a result, Mr. Frakt and Mr. Carroll suggest, Medicare spending might actually go up, not down, under Mr. Lieberman's proposal.
O.K., the obvious question: If Medicare is so much better than private insurance, why didn't the Affordable Care Act simply extend Medicare to cover everyone? The answer, of course, was interest-group politics: realistically, given the insurance industry's power, Medicare for all wasn't going to pass, so advocates of universal coverage, myself included, were willing to settle for half a loaf. But the fact that it seemed politically necessary to accept a second-best solution for younger Americans is no reason to start dismantling the superior system we already have for those 65 and over.
Now, none of what I have said should be taken as a reason to be complacent about rising health care costs. Both Medicare and private insurance will be unsustainable unless there are major cost-control efforts -- the kinds of efforts that are actually in the Affordable Care Act, and which Republicans demagogued with cries of "death panels."
The point, however, is that privatizing health insurance for seniors, which is what Mr. Lieberman is in effect proposing -- and which is the essence of the G.O.P. plan -- hurts rather than helps the cause of cost control. If we really want to hold down costs, we should be seeking to offer Medicare-type programs to as many Americans as possible.

Abstract: With probably the most impressive resume and the least chance of succeeding, Stanley Fischer, the governor of the Bank of Israel, has added his name to the list of candidates for managing director of the International Monetary Fund. A globally renowned economist who is credited with stabilizing the Israeli shekel during his six years as head of the country's central bank, Mr. Fischer also spent seven years as first deputy managing director of the I.M.F., and knows the organization well.

Full text: With probably the most impressive resume and the least chance of succeeding, Stanley Fischer, the governor of the Bank of Israel, has added his name to the list of candidates for managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
A globally renowned economist who is credited with stabilizing the Israeli shekel during his six years as head of the country's central bank, Mr. Fischer also spent seven years as first deputy managing director of the I.M.F., and knows the organization well.
"It was because of this experience that I decided to stand," Mr. Fischer said in a statement Saturday.
But despite Mr. Fischer's qualifications, even he seemed to acknowledge that he has only a slim chance of being chosen over the front-runner, Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister. Agustin G. Carstens, the governor of Mexico's central bank, is also campaigning for the job.
"An extraordinary and unplanned opportunity has come up, possibly one that will not come again," Mr. Fischer said in his statement. He decided to pursue the I.M.F. job, he said, "despite the process being complicated and despite the possible barriers."
Mr. Fischer had a distinguished academic career before entering public service, writing numerous economics textbooks and serving as head of the economics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was also chief economist at the World Bank from 1988 to 1990. He has private sector experience as a vice chairman of Citigroup from 2002 to 2005, when he became governor of the Bank of Israel.
"On the basis of his qualifications he is as serious as either of the other two candidates," said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "The work he has done in stabilizing the Israeli economy and stabilizing prices is viewed as a textbook application of monetary policy."
Still, the obstacles to Mr. Fischer's candidacy are formidable. As he acknowledged in his statement, at 67 he already exceeds the age limit of 65 for candidates for managing director, meaning a change in I.M.F. rules would be necessary for him to be elected by the 187 countries that participate in the selection.
With joint United States and Israeli citizenship, Mr. Fischer's passports work against him. By informal arrangement, the United States has supplied the head of the World Bank, while the head of the I.M.F. has come from Europe. In addition, Arab countries might object to an Israeli in the I.M.F. post.
"Stan Fischer would make an excellent I.M.F. managing director. But, at this late stage, he does not have enough support to succeed," the economist Nouriel Roubini told Reuters. Mr. Fischer was voted most suited to run the I.M.F. in a Reuters poll of economists.
Its executive board has set a June 30 deadline for selecting a successor to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as I.M.F. managing director last month after being accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid in New York.
Ms. Lagarde is highly regarded for her negotiating skills, and has the strong support of Germany, where she enjoys a warm working relationship with Wolfgang Schauble, the finance minister. The fact that she is a woman might also help restore the reputation of the I.M.F. after the arrest of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who denies the charges against him.
Though she is the front-runner, Ms. Lagarde faces abuse of power charges for her intervention in a court case involving a French tycoon. A French court moved on Friday to postpone a decision on the investigation, removing an immediate hurdle to Ms. Lagarde's candidacy but leaving her open to possible future legal proceedings.
Ms. Lagarde has been on a worldwide tour of countries including Brazil, India and China in what appears to be a successful campaign to win support from developing nations, some of which had said it was time for someone from a poorer country to manage the I.M.F.
"Everybody is free to file a candidacy," Ms. Lagarde told reporters in Cairo on Sunday, after meeting with the Egyptian finance minister, Samir Mohamed Radwan, about her own bid, Bloomberg News reported. She noted that Mr. Fischer is experienced, Bloomberg said.
Russia has also nominated Grigori A. Martchenko, Kazakhstan's central bank president.
The deadline for nominations was Friday. Mr. Fischer did not say when he had submitted his name.
The I.M.F. assists countries in overcoming financial crises, but typically makes loans contingent on harsh austerity measures.
Strong political skills are crucial for the I.M.F. managing director, which would seem to be another factor in Ms. Lagarde's favor. However, Mr. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics noted that Mr. Fischer was able to cope with Israel's fractious politics while pushing for fiscal discipline and cutting inflation.
In Israel, Yuval Steinitz, the finance minister, on Sunday said that the country would back Mr. Fischer's candidacy, but also gave him little chance of being chosen.
"First there is the age obstacle," Mr. Steinitz told Israel's Army Radio during an interview Sunday. "And the choice is very much political. Were it purely professional it would be hard-pressed to find a better person than Fischer."
In a 1987 paper with parallels to the current debt crisis in some European nations, Mr. Fischer argued in favor of debt relief for countries in Africa and Latin America. The overly indebted countries had "performed miracles" to try to service their debts, he wrote in The American Economic Review.
"But the price in terms of growth has been heavy," he said. "The time for debt relief has arrived."

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Annuities and the Puzzle of Income" (Economic View, June 5), in which Richard H. Thaler described some advantages of buying annuities:
Annuities are superficially attractive, but they have important flaws the column did not discuss. People don't tend to buy diversified sets of annuities, and because they are issued by inherently leveraged financial intermediaries, there can be material credit risks that are hard to assess over the 20- to- 40-year horizon of their payouts.
Annuity providers also incur sales charges and operating expenses, and need capital and a cushion of economic earnings. Those costs may not be incurred by someone making their own investments, or doing so through lower-cost vehicles.
Finally, inflation is an even more important consideration. Not discussing it is like playing "Hamlet" without the prince. In 30 years, the level of consumer prices in the United States might double or sextuple. The first would be painful, and the second ruinous, to someone who relied only on a fixed annuity.

Abstract: Around the same time, there were bubbles in the nation's commercial real estate and farmland. [...] there were real estate bubbles in many other countries, too. Our latest survey, covering April and May of this year, included 296 home buyers, and their median expectation for annual home price appreciation over the next decade was down sharply, to just 3 percent.

Full text: THE origins of the current economic crisis can be traced to a particular kind of social epidemic: a speculative bubble that generated pervasive optimism and complacency. That epidemic has run its course. But we are now living with the malaise it caused.
News accounts of the economic crisis rarely put it in these terms. They tend to focus on distinct short-term developments or on the roles of prominent people like Federal Reserve governors, members of Congress or Wall Street financiers. These stories grab attention and may be supported by some of the economic statistics that the government and private institutions collect.
But the economic situation is primarily driven by hard-to-quantify sociological factors that play out over many years.
The uptick in the unemployment rate, to 9.1 percent from 8.8 percent two months earlier and the drop in stock prices over the last month have attracted notice, yet in a sense they are symptoms of a deeper economic sickness.
Real estate prices have been a significant indicator of this ailment. An unprecedented bubble in American home prices started in 1997 and ended five years ago. Home prices rose 131 percent in that time, or 85 percent in real inflation-corrected terms, according to the S.& P./Case-Shiller National Home Price index. (I helped to develop that index, along with Karl Case of Wellesley College.)
Around the same time, there were bubbles in the nation's commercial real estate and farmland. And there were real estate bubbles in many other countries, too.
Consider this: Home prices rose nearly 10 percent a year on average in the United States from 1997 to 2006, long enough for many people to become accustomed to the pace and to view it as normal. The conventional 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.8 percent over those years, far below the appreciation rate on housing, so even if you had a substantial mortgage, you were becoming wealthier by the day, at least on paper. People who owned a home over that period had reason to feel pretty well off and proud of their investment acumen. That fed a contagion of optimism and helped to drive the speculative bubble, propelling the economy and the stock market in a feedback loop that repeated year after year.
Professor Case and I have conducted annual spring surveys of home-buyer attitudes for many years. We ask about long-term expectations: "On average over the next 10 years how much do you expect the value of your property to change each year?"
The survey we conducted in spring 2005, near the end of the bubble, included 407 home buyers. In it, the median expectation for home price appreciation over the next decade -- until 2015 -- was 7 percent a year. That is substantially less than the 10 percent a year that Americans had recently experienced.
But expected increases of 7 percent a year still implied another doubling of home prices by 2015. And about a quarter of our respondents in 2005 anticipated increases of at least 15 percent a year for the next decade. Something was very wrong with this picture, but few noticed it.
As it turned out, of course, those expected increases didn't happen. Instead, home prices tumbled 34 percent nationally from the peak in the first quarter of 2006 to the first quarter of 2011 -- or 40 percent in real terms -- and they still appear to be falling. The brief "recovery" in home prices of 2009 and 2010 was most likely spurred by federal housing stimulus measures like the home buyer tax credit. After that stimulus ended, prices resumed their downward trend.
During the bubble, the sense of rising wealth and high expectations gave people a good reason to spend and a greater willingness to plunge into investment, too. Government policy makers breathed in the same optimism, which no doubt encouraged them to be lax on regulatory restraint.
The mood is far different now. Our latest survey, covering April and May of this year, included 296 home buyers, and their median expectation for annual home price appreciation over the next decade was down sharply, to just 3 percent. And, in comparison with the 2005 results, few people had extravagant expectations.
The 3 percent figure is well below prevailing rates for 30-year mortgages, now hovering between 4.5 and 5 percent. Amid such low expectations, buying a home with a mortgage certainly isn't being viewed as a way to get rich.
Even for people who have other reasons to buy a house, there may be little urgency to do so. Our 2011 survey found that the median expectation for home price appreciation next year is just 1 percent. So it won't be surprising if new home sales remain abysmally low and few jobs are created in the hard-hit construction industry. And it shouldn't be a shock if the personal savings rate stays at around 5 percent, as it has recently, up from around 1 percent in 2005. This would mean that consumer spending will not drive a strong recovery.
A half-century ago, there was a lively discussion among economists about the dynamics of price expectations. For example, Alain C. Enthoven, then of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford wrote in 1956 that expectations that extrapolate past price increases can produce economic instability. But that thinking was largely cast aside in the 1960s, when my profession embraced the theory that efficient markets formed by people holding rational expectations could explain virtually all economic activity.
As a result, economists in recent decades have not developed expectations theory much further. That needs to be corrected in coming years. In the meantime, this failing helps explain why the current crisis was generally unpredicted, and why its future course is so poorly understood.

Full text: Regulators and financiers could be focused on the wrong mortgage market. They are right that healthy American home lending hinges on the private sector's ability to finance all or most of it, rather than relying on government-run Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or their equivalents. But architects of the postcrisis home loan market may be assuming it needs to be larger than it really does. It could be scarcely half as big as the current $10.5 trillion and therefore much easier to finance.
Size matters because important constituencies are sweating the details of mandated reforms, including setting a new gold standard for mortgages. Making home lending less risky and housing boom-and-bust cycles less severe would probably reduce the supply of loans. If authorities and investors choose the wrong market size, they could strike the wrong balance.
Outstanding mortgages are still only 6 percent below the precrisis peak, while home prices are down a third. That's one hint the market hasn't bled out the excesses. Once foreclosures, sharply lower home values and the swelling ranks of renters are baked in, the market should shrink. Today's mortgage market is more than twice as big as in less-frothy 2000. If home prices had appreciated in lock step with inflation since 1996 and loan-to-value ratios stayed the same, there would now be roughly $5.3 trillion in outstanding home loans, just over half the current level.
Or consider a simple calculation starting with the latest figures. First, assume that 4.3 million dud loans, as estimated by Barclays Capital, are repaid or written off once the relevant homes are foreclosed and resold. That could lop nearly $1 trillion from the market. Then, suppose the home ownership rate drops a couple more percentage points to the 64.5 percent average over the three decades leading up to 1999. That could knock off nearly $300 billion more. Overlay the drop in home prices from the 2006 peak, and a fully deleveraged mortgage market might be around $6.6 trillion in size.
Downsizing baby boomers also should translate to smaller mortgages. The whole market may not quite be cut in half. But policy makers shouldn't ignore the possibility.
Default Fantasies
Fitch Ratings is the latest credit watchdog to warn about the consequences of a missed interest payment by the United States. Yet there's a faction in Washington that seems increasingly inclined to push the nation's debt fight that far.
There's a false choice on offer, however. Republicans who say they're willing to risk a brief, technical default by the federal government mostly think any earlier deal to raise the statutory debt cap would encourage further tax-and-spend profligacy by Democrats. They reckon a temporary default would be worthwhile to reach a long-term deal on spiraling health care and retirement obligations.
Action to reduce federal deficits is needed or one day the government really will run out of money. But the struggle in Washington to coalesce on anything suggests another half-baked and temporary budget agreement is the most likely result of the current fight. And if a technical default followed, it could be far worse than gung-ho Republicans imagine. Peru got away, more or less, with a missed payment in 2000, but had a clear rationale and was a known risky and peripheral debtor. America, by contrast, is the world's credit benchmark and issuer of its reserve currency, suggesting a scarier outcome.
The credit rating and borrowing cost impact could be severe. But Fitch also points to repo markets -- crucial plumbing for the global financial system -- where an estimated $4 trillion of United States Treasuries are used as collateral. There are implications for the stability of money market funds, too.
Trouble in either place would echo the 2008 crisis. JPMorgan analysts further note the 40 percent decline in foreign holdings of the debt of government-sponsored housing enterprises in the year after they were bailed out, despite federal backing of their credit.
Even if a technical default wasn't disastrous in the short term, it would damage trust in American debt and the dollar for the long term. The markets, which have turned perhaps too benign an eye so far, could start delivering a harsher verdict sooner than the putative August debt cap deadline. Reaching that date doesn't mean Uncle Sam will inevitably miss a payment. But a loss of confidence would not be easily reversed.

Full text: Economic activity in the United States continued to grow in April and May, but higher food and energy prices, severe weather conditions and supply disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan put pressure on consumers, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve released on Wednesday.
The central bank's district-by-district report, called the beige book, said that economic activity "generally continued to expand," although at different rates across the country. The pace of growth slowed, for example, in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Chicago districts. The Dallas district accelerated, while other areas showed growth continuing at a steady pace, the survey said.
The beige book also noted that manufacturing in general expanded, and that activity in the nonfinancial service sectors grew steadily, led by the information technology and business and professional services industries.
The report is intended to get beyond the financial statistics to offer economists and market watchers insights into the regional factors affecting the nation's economy. The report covered a two-month period when the government's economic indicators were growing progressively weaker.
The survey, issued eight times a year, seemed to support remarks made a day earlier by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who described the country's economic growth as slow and uneven.
Compared with the previous beige book, which raised questions about the impact of the March disaster in Japan, this survey suggested that some of the economic headwinds could be receding.
"What we are seeing is that the business community and the banking community out on the ground see this as a transitory thing," John Canally, an economist for LPL Financial, said. "Businesses in general are seeing through the soft spot."
The report said that the supply disruptions caused by the events in Japan had resulted in a reduction in the flow of new cars to dealer inventories, which in turn had held down sales. In addition, bad weather and high gas prices hurt casino, retail and agricultural activity in several regions.
Those factors affected growth in consumer spending, with most districts indicating steady to modestly increasing activity, the survey said. "Elevated food and energy prices, as well as unfavorable weather in some parts of the country, were said to be weighing on consumers' propensity to spend," the report said.
The Cleveland district noted a sharp drop in auto production, while businesses in the Chicago area said contingency plans were put into play to deal with supply disruptions. High-tech companies in the Boston and Dallas districts reported a lack of parts that had adverse effects on business, according to the survey.
Business activity related to the agriculture sector was varied because of extreme weather. Cool temperatures delayed crops in the San Francisco Fed district; flooding on the Mississippi River slowed activity for farmers in the St. Louis and Atlanta districts. In the Dallas district, severe drought was expected to hurt the wheat crop, while wildfires led to "significant" agricultural losses, the survey said.
Residential construction and real estate continued to show widespread weakness, the survey said. Labor market conditions improved gradually across most of the country, but some districts said there was a dearth of workers with specialized technical skills. Wage growth was modest, the report said, even though highly skilled workers commanded steeper increases.
In a speech to bankers Tuesday in Atlanta, Mr. Bernanke said he was confident that the pace of growth would increase during the second half of the year, and that he continued to see no signs of broad and enduring inflation despite the recent price rises.
"Over all, the economic recovery appears to be continuing at a moderate pace, albeit at a rate that is both uneven across sectors and frustratingly slow from the perspective of millions of unemployed and underemployed workers," Mr. Bernanke said in his speech.
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee next meets on June 21 and 22.

Full text: GURGAON, India -- In this city that barely existed two decades ago, there are 26 shopping malls, seven golf courses and luxury shops selling Chanel and Louis Vuitton. Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs shimmer in automobile showrooms. Apartment towers are sprouting like concrete weeds, and a futuristic commercial hub called Cyber City houses many of the world's most respected corporations.
Gurgaon, located about 15 miles south of the national capital, New Delhi, would seem to have everything, except consider what it does not have: a functioning citywide sewer or drainage system; reliable electricity or water; and public sidewalks, adequate parking, decent roads or any citywide system of public transportation. Garbage is still regularly tossed in empty lots by the side of the road.
With its shiny buildings and galloping economy, Gurgaon is often portrayed as a symbol of a rising "new" India, yet it also represents a riddle at the heart of India's rapid growth: how can a new city become an international economic engine without basic public services? How can a huge country flirt with double-digit growth despite widespread corruption, inefficiency and governmental dysfunction?
In Gurgaon and elsewhere in India, the answer is that growth usually occurs despite the government rather than because of it. India and China are often considered to be the world's rising economic powers, yet if China's growth has been led by the state, India's growth is often impeded by the state. China's authoritarian leaders have built world-class infrastructure; India's infrastructure and bureaucracy are both considered woefully outdated.
Yet over the past decade, India has emerged as one of the world's most important new engines of growth, despite itself. Even now, with its economy feeling the pressure from global inflation and higher interest rates, some economists predict that India will become the world's third largest economy within 15 years and could much sooner supplant China as the fastest-growing major economy.
Moreover, India's unorthodox path illustrates, on a grand scale, the struggles of many smaller developing countries to deliver growth despite weak, ineffective governments. Many have tried to emulate China's top-down economic model, but most are stuck with the Indian reality. In India, Gurgaon epitomizes that reality, managing to be both a complete mess and an economic powerhouse, a microcosm of Indian dynamism and dysfunction.
In Gurgaon, economic growth is often the product of a private sector improvising to overcome the inadequacies of the government.
To compensate for electricity blackouts, Gurgaon's companies and real estate developers operate massive diesel generators capable of powering small towns. No water? Drill private borewells. No public transportation? Companies employ hundreds of private buses and taxis. Worried about crime? Gurgaon has almost four times as many private security guards as police officers.
"You could call it the United States of Gurgaon," said Sanjay Kaul, an activist critical of the city's lack of planning who argues that Gurgaon is a patchwork of private islands more than an interconnected city. "You are on your own."
Gurgaon is an extreme example, but it is not an exception. In Bangalore, outsourcing companies like Infosys and Wipro transport workers with fleets of buses and use their own power generators to compensate for the weak local infrastructure. Many apartment buildings in Mumbai, the nation's financial hub, rely on private water tankers. And more than half of urban Indian families pay to send their children to private schools rather than the free government schools, where teachers often do not show up for work.
With 1.2 billion people, India is the largest democracy in the world, a laboratory among developing countries for testing how well democracy is able to accommodate and improve the lives of a huge population. India is richer than ever before, with rising global influence. Yet its development is divisive at home. It is experiencing a Gilded Age of nouveau billionaires while it is cleaved by inequality and plagued in some states by poverty and malnutrition levels rivaling sub-Saharan Africa.
The volatile contradictions of rapid economic growth ricochet daily through Indian life. Middle-class rage over mounting corruption is visceral. Frustration with the government is widespread. Leftists and other critics blame India's landmark 1991 market reforms for failing to lift the rural poor out of poverty; business leaders warn that India risks slower growth or even stagnation unless those economic changes deepen and governing improves.
Today, Gurgaon is one of India's fastest-growing districts, having expanded more than 70 percent during the past decade to more than 1.5 million people, larger than most American cities. It accounts for almost half of all revenues for its state, Haryana, and added 50,000 vehicles to the roads last year alone. Real estate values have risen sharply in a city that has become a roaring engine of growth, if also a colossal headache as a place to live and work.
The Birth of a Boom
Before it had malls, a theme park and fancy housing compounds, Gurgaon had blue cows. Or so Kushal Pal Singh was told during the 1970s when he began describing his development vision for Gurgaon. It was a farming village whose name, derived from the Hindu epic the Mahabharata, means "village of the gurus." It also had wild animals, similar to cows, known for their strangely bluish tint.
"Most people told me I was mad," Mr. Singh recalled. "People said: 'Who is going to go there? There are blue cows roaming around.' "
Gurgaon was widely regarded as an economic wasteland. In 1979, the state of Haryana created Gurgaon by dividing a longstanding political district on the outskirts of New Delhi. One half would revolve around the city of Faridabad, which had an active municipal government, direct rail access to the capital, fertile farmland and a strong industrial base. The other half, Gurgaon, had rocky soil, no local government, no railway link and almost no industrial base.
As an economic competition, it seemed an unfair fight. And it has been: Gurgaon has won, easily. Faridabad has struggled to catch India's modernization wave, while Gurgaon's disadvantages turned out to be advantages, none more important, initially, than the absence of a districtwide government, which meant less red tape capable of choking development.
By 1979, Mr. Singh had taken control of his father-in-law's real estate company, now known as DLF, at a moment when urban development in India was largely overseen by government agencies. In most states, private developers had little space to operate, but Haryana was an exception. Slowly, Mr. Singh began accumulating 3,500 acres in Gurgaon that he divided into plots and began selling to people unable to afford prices in New Delhi.
Still, growth was slow until after 1991, when the government barely staved off default on foreign debts and began introducing market economic reforms. Demand for housing steadily increased, followed by demand for commercial space as multinational corporations began arriving to take advantage of India's emerging outsourcing industry.
Outsourcing required workspaces for thousands of white-collar employees. In New Delhi, rents were exorbitant and space was limited, and Mr. Singh began pitching Gurgaon as an alternative. It did have advantages: it was close to the New Delhi airport and a Maruti-Suzuki automobile plant had opened in the 1980s. But Gurgaon still seemed remote and DLF needed a major company to take a risk to locate there.
The answer would be General Electric. Mr. Singh had become the company's India representative after befriending Jack Welch, then the G.E. chairman. When Mr. Welch decided to outsource some business operations to India, he eventually opened a G.E. office inside a corporate park in Gurgaon in 1997.
"When G.E. came in," Mr. Singh said, "others followed."
With other Indian cities also competing for outsourcing business, DLF and other developers raced to capture the market with a helter-skelter building spree. Today, Gurgaon has 30 million square feet of commercial space, a tenfold increase from 2001, even surpassing the total in New Delhi.
"If the buildings were not there," Mr. Singh said of multinational companies, "they would have gone somewhere else."
Ordinarily, such a wild building boom would have had to hew to a local government master plan. But Gurgaon did not yet have such a plan, nor did it yet have a districtwide municipal government. Instead, Gurgaon was mostly under state control. Developers built the infrastructure inside their projects, while a state agency, the Haryana Urban Development Authority, or HUDA, was supposed to build the infrastructure binding together the city.
And that is where the problems arose. HUDA and other state agencies could not keep up with the pace of construction. The absence of a local government had helped Gurgaon become a leader of India's growth boom. But that absence had also created a dysfunctional city. No one was planning at a macro level; every developer pursued his own agenda as more islands sprouted and state agencies struggled to keep pace with growth.
"We have to keep up," said Nitin Kumar Yadav, the local HUDA administrator. "That is our pressure."
Gurgaon had been marketed as Millennium City, yet it had become an unmanageable city. For companies that had come to India in search of business efficiencies, the inefficiencies of Gurgaon presented a new challenge they would have to overcome on their own.
Self-Contained Islands
It is 8 p.m. on a recent Tuesday, time for the shift change at Genpact, a descendant of G.E. and one of Gurgaon's biggest outsourcing companies. Two long rows of white sport utility vehicles, vans and cars are waiting in the parking lot, yellow emergency lights flickering in the early darkness, as employees trickle out of call centers for their ride home. These contracted vehicles represent Genpact's private fleet, a necessity given the absence of a public transportation system in Gurgaon.
From computerized control rooms, Genpact employees manage 350 private drivers, who travel roughly 60,000 miles every day transporting 10,000 employees. Employees book daily online reservations and receive e-mail or text message "tickets" for their assigned car. In the parking lot, a large L.E.D. screen is posted with rolling lists of cars and their assigned passengers.
And the cars are only the beginning. Faced with regular power failures, Genpact has backup diesel generators capable of producing enough electricity to run the complex for five days (or enough electricity for about 2,000 Indian homes). It has a sewage treatment plant and a post office, which uses only private couriers, since the local postal service is understaffed and unreliable. It has a medical clinic, with a private ambulance, and more than 200 private security guards and five vehicles patrolling the region. It has A.T.M.'s, a cellphone kiosk, a cafeteria and a gym.
"It is a fully finished small city," said Naveen Puri, a Genpact administrator.
Actually, it is a private island, one of many inside Gurgaon. The city's residential compounds, especially the luxury developments along golf courses, exist as similarly self-contained entities. Nearly every major outsourcing company in the city depends on private infrastructure, as do the commercial towers filled with other companies.
"We pretty much carry the entire weight of what you would expect many states to do," said Pramod Bhasin, who this spring stepped down as Genpact's chief executive. "The problem -- a very big problem -- is our public services are always lagging a few years behind, but sometimes a decade behind. Our planning processes sometimes exist only on paper."
For many years, even Gurgaon's commercial centerpiece, Cyber City, was off the public grid. "They were not connected to any city service," said Jyoti Sagar, a lawyer and civic activist. "They were like a spaceship. You had these shiny buildings, and underneath you had a huge pit where everybody's waste was going."
Not all of the city's islands are affluent, either. Gurgaon has an estimated 200,000 migrant workers, the so-called floating population, who work on construction sites or as domestic help. Sheikh Hafizuddin, 38, lives in a slum with a few hundred other migrants less than two miles from Cyber City. No more than half the children in the slum attend school, with the rest spending their days playing on the hard-packed dirt of the settlement, where pigs wallow in an open pit of sewage and garbage. Mr. Hafizuddin pays $30 a month for a tiny room. His landlord runs a power line into the slum for electricity and draws water from a borehole on the property.
"Sometimes it works," Mr. Hafizuddin said. "Sometimes it doesn't work."
Even at the fringes of Gurgaon's affluent areas, large pools of black sewage water are easy to spot. The water supply is vastly inadequate, leaving private companies, developers and residents dependent on borewells that are draining the underground aquifer. Local activists say the water table is falling as much as 10 feet every year.
Meanwhile, with Gurgaon's understaffed police force outmatched by such a rapidly growing population, some law-and-order responsibilities have been delegated to the private sector. Nearly 12,000 private security guards work in Gurgaon, and many are pressed into directing traffic on major streets.
When an outsourcing employee was sexually assaulted after being dropped near her home in New Delhi, politicians placed the onus on the companies, even though the attack occurred on a New Delhi street. Outsourcing companies now must install GPS devices inside every private car and hire more security guards to escort female employees to their home at night.
The politicians "are basically telling me that the Delhi roads are my responsibility, which is not the case," said Vidya Srinivasan, who oversees logistics for Genpact.
Yet outsourcing is thriving in Gurgaon, anyway. Last year, a leading Indian industrial association determined that outsourcing was directly and indirectly responsible for about 500,000 jobs in Gurgaon. Companies still gravitate to Gurgaon because the city's commercial space is more modern, more abundant and far cheaper than that in New Delhi, while Gurgaon is also a magnet for India's best-educated, English-speaking young professionals, the essential raw material in the outsourcing business. And there is the benefit of a concentration of expertise: in the past decade, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Motorola, Ericsson, Nestle India and other foreign and Indian companies have opened offices in Gurgaon.
Still, Ms. Srinivasan said, the lack of government support is frustrating. She recently returned from a new Genpact operation in the port city of Dalian, China. There, she said, local officials "are doing everything to keep companies like ours." Asked if the government in Gurgaon was equally responsive, she shook her head.
"In India, it is not because of the government," she said, explaining how things get done. "It is in spite of the government."
Playing Catch-Up
Sudhir Rajpal, the wiry, mustachioed commissioner of the new Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon, has a long to-do list: fix the roads, the sewers, the electrical grid, the drainage, the lack of public buses, the lack of water and the lack of planning. The Municipal Corporation was formed in 2008, and Mr. Rajpal, having assumed the city's top administrative position a few months ago, has been conducting a listening tour to convince people that government can solve their problems.
It is not an easy sell.
One recent morning, his audience was a few dozen farmers in Badshahpur, one of the villages absorbed into the sprawling new territory of the Municipal Corporation. Most are actually former farmers, having sold their land to the developers constructing the office parks and apartment towers now ringing the village. Many of them had bought new cars or new plots of land or invested in the new developments. They were now richer. Their frustration was their village. It was becoming an urban slum.
"The drains are broken and accidents are happening," shouted one man. "Yet no one is answerable! There are problems and problems. Whatever water we get is dirty, but we have nowhere to complain."
When India's public and private sectors are compared, the contrast is usually stark: the private sector is praised for its efficiency, linear command structure and task-oriented ethos; the public sector is condemned for its opacity, lack of accountability and the fact that often no single agency seems in charge. Even as many Gurgaon residents hope that the Municipal Corporation can improve services, others worry that its authority is too limited, given that state agencies will maintain authority over licenses and infrastructure.
In Haryana, developers make campaign donations to politicians and exercise enormous power. Critics say graft and corruption are widespread. Many developers have disregarded promises to construct parks and other amenities. Meanwhile, state agencies like HUDA operate with little accountability. Civic leaders say more than $2 billion in infrastructure fees collected from Gurgaon have gone into HUDA's general budget without any benefit to the city.
"They used that money somewhere else," said Sanjeev Ahuja, a veteran journalist in Gurgaon. "The government thinks the private sector will take care of the city: 'People are rich. If they need water, they can buy water.' "
Some people hope Gurgaon's new municipal council, which was elected on May 13 to oversee the Municipal Corporation, will create a political voice for the city capable of forcing action. Eventually, the Municipal Corporation is expected to assume responsibility for providing services in all of Gurgaon, yet some residents are leery of the change.
Santosh Khosla, an information technology consultant whose family moved to Gurgaon in 1993, has services provided by his developer, DLF. He said DLF had broken numerous promises and did only an adequate job of delivering water and power. Still, adequate is tolerable.
"I'm certain that if it goes to the government," he said, "it will be worse."
Citizens Speak Up
Col. Ratan Singh, his military beret placed neatly atop his head, has arrived at a busy intersection in the midday sun for what he calls "an agitation." He is 82, an Indian Army veteran who has decided that private citizens need to incite a little conflict in Gurgaon. Demonstrations are common in Gurgaon, and he is leading a protest against shoddy work by a contractor.
"Every day some agitation is taking place," he said, shouting above the din of traffic. "People are not satisfied."
If people should be satisfied anywhere in India, Gurgaon should be the place. Average incomes rank among the highest in the country. Property values have jumped sharply since the 1990s. Gurgaon's malls offer many of the country's best shops and restaurants, while the city's most exclusive housing enclaves are among the finest in India.
Yet the economic power that growth has delivered to Gurgaon has not been matched by political power. The celebrated middle class created by India's boom has far less clout at the ballot box than the hundreds of millions of rural peasants struggling to live on $2 a day, given the far larger rural vote, and thus are courted far less by Indian politicians. This has made it harder to accrue the political power needed to correct Gurgaon's problems. When middle-class civic groups in Gurgaon pushed state leaders to create a single government authority overseeing the city, they were flicked away.
Faced with so many urban headaches, though, civic activists like Colonel Singh are pushing the government for change, or simply making change on their own. Colonel Singh leads an umbrella group of residents' associations that have started volunteer vigilance groups as watchdogs against crime.
Another civic activist, Latika Thukral, a former Citigroup employee, is involved in creating a biodiversity park. Ms. Thukral led efforts to clean up an illegal garbage dump and is organizing a campaign to plant a million trees this summer.
"If people like us don't stand up for our rights, our country will not change," she said. "The tipping point has come in India."
Across India, Gurgaon is both a model and a cautionary tale. Other cities want to emulate Gurgaon's growth and dynamism but avoid the dysfunction and lack of planning. Meanwhile, Gurgaon is trying to address its infrastructure woes; last year, the city was connected to the New Delhi rapid transit system, while a public-private project is under way to construct a link to Cyber City. Yet the state and local governments are still struggling to keep up, especially since Gurgaon is already building a industrial district and planning to create more commercial space.
"If Gurgaon had not happened, the rest of India's development would not have happened, either," contended Mr. Singh, the chairman of DLF. "Gurgaon became a pacesetter."

Full text: WASHINGTON
Germany has been a frequent cudgel in recent fights over the American economy. When Germany has grown faster than the United States, stimulus skeptics like to point across the Atlantic Ocean and say that austerity works. When it has grown more slowly, people who think the American stimulus made a big difference -- including me -- return the favor.
But the full story is more interesting than any caricature. In the last decade, Germany has succeeded in some important ways that the United States has not. The lessons aren't simply liberal or conservative. They are both.
With our economy weakening once again -- and with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany visiting the White House this week -- now seems to be a good time to take a closer look.
The brief story is that, despite its reputation for austerity, Germany has been far more willing than the United States to use the power of government to help its economy. Yet it has also been more ruthless about cutting wasteful parts of government.
The results are intriguing. After performing worse than the American economy for years, the Germany economy has grown faster since the middle of last decade. (It did better than our economy before the crisis and has endured the crisis about equally). Just as important, most Germans have fared much better than most Americans, because the bounty of their growth has not been concentrated among a small slice of the affluent.
Inflation-adjusted average hourly pay has risen almost 30 percent since 1985 in Germany, the kind of gains American workers have not enjoyed since the '50s and '60s. In this country, hourly pay has risen a scant 6 percent since 1985.
Germany also managed to avoid a housing bubble, unlike the United States, Britain, Ireland, Spain and other countries. German children have stronger math and science skills than ours. Its medium-term budget deficit is smaller. Its unemployment rate is like a mirror image of ours: 6.1 percent, well below where it was when the financial crisis began in 2007. Our rate has risen to 9.1 percent.
I'm not saying that the United States should want to become Germany. Americans remain considerably richer. We have the innovative companies -- Wal-Mart, Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter -- that make other countries swoon. We remain the world's immigration Mecca.
Yet for all the strengths of the United States, almost nobody claims that the economy is in especially good shape. It so happens that our current out-of-town guests could teach us a few things.

The first lesson is that it's really possible to make government more efficient. Like much of Western Europe, Germany long had a unemployment benefits system that discouraged work. But almost a decade ago, it began to make some changes.
It cut many benefits, in both duration and level, and it reduced the incentives to retire early. It also began trying to move the long-term unemployed into the labor force.
Specifically, the government took a fresh look at people who had not worked in years to determine who could and couldn't work. The able and healthy were matched with potential employers. If they took a low-paying job, which was often the case, they would still receive a small portion of their benefits for a time. If they refused to work, their benefits were reduced anyway.
"The incentives to take up work were strengthened," says Felix Hufner of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, "and also the sanctions were strengthened." Sure enough, the reforms have nudged more people back into the labor force -- and work tends to beget more work, as people develop skills and have more money to spend.
In the United States, short-term jobless benefits are not generous enough to be a major problem. But the Social Security disability program, which is one reason nearly 20 percent of working-age American men are not working, would benefit from some German-like reforms. So would those public sector pensions that encourage people to retire at 55 or 60.
Beyond the job market, Germany has also made a big effort to improve its education system. Eric Hanushek, a Stanford University economist, notes that Germany's performance on the main international math, reading and science tests have become such a matter of national concern that the name of the tests -- Pisa -- is now a household word. "In the U.S.," he says, "Pisa is still a bell tower in Italy."
The math scores of German students have risen significantly since 2000, extending their existing lead over American students. Germany's national average is now higher than the average in Massachusetts, this country's top-performing state. And there is obviously a connection between strong technical skills and a strong manufacturing sector.
But the German story is not merely about making government more efficient. It's also about understanding the unique role that government must play in a market economy.
That role starts with serious regulation. American regulators stood idle as the housing bubble inflated. German banks often required a down payment of 40 percent.
Unlike what happened here, German laws and regulators have also prevented the decimation of their labor unions. The clout of German unions, at individual companies and in the political system, is one reason the middle class there has fared decently in recent decades. In fact, middle-class pay has risen at roughly the same rate as top incomes.
The top 1 percent of German households earns about 11 percent of all income, virtually unchanged relative to 1970, according to recent estimates. In the United States, the top 1 percent makes more than 20 percent of all income, up from 9 percent in 1970. That's right: only 40 years ago, Germany was more unequal than this country.
Finally, there are taxes. Germany does not have a smaller budget deficit because it spends less. Germany, you'll recall, is the original welfare state. It has a smaller deficit because it is more willing to match the benefits it wants with the needed taxes. The current deficit-reduction plan includes about 60 percent spending cuts and 40 percent tax increases, Mr. Hufner says. It's like trying to lose weight by both eating less and exercising more.
As I suggested before, the American economy's strengths may still be greater than the German economy's. But Germany sure does seem more serious about dealing with its weaknesses.
And us? Well, lobbyists for the mortgage bankers and the N.A.A.C.P. have recently started pushing for less stringent standards for down payments. Wall Street is trying to water down other financial regulation, too.
Some Democrats say Social Security and Medicare must remain unchanged. Most Republicans refuse to consider returning tax rates even to their 1990s levels. Republican leaders also want to make deep cuts in the sort of antipoverty programs that have helped Germany withstand the recession even in the absence of big new stimulus legislation.
There is no getting around the fact that financial crises wreak terrible damage. It's too late for us to prevent that damage, and it will take a long time to recover fully. It is not too late to learn from our mistakes.

Abstract: "Over all, the economic recovery appears to be continuing at a moderate pace, albeit at a rate that is both uneven across sectors and frustratingly slow from the perspective of millions of unemployed and underemployed workers," Mr. Bernanke told the International Monetary Conference, a gathering of bank executives.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The leaders of the Federal Reserve are talking like people ready to sit down and let others take the lead in addressing the nation's economic problems.
"Monetary policy cannot be a panacea," the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told an audience of bankers Tuesday in Atlanta.
He said that growth remained slow and uneven, but he made no mention of the possibility that the Fed would intervene, noting instead that "a healthy economic future" required a plan to shrink the federal deficit.
William C. Dudley, one of Mr. Bernanke's top lieutenants, expanded on the same theme Tuesday night, saying that the government needed to balance its books, and that the nation needed to reduce its dependence on borrowing and consumption.
"These are fundamentally structural issues -- not cyclical issues; they cannot be tackled primarily through monetary policy," Mr. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech at a Midtown Manhattan hotel. "Instead, monetary policy is mainly a tool for stabilizing the macroeconomy and keeping inflation expectations well anchored."
Both men emphasized that the Fed had played an important role in helping the economy to recover. And both defended the need for continuation of a series of extraordinary policies meant to encourage growth, including holding interest rates to near zero and maintaining a large portfolio of investments. But the speeches, together with remarks by other Fed officials, signaled that additional interventions were, for now, very unlikely.
The Fed will conclude the planned purchase of $600 billion in Treasury securities at the end of June.
Investors ready to celebrate any sign the Fed might pump more money into the economy sold equities as Mr. Bernanke spoke. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended down slightly after climbing almost 2 percent earlier in the day.
Mr. Benanke's speech followed related remarks by President Obama, who told reporters Tuesday that he was worried about the rate of growth, but saw no possibility of another recession.
"I am concerned about the fact that the recovery that we're on is not producing jobs as fast as I want it to happen," Mr. Obama said. The economy has moved in recent months like a car in heavy traffic, gaining and then slowing, faster again and then suddenly hitting the brakes.
Despite those fluctuations, Mr. Bernanke said Tuesday that he remained confident that the pace of growth was likely to increase during the second half of the year.
He also said that he continued to see no evidence of broad and enduring inflation despite increases earlier this year in the prices of oil and other commodities.
"Over all, the economic recovery appears to be continuing at a moderate pace, albeit at a rate that is both uneven across sectors and frustratingly slow from the perspective of millions of unemployed and underemployed workers," Mr. Bernanke told the International Monetary Conference, a gathering of bank executives.
Mr. Bernanke made clear that recent data had shaken his confidence in the strength of the recovery, which continues to depend on extensive federal support. Mr. Bernanke has said he wants to see evidence of strong and sustained hiring by private firms before deciding that the economy can withstand the loss of that support. On Tuesday, he said that "until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established."
The economy has expanded much more slowly this year than the Fed had predicted. Last month private employers added only 83,000 jobs, reducing the average so far this year to about 180,000 jobs a month -- barely enough to cut into the numbers of the jobless.
Mr. Bernanke noted that after two years of economic recovery, the net decline in one important measure, aggregate hours worked, remained greater than the peak decline in the same measure during the deep recession in 1981-82.
The Fed has invested more than $2 trillion in a range of unprecedented programs, first to restore the financial system and then to encourage economic expansion. Mr. Bernanke has argued that the policies achieved worthwhile but limited objectives. Internal and external critics, however, describe the results as lackluster and warn that the policies could make it more difficult for the Fed to control inflation.
Those critics have taken a toll. So has internal debate about the efficacy of additional stimulus, which already seems to be yielding diminishing returns. So the Fed's focus has turned to advocating for broader solutions to broader problems.
"Policy makers urgently need to put the federal governments' finances on a sustainable trajectory," Mr. Bernanke said. Such a plan should not impose large spending cuts immediately, he cautioned, but it could produce immediate benefits "by leading to lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence."

Full text: Lexington, Mass.
LAST October, I won the Nobel Prize in economics for my work on unemployment and the labor market. But I am unqualified to serve on the board of the Federal Reserve -- at least according to the Republican senators who have blocked my nomination. How can this be?
The easy answer is to point to shortcomings in our confirmation process and to partisan polarization in Washington. The more troubling answer, though, points to a fundamental misunderstanding: a failure to recognize that analysis of unemployment is crucial to conducting monetary policy.
In April 2010, President Obama nominated me to be one of the seven governors of the Fed. He renominated me in September, and again in January, after Senate Republicans blocked a floor vote on my confirmation. When the Senate Banking Committee took up my nomination in July and again in November, three Republican senators voted for me each time. But the third time around, the Republicans on the committee voted in lockstep against my appointment, making it extremely unlikely that the opposition to a full Senate vote can be overcome. It is time for me to withdraw, as I plan to inform the White House.
The leading opponent to my appointment, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee, has questioned the relevance of my expertise. "Does Dr. Diamond have any experience in conducting monetary policy? No," he said in March. "His academic work has been on pensions and labor market theory."
But understanding the labor market -- and the process by which workers and jobs come together and separate -- is critical to devising an effective monetary policy. The financial crisis has led to continuing high unemployment. The Fed has to properly assess the nature of that unemployment to be able to lower it as much as possible while avoiding inflation. If much of the unemployment is related to the business cycle -- caused by a lack of adequate demand -- the Fed can act to reduce it without touching off inflation. If instead the unemployment is primarily structural -- caused by mismatches between the skills that companies need and the skills that workers have -- aggressive Fed action to reduce it could be misguided.
In my Nobel acceptance speech in December, I discussed in detail the patterns of hiring in the American economy, and concluded that structural unemployment and issues of mismatch were not important in the slow recovery we have been experiencing, and thus not a reason to stop an accommodative monetary policy -- a policy of keeping short-term interest rates exceptionally low and buying Treasury securities to keep long-term rates down. Analysis of the labor market is in fact central to monetary policy.
Senator Shelby also questioned my qualifications, asking: "Does Dr. Diamond have any experience in crisis management? No." In addition to setting monetary policy in light of a proper understanding of unemployment, the Fed is responsible for avoiding banking crises, not just trying to mop up afterward.
Among the issues being debated now is how much we should increase capital requirements for banks. Selecting the proper size of the increase requires a balance between reducing the risk of a future crisis and ensuring the effective functioning of financial firms in ordinary times. My experience analyzing the properties of capital markets and how economic risks are and should be shared is directly relevant for designing policies to reduce the risk of future banking crises.
Instead of going to the Fed, however, I will go about my congenial professional existence as a professor at M.I.T., where I have taught and researched since 1966, and I will take advantage of some of the many opportunities that come to a Nobel laureate. So don't worry about me.
But we should all worry about how distorted the confirmation process has become, and how little understanding of monetary policy there is among some of those responsible for its Congressional oversight. We need to preserve the independence of the Fed from efforts to politicize monetary policy and to limit the Fed's ability to regulate financial firms.
Concern about the (seemingly low) current risk of future inflation should not erase concern about the large costs of continuing high unemployment. Concern about the distant risk of a genuine inability to handle our national debt should not erase concern about the risk to the economy from too much short-run fiscal tightening.
To the public, the Washington debate is often about more versus less -- in both spending and regulation. There is too little public awareness of the real consequences of some of these decisions. In reality, we need more spending on some programs and less spending on others, and we need more good regulations and fewer bad ones.
Analytical expertise is needed to accomplish this, to make government more effective and efficient. Skilled analytical thinking should not be drowned out by mistaken, ideologically driven views that more is always better or less is always better. I had hoped to bring some of my own expertise and experience to the Fed. Now I hope someone else can.

Full text: Pandora Media is distinctly Web 2.0. Its Music Genome Project tailors Internet radio stations to individual tastes. Pandora is using that digital DNA to capitalize on investor demand for hot technology plays, with an initial public offering that could value the company at $1.4 billion. But investors should be going in with their eyes, and not just their ears, wide open. Pandora's business model is pretty old school.
It might look like a rival to Sirius XM, the satellite radio monopoly. But Pandora's primary competition is in the analog dashboard of terrestrial radio. Pandora generated almost 90 percent of its $138 million of revenue in the year through Jan. 31 from advertising. Sirius's coin comes from 20 million paying subscribers.
Pandora also does not have the financial scalability of a Facebook or the network-effect stickiness of an OpenTable, the online reservations system. The more people who listen, the more royalties the company pays for music. Total operating expenses move up nearly in lockstep with sales.
The company is growing in popularity. Registered users have quadrupled to 94 million in two years. Advertisers cannot help noticing. By 2014, some $17 billion will be spent on American radio spots, the market research firm IDC forecasts. Snatching a mere 3 percent of that would nearly quintuple Pandora's existing revenue.
But that might not be so easy. Though AM/FM radio's popularity is waning, listeners still tune in for more than two hours a day, according to Bridge Ratings. By contrast, based on Pandora's figures, its users log in on average for considerably less time. That could take some shine off Pandora's ability to aim ads more precisely.
It also means that despite Pandora's impressive growth, its valuation looks exuberant. Sirius trades on an enterprise value of about 3.8 times estimated 2011 revenue, according to Thomson One Analytics. The terrestrial operator Cumulus bought a rival, Citadel, earlier this year for about 3.2 times revenue. If you split the difference and generously assume Pandora's top line doubles again this year, the company would be worth less than the low end of its I.P.O. price range. And that still overlooks the lack of any profit after six years.
Bullish on Japan
Bond traders have been betting against Japanese government bonds for years -- and losing spectacularly. Victims of the so-called widow-maker trade of shorting the bonds thought the March disaster would vindicate them. Rebuilding will add to Japan's sky-high debt and, with a shrinking work force and rising pension costs, push up yields. But the quake has not disrupted the self-perpetuating money machine that drives the bonds. Doomsayers still run the risk of becoming road kill.
The bonds have outperformed United States and German bonds over the last five years, returning over 55 percent in dollar terms, according to Merrill Lynch, despite yielding less than 2 percent. Much of that is a function of the yen's appreciation against the dollar. But short-sellers have also been flummoxed by the surprising way that a government with debt twice the size of its economy has managed not just to avoid a Greek-style blowout, but also to borrow more cheaply every year.
All but 5 percent of Japanese government bonds are held by Japanese, not foreigners demanding attractive yields. Japanese who balked at low yields and invested elsewhere have been punished. At home, stocks have halved since 2005 and the yen's climb has sapped gains offshore.
Japan's pension funds and insurers accumulate long-term bonds to match their liabilities. Banks are the largest buyers by far, a fact unlikely to change unless the economy revs up. With growth anemic and prices falling, companies are paying off loans and socking cash into bank accounts rather than investing it. With worthy borrowers scarce, banks park these deposits in government debt.
Even if Japan's economy does miraculously revive, inflation and growth would offset higher borrowing costs by increasing tax revenue. The real concern, then, is whether demographics might derail the Japanese bond engine. As the work force shrinks and the ranks of retirees grow, pension funds might need to sell their holdings. The government's funding needs would then rise as income taxes decline.
Even without fiscal reforms, though, Japan is not likely to reach this tipping point for at least five years, sufficient time to get its fiscal house in order and avert a crisis. True, Japan's politicians demonstrate a paucity of leadership to tackle these problems. But that is still enough of a window to make a few more widows out of those betting against Japanese government debt.

Full text: THE NEWS The Chinese economy showed signs of slowing after two years of torrid growth, as manufacturers' backlogs shortened and auto sales unexpectedly stalled.
BEHIND THE NEWS Beijing, worried about inflation, has been tapping the monetary-policy brakes in recent months, so a little slowdown could be seen as a good thing. But any loss of momentum in the world economy poses a danger to Europe and the United States, where jobs, not prices, are the main concern. Some analysts say China may not be able to resume such rapid growth once inflation is tamed.
THE NEWS Housing prices in the United States have slumped to new post-bubble lows, down by one-third from the 2006 peak, according to the widely followed Case-Shiller Home Price Index.
BEHIND THE NEWS Though the figures (for March, the latest available) prompted little optimism for the near future, analysts said they thought housing was near a bottom and could turn up again soon. Even with a huge number of unsold houses (new and foreclosed) in some areas, analysts said there remained a great deal of pent-up demand, held back mainly by tightened credit.
THE NEWS A new financial rescue package for Greece took shape, offering up to 60 billion euros ($86 billion) in new loans in exchange for steps to speed up privatization and tax collection.
BEHIND THE NEWS Greece's fellow euro countries are eager to prevent a default that would undermine other shaky member nations like Ireland and Portugal. The deal would turn on private holders of Greek debts agreeing to roll them over -- and forestall a restructuring that would force losses on them. The deal would also depend on greater government austerity in an economy already contracting from earlier cuts.
THE NEWS The pace of job growth in the American economy slowed to a crawl in May, with just 54,000 nonfarm jobs added, far too few even to keep up with population growth. The unemployment rate ticked up to 9.1 percent.
BEHIND THE NEWS Some of the falloff was traceable to transient factors like bad weather and higher fuel prices, but economists said it also resulted from the waning of federal stimulus programs and the political push for austerity at all levels of government. "The economy clearly just hit a brick wall," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics.
THE NEWS After rallying briskly on Tuesday following the holiday weekend, the major stock indexes retreated sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 2.3 percent of its value for the week.
BEHIND THE NEWS Investors were initially cheered by the hopeful signs from Europe and took the housing report in stride. But their mood was soured by the gathering gloom on the employment front and the political deadlock in Washington over fiscal policy, with a dire warning from Moody's that the nation's credit rating would be cut if a debt-limit deal is not struck soon.

Full text: THE first security I was ever aware of was a dividend-paying stock, the AT&T shares that my grandfather, a retired postman, owned when I was little. Those shares along with some other dividend-paying stocks formed the foundation of his nest egg. By reinvesting his dividends, he was able to amass sizable savings for someone who probably never earned more than $20,000 a year.
So when I heard recently that some advisers were using dividend-paying stocks to coax people who still hold their money in cash or low-yielding bonds back into the equity markets, my ears perked up.
After all, dividend-paying stocks were largely ignored in the high-growth years for much of the past two decades. Companies that pay dividends, like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Caterpillar and Johnson & Johnson, are established corporations with none of the go-go appeal of a technology start-up.
On the other hand, the people running those start-ups often had (and still do have) a good portion of their compensation tied up in stock options. And those options become more attractive the higher the stock price goes, making growth much more important than returning any capital to investors through dividends.
And until President George W. Bush's tax changes in 2003, dividends were taxed at ordinary income tax rates, not the lower capital gains rate.
"The way the tax code was written, it made companies go for capital gains over dividends," said Jason Trennert, managing director at Strategas Research Partners. "It made people make imprudent decisions. Dividends remind executives four times a year that it's not their company."
Mr. Trennert said that many clients of Strategas, which has headquarters in New York, are reporting increased interest in dividend-paying stocks. That could produce a chicken and egg situation of companies increasing or initiating dividends if investors are asking for them. The advisers and analysts I spoke to who favored dividend-paying stocks as a crucial part of anyone's portfolio were divided into two camps.
The first offered more sentimental reasons. Kenneth Kamen, president of Mercadien Asset Management in Hamilton, N.J., said he had a relative in his 80s who has held a handful of dividend-paying stocks since the 1970s. Until recently, he reinvested the dividends to buy more shares. But with the stocks now worth more than $1 million and with the average dividend yield of 4.5 percent, the relative stopped reinvesting the dividends and now receives $61,000 a year in income.
Mr. Kamen said his relative's rationale back in the 1970s is still sound: if the company paid a dividend, it was probably sound. "He said, 'We didn't have access to all this information,' " Mr. Kamen said. "Dividend-paying stocks represented an interesting form of research for him. You can't fake cash."
The second group considers these stocks to be a counterweight to portfolios excessively weighted toward supersafe investments, since the performance of those investments is going to lag over time.
Catherine Avery, who runs an investment advisory company under her name in New Canaan, Conn., said she is telling her clients that 54 percent of the returns in stocks since 1928 have come from dividends. Ms. Avery also notes that companies like Johnson & Johnson and Emerson Electric have maintained unbroken streaks of increasing their dividends -- 49 years in the case of Johnson & Johnson and 53 years for Emerson.
She said she has been making these points to encourage clients who have resisted investing in equities since the recession to buy stocks again. "They missed two big years in the markets," she said. "Now we're reaching out to people and telling them this is your dead last chance to get back into the market at attractive valuations."
The reality, though, is most people own dividend-paying stocks even if they don't think of them in those terms. At the end of 2010, 373 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index paid dividends. That is nearly 75 percent of the companies in the index that most investors track.
What follows is a more detailed assessment of the pros and cons of owning dividend-paying stocks.
THE UPSIDES All things being equal, dividend-paying stocks have several advantages.
Devotees like to point to their stability over the long term. Haverford Trust, which manages $6.5 billion, has all $3.5 billion of its equity allocation in dividend-paying stocks, said Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford, in Radnor, Pa.
If a client 30 years ago had put a $1,000 each into Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble and reinvested the dividends, the firm calculates that that $3,000 would be worth $223,982 today. But over that same period, $3,000 invested in the S.& P. 500 would now be worth $64,668, and that money in 30-year Treasury bonds would have grown to $89,399, according to S.& P. indexes.
These exercises are always eye-opening but selective. Enron, WorldCom and Lehman Brothers also paid dividends to shareholders, who have long since seen the value of their holdings go to zero.
Mr. Smith argued that for passive, long-term investors, which many people are, dividend-paying stocks offer more comfort. "If you're buying a stock for its dividend yield, why should you care about the day-to-day fluctuation of the stock price as long as it's paying its dividend?" he said. "Do bond investors worry about fluctuation day to day?"
While these stocks are going to lag behind any big rally, they are also going to fall more slowly. "During the bear market, in 2008, when the S.& P. was off 37 percent, we were off 25 percent," Mr. Smith said.
These stocks also offer at least some sort of hedge against inflation. A typical high-quality corporate bond is going to pay the same yield today as it will in 10 years. That could be a problem if the rate of inflation increases since that would effectively erode the value of the fixed coupon.
With dividend-paying stocks, companies could raise prices and then increase the dividends to keep pace with inflation. "Dividends play a hybrid role that they didn't in the past," Mr. Kamen said. "You don't get that in bonds."
The tradeoff is a stock's price could swing widely, whereas a high-quality bond would stay the course.
DOWNSIDES The two big risks come from how quickly the economy grows -- and thus how much cash companies have to pay dividends -- and what policy makers do with taxes.
When the extension to the Bush tax codes expires in 2012, dividends could again be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. This is how they were taxed for much for the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s.
"It's a concern of ours," Ms. Avery said. But, she added, "we believe there is enough cash sitting on corporate balance sheets that they do have the ability to increase those dividends to make the end product more attractive to investors."
There is third, short-term concern. Right now, low interest rates make dividends attractive. As interest rates rise, which they will eventually, dividend-paying stocks become less attractive because their yields are unlikely to keep pace with the yields from high-quality corporate debt.
Jeremy Zirin, chief United States equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management, which has headquarters in New York, said one way to measure this is to look at the relationship between average dividend yield and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. Right now, the dividend yield is about 2 percent while the 10-year Treasury is paying 3.5 percent.
This means these dividends are about 65 percent of the yield of Treasuries. Historically, when that ratio dips below 50 percent, dividend-paying stocks become less attractive. "We have a ways to go," Mr. Zirin said.
But of course, Mr. Kamen's relative would say that a decrease in the price of a dividend-paying stock is not all bad: it means the reinvestment plan buys more shares. That was exactly what my grandfather did.

Jobless Rate Not Enough To Predict Election Result

Abstract: Some models, however, claim to have much more predictive power than this, using economic variables (sometimes along with noneconomic variables) to explain as much as 90 percent of presidential election results. (The latter definition would apply to wars like Iraq or Vietnam -- but not to something like the Gulf War or World War II where the U.S. was responding to another country's attack.) Mr. Hibbs, using data from 1952 through 2008, claims to be able to explain almost 90 percent of the variance in presidential election results based on these variables alone, missing the results by just a point or two on average:

Full text: Yesterday's column on the weak historical relationship between the unemployment rate and presidential performance generated a mostly favorable reaction. But I also got a few replies wondering how to reconcile these findings against the claims, made with some frequency by political scientists, that presidential elections can be forecast with pinpoint accuracy provided that you know the economic fundamentals.
Might it be that the unemployment rate is the "wrong" variable? It has a couple of flaws. It tends to be more a lagging than a leading indicator. It affects a relatively small number of voters (although underemployment is another matter). There is ample room to critique the way that it is calculated, such as by excluding "discouraged workers" from the calculation, and it's subject to reasonably large measurement errors.
Apart from the unemployment rate, the economic measures that we hear about most frequently are probably gross domestic product (G.D.P.) growth and inflation. Do either of these do a better job of forecasting elections?
Yes, but they still don't do terribly well.
Here's the comparison over the past 100 years of real (inflation-adjusted), per-capita G.D.P. growth over the course of the president's term to performance of the incumbent party:
G.D.P. growth explains about 12 percent of election results. That's something -- but it still leaves 88 percent unexplained. If this was as well as we could do, the slogan "it's the economy, stupid" might have to be revised to "sure, you'd rather have a better economy than a weaker one; it probably makes some difference at the margin" -- which doesn't make for a very good bumper sticker.
Roughly the same is true of the inflation rate:
However, this one is a little tricky because both high inflation and deflation have deleterious effects on the consumer. A quadratic curve does somewhat better than a straight-line estimate: low (but positive) inflation helps the incumbent president, while either deflation or high inflation hurt.
You can do a bit better still if you combine these measures. One relatively elegant method is to subtract the inflation rate from the per-capita G.D.P. growth rate. This explains about 43 percent of the variance in election results:
So we can breathe a sigh of relief. The economic fundamentals clearly do make some difference -- quite a bit really.
But we shouldn't expect any miracles. This cute little model would have called the wrong winner in six of the past 25 elections: 1912, 1948, 1952, 1960, 1968, and 2000 (although it would have gotten the winner of the popular vote right in that year). And it would have missed the margin in the popular vote by about 8 points on average, or roughly 4 points for each of the two major candidates (since a vote for one of them means a vote against the other).
This seems like a healthy state of affairs. Simple economic variables can account for a little less than half of the variability in election results. The other half falls into the "everything else" category, including factors such as foreign policy successes and failures, major scandals, incumbency, candidate quality, controversial social legislation and structural factors like changes in partisanship. Technically speaking, some of the variability may also be explained by economic factors that weigh upon voters' minds, but which are not easily quantified by measures like G.D.P. and inflation.
Nevertheless, the heuristic "it's half the economy and half everything else, stupid" is a pretty good way to think about presidential elections.
Some models, however, claim to have much more predictive power than this, using economic variables (sometimes along with noneconomic variables) to explain as much as 90 percent of presidential election results. You should be very skeptical of these claims.
Perhaps the best-known of these models is the so-called "Bread and Peace" model designed by Douglas Hibbs of the University of Gothenberg. There are a lot of things to admire about this model. Most notably, it's not larded down with superfluous variables. Instead, it is based on just two: growth in real, per-capita disposable income (weighted to place more emphasis on the later years of a president's term than the earlier ones), and the number of military fatalities resulting from U.S.-initiated foreign conflicts. (The latter definition would apply to wars like Iraq or Vietnam -- but not to something like the Gulf War or World War II where the U.S. was responding to another country's attack.)
Mr. Hibbs, using data from 1952 through 2008, claims to be able to explain almost 90 percent of the variance in presidential election results based on these variables alone, missing the results by just a point or two on average:
There are a couple of common critiques of this model. One is that the way it defines wars is a bit problematic. For instance, because the Korean War resulted in 14 times more U.S. fatalities than the Iraq War, it had about 14 times more effect on Mr. Hibbs's model. Perhaps that's a defensible position -- U.S. soldiers being killed in action is a very noticeable impact for the public -- but by other measures we might have expected Iraq to have a larger impact: it was more unpopular than the Korean War, and it was quite a bit more expensive.
Nevertheless, the proof is the model's predictive power. Mr. Hibbs first released forecasts using this model in 1992, and since then it has performed acceptably well but not superbly, with fairly big misses in 1996 and 2000 but good results in the other years, including 2008.
Still, there are some signs that the model is not quite as accurate as claimed. Using these two variables to forecast the results of the elections of 1952 through 1988 -- the dataset that Mr. Hibbs originally had to work with -- would have missed the incumbent party's vote share by just 0.8 percentage points, on average. Since then, on the out-of-sample results, the average miss has been 2.6 percentage points.
We can, of course, wait to see how this model does in 2012, 2016, 2020 and so forth to get a better sense for how accurate it really is. But I don't have that much patience! So here's what we can do instead -- it's a technique that I've applied to other models of this type. We can plug in the data from elections prior to 1952, which were outside the period that the model to build its estimates. How would the model have performed in 1948, for example?
I dug deep into the bowels of the Census Bureau's Web site and discovered data on disposable income growth dating back to the 1920s. (The data is annual rather than quarterly, but this is easy to adjust for and should make only an extremely minor difference.) The other variable that Mr. Hibbs uses -- military casualties -- isn't pertinent to these years because the only major conflict that the U.S. fought in during this period was World War II, a "good" war in which the United States was compelled into action because of Axis hostilities and that therefore would not meet Mr. Hibbs's definition.
Here, again, is how the model performed from 1952 through 2008:
Now, let's plug in 1948:
Uh-oh. The model did really, really badly in 1948. Disposable income growth was actually negative in the four years preceding 1948, according to Mr. Hibbs's formula. It would have predicted, therefore, just a 43 percent share of the two-party vote (that is, excluding votes for third parties) for Harry Truman. Instead, Truman got 52 percent of the two-party vote and won the election over Thomas Dewey, much to the Chicago Tribune's surprise.
But 1948 was a weird year -- lots of erratic economic data in the postwar period. How would the model have performed in 1944?
Another bad year for the model. Income growth was prodigious in these years, and the model would have expected Franklin Roosevelt to win a landslide victory, getting 66 percent of the two-party vote. Roosevelt booked a solid win, but his actual total of 54 percent of the two-party vote is not particularly close to the model's estimate. This election occurred during World War II; perhaps Mr. Hibbs' distinction between good and bad wars is less salient to the American public than we might think. But this is a poor result.
The 1940 election occurred before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the model performed better in that year, missing Roosevelt's vote share by 4 points.
But 1936 constituted another big problem. Disposable income growth between 1932 and 1936 was an astounding 8.5 percent. That should have translated, according to the formula, to Roosevelt receiving 77 percent of the two-party vote. Roosevelt performed really, really well in 1936, winning all but two states, but he won only 62 percent of the vote rather than 77 percent.
A similar problem is apparent in 1932. Herbert Hoover presided over the biggest economic disaster in United States history, with per capita income growth declining by 8.4 percent. Mr. Hibbs's formula would have called for him to win just 16 percent of the major-party vote. Hoover did, in fact, lose in a landslide, but things weren't quite that bad.
1928, a seemingly normal year (no depressions, no wars), was another bad one for the model. Although some other economic measures were decent or good, disposable income growth was slow enough that the model would have predicted that Hoover would receive 47 percent of the vote and lose the election. Instead, he won in a landslide, defeating the Democratic candidate, Al Smith.
If it's any consolation, the model would have performed quite well in 1924.
Overall, however, the model performs quite poorly on out-of-sample results. In the years from 1924 through 1948, and from 1992 through 2008, it would have missed the incumbent party's vote share by an average of 7.8 points, and a median of 4.7 points. By contrast, a naive strategy of simply guessing that the incumbent party would win exactly half the vote would have done better, missing by an average of 5.8 points and a median of 4.3 points.
If we redo the model using all the data from 1924 through 2008, it explains about 60 percent -- not 90 percent -- of the variance in the presidential vote. Importantly, the coefficient on the growth variable is also quite a bit lower, meaning that the electorate is somewhat less sensitive to economic performance. Each percentage point rise in income growth translates to a 1.5 percentage point rise in the incumbent party's vote share, rather than 3.6 percent as the original model implied.
And if we remove the war causalities variable and just focus on what the model tells us about the economy, it explains almost exactly half the vote. That's good, but not much better than our simple G.D.P.-and-inflation model.
To be clear, I think Mr. Hibbs's model is the best of its kind. But there's nothing magical about it, and the fact that it performed so uncannily well from 1952 through 1988 is not a good reflection of its predictive power. Core economic variables explain about half of the presidential vote -- the rest is up to the candidates and the voters.
At the risk of beating a dead horse, let me reiterate that this is a result that I find intuitively appealing.
I'd be worried if, as our study of the unemployment rate seemed to imply, the economy had no effect on election results at all; that clearly seems wrong given the effect it has upon people's lives and the media's (appropriate) attention to it.
But I'd be just as worried if one or two economic variables explained 90 percent of the results. Wars matter, above and beyond what can be measured with a single variable based on military causalities. Watergate mattered. September 11 mattered. Monica Lewinsky mattered. The fact that parties have nominated candidates as strong as Dwight Eisenhower and as weak as George McGovern -- that matters. It matters that the electorate goes through phases of being relatively more and relatively less partisan.
In 2012, things like President Obama's unpopular health care bill, the Republicans' unpopular Medicare bill, and the death of Osama bin Laden are likely to matter. So will the economy (those numbers are getting worse for Mr. Obama).
But the results are not quite baked in, as some would have you believe. Until we reach the point where the polls become more reliable -- the nice thing about polls is that they permit voters to determine for themselves what matters to them, rather than having preferences inferred by a statistical formula -- my advice is to look at more rather than fewer pieces of evidence.
Look at a broad range of economic variables -- maybe you should pay a little bit more attention to disposable income growth, and a little bit less to unemployment -- but look at all of the major ones. Look at Mr. Obama's approval ratings -- we're just now getting to the point where they can start to have a tiny bit of predictive power. Look at the number of people who say the country is on the right track or the wrong track. Don't dismiss the importance of factors like the health care bill and the death of Bin Laden just because their impact is harder to quantify. Furthermore, consider the potential impact of "black swan" types of events: everything from a debt default to a Tea Party candidate running as an independent.
It's much too soon to reduce the election down to a four-word catch phrase, or to a two-variable formula. It's the economy, stupid. And everything else too.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published a blog post about the "mistake of 1937," the premature fiscal and monetary pullback that aborted an ongoing economic recovery and prolonged the Great Depression. As Gauti Eggertsson, the post's author (with whom I have done research) points out, economic conditions today -- with output growing, some prices rising, but unemployment still very high -- bear a strong resemblance to those in 1936-37. So are modern policy makers going to make the same mistake?
Mr. Eggertsson says no, that economists now know better. But I disagree. In fact, in important ways we have already repeated the mistake of 1937. Call it the mistake of 2010: a "pivot" away from jobs to other concerns, whose wrongheadedness has been highlighted by recent economic data.
To be sure, things could be worse -- and there's a strong chance that they will, indeed, get worse.
Back when the original 2009 Obama stimulus was enacted, some of us warned that it was both too small and too short-lived. In particular, the effects of the stimulus would start fading out in 2010 -- and given the fact that financial crises are usually followed by prolonged slumps, it was unlikely that the economy would have a vigorous self-sustaining recovery under way by then.
By the beginning of 2010, it was already obvious that these concerns had been justified. Yet somehow an overwhelming consensus emerged among policy makers and pundits that nothing more should be done to create jobs, that, on the contrary, there should be a turn toward fiscal austerity.
This consensus was fed by scare stories about an imminent loss of market confidence in U.S. debt. Every uptick in interest rates was interpreted as a sign that the "bond vigilantes" were on the attack, and this interpretation was often reported as a fact, not as a dubious hypothesis.
For example, in March 2010, The Wall Street Journal published an article titled "Debt Fears Send Rates Up," reporting that long-term U.S. interest rates had risen and asserting -- without offering any evidence -- that this rise, to about 3.9 percent, reflected concerns about the budget deficit. In reality, it probably reflected several months of decent jobs numbers, which temporarily raised optimism about recovery.
But never mind. Somehow it became conventional wisdom that the deficit, not unemployment, was Public Enemy No. 1 -- a conventional wisdom both reflected in and reinforced by a dramatic shift in news coverage away from unemployment and toward deficit concerns. Job creation effectively dropped off the agenda.
So, here we are, in the middle of 2011. How are things going?
Well, the bond vigilantes continue to exist only in the deficit hawks' imagination. Long-term interest rates have fluctuated with optimism or pessimism about the economy; a recent spate of bad news has sent them down to about 3 percent, not far from historic lows.
And the news has, indeed, been bad. As the stimulus has faded out, so have hopes of strong economic recovery. Yes, there has been some job creation -- but at a pace barely keeping up with population growth. The percentage of American adults with jobs, which plunged between 2007 and 2009, has barely budged since then. And the latest numbers suggest that even this modest, inadequate job growth is sputtering out.
So, as I said, we have already repeated a version of the mistake of 1937, withdrawing fiscal support much too early and perpetuating high unemployment.
Yet worse things may soon happen.
On the fiscal side, Republicans are demanding immediate spending cuts as the price of raising the debt limit and avoiding a U.S. default. If this blackmail succeeds, it will put a further drag on an already weak economy.
Meanwhile, a loud chorus is demanding that the Fed and its counterparts abroad raise interest rates to head off an alleged inflationary threat. As the New York Fed article points out, the rise in consumer price inflation over the past few months -- which is already showing signs of tailing off -- reflected temporary factors, and underlying inflation remains low. And smart economists like Mr. Eggerstsson understand this. But the European Central Bank is already raising rates, and the Fed is under pressure to do the same. Further attempts to help the economy expand seem out of the question.
So the mistake of 2010 may yet be followed by an even bigger mistake. Even if that doesn't happen, however, the fact is that the policy response to the crisis was and remains vastly inadequate.
Those who refuse to learn from history are condemned to repeat it; we did, and we are. What we're experiencing may not be a full replay of the Great Depression, but that's little consolation for the millions of American families suffering from a slump that just goes on and on.

Abstract: Based on nearly two dozen interviews with farmers, business owners, analysts and government officials, private insurance companies are likely to experience at least $10 billion in insured losses this year, mostly associated with the tornadoes and the flooding along the Mississippi, based on property damage, lost inventory, business interruption and disrupted crop plantings.

Full text: The devastation from the natural disasters that have ripped through parts of the country this year has been starkly evident. Hundreds of people have died and thousands of houses have been shattered in a deadly string of tornadoes. Millions of acres of farms were inundated and businesses shut down by flooding along the Mississippi River.
Now, as homes are repaired, fields are pumped and factories are cleaned out, the damage assessments will mount, and another measure of the impact will come into clearer focus: the cost to insurance companies.
Based on nearly two dozen interviews with farmers, business owners, analysts and government officials, private insurance companies are likely to experience at least $10 billion in insured losses this year, mostly associated with the tornadoes and the flooding along the Mississippi, based on property damage, lost inventory, business interruption and disrupted crop plantings.
Insurance industry and risk analysis experts arrived at their projections by adding median damage estimates for the worst of the tornadoes so far. The tally will rise when private-sector insurance flood and crop claims associated with the Mississippi River flooding are tacked on and hundreds of other tornadoes and severe winter weather events are factored in.
"Natural catastrophe losses in the United States are likely to be well over $10 billion by the end of 2011," said David Smith, the senior vice president of Eqecat Inc., a catastrophe risk modeling firm. And Robert P. Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, said that just one "relatively minor" hurricane this year could push the total private insurance catastrophe losses in 2011 above the $13.6 billion paid out in 2010.
Whatever the numbers prove to be, analysts acknowledge that the geographic and economic range of damage is vast. Farmland is still submerged, meaning farmers must wait until the water fully recedes to determine whether the soil is fit to replant. Damage assessment teams are still fanning out in tornado zones, surveying the destruction.
And there is also uncertainty about what insurance policies will cover, a question recently on the mind of Austin Golding, a 25-year-old manager in his family's barge business in Vicksburg, Miss. Like other business owners along the Mississippi, Mr. Golding took pre-emptive measures when the river started to rise, moving equipment and staff members to portable trailers on higher ground and putting the main office on blocks, a costly operation that he said saved the insured building from water damage.
"I think we are probably going to try to recoup what we spent in trying to avoid a total replacement" of the building, Mr. Golding said. He added that they would at least try to negotiate a decrease in the premium.
The Mississippi River areas that were flooded include two million to more than three million acres of farmland and pasture, said Michael Cordonnier, a consultant with the Soybean and Corn Advisor, an information service for the commodity industry. Houses, ports, casinos, hotels, grain elevators, infrastructure, fisheries and other facilities are among the sources expected to generate claims from damages.
In addition to the flooding, some of the worst tornadoes in decades have struck this year. As of Wednesday, there have been at least 518 fatalities from tornadoes in the United States, just behind the 519 in 1953, the highest number since official record-keeping started in 1950, said Gregory Carbin, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist.
Just the tornadoes that affected Alabama and neighboring states in the last week of April, and Joplin, Mo., in May, could produce insured losses of $4.5 billion to $8 billion, said Mr. Hartwig of the insurance institute. Eqecat Inc. estimated insured losses at $2 billion to $5 billion in the April week and $1 billion to $3 billion for Joplin. AIR Worldwide, a risk modeling and consulting firm, said it estimated $3.7 billion to $5.5 billion in insured losses for tornadoes and other severe weather events, including Alabama's, in just one week: April 22 to 28.
Catastrophes are defined in the industry as any single event with $25 million or more in insured losses. The biggest catastrophe to hit the industry's insurers was Hurricane Katrina, which generated $45 billion, adjusted for inflation, in insured losses for houses, businesses and vehicles.
While many in the industry, and those clearing out their homes or pumping out businesses, say it is too early to put a figure on the damage, private insurance companies will not be alone in bearing the cost.
The government will cover most of the losses related to flooding for insured homes and small businesses through the National Flood Insurance Program. Officials said the flood insurance program was already $17.7 billion in debt to the Treasury Department, mostly because of Katrina. They added, however, that the program still had $668 million in cash reserves as of April 30 and the ability to borrow nearly $3 billion more from the department if needed to cover this year's claims.
Farmers Insurance, which is one of at least 90 private insurance companies that pays out the flood claims losses using the flood insurance program's funds, has received about 300 claims for flood losses as of May 30, said Jeffery W. Hinesly, a manager of the program for the company. He said that each claim averaged $20,000 to $30,000 for property damage. "I do not expect much more than the 300 because many do not own flood insurance," he said. The major loss exposure that private insurance companies will have using their own funds for flood losses is for automobile insurance, which is not covered by the flood insurance program, he added.
For crop insurance, the government's Risk Management Agency shares the payments for losses with the 15 private insurance companies that it regulates. William J. Murphy, the administrator of the agency, said he expected crop-related losses from Missouri south through the Mississippi River basin to be in the $700 million to $800 million range. The amount paid by the private companies depends on individual contracts with farmers, but it is expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
"We are waiting to see the extent of the losses down there," Mr. Murphy said.
Meanwhile, along the river and in tornado-wrenched towns, residents, farmers and business owners are struggling to adapt.
Bobby W. Armstrong, 79, and his wife, Barbara, moved into a Days Inn in Joplin after their three-bedroom home was damaged, but they considered themselves fortunate that it was not destroyed.
"We heard sirens going and so we went into the hallways and sat down next to the linen closet and huddled up there on the floor," said Mr. Armstrong, a Marine Corps veteran. He said a "wild guess" was that the house needed a new roof, siding, gutters and other repairs, but they had yet to see a claims adjuster.
"We have turned in the report on it, and it will take time before they get out," he said.
Farmers, too, must wait, and with commodity prices at recent highs, the delays can be costly. The floods wiped out investments in fertilizer, labor and seeds. Crop insurance might cover only 50 to 75 percent of the value, depending on average historical yields. In addition, there are seasonal issues. It is too late to replant corn, but soybeans may still take root if the topsoil is in shape.
John Michael Pillow, a 41-year-old farmer in Yazoo County, Miss., watched in dismay when the river spilled over onto his insured farmland, destroying about 3,000 of the 4,000 acres of corn he had already planted.
"I am really hoping we can plant soybeans," he added, "so we will be able to get out of this year without a complete loss."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- No American president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has won a second term in office when the unemployment rate on Election Day topped 7.2 percent.
Seventeen months before the next election, it is increasingly clear that President Obama must defy that trend to keep his job.
Roughly 9 percent of Americans who want to go to work cannot find an employer. Companies are firing fewer people, but hiring remains anemic. And the vast majority of economic forecasters, including the president's own advisers, predict only modest progress by November 2012.
The latest job numbers, due Friday, are expected to provide new cause for concern. Other indicators suggest the pace of growth is flagging. Weak manufacturing data, a gloomy reading on jobs in advance of Friday's report and a drop in auto sales led the markets to their worst close since August, and those declines carried over into Asia Thursday.
But the grim reality of widespread unemployment is drawing little response from Washington. The Federal Reserve says it is all but tapped out. There is even less reason to expect Congressional action. Both Democrats and Republicans see clear steps to create jobs, but they are trying to walk in opposite directions and are making little progress.
Republicans have set the terms of debate by pressing for large cuts in federal spending, which they say will encourage private investment. Democrats have found themselves battling to minimize and postpone such cuts, which they fear will cause new job losses.
House Republicans told the president that they would not support new spending to spur growth during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday.
"The discussion really focused on the philosophical difference on whether Washington should continue to pump money into the economy or should we provide an incentive for entrepreneurs and small businesses to grow," said Eric Cantor, the majority leader. "The president talked about a need for us to continue to quote-unquote invest from Washington's standpoint, and for a lot of us that's code for more Washington spending, something that we can't afford right now."
The White House, its possibilities constrained by the gridlock, has offered no new grand plans. After agreeing to extend the Bush-era tax cuts and reducing the payroll tax last December, the administration has focused on smaller ideas, like streamlining corporate taxation and increasing American exports to Asia and Latin America.
"It's a very tough predicament," said Jared Bernstein, who until April was economic policy adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. "Is there any political appetite for something that would resemble another large Keynesian stimulus? Obviously no. You can say that's what we should do and you'd probably be right, but that's pretty academic."
More than 13.7 million Americans were unable to find work in April; most had been seeking jobs for months. Millions more have stopped trying. Their inability to earn money is a personal catastrophe; studies show that the chance of finding new work slips away with time. It is also a strain on their families, charities and public support programs.
The Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, has the means and the mandate to reduce unemployment by pumping money into the economy.
As financial markets nearly collapsed in 2008, the Fed unleashed a series of unprecedented programs, first to arrest the crisis and then to promote recovery, investing more than $2 trillion. The final installment, a $600 billion bond-buying program, ends in June.
Now, however, the leaders of the central bank say they are reluctant to do more. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in April that more money might not increase growth, but there was a growing risk that it would accelerate inflation.
Congress charged the Fed in 1978 with minimizing unemployment and inflation. Those goals, however, are often in conflict, and the Fed has made clear that inflation is its priority. Fed officials argue in part that maintaining slow, steady inflation forms a basis for enduring economic expansion.
Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in a recent interview that the Fed had reached the limits of responsible policy.
"We've done things that are quite unusual. We're using tools that we have less experience with," Mr. Rosengren said. "Most of the criticism has been that we're being too accommodative. That is a concern that we have to put some weight on."
Heather Boushey, senior economist at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group, said that the Fed was being too cautious about inflation and too callous about joblessness.
"We have a massive unemployment problem in this country right now. It is festering. It's not good for our economy. It's not good for our society. And we have the tools to fix it," she said. "We certainly need to be concerned about what happens down the road, but shouldn't we first be concerned about getting the U.S. economy back on track?"
Seven presidents have stood for re-election since Mr. Roosevelt. In three instances the unemployment rate stood above 6 percent on Election Day. Two presidents lost: Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush. But Ronald Reagan won, despite 7.2 percent unemployment in November 1984, because the rate was falling and voters decided he was fixing the problem.
The Obama administration hopes to tell a similar story.
"We have undertaken some of the biggest policy actions to create jobs that any administration has ever done," said Jason Furman, deputy director of the National Economic Council, which advises the president on economic policy. Mr. Furman said that the economy was still benefiting from last year's tax cuts, and from the dollop of federal stimulus spending that Democrats pushed through in 2009.
The White House is pursuing a number of smaller initiatives, like persuading China to buy more American goods and services; increasing business confidence in the health of the economy, to spur new investment; and striking a deal with Republicans to overhaul corporate taxation.
It is also pushing to renew federal financing for transportation projects with an important twist: The six-year plan would be front-loaded so that $50 billion would be spent in the first year.
But Christina Romer, who headed the president's Council of Economic Advisers until fall 2010, said in a recent speech at Washington University in St. Louis that no part of the government was addressing unemployment with sufficient urgency or hope.
"Urgency, because unemployment is a tragedy that should not be tolerated a minute longer," she said. "And hope, because prudent and possible policies could make a crucial difference."
Correction: August 13, 2011, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on June 2 about the unemployment rate's effect on President Obama's prospects for re-election misstated the number of presidents who have run for re-election since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is seven, not ten. (Presidents Truman, Johnson and Ford came to the presidency by succession, not election, so their candidacies as incumbents are not considered re-election campaigns.) This correction was delayed because an e-mail from a reader pointing out the error went astray at The Times.

Full text: How low can the market go?
For real estate, some economists say, an end to the seemingly endless decline in housing values might be in sight.
Not immediately. At the moment, prices are still dropping. In 20 large cities, prices fell 0.8 percent in March from the previous month, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Indexreleased Tuesday. That pushed the closely watched index below its level of two years ago to a new post-bubble low, and put it 33.1 percent under its July 2006 peak.
Few analysts expect housing prices to rebound anytime soon. But quite a few are predicting that the market is close to the moment when things will stop getting worse, which will be a major improvement all by itself.
"By far the bulk of the downturn of housing prices is beyond us," said Paul Dales of Capital Economics. He expects the market to slip 5 percent further, slightly more than he was expecting a few months ago.
"There are some amazingly favorable signs. Housing is the most undervalued it's been in 35 years," Mr. Dales said. "At some point, it's going to do very well."
Peter Muoio, senior principal of Maximus Advisors, says he thinks the market has already bottomed, although he expects it to bounce around in a narrow range for a few years rather than recovering. And James F. Smith, chief economist for the investment firm Parsec Financial and a rare housing bull, is predicting a 25 percent climb from here by mid-decade.
"There's a lot of pent-up demand for housing and someday it will be unleashed," Mr. Smith said, adding: "Your guess is as good as mine when it will come."
The new Case-Shiller data did not offer much room for short-term optimism. The national housing index, which is reported quarterly, fell 4.2 percent in the first quarter after a drop of 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. This, too, is a new recession low.
Twelve of the 20 cities in the index hit a post-bubble low in March. Washington, D.C., was the only city where prices rose both in March and over the last year. In a double-digit drop that echoed the worst era of the crash, Minneapolis fell by 10 percent over the year.
"Home prices continue on their downward spiral with no relief in sight," David M. Blitzer, the S.& P. Index Committee chairman, said in a statement.
Housing prices are now back to where they were in mid-2002 even before taking inflation into account. Such a decline was unimaginable to the boosters and many of the analysts in the middle of the boom, who were fond of saying that house prices never fell on a national basis. But as credit dried up and the easy refinances disappeared, the foreclosures began. Prices fell sharply in late 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The market turned around in 2009, prompting hopes that the worst was over. A government tax credit proved wildly popular, but the declines resumed after its expiration a year ago.
Some economists think there are still relatively large drops to come. Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, expects a 6 to 8 percent fall during the rest of the year. "There are a lot of forces pushing prices downward," he said.
One of them is the excess number of houses. Builders built too much during the boom, and the mania for second and third homes has sharply diminished. New household formation will soak up the supply, but that will take years.
The financial blog Calculated Risk estimated the excess housing supply this week using 2010 Census data, which it compared to 1990 and 2000. The blog concluded that the excess in April 2010 was about 1.8 million units, but probably several hundred thousand fewer now.
The wild card in all of this is consumer sentiment, otherwise known as confidence. The United States Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index unexpectedly fell to 60.8 in May from a revised 66 in April. Analysts had forecast a one-point rise, but the mood turned hesitant. The May level is the lowest since the fall.
People without confidence in the economy and their own prospects tend to put off major purchases.
"People are still scared," Douglas C. Yearley Jr., chief executive of the high-end builder Toll Brothers, said in a recent interview. "If they look in the paper and see that Robert Shiller says prices have another 20 percent to go, it has to keep them at home."
Mr. Shiller, one of the developers of the Case-Shiller index and a housing bear, did not respond to requests for his latest forecast, a development that no doubt made Mr. Yearley's day.

Full text: CHANGSHA, China -- China's economy is starting to slow, after two years of torrid growth achieved following the global downturn.
Chinese manufacturers' backlogs of orders are gradually shrinking in many industries. Purchasing managers have become less optimistic about their businesses' prospects. And after surging past the United States in car sales over the last two years, the Chinese auto market unexpectedly stalled last month, as carmakers curtailed production plans.
Because China's cooling economy is partly a result of Beijing's efforts to contain inflation, some economists are not worried, saying a slight slowdown could be positive. And they say that after the government eases off the brakes, economic growth should quickly pick back up.
But other experts worry that inflation is already so entrenched that the government may be forced to continue braking the economy for a considerable time.
"They have to continue to tighten policy into what we expect will be a sharp growth downturn, already likely to be under way," said Diana Choyleva, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Lombard Street Research, an economic forecasting firm based in London.
The world closely monitors the temperature of China's economy, so crucial has it become to the health of global business and finance. This spring, as economists at Western investment banks have been reducing their growth forecasts for China, the specter of slackening Chinese demand has helped send world prices for industrial commodities like copper falling by 10 percent or more.
And the "A" share stock market in Shanghai has dropped 11.7 percent from its high on April 18, including drops of 0.13 percent on Monday and nearly 1 percent on Friday.
Despite signs of slowing Chinese growth, some international corporate executives say they remain optimistic, particularly if they look beyond the next several months.
"I don't think it's a hard landing," said Martin Brudermuller, the vice chairman for BASF of Germany, the world's largest chemical company, which sells to a wide range of industries in China. "I'm not really worried at this point."
And even though Goldman Sachs last Tuesday cut its forecast for economic growth in China during the second quarter to 8 percent -- down from 8.8 percent -- it predicted that growth would recover to 9.3 percent by the fourth quarter.
The optimists note that the Chinese economy expanded robustly until this spring, even though policy makers had been stomping on the brakes since October to try to curb inflation. Seen from that perspective, policy makers can easily press the growth accelerator, after inflation starts to subside.
The braking measures have included the requirement that commercial banks, to restrict their ability to lend, must park more than one-fifth of their assets at the central bank. That is starving all but the largest and most politically connected companies of capital.
And trying to slow a real estate boom that looks more and more like a dangerous bubble, the government has also put many restrictions on issuing new mortgages. The measures include requiring higher down payments, to reduce the risk that a real estate collapse would harm the banking system, as happened in the United States.
Another slowdown factor: the huge government investments in high-speed rail and other infrastructure, which played a central role in China's swift recovery in 2009 from the global economic downturn, have begun to level off.
But Douglas Hsu, the chairman and chief executive of the Far Eastern Group, a big Taiwanese multinational with extensive investments in the cement and petrochemicals industries in mainland China, predicted that government-supported efforts to increase construction of low-income housing and move more people from rural areas to cities would offset the gradual deceleration in infrastructure spending in the months and years to come.
The big question now is how much economic growth may slow, before the authorities shift their priority from controlling inflation to revving the growth engine.
Some businesses here in Changsha, a city of 6.5 million people that is the capital of Hunan Province in south-central China, say they already see weakening sales.
"Our business is down 30 to 40 percent, we're losing money every day," said Li Chuanlian, the manager of a store that sells stoves.
Real estate prices are still rising briskly here, as speculators with cash continue to snap up properties after the completion of a high-speed rail line linking Changsha to the more affluent Guangzhou. But in many cases, buyers are economizing on furnishing those apartments, Mr. Li said.
Blackouts, caused by the nation's utilities balking at high coal prices, are another headache.
"With no electricity, they can't try my products, so business stops," said Wang Zhuanghong, the manager of a household appliances store.
Chinese regulators announced on Monday that they would allow electricity rates to rise in half of China's provinces by an average of 1.67 fen per kilowatt-hour, or 0.26 cents, for industrial users. The increase, which works out to 2.2 percent, is intended to give electricity companies a greater incentive to run power plants.
But electricity prices would still lag behind spot coal prices, up 36 percent in China since the start of last year. And electric utilities would not be allowed to charge more to residential users, so as to limit inflation.
The power shortages also threaten to trim China's industrial output over the summer, as the authorities have given priority to residential users during the peak air-conditioning season.
A big source of uncertainty about the Chinese economy hangs over one industry that has propelled consumer spending at a remarkable pace for the last decade: autos.
The swift expansion of the Chinese auto market enabled it to pass the recession-crippled American market in 2009, and then to surpass the highest levels ever achieved in the United States in the total number of vehicles sold. The production and demand have helped underpin high world prices for oil, steel and other commodities.
But sales of cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles grew only 7 percent in April from a year earlier, indicating a further slowing this year after year-over-year sales growth of 20 to 120 percent each month in 2010.
J. D. Power & Associates, the global consulting firm, responded to the weak April sales by lowering its estimate for growth in China's car market this year to 7 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 11 percent. That works out to 295,000 fewer cars this year than previously predicted.
But some of the biggest reasons for the auto slowdown appear to have nothing to do with consumer confidence. John Zeng, the J. D. Power co-director of Asia forecasting for greater China, said that most of the reduced sales forecast -- as many as 260,000 cars of the decline -- reflected the effects of the Japan earthquake on the automotive supply chain. China still relies on Japan for nearly half of its automatic transmissions, whose supply will not return to normal until early next year, Mr. Zeng said.
Meanwhile, in bustling Beijing, the municipal government has cut by half the number of license plates it will allow to be issued this year, as a way to fight traffic jams. That move has trimmed China's projected overall car sales by an additional 4 percent this year.
Some economists say that the government waited too long last year to try to slow the overall economy. They fear that inflation now has such a firm foothold that it could take a serious downturn to stop it.
A step China could take against inflation is to stop issuing billions of extra renminbi each month to pay for intervention in currency markets. The intervention has slowed the renminbi's rise against the dollar to an annual pace of about 5 percent.
But few economists expect China to stop intervening any time soon.
Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a year earlier after climbing 5.4 percent in March, according to official statistics. The official figures are widely thought to understate the true extent of inflation, which some economists say actually may be twice as high.
State media have begun to warn the public that inflation may persist a long time. Government-imposed price controls have only delayed, not eliminated, the need to raise prices for services like electricity, for which production costs have risen.
Although Chinese policy makers have plenty of options to reinvigorate growth if they declare victory on inflation, they nonetheless face a longer-term challenge. Many economists predict China's economy simply cannot maintain its double-digit growth of the last three decades. In fact, the five-year plan starting this year calls for annual growth of 7 percent from 2011 to 2015.
The problem lies in China's extremely heavy dependence on investment in factories, infrastructure and apartment buildings to sustain growth. The slowly rising levels of debt at local governments and large companies that have financed that investment indicate it may not be sustainable.
At the same time, the economic returns on new highways and other public infrastructure projects are declining, now that the best locations have already been built up, and as planners extend construction to less affluent and more remote areas. While some economists predict this effect will take five or more years to become serious, others warn it could hit sooner.
"Growth will slow significantly in two or three years -- the timing will be determined politically," said Michael Pettis, an associate professor of finance at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University. "And the slowdown will last much longer than anyone expects -- perhaps over a decade."

Full text: HONG KONG -- Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the most high-profile dissident in Myanmar, signaled on Monday that she would be seeking to broaden her audience in her country since being released from house arrest.
Speaking from Myanmar via a live video link to an audience at the University of Hong Kong, she confirmed that she would begin traveling outside of Yangon, the biggest city in Myanmar and its economic capital, a move that may test boundaries imposed on her since her release in November.
In 2003, during a period free from detention, Mrs. Aung San Suu Ky toured the country, drawing increasingly large crowds, and on one trip, a band of men attacked her convoy in what some people believed was an assassination attempt. She was then sent back to house arrest.
On Monday she also urged the international community to reach out to the opposition movement in Myanmar by using modern communications technology.
In the months since her release from house arrest, Mrs. Aung San Suu Ky, recipient of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has used video links and other means to connect with students and activists in Europe and North America.
"We can help each other now -- we now have the ability," she said after being asked how people outside of Myanmar could an engage with her and other pro-democracy activists inside her country.
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi would not specify when or where she would travel, or even the purpose of her trips. But she pointedly noted on Monday that the government had not provided assurances of her safety and that she had made it clear that she expected the authorities to ensure her security.
"It is the duty of the government to provide assurances," she said.
Some Burmese dissidents have been hoping that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi would take a more active political role.
Her supporters, while acknowledging the range of opinions within the democracy movement in Myanmar, described her decision to travel around the country as a natural progression.
"She is the leader of the democracy network, and that includes addressing issues such as social welfare, political prisoners, farmers' rights and civil rights lawyers," said Aung Din, executive director of the United States Campaign for Burma, a lobbying group. "She is the leader of a broader civil society movement."
The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962, and the elections in November were advertised as a "road map to democracy." In March, a civilian government was installed under President Thein Sein, but analysts say little has changed inside Myanmar since the elections.
The new government has done little to end abuses across Myanmar, said Tomas Ojea Quintana, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar.
Speaking by telephone, Mr. Quintana listed several areas in which the new government failed to make any significant progress, noting land confiscation, forced labor, internal displacement of people, extrajudicial killings and sexual violence against women.
"These problems remain widespread and unaddressed," said Mr. Quintana, who in May visited Thailand for a week to speak with refugees from Myanmar.
The Myanmar government has refused entry to Mr. Quintana.
He said he was preparing a report to present to the U.N. General Assembly this year.
Likewise, little progress has been made to confront what has been described as rampant corruption of the Myanmar economy.
It has been "a little disappointing," Sean Turnell, professor of economics at Macquarie University in Sydney, said of the new government's response to initiating economic reforms. The military remains by far the largest expenditure in Myanmar, at about 25 percent of the budget, he said.
"That is causing all sorts of distortion to the economy, and creating a very serious budget deficit," he said. "But the government's response to budget deficits has been to print more money, which has led to the highest rate of inflation in Southeast Asia."
Mr. Turnell said, for example, that he had expected the government to address the gap between the official exchange and market rates of Myanmar's currency, the largest such gap in the world. The official exchange rate is 6 kyat to the U.S. dollar, while on the market, a dollar exchanges for 350 kyat, Mr. Turnell said. No action has been taken, he said.
"Economic reform is really going to run up against vested interests," he said, pointing to a relatively few number of oligarchs who command most of the business enterprises in Myanmar.
The address on Monday by Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was preceded by a videotaped speech from her. In it, she emphasized the need for education and described people as "learners and nonlearners."
When asked later how she would describe the military establishment in Myanmar, she said, "I would say they are not very fast learners."
When asked by a student how she has managed to maintain her conviction in principles, she was blunt: "Discipline. That's how I managed to live in isolation and keep my faith."
Under house arrest for 15 of 21 years before her release in November, she spoke on Monday of maintaining simplicity in her daily life.
"I've learned to be happy with small things," she said. "You have to learn to be happy with small things."
When asked by a female student at Hong Kong University about the role of women in politics in Myanmar, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said many women were playing roles inside her party, the National League for Democracy.
Then she smiled, adding "sometimes I think they are more helpful than men."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: The combined tally for the $8.7 billion A.I.G. stock sale last week, the spinoff of American International Assurance and the sale of Alico to MetLife comes to an estimated $600 million. Federal regulators are still wrestling with how to impose such resolution authority after Congress set out a bare-bones framework in last year's financial reform legislation.

Full text: Bankruptcy beats bailouts in the land of Hermes ties and wingtips. So far, the bankers, lawyers and other advisers from the 44 firms that are helping wind down defunct Lehman Brothers have raked in $1.2 billion. That's more than the combined post-rescue fees paid by some of the biggest recipients of federal aid during the crisis.
Take Citigroup, for example. It needed $45 billion of taxpayer funds to stay afloat. It paid some back to the Treasury. But the government appointed Morgan Stanley to oversee the sale of its $25 billion common equity stake -- and handed over $69 million in fees for the effort.
Then there's General Motors, which needed $50 billion from the government before converting much of it, and union and bondholder debts, into equity. Banks earned a cut-rate 0.75 percent fee on the automaker's initial public offering last year. But the deal still added up to almost $135 million for the banks, led by Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan.
The hobbled American International Group has been even more lucrative for financiers. The combined tally for the $8.7 billion A.I.G. stock sale last week, the spinoff of American International Assurance and the sale of Alico to MetLife comes to an estimated $600 million. Add the fee costs of the three rescues and they account for just two-thirds of the Lehman tab so far.
Of course, Lehman's cost to the economy dwarfs all. That might sound like an argument for always choosing bailouts over bankruptcy. But moral hazard serves as a reminder that firms should be allowed to fail -- in a more controlled way than Lehman did. Federal regulators are still wrestling with how to impose such resolution authority after Congress set out a bare-bones framework in last year's financial reform legislation.
A well-structured template would help prevent the broader panic that ensues when a large institution collapses, and should ultimately reduce the amount of aid the government needs to pump into the system. It also should cut down on the man-hours required to cope with the complexity, yet still leave plenty of work for fee-hungry advisers.
Surviving Inflation
Fickle weather, decreasing farmland and more mouths to feed are pushing up prices of wheat and other important ingredients and soft commodities. Companies feeding the hungry masses are running out of places to slash costs and increasingly being forced to pass the inflation on to customers to avoid smaller profits. Big brands and active market leaders, like McDonald's and Pepsi, stand to best survive the storm.
Some early evidence seems to favor the brave. J. M. Smucker has been leading the way, raising the price of Folgers coffee. A jar that sold for $4 a year ago now costs $5.20, a 30 percent increase. A rival, Kraft, typically has taken longer to raise prices in this category, but Smucker's shares have performed better despite-- or, maybe because of -- the aggressive moves.
Pepsi also shocked markets this year when it jacked up forecasts for commodity inflation to roughly double what rivals like Coca-Cola were expecting. But competitors have slowly come around, and in the meantime Pepsi shares have outperformed theirs.
The cost adversity also puts market leaders in position to throw their weight around. McDonald's, for example, plans to invest $1 billion over the next few years to remodel about 5,000 restaurants. A nicer atmosphere could help ease the pain of a costlier Big Mac. In the past, such redesigns have increased sales of established stores by 6 or 7 percent. Smaller rivals may not have such capital to invest to mask their costlier meals.
History also favors the titans. During the last big global food inflation, in 2007-8, General Mills raised prices and still gained impressive market share. With brands like Cheerios and Lucky Charms, the company surged from 16 percent of United States cereal sales to 26 percent in a year, according to IBISWorld, a market research company.
With the economy only wheezing back to life and jobs still hard to come by, consumers may not have as much of an appetite for higher prices as they had in previous downturns. But the companies big enough and bold enough to tackle the issue head-on seem nevertheless to have an edge in tough times.

Full text: Microsoft has missed too many opportunities under Steve Ballmer's stewardship. It's a fair criticism reignited last week by the hedge fund boss, David Einhorn, who called for the software giant's chief executive to step down. But that doesn't necessarily mean Mr. Ballmer will go. Based on total return to shareholders, other long-time company bosses, including Jeff Immelt at General Electric, have fared worse.
Mr. Ballmer started as chief executive in January 2000. Over the last decade, Microsoft's shares have tumbled 30 percent, and they're up only a hair from their low in 2006. The potted narrative is that Mr. Ballmer has shepherded the "old" operating system and productivity software powerhouse reasonably well but misjudged new developments, wasting billions of dollars chasing Silicon Valley innovators like Apple and Google.
It would be a lot to expect a single company to dominate more than one truly world-changing technology. But with that caveat, the critique of Mr. Ballmer is on target even if he's far from the only chief executive who has struggled to make the most of a franchise. And he at least saw the need to pay dividends a few years earlier than, say, John Chambers at Cisco Systems.
On a total return basis including those payouts, Microsoft shareholders are down just over 10 percent over 10 years, and better off by some 14 percent over five, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That's far from gratifying, but easily beats Cisco. Looking further across corporate America, Mr. Ballmer stomps Mr. Immelt's decade-long reign at G.E. and outdoes Rupert Murdoch's latest five-year stretch at the News Corporation. Richard Fairbank at Capital One Financial and Steven Burd at the grocery chain Safeway, two other corner-office fixtures, also have fallen short of Mr. Ballmer's performance.
This report card, of course, damns Mr. Ballmer with faint praise. His problem isn't so much shrinking profits as a loss of investor faith in Microsoft, whose price-to-earnings ratio is one of the lowest among big companies in the United States. But Mr. Einhorn probably won't quickly get his wish for a replacement. Mr. Ballmer and Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, go way back and together own more than 10 percent of the company. That means the current chief executive probably will get more time to try to reinvent Microsoft.
Virtual Inflation
In the currency wars, the nerds are winning. The value of a Bitcoin, a digital currency trading over peer-to-peer networks, has rocketed more than ninefold in two months to more than $8.60 as of Friday afternoon. The preordained supply and decentralization of Bitcoins have intrigued geeks and paranoid inflationistas alike. But this abstract gold may not survive what looks like a bubble.
Bitcoins are actually strings of unique digits, tracked and traded via an online network. People earn new coins by solving network security problems. These coins can then be traded for real currencies on exchanges, or for goods from certain businesses that accept them.
The Bitcoins in a user's virtual wallet are tracked by the secure system and can be transferred only by that user. Moreover -- and here's the hook for the inflation worriers -- the currency can't be printed willy-nilly. The supply of Bitcoins is on a predefined path and will be capped at 21 million. And because there's no central point in the system, there's no equivalent of the Federal Reserve to rewrite that policy.
The concept of the Bitcoin is no less real than regular paper money or coins. All such currencies have only the value their users accept. Bitcoins do, though, have a couple of disadvantages: they don't generate income, and since they exist in the digital cloud they'd be less use than paper money in any scenario involving power cuts or lost connectivity.
Still, it's easy, quick and essentially free to transfer Bitcoins. Moreover, transactions are anonymous and the system knows no national borders. That's helpful for some legitimate users, but also makes the currency a potential worry for law enforcers.
The finite supply means the value of Bitcoins should rise as demand increases. But the latest run-up looks decidedly frothy. A flush user can buy Web design help or alpaca socks. But there aren't many businesses that accept Bitcoins. So it seems likely that enthusiasts and speculators are hoarding them without regard to the value they really represent. A bubble that bursts when the abstract intellectual appeal fades would probably doom the otherwise creative idea.

Full text: Unemployment is a terrible scourge across much of the Western world. Almost 14 million Americans are jobless, and millions more are stuck with part-time work or jobs that fail to use their skills. Some European countries have it even worse: 21 percent of Spanish workers are unemployed.
Nor is the situation showing rapid improvement. This is a continuing tragedy, and in a rational world bringing an end to this tragedy would be our top economic priority.
Yet a strange thing has happened to policy discussion: on both sides of the Atlantic, a consensus has emerged among movers and shakers that nothing can or should be done about jobs. Instead of a determination to do something about the ongoing suffering and economic waste, one sees a proliferation of excuses for inaction, garbed in the language of wisdom and responsibility.
So someone needs to say the obvious: inventing reasons not to put the unemployed back to work is neither wise nor responsible. It is, instead, a grotesque abdication of responsibility.
What kinds of excuses am I talking about? Well, consider last week's release of the latest report on the economic outlook by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or O.E.C.D. The O.E.C.D. is basically an intergovernmental think tank; while it has no direct ability to set policy, what it says reflects the conventional wisdom of Europe's policy elite.
So what did the O.E.C.D. have to say about high unemployment in its member countries? "The room for macroeconomic policies to address these complex challenges is largely exhausted," declared the organization's secretary general, who called on countries instead to "go structural" -- that is, to focus on long-run reforms that would have little impact on the current employment situation.
And how do we know that there's no room for policies to put the unemployed back to work? The secretary general didn't say -- and the report itself never even suggests possible solutions to the employment crisis. All it does is highlight the risks, as it sees them, of any departure from orthodox policy.
But then, who is talking seriously about job creation these days? Not the Republican Party, unless you count its ritual calls for tax cuts and deregulation. Not the Obama administration, which more or less dropped the subject a year and a half ago.
The fact that nobody in power is talking about jobs does not mean, however, that nothing could be done.
Bear in mind that the unemployed aren't jobless because they don't want to work, or because they lack the necessary skills. There's nothing wrong with our workers -- remember, just four years ago the unemployment rate was below 5 percent.
The core of our economic problem is, instead, the debt -- mainly mortgage debt -- that households ran up during the bubble years of the last decade. Now that the bubble has burst, that debt is acting as a persistent drag on the economy, preventing any real recovery in employment. And once you realize that the overhang of private debt is the problem, you realize that there are a number of things that could be done about it.
For example, we could have W.P.A.-type programs putting the unemployed to work doing useful things like repairing roads -- which would also, by raising incomes, make it easier for households to pay down debt. We could have a serious program of mortgage modification, reducing the debts of troubled homeowners. We could try to get inflation back up to the 4 percent rate that prevailed during Ronald Reagan's second term, which would help to reduce the real burden of debt.
So there are policies we could be pursuing to bring unemployment down. These policies would be unorthodox -- but so are the economic problems we face. And those who warn about the risks of action must explain why these risks should worry us more than the certainty of continued mass suffering if we do nothing.
In pointing out that we could be doing much more about unemployment, I recognize, of course, the political obstacles to actually pursuing any of the policies that might work. In the United States, in particular, any effort to tackle unemployment will run into a stone wall of Republican opposition. Yet that's not a reason to stop talking about the issue. In fact, looking back at my own writings over the past year or so, it's clear that I too have sinned: political realism is all very well, but I have said far too little about what we really should be doing to deal with our most important problem.
As I see it, policy makers are sinking into a condition of learned helplessness on the jobs issue: the more they fail to do anything about the problem, the more they convince themselves that there's nothing they could do. And those of us who know better should be doing all we can to break that vicious circle.
