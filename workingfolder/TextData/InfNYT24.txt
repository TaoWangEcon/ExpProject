Full text:   BEIJING -- China announced on Wednesday that it would increase its military budget for 2014 to almost $132 billion, a 12.2 percent rise over last year. The rapid growth in defense spending is another sign of the country's goal of becoming a dominant military presence in the Pacific, with a navy able to project power across the region.
The rate of growth in spending is greater than that of recent years. In 2013, China's defense budget increased by 10.7 percent over the previous year. The country's military spending is the second largest in the world, behind that of the United States.
The buildup of the People's Liberation Army, which also includes navy and air force branches, is considered by many analysts to be consistent with the size of China's economy -- the second largest in the world -- and its global political influence. Nevertheless, the military expansion is being closely watched by other nations in the region and by the United States, the supreme military power in the Pacific.
American officials have expressed growing concerns over diplomatic tensions in East Asia and Southeast Asia, much of it related to regional anxieties over China's military rise and its assertion of sovereignty over rocks, reefs, islands, fisheries and sea lanes in the area. The United States has said it does not take sides in the territorial disputes, but it asserts it will maintain freedom of navigation.
Foreign military analysts say China's actual annual military spending is higher than the official figure. IHS Jane's, a defense industry consulting and analysis company, estimated that China would spend $148 billion this year, but such estimates can vary widely. The unofficial estimate is still much less than the military budget of the United States, which is officially $526.8 billion for fiscal year 2014.
Dennis J. Blasko, a former military attaché at the American Embassy in Beijing and a retired Army officer, said the 2014 Chinese military budget "won't break the bank, but it says to the troops, 'Thank you for your service, you are important to us, we support you."'
"A significant portion likely will be used for more pay raises," he added. "You may recall hearing some talk about how P.L.A. officers should be paid more than civil servants."
A major portion of the increase will go to "better, more realistic training," Mr. Blasko added. "The navy will also continue to train more at greater distances from China, which is more expensive than training in local waters."
China announced the 2014 military budget on the first day of the National People's Congress, an annual meeting of a legislature whose purpose is to formally approve policy already made by Communist Party leaders.
"We will comprehensively enhance the revolutionary nature of the Chinese armed forces, further modernize them and upgrade their performance, and continue to raise their deterrence and combat capabilities in the information age," Prime Minister Li Keqiang said at the opening session on Wednesday.
Other Asian nations suspect China's priority is building offensive capabilities and point to China's increasingly assertive postures on sovereignty issues. Southeast Asian nations have opposed China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which some analysts say has rich oil and gas reserves and abundant fisheries.
Last November, China stunned Japan, South Korea and the United States when it announced a new Air Defense Identification Zone over a swath of the East China Sea, saying that foreign planes, military or civilian, would have to report flight paths through the zone to China. The United States has continued to send military flights through the zone without obeying China's request.
China and Japan have been engaged in a heated diplomatic dispute over the sovereignty of islands administered by Japan in the East China Sea. Military patrols and movements by fishing vessels around those islands, called the Senkaku in Japanese and the Diaoyu in Chinese, could unintentionally trigger a conflict, American officials say.
"The last thing we need is some unintended incident that leads to unintended consequences, very severe consequences, whether it's a fishing boat bumping into a navy vessel and someone drowning," Gary F. Locke, the departing American ambassador to China, said at his final news conference in Beijing last week. "So it's important that both sides lower the temperature and focus on diplomacy."
American military officials have said ties with their Chinese counterparts are much weaker than with Soviet military officials during the height of the Cold War. In late February, Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the United States Army chief of staff, visited China to lay the groundwork for starting a formal dialogue and exchange program between the United States Army and the People's Liberation Army. The general said he expected the first meeting in that program to take place before the end of 2014.
In recent years, the Chinese military has deployed to sea an aircraft carrier it refitted after being purchased from Ukraine, the Liaoning, and tested at least two stealth fighters. Many Chinese defense companies and research programs at state-run universities have been developing a range of drones for use by the People's Liberation Army and for sale to other nations.
Mr. Li, the prime minister, also said Wednesday that China's economic growth rate for 2014 is expected to be 7.5 percent, which is consistent with projections by many analysts. The target for the consumer price index, a measure of inflation, is 3.5 percent.
Unlike in recent years, the Finance Ministry on Wednesday did not release revenue and expenditure budgets of local governments, saying in a report that "related data is still being collected." The lack of data made it impossible to tally the total domestic security budget for 2014. The ministry said the budget from the central government for public security was $33 billion, but most of the financing of the huge domestic security apparatus is in the budget of local governments. In 2011, the announced total amount was 624.4 billion renminbi, or $95 billion, the first time the planned budget for the domestic security apparatus, led by Zhou Yongkang at the time, had exceeded the official military budget.
That trend has continued each year, and in 2013 the announced amount was 769 billion renminbi, an 8.7 percent increase over the previous year. The knife murders of 29 civilians last weekend in the Kunming train station, which appeared to be an act of domestic terrorism with roots in ethnic conflict, will no doubt contribute to calls for even greater increases in security spending.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: The escalating crisis in Ukraine created turmoil in global markets on Monday, hitting stocks from Wall Street to Ukraine and causing a spike in oil and natural gas prices that could reach into consumers' wallets. Rather, economists said the biggest danger to global growth, outside of outright war, was the possibility that sanctions or political theater could bring a disruption to the flow of natural gas to Western Europe, creating an external shock that could push the fragile euro zone back into recession.

Full text:   The escalating crisis in Ukraine created turmoil in global markets on Monday, hitting stocks from Wall Street to Ukraine and causing a spike in oil and natural gas prices that could reach into consumers' wallets.
But despite fears that the conflict between Russia and the West over Ukraine could shift into a military confrontation, analysts said there was little risk of global financial contagion or of major blowback to Western economies.
"If this turns into an outright war, it will be a different story," said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the private bank Berenberg in London. "More likely it will remain a Cold War-style standoff, and if that's the case the economic damage for the West and the global economy will be limited."
Still, the growing crisis in Ukraine is unsettling investors, who have already been nervous about shaky emerging-market economies. The biggest impact was felt on Russian and Ukrainian markets, with the Moscow benchmark Micex index dropping 10.8 percent. The ruble fell to a record low against the dollar, with concerns spreading to currencies in nearby countries like Hungary, Turkey and Poland.
The turmoil in Moscow markets prompted the Russian central bank to announce a "temporary" 1.5 percentage point rise in its benchmark interest rate target, to 7 percent. "The decision is aimed at preventing the risks for inflation and financial stability arising from the recent increase in financial market volatility," the central bank said in a statement.
In developed markets, shares sank as well, with companies with exposure to Ukraine and Russia taking the biggest beating. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of European blue chips closed down 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 153.68 points, or 0.9 percent, to 16,168.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index took its biggest drop since Feb. 3, falling 13.72 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,845.73. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 30.82 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,277.30.
At the same time, investors moved into traditionally safer assets like United States bonds and the Japanese currency. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32 to 101 9/32, and its yield fell to 2.61 percent, from 2.65 percent late Friday.
"The escalation of the crisis is clearly a shock to emerging-market sentiment," said Michala Marcussen, the global chief economist at Société Générale. While the economic fundamentals suggest the damage should be contained to Ukraine and Russia, she added, "we have to be aware of market psychology."
While many major indexes are trading at near-record levels, global markets have become increasingly volatile of late. Jitters caused by serious political problems in countries like Thailand, Argentina and Turkey have been exacerbated by concerns that growth in emerging markets will be stymied as the Federal Reserve reduces its monthly bond purchases.
The situation in Ukraine has only played into those fears.
Ukraine makes up only about 0.2 percent of global gross domestic product, according to Société Générale, and in itself has little bearing on the world economy. Rather, economists said the biggest danger to global growth, outside of outright war, was the possibility that sanctions or political theater could bring a disruption to the flow of natural gas to Western Europe, creating an external shock that could push the fragile euro zone back into recession.
The crisis has energy markets worried because a large portion of Russian natural gas for Europe moves through Ukraine. Natural gas prices rose about 6 percent on the British market, and shares of Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly that counts Ukraine as a major customer, fell more than 10 percent. Oil prices also rose, with Brent crude futures traded in London adding 1.9 percent. What may be keeping prices from going higher for now is that in recent years Russia has chipped away at the amount of gas that goes through Ukraine by opening the Nord Stream pipeline, which bypasses the country. In addition, European countries have been able to build up substantial stores of gas, given that the winter has been warm.
Stocks with direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine also took a hit.
Several of the biggest western oil companies like ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell have major investments in Russia. BP, the British oil company, has significant interests with a 20 percent stake in Rosneft, the state-controlled oil company. Robert W. Dudley, BP's chief executive, serves on Rosneft's board, and BP has been in talks to send teams of technical experts to help the Russian company. On Monday, BP shares fell 2 percent in London.
Russia is also a big player in industrial metals, and most of the world's major brands are significantly invested in the country. "That means Russia is very important for a range of European and American companies," said Chris Weafer, co-founder of Moscow-based Macro Advisory. For instance, Russia is the No. 1 market for the French dairy giant Danone and the second-biggest market for Pepsi. Shares of the French automaker Renault, which also has major operations and sales there, fell 5.4 percent.
European banking shares were broadly off, led by a 9.6 percent decline in Raiffeisen Bank International, the Austrian lender that ranks as one of the Western lenders most exposed to Ukraine. UniCredit, the Italian lender, fell 6 percent, while BNP Paribas of France and Piraeus Bank of Greece each declined more than 3 percent.
But the fallout to the banking sector may be somewhat limited. During the financial crisis in 2009, many Western banks pulled back from Ukraine, and Russian lenders, particularly Sberbank and VEB, stepped in to take up the slack. Raiffeisen is one of the few European Union lenders with major Ukraine business, and it said in November that it was seeking to sell the local unit, known as Raiffeisen Bank Aval.
Ms. Marcussen of Société Générale said that investors would be closely watching the progress this week of an expected International Monetary Fund mission to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. The interim Ukrainian government is negotiating with the European Union, the United States and the International Monetary Fund for a bailout of as much as $35 billion to get it through the next two years. And a team from the fund was expected to arrive in Kiev for discussions this week.
Of major concern, Ms. Marcussen said, would be whether the fund will seek major "haircuts" on the value of Ukrainian government debt, forcing private sector bondholders to book big losses. On Monday, bond prices in Russia and Ukraine jumped significantly, suggesting investors are worried.
Over all, the biggest risks of the crisis may be more specific to the Russian and Ukraine economies, which have been under pressure for a while. Even before Russia's armed intervention, Ukraine faced a possible default on its debt, and its economy was hobbled.
In Russia, growth has been slowing, as commodity prices fall and foreign investment dries up. Last year, growth came in just at above 1 percent, well below the 3 percent that international economists had forecast.
"What's becoming clear is that Russia has finally come to the end of its oil-driven growth model. It needs a new investment driver, and needs to attract more foreign investment to diversify its industries," said Mr. Weafer of Macro Advisory.

Abstract: If you spent the last five years watching CNBC, or reading the Wall Street Journal opinion pages, or for that matter listening to prominent conservative economists, you lived in a constant state of alarm over runaway inflation, which was coming any day now.

Full text:   Recently the Federal Reserve released transcripts of its monetary policy meetings during the fateful year of 2008. And, boy, are they discouraging reading.
Partly that's because Fed officials come across as essentially clueless about the gathering economic storm. But we knew that already. What's really striking is the extent to which they were obsessed with the wrong thing. The economy was plunging, yet all many people at the Fed wanted to talk about was inflation.
Matthew O'Brien at The Atlantic has done the math. In August 2008 there were 322 mentions of inflation, versus only 28 of unemployment and 19 of systemic risks or crises. In the meeting on Sept. 16, 2008 -- the day after Lehman fell! -- there were 129 mentions of inflation versus 26 mentions of unemployment and only four of systemic risks or crises.
Historians of the Great Depression have long marveled at the folly of policy discussion at the time. For example, the Bank of England, faced with a devastating deflationary spiral, kept obsessing over the imagined threat of inflation. As the economist Ralph Hawtrey famously observed, "That was to cry 'Fire, fire!' in Noah's flood." But it turns out that modern monetary officials facing financial crisis were just as obsessed with the wrong thing as their predecessors three generations before.
And it wasn't just a bad call in 2008. Much supposedly informed opinion has remained fixated on the supposed threat of rising prices despite being wrong again and again. If you spent the last five years watching CNBC, or reading the Wall Street Journal opinion pages, or for that matter listening to prominent conservative economists, you lived in a constant state of alarm over runaway inflation, which was coming any day now. It never did.
What accounts for inflation obsession? One answer is that obsessives failed to distinguish between underlying inflation and short-term fluctuations in the headline number, which are mainly driven by volatile energy and food prices. Gasoline prices, in particular, strongly influence inflation in any given year, and dire warnings are heard whenever prices rise at the pump; yet such blips say nothing at all about future inflation.
They also failed to understand that printing money in a depressed economy isn't inflationary. I could have told them that, and in fact I did. But maybe there was some excuse for not grasping this point in 2008 or early 2009.
The point, however, is that inflation obsession has persisted, year after year, even as events have refuted its supposed justifications. And this tells us that something more than bad analysis is at work. At a fundamental level, it's political.
This is fairly obvious if you look at who the inflation obsessives are. While a few conservatives believe that the Fed should be doing more, not less, they have little if any real influence. The overall picture is that most conservatives are inflation obsessives, and nearly all inflation obsessives are conservative.
Why is this the case? In part it reflects the belief that the government should never seek to mitigate economic pain, because the private sector always knows best. Back in the 1930s, Austrian economists like Friedrich Hayek and Joseph Schumpeter inveighed against any effort to fight the depression with easy money; to do so, warned Schumpeter, would be to leave "the work of depressions undone." Modern conservatives are generally less open about the harshness of their view, but it's pretty much the same.
The flip side of this antigovernment attitude is the conviction that any attempt to boost the economy, whether fiscal or monetary, must produce disastrous results -- Zimbabwe, here we come! And this conviction is so strong that it persists no matter how wrong it has been, year after year.
Finally, all this ties in with a predilection for acting tough and inflicting punishment whatever the economic conditions. The British journalist William Keegan once described this as "sado-monetarism," and it's very much alive today.
Does any of this matter? It's true that the Fed hasn't surrendered to the sado-monetarists. Notably, it didn't panic in 2011, when another blip in gasoline prices briefly raised the headline rate of inflation, and Republicans began inveighing against the "debasement" of the dollar.
But I'd argue that the clamor from inflation obsessives has intimidated the Fed, which might otherwise have done more. And it has also been part of a general climate of opposition to anything that might address our continuing jobs crisis.
As I suggested, we used to marvel at the wrongheadedness of policy makers during the Great Depression. But when the Great Recession struck, and we were given a chance to do better, we ended up repeating all the same mistakes.

Full text:   SHANGHAI -- Last June, an affiliate of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba made an offer to its hundreds of millions of users: Give us your cash, and we will pay more than Chinese banks will.
Savers swamped the company seeking interest rates that were significantly higher than the low rates fixed by the government. By early February, 81 million people had signed up for the company's money market product called Yu'e Bao, which translates as "leftover treasure."
The fund, which was established by Alipay, a unit of Alibaba, now has $40 billion in assets under management, making it the country's biggest money market fund.
Other big Chinese Internet companies have followed suit, promising even higher returns than Yu'e Bao. The result is an assault on one of the crucial instruments the Chinese government uses to manage the economy: interest rates.
"This is the beginning of interest rate liberalization," says Chang Chun, who teaches at Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Advanced Institute of Finance. "People want to get a higher yield on their savings deposits, and so this is one way to get around the regulation."
Jack Ma, Alibaba's flamboyant and sharp-tongued chairman, insists China's financial regulations are suffocating smaller investors and average consumers. He has vowed to shake up the country's banking and financial services sector. "The financial industry needs spoilers to make a revolution," he said during a speech last June.
The big winners so far are Chinese savers, who now earn up to 7 percent annually on cash deposits. Traditional banks have rarely been so generous. They now pay 3.3 percent.
For years, Chinese policy makers have promised to liberalize interest rates as part of a bold reform effort aimed at letting market forces play a larger role in the economy so that it grows in a more sustainable and healthy way. Perhaps because of strong opposition from banks and other state institutions, the interest rate controls have not yet been lifted.
Analysts say the government's decision to permit Internet companies to offer a wide range of investment and financial services is an effort to create alternatives to state banks and, in effect, loosen interest rate controls.
While the money involved is relatively small -- about $50 billion in a $9 trillion economy -- the phenomenal growth of Internet finance is intensifying competition for deposits and putting pressure on China's dominant state-run banks, which are already struggling to cope with a severe cash squeeze. Internet finance is also emerging at a time when the government is trying to contain the growth of shadow banking, which could be masking huge risks and liabilities that exist outside the purview of regulators.
Not everyone is pleased. In recent weeks, critics have referred to the online products as "vampires sucking blood out of banks," and warned that investors may not be aware of the risks. Chinese regulators said in late February that they are considering new rules to govern the sector.
For their part, the leaders in Internet finance, such as Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, play down the risks of their new investment products. They say they are operating within the law and putting the cash to work in investments that carry low risk. There are, of course, serious challenges ahead for Internet finance in China, analysts say. For instance, although the online deposits are promoted as if they were savings accounts, they are investment products that carry risk. The principle is not guaranteed, and if consumers begin to suffer losses, analysts say, there could be a flood of redemptions.
For the last decade, the government has aided state-run banks by placing a ceiling on the savings deposit rate and a floor on bank lending rates. The wide spread between the two, known as the net interest spread, has helped banks pocket fat profits that they needed to restructure after massive losses in the 1990s.
Savers, on the other hand, have seen the value of their cash deposits deteriorate, since the rate of inflation has usually been higher than the government-controlled deposit rate. Economists say the policy has acted like a tax on savers.
It has also forced some wealthy Chinese investors to channel their money into hard assets: art, gold and property. In recent years, many investors have also sought higher yields by buying so-called wealth management products through financial leasing companies, trust companies and even local banks. The products, though, can be risky because the money is often used to finance high-interest loans to developers and local government infrastructure companies.
Now, investors are turning to online investment products. The high rates offered by products like Yu'e Bao are exposing weaknesses in China's financial system, where investors have fewer options than in the West, especially with fixed interest rates.
Major Chinese Internet companies are now disrupting those controls by offering enticing yields aimed at ordinary savers with spare cash, people like Gao Yue, a 25-year-old health care consultant in Beijing. Since October, she has put about $15,000 into her new Yu'e Bao account.
"As long as I get a higher return than the regular bank deposit, I'm happy to put my money in there," she said in an interview. "It's better than being beaten by inflation."
Alibaba is the prime mover in the new business. The company has dominated online shopping for years with its popular websites Taobao and Tmall and even established an arm that lends to small businesses. In 2013, the company's online payment service, Alipay (a kind of Chinese version of PayPal) moved into banking and finance by partnering with Tianhong Asset Management, a small, state-backed firm. (In October, Alipay agreed to pay $200 million to acquire a controlling stake in Tianhong.)
Alipay's 800 million registered users were then encouraged to transfer any money left over in their online shopping account to Yu'e Bao, the new online fund set up by Alipay and Tianhong. The rates promoted by Tianhong were higher than those offered by banks.
Soon after, Yu'e Bao took flight. Analysts say Yu'e Bao's appeal is its simplicity and convenience. Alipay account holders can transfer as little as one renminbi, or about 16 cents, into Yu'e Bao and withdraw the money at any time, without being penalized. They can also get daily earnings updates on their mobile phones.
"What makes Yu'e Bao attractive is the small size. You don't need to invest much," says Joe Zhang, a Hong Kong banker. "Small is the killer app."
How does Yu'e Bao get such high rates? Company executives say they invest mostly in the interbank market, where banks and other financial institutions extend loans to one another, usually for short periods. Interbank rates have soared in China during the last year because banks, particularly smaller banks, are desperate for cash.
"Banks are definitely short of cash," says Charlene Chu, who formerly followed Chinese banks for Fitch Ratings. "This is why the interbank rate is going up."
In the United States, PayPal flirted with a similar online money market fund product for years before closing it in 2011. Since then, no major American Internet company has ventured into the banking or investment business.
But Bill Harris, a former chief executive at PayPal, says American Internet companies are missing a big opportunity. "The reason none of them is doing it is they haven't tried," Mr. Harris said. "If a tech firm did it, they could build systems with no humans. Amazon could do it. PayPal could do it. Apple could do it in spades. I think they're missing the boat."
Analysts say soaring interbank rates are a sign of stress in the banking system, which means banks or financial institutions could default, leading to losses; or if conditions improve, interbank rates could slide, meaning lower interest rates and lower returns for consumers.
For now, though, Internet finance looks lucrative. With $40 billion in assets under management, Alibaba and its partners are expected to reap $250 million in revenue annually just from management and service fees. Baidu and Tencent have formed partnerships to offer new funds with other fund companies, including the state-run China Asset Management Company.
"Internet finance is here to stay," says Johnson Chng, a banking expert at A. T. Kearney, the global advisory firm. "Internet players are targeting a segment that banks don't look at."

Abstract: Despite the questions hanging over the economy, Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to continue to slowly ease back on the central bank's stimulus efforts as long as the labor market shows signs of life, keeping in place the policy they announced in December.

Full text:   The economy finished 2013 on a weaker footing than first thought, the government said on Friday, heightening concern that the United States is in the midst of another of the periodic slow patches that have dogged the recovery over the last five years.
The Commerce Department now estimates the economy grew at an annual pace of 2.4 percent in October, November and December, down from an initial estimate of 3.2 percent. The revised figure also represents a substantial slowing from the pace of growth in the third quarter, which totaled 4.1 percent. The department is scheduled to provide one more estimate of growth during the fourth quarter on March 27.
The downward revision comes after new data showing lackluster retail sales, inventory adjustments and a slightly less impressive trade balance late last year. Disappointing reports on job creation in December and January have also prompted fear of continued weakness into the spring of 2014.
The burst of growth last summer and initial signs of robust activity during the autumn had convinced some experts that the economy was finally achieving the kind of momentum that would be sustainable for more than a quarter or two. But the updated data on Friday suggest the economy was still performing well short of the so-called breakout speed economists and policy makers have been hoping for. Instead, it continues to muddle along at a steady but disappointing pace.
From 2010 to 2013, output expanded at an annual rate of about 2.3 percent, strong enough to lift corporate profits and stabilize many parts of the economy, but not fast enough to push unemployment low enough to lead to meaningful wage increases for most workers. That, in turn, has held back big gains in consumer spending, which is responsible for a large share of overall economic growth.
"Originally, we had really glowing expectations for the fourth quarter, but it's been gradually beaten down from really good to merely better-than-trend," said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS Securities. "And there are questions now about how much is because of weather and how much is because the economy didn't take off at the end of 2013 the way everybody expected."
Most experts say they expect the economy to continue to expand at an anemic pace in the first few months of 2014, but they are hopeful that growth will pick up through the remainder of the year. Many economists are looking for growth of less than 2 percent in the first quarter of 2014.
Despite the underwhelming report on the economy, the stock market continued to push higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 16,321.71, up 49.06 points or 0.3 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 's 500-stock index rose 5.16 points or 0.28 percent, closing at 1,859.45, a new high. The Nasdaq composite dropped 10.814 points, or 0.25 percent, and closed at 4,308.12.
In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32 to 100 28/32, while its yield increased to 2.65 percent from 2.64 percent late Thursday.
One reason for the current weakness on the growth front is the more rapid pace of inventory gains in the second half of 2013, which tends to pull growth forward and then hold back production as stockpiles at warehouses and store shelves are gradually wound down. Mr. Berger said he expected the economy to expand by 1 percent in the first quarter of 2014, but he warned that unless demand picked up significantly, further inventory adjustments might mean an even weaker performance than that in the current quarter.
Some optimistic observers, however, say the cold temperatures and repeated snowstorms in many parts of the country since December may be to blame for much of the apparent slowdown, with any temporary hit quickly lifting in the months to come. That's one reason traders and investors are focusing on the February jobs report, expected on March 7, for clues about whether something more fundamental than weather is at work.
The consensus view of economists is that employers added roughly 150,000 positions in February, well above the 113,000 payroll gain in January, with the unemployment rate remaining stable at 6.6 percent.
Despite the questions hanging over the economy, Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to continue to slowly ease back on the central bank's stimulus efforts as long as the labor market shows signs of life, keeping in place the policy they announced in December. The Fed is tapering purchases of government securities by another $10 billion after each meeting of its policy committee.
Besides a smaller contribution from exports and retail sales, growth in the fourth quarter was weighed down by a sharp fall in federal government expenditures, including a 14 percent drop in military spending, because of automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress earlier in 2013 and the government shutdown in October. All told, the plunge in spending by Washington shaved 1.05 percentage points off the rate of growth in the quarter.
With that kind of decline in government spending unlikely to persist into 2014, there is one less headwind facing the economy this year. Similarly, the pressure on growth now from last year's inventory buildup should ease as 2014 progresses.
Another hopeful sign is healthier investment by businesses in equipment and software in the fourth quarter of 2013, an indication companies might finally be comfortable enough to start deploying their huge cash hoards for expansion. "It's a start," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, "and it's encouraging that it happened in the quarter where we had the government shutdown."

Full text:   Updated, 10:25 p.m. | The Federal Reserve is struggling to redefine the central element of its economic stimulus campaign, its plans for short-term interest rates.
The Fed said in 2012 that the fall of the unemployment rate would dictate how soon it ended its policy of holding short-term rates near zero. But the rapid decline of measured unemployment has outpaced the improvement in other economic indicators, and the Fed is looking for a new measuring stick.
Several Fed officials said on Friday in New York that the Fed had yet to settle on a new approach to providing guidance to market participants about the future timing of its actions, echoing remarks on Thursday by the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said he did not expect an agreement by the time of the Fed's next meeting March 18 and 19. "I think forward guidance is a very difficult and subtle policy practice," Mr. Plosser said at a conference on monetary policy sponsored by the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. "I suspect there will be plenty of discussion."
The Fed is facing numerous questions about the value of its efforts.
Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and an avowed skeptic of the Fed's bond-buying campaign, said at the conference that he also doubted the value of forward guidance. And he said he was skeptical of the Fed's ability to control the disruptive consequences of its eventual retreat. "If there is trouble," he said, "it will be monetary action pushing us into a downturn rather than high inflation."
A paper presented at the conference argued that Fed officials might be underestimating the tensions building in the financial system.
Fed officials say they are watching closely, but that they don't see evidence their policies are causing significant problems. "At this stage broadly I don't see concerns," Ms. Yellen said Thursday, although she added that she did see "pockets" of concern, including underwriting standards for leveraged loans.
Ms. Yellen's comments underscored that the Fed, in looking for new problems, has been particularly focused on the use of leverage. Reliance on borrowed money was a major reason for the severity of the recent crisis.
The authors of the new paper fret that the Fed is fighting the last war.
"The absence of leverage may not be sufficient to ensure that monetary policy can disregard concerns for financial stability," wrote Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, and three co-authors. "It does not follow that future bouts of financial instability will operate only through the same mechanism that was present in 2008 and 2009."
Investors move in herds. Even without significant leverage, those movements can build sharply and recede sharply. As a result, the paper concludes, the summer disruption in financial markets when the Fed first hinted at its eventual retreat is likely to be repeated whenever the Fed moves toward raising interest rates.
"The risk is that if you go lower for longer you make the imbalance that you have to unwind bigger," said another of the authors, Anil K. Kashyap, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago. "Maybe you unwind it at a time that the economy is stronger. But if people are irrational, you're going to get more of this herding and the negative effects are going to be worse."
Jeremy C. Stein, a Fed governor, said at the conference that he agreed that leverage was not a necessary ingredient for problems to emerge. He said there was a basic asymmetry in the way markets were responding to Fed policy: Interest rate spreads were contracting gradually as the Fed eased policy, but had the potential to bounce back rapidly as the Fed began to tighten.
But Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, questioned whether these market disruptions would damage the broader economy -- and if not, whether the Fed should care.
Mr. Kocherlakota also said that the Fed had "two to three" years to sort through the issues because economic conditions continued to require aggressive stimulus.
The Fed said in December 2012 that it planned to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. One year later, the Fed added that it planned to keep rates near zero well after unemployment drops under that mark. The rate was 6.6 percent in January.
Officials agree the Fed now needs to say more. The challenge is that investors respond to clear and simple guidance but, as the economy heals, the Fed wants to preserve flexibility to calibrate its campaign.
Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said on Friday that the Fed needed clear and simple goals, although he did not propose a specific set of new thresholds. He also called for the Fed to make clear that it would tolerate inflation above its 2 percent target to increase employment more quickly.
"These messages," he said, "need to be repeated -- over and over again."
Mr. Plosser, a skeptic about the need for additional efforts to stimulate the economy, said he believed the challenge was more fundamental. Even if the Fed is clear, it will not be seen as credible, because investors will regard its guidance as a forecast contingent on economic conditions and not a commitment.
"Policy makers cannot maintain discretion and simultaneously commit to forward guidance and expect that guidance to be effective," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: According to the data on Friday, consumer prices in the 18-nation euro zone rose at an annualized rate of 0.8 percent in February, unchanged from the revised figure for January.

Full text:   PARIS -- Inflation in the euro zone remained stuck at a very low level in February, while the jobless rate was unchanged in January, official reports showed on Friday, providing the European Central Bank with crucial data before its monetary policy meeting next week.
The central bank is concerned that, with unemployment depressing demand, extremely low inflation could ultimately bring on a debt spiral that hurts borrowers and already-weak banks. Whether the latest data will prompt any action by the central bank is hard to predict.
On Thursday, at an international meeting of central bankers in Frankfurt, the central bank's president, Mario Draghi, was sticking to his script of recent weeks, which so far has resulted in the bank's taking no new action to stimulate the euro zone economy. "Overall, we see the euro area's economic recovery gradually taking hold, albeit at a slow and uneven pace," Mr. Draghi said in a speech.
Mr. Draghi expressed concern about the low level of prices, but added, "We are clearly not in deflation," a condition he defined as "a self-reinforcing fall in prices that is broad-based across items and across countries."
According to the data on Friday, consumer prices in the 18-nation euro zone rose at an annualized rate of 0.8 percent in February, unchanged from the revised figure for January. The "core" inflation rate, which excludes energy and food prices, ticked up to 1 percent from 0.8 percent in January, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported from Luxembourg.
The jobless rate in January for the euro zone remained at 12 percent, Eurostat reported. For the full European Union, made up of 28 nations, unemployment stood at 10.8 percent, also unchanged.
The numbers contrast with the United States' jobless rate of 6.6 percent in January. But questions remain about the strength of the American recovery.
Revised data released on Friday in Washington indicated that the economy in the United States grew at a slower pace in the fourth quarter of 2013 than first thought, weighed down by disappointing retail sales, inventory adjustments and a less robust trade balance.
The Commerce Department now estimates that the American economy grew 2.4 percent in October, November and December, down from an initial estimate of 3.2 percent released in late January. At 2.4 percent, the revised figure represents a substantial slowing from the pace of growth in the third quarter, which was 4.1 percent.
Most experts predict that the American economy will continue to expand at a lackluster pace in the first several months of 2014, with growth picking up over the remainder of the year. Economists are looking for growth of about 2 percent in the first quarter.
While the European headline numbers were largely in line with market expectations, investors read the small increase in the core inflation rate as making it less likely that the European Central Bank would take policy action when it meets next week, and the euro jumped 0.6 percent to its highest level of the year, at $1.3802.
The euro rose against the dollar, reflecting diminishing expectations of a rate cut by the central bank next week. The Federal Reserve is holding its own benchmark, the federal funds rate, at a record low near zero. With the European bank's key rate at 0.25 percent, money managers have an incentive to park funds in short-term euro securities to eke out a small premium over what they would get in dollar investments.
Officially, the euro zone has been gradually recovering since early 2013, its economy growing at a 1.1 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, estimated on Tuesday that the currency bloc would grow 1.2 percent in 2014.
That growth is too weak to make much of a dent in the region's record joblessness, however, and Mr. Rehn said that he expected the euro zone jobless rate to fall only to 11.7 percent by next year. Eurostat said on Friday that 26.2 million people across Europe are currently classified as unemployed, including more than 5.5 million young people.
The jobless rate varies widely between countries. Austria, at 4.9 percent, and Germany, at 5 percent, are the lowest in the European Union. But Spain, at 25.8 percent, and Greece, at 28 percent in December (the latest data available), are both experiencing depression-level unemployment.
In Italy, where the new government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is grappling with political turmoil and a stagnant economy, the jobless rate rose to 12.9 percent, the highest in decades, from 12.7 percent in December.
Rolf Campos, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Navarra, Spain, said the rebound in core prices might reassure the central bank, making it feel "less pressed to do something to prevent undershooting" its target of keeping prices rising at a level of just under 2 percent.
The concerns over deflation may be overstated, he added, as "low inflation rates are actually showing that the healing process has begun in the European periphery."
Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, predicted before the data was released that the European Central Bank would cut its main interest rate target, currently at a record low of 0.25 percent, when it meets next week.
But the inflation report "weakens the position of the doves in the E.C.B. governing council," he said after the Eurostat report. "The decision on interest rates on Thursday is therefore quite open."
Central bank officials may decide to find another way to provide monetary stimulus, he said, perhaps by using technical measures to increase the money supply, while allowing the central bank to hold the interest rate weapon in reserve.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   While some regional airlines have reported difficulties hiring new pilots in the last year, a government watchdog said on Friday that it had found "mixed evidence" that the industry was actually facing a shortage of qualified pilots.
Airlines may need to hire as many as 4,500 pilots a year for the next decade to replace an expected wave of retirements. Regional airlines in recent months have complained they cannot find qualified pilots and might need to cancel some flights and cut back on routes as a result.
But a new report by the Government Accountability Office found that while some economic indicators pointed to a possible shortage, others suggested that there were still enough pilots to meet the demands of growing air travel. Part of the problem is that airlines are not offering competitive salaries to attract young pilots.
The G.A.O. found that there were a lot of qualified pilots in the United States, but some might be flying for the military or for foreign airlines. Many also work in an entirely different industry.
There are more than 130,000 registered pilots under the age of 65 with an active pilot certificate, according to F.A.A. data. More than 72,000 pilots were employed by United States airlines in 2012. But the report said another 105,000 pilots had instrument ratings and commercial certificates and could pursue a career as a commercial pilot if they chose.
"Whether these pilots choose to seek employment with U.S. airlines depends on the extent to which pilot job opportunities arise, and on the wages and benefits airlines offer," the report said.
The pilot unemployment rate, about 2.7 percent, is much lower than the national average, which suggests a labor shortage. From 2000 to 2012, however, weekly earnings for pilots dropped by 9.5 percent adjusted for inflation, and pilot employment fell by 12 percent, which is evidence that demand for pilots has not outstripped supply.
The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents more than 50,000 pilots, said the report underlined the fact that there was no actual shortage of qualified pilots. "There, is however, a shortage of qualified pilots willing to fly for substandard wages and inadequate benefits," it said in a statement.
The pilot union said airlines had failed to anticipate the wave of retirements as well as new rules, drafted five years ago, that recently raised qualification requirements for new pilots.
Eleven out of 12 regional airlines did not meet their targets for entry-level pilots last year, the G.A.O. report said. Regional airlines account for half of all domestic flights. The average entry salary at a regional carrier is $22,400.
Mainline airlines did not report similar concerns, since they hire mostly from the ranks of experienced pilots among regional carriers. Their entry-level salaries are usually twice as high as those of regional carriers. Pilots can also expect gradual pay increases as they move up in seniority and fly bigger jets. A senior captain at a mainline carrier can earn more than $200,000 a year in base pay, the report said.
The industry is also adapting to new federal rules that require airlines to hire new pilots as first officers provided they have flown a minimum of 1,500 hours, instead of 250 hours previously. The new rules, which came into effect in January, were drawn in response to the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in 2009. Investigators blamed pilot error for the accident near Buffalo, which killed 50 people.
The G.A.O. report also cautioned that the high cost of a pilot's education and training might lead to fewer people signing up for flight schools and might lead to fewer pilots in the future. The cost of flight training and an academic education to get a four-year aviation degree, as well as additional ratings needed by commercial airlines, can total more than $100,000.
It suggested various policies to attract and train future pilots. Those include increasing wages and bonuses for new hires, helping to pay for pilot training programs, or changing the contractual terms between mainline and regional airlines to help increase revenue at the regional carriers.

Abstract: Not only do they forecast an economy with less growth than in any comparable period since the Great Depression, they think interest rates will rise substantially, to the great discomfort of the federal government, which will have to pay ever-rising amounts of interest to service the rising national debt. "If we are bound to settle into a world of limited growth and low inflation," said Robert J. Barbera, the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University, "real rates are quite unlikely to rebound to the levels witnessed in the halcyon days of 3 percent-plus economic expansions."

Full text:   The part of the past that you deem most relevant can be critical in determining your outlook for the future. And nowhere is that clearer than in the changing economic forecasts that come out of the Congressional Budget Office.
This year's short-term and long-term economic forecasts are substantially worse than last year's, even though the economy performed better than expected in 2013. What changed was that the C.B.O. economists essentially decided that they would no longer treat the recent years of poor economic performance as a sort of outlier. They have seen enough of a slow economy to begin to think that we should get used to sluggishness.
They think that Americans will earn less than they previously expected, that fewer of them will want jobs and that fewer will get them. They think companies will invest less and earn less. The economy, as measured by growth in real gross domestic product, will settle into a prolonged period in which it grows at an average rate of just 2.1 percent. From 2019 through 2024, job growth will average less than 70,000 a month.
Not only do they forecast an economy with less growth than in any comparable period since the Great Depression, they think interest rates will rise substantially, to the great discomfort of the federal government, which will have to pay ever-rising amounts of interest to service the rising national debt.
It is a dreary, depressing prospect.
It is also almost certainly wrong.
Why is it wrong? It is highly unlikely that we will have both an anemic economy and high long-term interest rates. Both are required to achieve the dire budget consequences forecast by the C.B.O. One would not be enough.
"If we are bound to settle into a world of limited growth and low inflation," said Robert J. Barbera, the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University, "real rates are quite unlikely to rebound to the levels witnessed in the halcyon days of 3 percent-plus economic expansions."
Of course, forecasts are often wrong, and economists, like the rest of us, can have different views. But the C.B.O. forecast has an official nonpartisan imprimatur. Its views are likely to shape congressional debate and action.
This is reminiscent of one of the great errors committed by the C.B.O., back in 2001.
The late 1990s were a boom time in which tax receipts came in well above forecasts year after year. The C.B.O., to the annoyance of many in Congress who wanted to cut taxes, kept forecasting that tax receipts would decline to their historic levels.
Then, in its outlook issued at the beginning of 2001, the C.B.O. gave in. It decided that the increase in tax receipts was permanent and forecast that it would continue. "Most of the improvement in C.B.O.'s budget outlook," it said at the time, "results from changes in economic projections." It said growth would be greater, interest rates lower and revenue higher than it previously expected. By 2006, budget surpluses would have paid off all the outstanding Treasury securities.
That forecast was among the worst in history -- and not just because the newly inaugurated president, George W. Bush, used the C.B.O. report to push through a large tax cut. In that very year, 2001, we found out why tax receipts had been far higher than expected -- a reason that seems obvious now but did not then.
The reason was the unusual nature of the technology stock bull market. It had to do with all the stock options that were being issued and cashed in, making lucky insiders fabulously rich. They paid taxes on those profits at ordinary income tax rates.
In normal times, such increased individual tax receipts would be offset by lower corporate tax payments because companies can deduct every dollar of option profit as an expense. But much -- perhaps most -- of the options profits in the late 1990s and 2000 went to executives from companies that were not paying taxes. Many of the companies had never earned a penny; some never would. They had no use for an additional tax deduction.
When the bull market collapsed, options profits stopped arriving. Tax receipts would have plunged even if there had been no Bush tax cuts.
What that error has in common with this year's report is that in each case the C.B.O. decided to change its assumptions to bring its forecasts more in line with recent history.
"Most of the increase in projected deficits results from lower projections for the growth of real G.D.P. and for inflation, which have reduced projected revenues between 2014 and 2023 by $1.4 trillion," the new report states. It has looked at the last five business cycles -- most importantly the recent one -- and concluded that its old estimates were just too optimistic, being based on the history before the Great Recession.
One change the office has made is to assume that the labor force -- the pool of people available to accept jobs -- is going to continue to decline as it has during the recession and its aftermath. Part of the decline is the result of demographics, with a larger part of the population past normal retirement age, but much of the rest has until now been viewed as most likely temporary.
In a speech this week to the National Association for Business Economics, Douglas W. Elmendorf, the C.B.O.'s director, said he now thinks a significant part of that decline represents "discouraged workers who have dropped out of the labor force permanently." The new forecasts assume that the labor force participation rate -- the proportion of people of working age who want to work -- will continue to decline.
One reason for that predicted decline is the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The C.B.O. estimates that a significant number of workers have continued to work primarily because they need health insurance at a reasonable cost. With such insurance available, they will choose to retire.
That hardly sounds like a problem for the economy. Those who do choose to retire presumably will be happier and can afford to do so. Others will be promoted into their jobs and will in turn be succeeded by others. Eventually, that will help some unemployed people obtain jobs.
But the C.B.O. does not see that as good news, at least in the long term. The assumption is that the number of jobs filled is a proportion of the number of people seeking work, and that if fewer people are looking for work, fewer people will be getting work. As a result, there will be less national income and thus less tax revenue.
There is one economic theory that would justify a forecast of higher interest rates when the economy is weak. That is a crisis of confidence, as illustrated by some peripheral economies in the euro zone. The more they needed to borrow, the more fearful of possible default the lenders became and the higher the interest rate they demanded.
There is no sign that is happening to the United States, in no small measure because it can borrow in the currency it prints. Recent history indicates that the slower the United States economy is, the more investors value the security of Treasuries, and the lower interest rates fall.
That is what has happened in Japan, whose economy has been weak for many years and whose debt burden -- relative to the size of the country -- is much larger than the one in the United States. It is able to borrow in its own currency, and rates have been close to zero for a long time.
The C.B.O. assumes that productivity growth will be much lower than it had expected and far below what it was in previous cycles. It assumes that as budget deficits pile up, private borrowers will be crowded out of the market and that as a result there will be less business investment and even less growth, causing tax revenue to fall further.
There is a risk that those who fear deficits will seize on this forecast to argue that much more austerity is needed now -- a move that would only serve to slow the economy and make dire forecasts more likely to be accurate.
I have no reason to doubt that the economists at C.B.O. are sincere in their pessimism. But it would be good if there were an alternative forecast out there -- one that assumes the sky is not going to fall, and that the fact the economy has been weak does not indicate that it will always be so, any more than the strong economy of the 1990s was proof that the strength would endure indefinitely. Perhaps a group of economists, possibly including some C.B.O. alumni, will take on that task.

Full text:   ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Caught between a gridlocked Congress and a Highway Trust Fund that will soon be broke, President Obama on Wednesday urged lawmakers to overhaul corporate and business taxes to pay for repairing and replacing the nation's aging roads, rails, bridges and tunnels.
Speaking at a cavernous renovated transit hub here, Mr. Obama avoided the politically treacherous solution that most transportation experts say is necessary in the short term: raising the federal gas tax that has been frozen at 18.4 cents per gallon for the past two decades. Officials said Mr. Obama opposes a gas-tax increase.
Instead, the president offered a stopgap proposal for fixing some of the nation's crumbling infrastructure that White House officials hope will appeal to Mr. Obama's Republican adversaries. Even as the president spoke in Minnesota, House Republicans offered a broader tax overhaul plan that mimicked some of the White House provisions.
"There are leaders in both parties who are willing to reach across the aisle when it comes to infrastructure," Mr. Obama said to an enthusiastic crowd. But he said there were "some Republicans in Congress who have refused to act," and he chided his opponents for failing to embrace obvious opportunities to create jobs.
"I guess it's not that they don't like roads," the president said, "they just don't want to pay for it. It doesn't work like that."
New legislation to pay for transportation projects is an urgent priority for both parties because the highway fund is nearing insolvency. Anthony R. Foxx, the transportation secretary, has said the fund could begin "bouncing checks" by this summer. That would force a halt to construction projects around the country, officials have said, and could undermine as many as 700,000 jobs.
The president's proposal, which he first suggested in a speech last summer in Chattanooga, Tenn., would eliminate business and corporate tax loopholes to finance a four-year, $302 billion transportation bill. White House officials declined to be specific, but said they would try to eliminate incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas.
Advocates for increased transportation funding praised the president's efforts, but said the idea fell far short of what was needed. Kathleen Bower, a spokeswoman for AAA, the automobile association, called it a "one-time patch" and said a gas-tax increase was "the most viable, responsible and effective near-term solution." Edward G. Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania and co-chairman of Building America's Future, called it an "attractive political compromise."
"It's not enough, it's not nearly enough," Mr. Rendell said. But he added that a gas-tax increase was not currently "a viable political option."
Since Congress created it in 1932, the gasoline tax has been the chief source of revenue for building American highways. It was designed as a classic user fee -- drivers pay for construction and maintenance of the roads they use. Throughout the 20th century, it financed the construction and maintenance of the interstate highway system, and presidents from both parties regularly signed gas-tax increases to keep revenue on pace with inflation and the nation's growing infrastructure needs. Ronald Reagan raised the gas tax twice.
But the tax, which is not indexed to inflation, has not been raised since 1993, when Bill Clinton increased it by 4.3 cents to its current rate.
Two years later, the conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist asked Republican lawmakers to sign on to a pledge never to raise taxes. Since then, any proposal to increase the tax has been dead on arrival in Washington. But according to the Congressional Budget Office, the highway trust fund is now on the brink of bankruptcy. Absent an injection of new funding, the budget office projects that the fund will run out of money by next year, racking up a $77 billion deficit through 2019 and a $172 billion deficit through 2024.
White House officials said Mr. Obama's plan would use savings from business tax changes for a one-time, $150 billion infusion of cash into the trust fund to make it solvent. The president also proposed spending $600 million on so-called Tiger grants, which allow states to compete for additional money for regional transportation projects.
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama made the case privately for his transportation funding proposal to the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, during an hourlong Oval Office meeting, according to officials with knowledge of the conversation. Mr. Boehner, who has said that Republicans are eager to overhaul and simplify the corporate tax system, nonetheless expressed skepticism to Mr. Obama on Tuesday about the proposal to finance transportation spending with business tax changes, the officials said.
Still, some members of both parties have shown some optimism about the possibility of a compromise on a transportation bill, even in an otherwise gridlocked Congress whose members are facing re-election in a matter of months.
House Republicans on Wednesday released their own proposal for a tax overhaul that would cut the top corporate income tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent and reduce the number of individual income tax brackets to two from seven. A spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said lawmakers would review the president's proposal.

Abstract: Violent protests, especially among students, have a lengthy history in Venezuela, to the point where the more radical student demonstrators have long been referred to as "rock throwers" -- a term that applied to no small number of officials in the current government in their university days.

Full text:   SAN CRISTÓBAL, Venezuela -- No one here is hiding the heavy artillery, such as it is. Students camping out on an intersection of this city, which has become a battleground between the authorities and antigovernment protesters, have a variety of homemade weapons -- mortars to lob small, noisy explosives, miniature firebombs, slingshots, clubs and nasty-looking things called Miguelitos made from hoses festooned with nails.
"We're not peaceful here," said Andryth Niño, 19, toying with a two-and-a-half-foot-long Miguelito one night this week as she sat with companions on the curb near the students' ragtag camp, which had been rebuilt after being flattened a few nights earlier by National Guard troops. "You can't be peaceful when they're always attacking you."
Opposition political leaders and protest organizers in Caracas, the capital, have been urging demonstrators to use nonviolent means to confront the government, and most of the large marches and rallies around the country, including here, have been carried out peacefully.
Yet the appeal to nonviolence had little echo among some of the most determined protesters in this western city, where the rallies started this month and where confrontations with government troops have been most intense.
About a dozen people have died around the country in violence associated with the protests. Several were fatally shot, and many more have been wounded. Security forces have been implicated in some of the deaths.
Last week, President Nicolás Maduro sent extra troops to contain the unrest in this bastion of the political opposition, and in recent days National Guard soldiers have swept through residential neighborhoods, firing tear gas and plastic buckshot at residents, menacing or detaining protesters and destroying motorcycles and other property.
Pointing to the casualties around the country and the aggressive tactics, many protesters said they saw no choice but to do what was needed to act in self-defense.
"We don't attack; we defend ourselves," said Daniel Tinoco, 23, a student leader at the encampment, who wears gloves during confrontations with troops to protect his hands while throwing rocks and hurling back tear gas canisters.
The protests started with students but have spread to other sectors of society. Last weekend, in middle-class neighborhoods around this city, residents threw rocks at National Guard troops whom they saw as invaders and prepared firebombs as they guarded barricades made of heaps of junk, tree limbs and other materials.
On Sunday, a 34-year-old protester was killed when he fell from a rooftop where he had been hiding from troops who were firing tear gas in the neighborhood.
At a memorial service that night for the protester, Jimmy Vargas, friends said his death would make them more aggressive in their fight with government forces. Someone hung a sign on a fence near the spot where Mr. Vargas fell, his blood still staining the ground.
"Jimmy, you didn't go away," the sign said. "You are here in every rock that is thrown in your name."
The protests have fed tensions with the United States, which expelled three midlevel Venezuelan diplomats on Tuesday. The move was in retaliation for the expulsion last week by Mr. Maduro of three American consular officials who the Venezuelan government claimed had been fomenting violent student protests, a charge Washington denied.
Even though Venezuela is a major oil supplier to the United States, the two countries have long been at odds politically and have not had ambassadors in each other's capitals since 2010. On Tuesday, however, the foreign minister, Elías Jaua, said Venezuela would nominate a new ambassador to Washington, after Mr. Maduro said he wanted someone to explain to Americans what was going on in his country.
The protests have given voice to a host of complaints, transforming into a prolonged howl of frustrated rage by opponents of the country's socialist-inspired government. Demonstrators denounce soaring crime, high inflation and long lines to buy food and other basic goods that are in chronically short supply. Now the demands also include the release of jailed protesters and a halt to the tactics used against demonstrators.
Violent protests, especially among students, have a lengthy history in Venezuela, to the point where the more radical student demonstrators have long been referred to as "rock throwers" -- a term that applied to no small number of officials in the current government in their university days.
As the current round of protests has spread, young demonstrators in Caracas have frequently engaged in battles with the police that have often seemed choreographed -- generally, a brief thrust and counterthrust that ends with the rock throwers fleeing tear gas and plastic buckshot, only to regroup later.
The subject of violence is a delicate one, and most demonstrations in recent weeks have been peaceful.
Nonetheless, Mr. Maduro has focused attention on acts of violence and vandalism. He has repeatedly labeled the protesters as fascists who are part of a wider plot to topple him. And as for the demonstrators in Táchira, the border state of which San Cristóbal is the capital, Mr. Maduro claims their ranks have been infiltrated by right-wing Colombian paramilitary fighters sent by his enemies.
He has jailed a prominent opposition leader, Leopoldo López, accusing him on television of seeking to cause a coup by training youths to spread violence at demonstrations. Mr. López, the former mayor of a wealthy part of Caracas, denies the charge and has repeatedly called for demonstrators to act peacefully.
Many protesters here and elsewhere say that they have been inspired by recent events in Ukraine, where months of civic unrest culminated in violent street battles that forced President Viktor F. Yanukovych from power.
"We've been watching what's happening in Ukraine," said Luigi Pallottini, 19, a student at the encampment. "We've been in contact with them through social media."
Protesters said that they had studied videos of the Ukrainian revolt and recent uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere, and that they had learned tactics from them, like how to organize at barricades to watch for the arrival of security forces, how to make smoke bombs and how to block the view of the drivers of tanks or armored riot vehicles by heaving glass bottles filled with paint at the vehicles' windows.
The students and other protesters generally say that they want Mr. Maduro to leave office, but in an orderly manner, such as by resignation or a recall election.
Still, at times the whole business has the naïve feel of a boy's adventure tale.
One recent night, a pair of students covered their faces with hoods and slunk off under the glare of streetlights with a brace of small firebombs for what they said was a strike against a National Guard post.
A short time later they returned, elated, announcing that their mission had been a success. A counterattack was anticipated. The camp sprang into action with an improvised arsenal. That included homemade mortars made from steel tubes. A small bag of explosive powder is put inside the tube and a fuse is lit. When it goes off it makes a loud bang and launches a firework-like projectile about half a block.
Someone else had jammed a piece of brick on the end of a broken golf club and had another weapon, too -- a slingshot, with marbles for ammunition. Others picked up metal rods, rocks, Miguelitos or more firebombs, which here are generally made from pony-size beer bottles with a few ounces of gasoline.
Scruffy and unwashed from several days at the camp, the students donned an array of protective gear, including motorcycle helmets, construction dust masks and gloves. One had made a shield from a round piece of metal. Two protesters came down a rope from the terrace of what appeared to be an abandoned house on the corner, while another remained behind, perhaps ready to toss projectiles from above.
"This," he said, "is the fort."
Yet the counterattack never arrived, and most of them eventually wandered off to get some sleep.

Full text:   In the five years that have elapsed since the direst days of the financial crisis, we've learned much about how the nation's high-level banking regulators worked to keep the debacle from turning into a full-blown economic Depression. Tales of these herculean efforts have emerged in books by some of the major players, and in the exhaustive testimony they've presented before congressional inquisitors and others trying to determine what went wrong and why.
Still, there is more to learn.
That's the message in the transcripts released last Friday by the Federal Reserve Board, detailing the 2008 meetings of its powerful Federal Open Market Committee. This treasure trove -- almost 2,000 pages of conversation and dialogue by the committee members and other Fed officials -- sheds light on the rescue of Bear Stearns, the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers and the bailout of the American International Group.
My initial takeaway from these voluminous transcripts is that they paint a disturbing picture of a central bank that was in the dark about each looming disaster throughout 2008. That meant that the nation's top bank regulators were unprepared to deal with the consequences of each new event.
Consider comments about the strength of the United States banking system made at the meeting on March 18, 2008. This sit-down occurred just days after the collapse of Bear Stearns and the sale of its assets to JPMorgan Chase, in a deal brokered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
While most of the discussion at this meeting covered the possibility that the country had already slipped into a recession and that inflation might rear its head, the topic of whether the nation's banks were adequately capitalized did come up. That these institutions were inadequately capitalized was already obvious to some regulators, but that was not the view of Timothy F. Geithner, who was then the president of the New York Fed and vice chairman of the Fed's Board of Governors.
"It is very hard to make the judgment now that the financial system as a whole or the banking system as a whole is undercapitalized," Mr. Geithner said, adding that "some people are out there saying that."
He continued: "Based on everything we know today, if you look at very pessimistic estimates of the scale of losses across the financial system, on average relative to capital, they do not justify that concern."
To Mr. Geithner, the nattering naysayers raising alarms about the financial system's soundness were a bigger problem than the one that they were trying to draw attention to. "There is nothing more dangerous in what we're facing now," he said, "than for people who are knowledgeable about this stuff to feed these broad concerns about our credibility and about the basic core strength of the financial system."
On Friday, Mr. Geithner did not return an email requesting comment.
To be sure, Mr. Geithner was not alone in this view. Just two weeks earlier Donald L. Kohn, another Fed vice chairman, told the Senate Banking Committee: "The problems in the mortgage and housing markets have been highly unusual and clearly some banking organizations have failed to manage their exposures well and have suffered losses as a result. But in general these losses should not threaten their viability."
Wanna bet?
Equally distressing, as the credit storm gathered strength after the Bear Stearns collapse, the minutes show little comprehension of the perils posed by two other teetering financial giants: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This is odd, given that the declining financial position of these mortgage finance heavyweights -- they guaranteed or issued $5 trillion in mortgages -- was known at the time. Yet the companies were barely mentioned at the meetings before the one that occurred on Aug. 5. Just a month later, the companies had to be taken over by taxpayers.
Also missing from much of the discussion early in 2008 was the recognition that government rescues of reckless financial firms created moral hazard.
The March 18 meeting came just two days after the Bear Stearns rescue. But almost no concerns were raised at the meeting that by aiding this brokerage firm, other firms would assume that the government would also come to their rescue.
The Bear Stearns rescue, after all, cemented the notion that the taxpayer would be there to bail out aggressive financiers. And yet there was only one passing reference to this policy peril. It came from Frederic S. Mishkin, a governor who left the Fed later that year.
Outlining his bearish views on the economy and deteriorating credit markets, Mr. Mishkin noted another cost associated with the deepening financial problems.
"One result," he said, "is that we've just expanded the safety net to a much wider set of institutions, and we are in a brave new world here, and it is very disturbing."
And that was it. Nothing more about this crucial issue was said at that meeting.
Six months later, amid Lehman's failure, they did start to talk about moral hazard.
In public statements since that time, the Fed has maintained that the government didn't have the tools to save Lehman. These documents appear to tell a different story.
Some comments made at the Sept. 16 meeting, directly after Lehman filed for bankruptcy, indicate that letting Lehman fail was more of a policy decision than a passive one.
For example, James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, noted the positive message that the decision sent to the market. "By denying funding to Lehman suitors," Mr. Bullard said, "the Fed has begun to re-establish the idea that markets should not expect help at each difficult juncture."
Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, echoed this view. "What we did with Lehman I obviously think is good," he said. "It has had an effect on market participants' assessment of the likelihood of other firms getting support."
But he added that the Fed's public stance on Lehman's failure was confusing the markets.
"All the language around not supporting Lehman was of a one-off nature," he said. " So I'm not sure about the extent to which we've diminished uncertainty about the likelihood of support going forward, and I think that such uncertainty is likely to exacerbate financial volatility in the months ahead until we can make more progress on articulating a reasonably principled policy on when we're going to intervene and when we're not, or at least enhancing clarity about that."
Mr. Lacker was right to wonder. Later that day, the government rescued the American International Group, the beleaguered insurance company, and its big-bank counterparties.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama's annual budget request to Congress will propose a significant change in how the government pays to fight wildfires, administration officials said, a move that they say reflects the ways in which climate change is increasing the risk for and cost of those fires.
The wildfire funding shift is one in a series of recent White House actions related to climate change as Mr. Obama tries to highlight the issue and build political support for his administration's more muscular policies, like curbing carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. On Monday, Mr. Obama plans to describe his proposal at a meeting in Washington with governors of Western states that have been ravaged recently by severe drought and wildfires.
The proposal will ask Congress to pay the costs of fighting extreme wildfires in the same way it finances the federal response to disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes, the officials said. When unpredictable events like Hurricane Sandy are destructive enough to be declared disasters by the president, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is authorized to exceed its annual budget and draw on a special disaster account. The account is adjusted each year to reflect the 10-year average cost of responding to such events.
Mr. Obama's budget proposal would create a similar exception for the Interior and Agriculture Departments, which have agencies that are responsible for wildfire response. In recent years, as wildfires have become more frequent and intense in the Western United States, the cost of fighting the fires has soared.
In real dollar terms, adjusted for inflation, the Forest Service and Interior Department spent an average of $1.4 billion in annual wildfire protection from 1991 to 1999, according to a report by Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit research group. But that spending has more than doubled -- from 2002 to 2012, the agencies spent an average of $3.5 billion to fight wildfires.
In a conference call with reporters last summer, the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, said: "When you take resources to suppress fires, you sometimes have to take it from the very resources that you would use to restore property or to prevent fires to begin with. And that just basically shifts the risk to a much longer-term and more serious risk."
A series of scientific studies have warned that increasing carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels could cause the planet to warm by more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, leading to rising sea levels, stronger storms and more extreme droughts. A study published last year by Forest Service researchers concluded that wildfires were expected to increase 50 percent across the United States under a changing climate, and over 100 percent in areas of the Western United States by 2050.
In his second term, Mr. Obama has taken on the politically contentious challenge of tackling climate change. At the center of his climate policy is a set of controversial Environmental Protection Agency regulations to curb carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants -- rules that could shutter hundreds of such plants. As he tries to build political support for the rules, Mr. Obama has sought to make the case that the costs of damage from climate change will be far greater than the costs of mitigating climate change.
Mr. Obama's budget request, which he will deliver to Congress next month, will include several other direct references to the costs of climate change, according to a White House official. This month, Mr. Obama announced that his budget would include a request from Congress for a $1 billion "climate resiliency fund."
While there is intense resistance from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to most of Mr. Obama's climate policies, the wildfire funding proposal has bipartisan support. His proposal is based on a Senate bill sponsored by Senators Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho. A similar bill in the House also has bipartisan support. A coalition of environmentalists, sportsmen and timber producers has lobbied in favor of the bill.

Full text:   On Friday, the Federal Reserve released the transcripts of its policy meetings of 2008, a year that began with little hint that a recession and a world financial crisis were unfolding. The transcripts provide new insights into the debates, miscalculations and actions of the Fed's policy making council, the Federal Open Market Committee, in assessing and countering the crisis. In a running analysis of the documents, reporters for The New York Times shared their findings.
12:45 P.M. | Yellen's Call for Stimulus
Until now, the world has known much about Janet L. Yellen's economic views during the crisis, but little about her views on the government bailouts.
In late October 2008, Ms. Yellen, then head of the Fed's regional bank in San Francisco, said she strongly supported recent efforts to prop up the banking system. But she said it was not nearly enough. In tune with many critics of the government bailouts, Ms. Yellen said ordinary Americans also needed help.
Alluding to the bailouts, she said: "We are fighting an uphill battle against falling home prices, an economy in recession and collapsing confidence. It is not clear whether these steps will reopen credit flows to households and businesses, especially those with less than sterling credit."
At a time when many at the Fed were wary of stimulus packages, Ms. Yellen's concerns led her to argue for more: "Given the seriousness of the situation, I believe that we should put as much stimulus into the system as we can as soon as we can."
-- Nathaniel Popper
12:37 P.M. | Concern About the Blame Game
The blame game, focusing on the handling of Lehman's collapse, seemed to be getting to senior Fed officials by the end of October 2008. Within the privacy of the F.O.M.C. meeting of Oct. 28-29, Timothy F. Geithner of the New York Fed placed some blame on Congress for making matters worse. He was presumably referring to the House's vote against the Troubled Asset Relief Program at the end of September. Congress approved the program a few days later. But Mr. Geithner said the initial vote had hurt.
"Look particularly at the damage to confidence created by the Congress's actions in the weeks after the legislation was first proposed," he said. He then pressed other committee members to watch their words when talking about the Fed's actions. "But please be very careful, certainly outside this room, about adding to the perception that the actions by this body were a substantial contributor to the erosion in confidence. I think that Don Kohn said it best. The whole framing, which seems to have hardened now, that the world ended with the Lehman bankruptcy is just deeply unfair to the basic truth."
-- Peter Eavis
12:22 P.M. | Unhappiness With Thrift Regulator
As signs of stress in the financial system built, during the summer of 2008, Federal Reserve policy makers were growing frustrated with the activity of other regulators.
In July, Janet L. Yellen, the head of the Fed's regional branch in San Francisco, told her story of dealing with IndyMac as it headed toward collapse. Ms. Yellen said that while her bank was offering IndyMac loans, the Office of Thrift Supervision, IndyMac's primary regulator, was downgrading IndyMac without informing the Fed.
Jeffrey Lacker, the head of the Fed branch in Richmond, expressed his unhappiness with the way the O.T.S. had behaved in the IndyMac case, and other situations he had dealt with: "I think it is outrageous that the O.T.S. downgraded them and didn't inform the San Francisco Fed," Mr. Lacker said. "I hope, Mr. Chairman, that the unacceptability of that sort of behavior is communicated at the highest levels to the O.T.S."
-- Nathaniel Popper
12:11 P.M. | Intricacies of 'Fed Speak'
In a meeting on March 18, Fed officials agreed that the economy had badly deteriorated and was pitching into recession. (They would later find out it had already been contracting for a full quarter.) But they disagreed about what kind of a threat rising inflation might pose to the economy -- and what to tell the public about it. The transcript becomes an object lesson in the intricacies of the famed "Fed speak."
The participants in this discussion are: Donald Kohn, Frederic Mishkin, Ben S. Bernanke, Charles Evans of the Chicago Fed, Brian Madigan, William Dudley, Kevin Warsh, Timothy F. Geithner of the New York Fed, Dennis Lockhart of the Atlanta Fed and Randall Kroszner.
MR. KOHN: On inflation expectations, because they haven't risen very much, I agree with President Geithner. I like the fact that we tell people we are aware, but we could say "have edged higher" or something like that instead of "risen."
MR. MISHKIN: We could use my "smidgen" word, but "edged higher" is better.
MR. KOHN: Went up a smidge.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: All right. President Evans.
MR. EVANS: "Edged higher" is an unusual phrase.
MR. MISHKIN: "Have risen somewhat"?
MR. MADIGAN: I think an issue with "edged higher" is that it really does sound as though you have some very specific measures in mind.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Brian, do you have a thought on "risen" versus "risen somewhat" versus taking it out?
MR. MADIGAN: I think if you take it out that very much raises the question of what to do with that language in red about the factors that would push inflation down. It would be tough to drop the inflation expectations thought and not have inflation expectations mentioned anywhere in the paragraph. There would just be vacant space where you had, at least in previous minutes, referred to it.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Anyone else? Bill.
MR. DUDLEY: Adding just the word "slightly" -- "risen slightly" -- gets to your point.
MR. MISHKIN: "Slightly" or "somewhat" risen.
MR. WARSH: Brian, does "somewhat" mitigate it a little, or does that highlight it?
MR. MADIGAN: I'm not sure. I mean, in my mind it mitigates it.
VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER: Somewhat.
MR. KROSZNER: Is "slightly" better than "somewhat"?
MR. KOHN: "Somewhat" is bigger than "slightly."
MR. EVANS: That is 50 versus 25 in the old days.
MR. LOCKHART: Mr. Chairman, if I understand the discussion about this, when you say "some indicators have risen somewhat," you are getting into territory that seems sort of mealy-mouthed.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Right.
MR. KOHN: "Risen a little"?
MR. KROSZNER: What is wrong with "slightly"?
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: All right.
-- Annie Lowrey
12:06 P.M. | Bernanke Sees Unfair Critique on Lehman
In late October, more than a month after Lehman's collapse and the sharp worsening of the crisis, Ben S. Bernanke took on the question of whether Lehman should have been saved.
Perhaps with an eye on history, he defended the decision, but he was also quick to note the danger of letting financial institutions become too big to fail, a phrase soon to enter the lexicon of the crisis. And one still very much on the mind of policy makers today.
"Also more recently we have heard more of a critique from the left, which is, 'What in the heck were you guys doing letting Lehman fail?"' Mr. Bernanke said. "I think that critique is unfair at a narrow level in that, first, Lehman was a symptom as well as a cause of the recent crisis and, second, the Fed and the Treasury simply had no tools to address both Lehman and the other companies that were under stress at that time."
But with outrage in Europe building, Mr. Bernanke made plain the situation was far from ideal. "I think that criticism is appropriate, though, as directed toward the United States as a whole," he said. "We did not have -- as the Europeans have or as we have F.D.I.C.I.A. for banks -- a system that was set up to allow a reasonable and responsible orderly resolution of nonbank systemically critical institutions."
In any case, given what he termed the "fog of war," Mr. Bernanke astutely split the difference and acknowledged that both sides had a point. It's a point that Mr. Bernanke -- who stepped down as Fed chairman at the end of last month and is now a distinguished fellow in residence at the Brookings Institution -- is sure to tackle again as he writes a memoir of his years at the Fed.
"So given the fog of war -- which has, of course, been intense going back for more than a year," he said at the Oct. 28-29 meeting, "I would defend what we've done in terms of the general direction, acknowledging that execution is not always perfect and that communication is not always perfect."

11:55 A.M. | Benefits of (Earlier) Hindsight
Imagine if we knew in 2011 what was said in 2008. Would it have been easier for those who were right to win the debate about doing more?
-- Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) 21 Feb 14
11:53 A.M. | In April, Even Pessimism Has a Rosy Glow
Janet L. Yellen was known for being one of the most pessimistic members of the Fed's policy making committee in early 2008, but even she was way off in her estimates of the magnitude of what was coming.
At the Fed's two-day meeting in late April, she was very concerned about the future. The Fed's internal projections, she said, represent "one of the most pessimistic economic forecasts; yet I find its recessionary projection quite plausible and see downside risks that could take the economy well below that forecast."
At the same time, though, Ms. Yellen was not envisioning a long recession. She said that while the first half of 2008 would likely see no economic growth, in the second half she was expecting growth of 1.5 percent. That view ended up being far too rosy, as was her assessment at the time that "the likelihood of a severe financial panic has diminished."
Part of the reason for her note of optimism was her faith in the power of government stimulus. She said that a recent fiscal stimulus package and tax rebates would likely "provide a bigger bank for the buck" than similar measures taken in 2001.
"Of course, there is considerable uncertainty about assessing the potential size of these effects," she said. "But over the next few months as the checks go out and the retail sales reports come in, we should get a pretty quick preliminary read on how things are shaping up."
-- Nathaniel Popper
11:47 A.M. | More on the Lehman Decision
Jeffrey M. Lacker, then and now the Richmond Fed president, was confident at the Sept. 16 meeting that letting Lehman Brothers collapse had been the right call.
"What we did with Lehman I obviously think is good," he concluded. "It has had an effect on market participants' assessment of the likelihood of other firms getting support, and I think you would have to attribute at least some of changes in equity prices to that."
And while the stock market might drop in the short term, Mr. Lacker added, there was a "silver lining" to Lehman's collapse. "I don't want to be sanguine about it, but the silver lining to all the disruption that's ahead of us is that it will enhance the credibility of any commitment that we make in the future to be willing to let an institution fail and to risk such disruption again."
Thomas M. Hoenig, then the head of the Kansas City Fed, was similarly concerned that saving Lehman would have sent the wrong signal to Wall Street, the so-called moral hazard argument, which was much invoked at the time.
"I think what we did with Lehman was the right thing because we did have a market beginning to play the Treasury and us, " Mr. Hoenig said, "and that has some pretty negative consequences as well, which we are now coming to grips with."
-- Nelson D. Schwartz
11:45 A.M. | Was It Right to Let Lehman Fail?
Within hours of Lehman's collapse, the debate had begun over whether the decision to let it fail had been the right one. It's a debate that rages to this day, on Wall Street, in Washington and in academia. Eric Rosengren, head of the Boston Fed, wasn't sure, and he astutely warned of the danger that a money-market fund could run into trouble as a result. That quickly happened, as the Reserve Fund 'broke the buck' and sent the crisis into overdrive that week.
"I think it's too soon to know whether what we did with Lehman is right," he said on Sept. 16. "But we took a calculated bet. If we have a run on the money-market funds or if the nongovernment tri-party repo market shuts down, that bet may not look nearly so good."
However, Mr. Rosengren stopped short of saying the decision to let Lehman collapse was the blunder that many overseas officials, like Christine Lagarde, then the French finance minister and now head of the International Monetary Fund, quickly said it was at the time.
"I think we did the right thing given the constraints that we had," Mr. Rosengren said. "I hope we get through this week...There are a lot of lessons learned, but we shouldn't be in a position where we're betting the economy on one or two institutions. That is the situation we were in last weekend. We had no choice. We did what we had to do, but I hope we will find a way to not get into this position."

11:33 A.M. | In January, Divergence on Recession Prospect
In January 2008, the economy had just entered what would become the worst recession since the Great Depression, by many measures.
A slew of economic data -- on housing, industrial production, layoffs, job openings and credit-card defaults -- had come in worse than expected, and Fed officials were attempting to gauge the possibility that a soft patch might turn into a recession.
Both Ben S. Bernanke and Janet L. Yellen were very pessimistic from the outset. "I think there are a lot of indications that we may soon be in a recession," Mr. Bernanke said during a conference call in early January. "I think a garden-variety recession is an acceptable risk, but I am also concerned that such a downturn might morph into something more serious."
Others were more bullish. "While there are tales of woe, none of the 30 C.E.O.'s to whom I talked, outside of housing, see the economy trending into negative territory," said Richard Fisher of the Dallas Fed in January. "They see slower growth. Some of them see much slower growth. None of them at this juncture -- the cover of Newsweek notwithstanding, a great contra-indicator, which by the way shows 'the road to recession' on the issue that is about to come out -- see us going into recession."
And it is in January that Fed officials first predict that the economy is outright contracting -- an assessment that their colleagues would not fully join them in for months.
"The severe and prolonged housing downturn and financial shock have put the economy at, if not beyond, the brink of recession," Ms. Yellen said.
Her colleague Eric Rosengren of the Boston Fed was more definitive: "We could soon be or may already be in a recession."

11:22 A.M. | Keeping the Word 'Crisis' in Reserve
At the March 18 meeting, Frederic Mishkin, an F.O.M.C. member, discussed the semantics of how to publicly discuss what was going on in the markets.
Mr. MISHKIN: We are in a financial crisis, and it is worse than we have experienced in any other episode of financial 'disruption,' which is the word I use. I will not use 'financial crisis' in public. 'Financial disruption' is still a good phrase to use in public, but I really do think that this is a financial crisis. It is surely going to be called that in the next edition of my textbook.
PARTICIPANT: When is it coming out?
Mr. MISHKIN: Wouldn't you like to know!

11:18 A.M. | Geithner and Yellen Debate Bonuses
In January 2008, as the debate about Wall Street bonuses began to come to a boil, Timothy F. Geithner, the Fed president in New York, and Janet L. Yellen, the Fed president in San Francisco, found themselves on opposite sides, with Mr. Geithner defending the Wall Street status quo.
Ms. Yellen pointed to a paper by Raghuram Rajan -- now the head of India's central bank -- about the danger of the structure of Wall Street bonuses. "I don't know what the answer is in terms of changing these practices," she said. "Maybe the market will attend to them, but it seems to me that we have had an awful lot of booms and busts in which this type of incentive played a role."
Mr. Geithner, who has developed a reputation for representing Wall Street's interest during the crisis, pushed back. "Raghu's presentation was mostly about hedge fund compensation, and I think he is mostly wrong when you think about that and the incentive structure," Mr. Geithner said.
He said that reforming bonuses probably wouldn't help much: "What distinguishes how well the guys did is much more subtle around culture, independence and the quality of judgment exercised at the senior level, and this is important because, when you think about what you can do through supervision and regulation, to affect that stuff is hard."
In the end, given the relative lack of reforms to bonuses since the crisis, it would appear that Mr. Geithner won the argument.

11:18 A.M. | 'Already a Historic Week'
On Sept. 16, even as Fed policy makers tried to gauge the depth of the crisis, some quickly concluded that it was an economic threat of historic proportions. In a prescient comment, the head of the Boston Fed realized this wasn't just about Wall Street any more.
"This is already a historic week, and the week has just begun," said Eric S. Rosengren, then and now the president of the Boston Fed. "The failure of a major investment bank, the forced merger of another, the largest thrift and insurer teetering, and the failure of Freddie and Fannie are likely to have a significant impact on the real economy.
-- Nelson D. Schwartz
11:09 A.M. | Another Indicator, in a Mug
On March 18, Richard W. Fisher of the Dallas Fed cited his drinking habits in comments about inflation:
"Most distressing to me was Anheuser-Busch, since I am a beer lover. The cost of input of hops and barley has gone up 3½ percent."
-- Peter Eavis
11:08 A.M. | 'You Need Enough Force'
Size matters when markets are melting down. And that was evident on Sept. 16, as Fed officials debated just how much to make available abroad. William Dudley wasn't afraid to invoke the c-word, either.
"In a crisis you need enough force -- more force than the market thinks is necessary to solve the problem," he said, "and we're going to have to have discussions to determine how much is enough force."
-- Nelson D. Schwartz
11:06 A.M. | You Can't Spell A.E.I.O.U. Without ...
At the March 18 meeting, there was humor, of sorts.
Charles Plosser: "Like everyone else, I am very concerned about the developments in thefinancial markets. I've been supportive of the steps we've taken to enhance liquidity in the marketsthrough the T.A.F., the T.S.L.F., the P.D.C.F., or whatever."
Ben Bernanke: "A.E.I.O.U."
Tim Geithner: "Don't say i.o.u." [Laughter]
-- Peter Eavis
10:57 A.M. | Sympathy for Banks' Fear of Stigma
A big fear among Wall Street banks in 2008 was that they would be singled out as weak if they used the Fed emergency credit lines. William Dudley, a top Fed official, noted that the Fed had gotten questions about how it would disclose use of the Wall Street loans. He sympathized, saying, "The stigma issue is a legitimate issue, and that is why we have to be very careful about how we talk about this and take tremendous care not to disclose who or even what type of institution uses it."
Referring to the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, one of the credit lines, he added, "But at the end of the day, if you can't fund your repo and your only choice is to come to the P.D.C.F., that is probably what you are going to do." Repo is a type of short-term borrowing, backed with assets like bonds.
-- Peter Eavis
10:57 A.M. | Reservations About Helping Overseas
On Sept. 16, not every Fed policy maker was so eager to rush to aid overseas central banks, especially in Europe.
Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed (then and now), wondered whether foreign institutions couldn't use their own dollar reserves, rather than immediately benefiting from the Fed's largess. "Broadly, I'm uncomfortable with our playing that role," he said.
Mr. Bernanke wasn't buying it. "Well, I don't think there are any significant downside risks," he said.
-- Nelson D. Schwartz
10:51 A.M. | Geithner's Concern on Backstopping Wall Street
At the March 18 meeting, Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, wanted the Fed to act as traditional lender of last resort, but he didn't want to bail out all of Wall Street: "The hardest thing in this balance now is to try to do something that doesn't increase the incentives so that we become the counterparty to everybody, " he said. "We're trying to make sure that it's a backstop, but not a backstop that's so attractive that they come, and that's going to be a very hard line to walk."
-- Peter Eavis
10:47 A.M. | In September, Plastic Surgery as an Indicator
Janet L. Yellen, the current Fed chairwoman, developed a reputation for forecasting the recession in 2008. On the day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, Ms. Yellen gave a cheeky indication of the sort of evidence she was looking at in her posting at the Fed's San Francisco regional bank. She said she was noticing "widespread" cutbacks in spending on discretionary items popular in California.
"East Bay plastic surgeons and dentists note that patients are deferring elective procedures," she said to laughter, according to a transcript of the meeting on Sept. 16, 2008.
"Reservations are no longer necessary at many high-end restaurants. And the Silicon Valley Country Club, with a $250,000 entrance fee and seven- to eight-year waiting list, has seen the number of would-be new members shrink to a mere 13," she said to more laughter.
-- Nathaniel Popper
10:45 A.M. | Strains Begin to Emerge Overseas
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, worries that the crisis was spreading overseas quickly mounted. On Sept. 16, just a minute or so into the meeting, Mr. Bernanke warned other members of the committee, "there are very significant problems with dollar funding in other jurisdictions -- in Europe and elsewhere."
Strains were already evident in Northern Europe, as Norway moved to protect its banking system and talk of Iceland's problems first cropped up. Iceland's highly levered banking system would soon collapse. The Bank of England, Switzerland's central bank, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan all needed help.
The answer was to create so-called swap lines, enabling foreign banks to quickly obtain dollar funding from the Fed.
But how much, Mr. Bernanke wanted to know. The answer was a lot.
"The numbers have to be very, very large, or it should be open-ended," said William Dudley, then a top Fed official and now president of the New York Fed. "I would suggest that open-ended is better because then you really do provide a backstop for the entire market."
-- Nelson D. Schwartz
10:43 A.M. | Even in September, 'Inflation' Trumps 'Recession'
In the fall of 2008, we now know, businesses were shedding hundreds of thousands of employees. The unemployment rate had started its march up into the double digits. The markets were stressed.
But the Fed transcripts from September make it clear how hard it can be to judge the depth of economic stress in real time. During the meeting, there were 129 mentions of "inflation." There were just five of "recession." Words like "soft" and "weak" pepper the transcript.
That said, Mr. Bernanke says, "I think what we saw in the recent labor reports removes any real doubt that we are in a period that will be designated as an official N.B.E.R. recession," referring to the National Bureau of Economic Research. And by December, the Fed is predicting a "a deep, prolonged recession and a very sluggish recovery." The economy had been contracting for three full quarters, since December 2007.
-- Annie Lowrey
10:40 A.M. | A Growing Sense of Not Doing Enough
Early in 2008, as signs of crisis were building, Janet L. Yellen scolded the other members of the open market committee to recognize that they had not done enough.
In the Jan. 21 meeting she said "the risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high, and it is being clearly priced now into not only domestic but also global markets."
Meanwhile, she said, "I put the stance, as best I can judge it, of monetary policy within the neutral range."
She said Mr. Bernanke's proposal of a 75 basis-point cut in the Fed's benchmark rate was a good step toward recognizing the central bank's slowness.
"An intermeeting move will be a surprise, but I think it will show that we get it and we recognize we have been behind the curve."
-- Nathaniel Popper
10:31 A.M. | Bear Stearns Demise as 'Old-Fashioned Bank Run'
On March 18, two days after the Fed rescued Bear Stearns, William Dudley, the official overseeing markets at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told the F.O.M.C., "In my view, an old-fashioned bank run is what really led to Bear Stearns's demise." This utterance goes to the heart of one of the big debates of the crisis: Were many banks simply insolvent because of losses in their balance sheets, or lacking in funds, or a toxic combination of both?

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- On the morning after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008, most Federal Reserve officials still believed that the American economy would keep growing despite the metastasizing financial crisis.
The Fed's policy-making committee voted unanimously against bolstering the economy by cutting interest rates, and several officials praised what they described as the decision to let Lehman fail, saying it would help to restore a sense of accountability on Wall Street.
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, urged his colleagues "to wait for some time to assess the impact of the Lehman bankruptcy filing, if any, on the national economy," according to transcripts of the Fed's 2008 meetings that it published on Friday.
The hundreds of pages of transcripts, based on recordings made at the time, reveal the ignorance of Fed officials about economic conditions during the climactic months of the financial crisis. Officials repeatedly fretted about overstimulating the economy, only to realize time and again that they needed to redouble efforts to contain the crisis.
The Fed's chairman at the time, Ben S. Bernanke, was unusually clearsighted in warning of the risk of a severe recession as the nation entered into a presidential election year. But he struggled to persuade his colleagues, and at crucial junctures he did not push forcefully for stronger action.
The Fed's current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, was even more alarmed by the deterioration of economic conditions. She and Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, are the most forceful and persistent advocates for stronger action in the transcripts. But they, too, underestimated the downturn until the final months of 2008.
The transcripts also show, however, that Fed officials responded decisively in those final months, probably preventing an even deeper recession. By the end of 2008, the Fed had reduced short-term interest rates nearly to zero for the first time since the Great Depression, and it had become a primary source of funding not just for the global financial system but for American homeowners and for companies that made food and cars.
Ms. Yellen summed up this new ethos at a Fed meeting six weeks after Lehman's failure, telling colleagues, "Given the seriousness of the situation, I believe that we should put as much stimulus into the system as we can as soon as we can."
In normal times, the Fed is a powerful but somnolent institution, charged with keeping a steady hand on the rudder of the economy. It moves interest rates up and down to moderate inflation and minimize unemployment. But beginning in 2007, it was forced to take on a far more challenging role as the central backstop for the global financial system.
The Fed's understanding of the crisis, however, was clouded by its reliance on indicators that tend to miss sharp changes in conditions. The government initially estimated, for example, that the economy expanded in the first half of 2008 because it basically assumed that some economic trends, like the pace of business creation, had continued apace. The Fed also relied on economic models that assumed the existence of smoothly functioning financial markets, limiting its ability to project the consequences of a breakdown. And the outlook of Fed officials also reflected a deeply ingrained bias to worry more about the risk of inflation than the reality of rising unemployment.
As Fed officials gathered on Sept. 16 at their marble headquarters in Washington for a previously scheduled meeting, stock markets were in free fall. Housing prices had been collapsing for two years, and unemployment was climbing.
Yet most officials did not see clear evidence of a broad crisis. They expected the economy to grow slowly in 2008 and then more quickly in 2009.
The transcript for that meeting contains 129 mentions of "inflation" and five of "recession."
Mr. Bernanke even told his colleagues that it was clear the economy had entered a downturn but that he still did not favor cutting rates.
"I think that our policy is looking actually pretty good," he said.
That optimism would not long endure. Just minutes after the end of that first meeting, a smaller group of Fed officials agreed to rescue the faltering insurance giant the American International Group, a company never before subject to Fed supervision that until then was barely on the government's radar.
In the succeeding weeks, as evidence of a downturn became unmistakable, the Fed would announce a seemingly endless series of programs to buttress the economy, leading Fed officials to joke about the resulting alphabet soup of acronyms.
In early October, a few weeks after the decision to stand pat, the Fed convened an unscheduled meeting to cut interest rates in an action coordinated with other major central banks.
"It's more than obvious that we have an extraordinary situation," Mr. Bernanke told colleagues.
"I should say that this comes as a surprise to me," he said. "I very much expected that we could stay at 2 percent for a long time, and then when the economy began to recover, we could begin to normalize interest rates. But clearly things have gone off in a direction that is quite worrisome."
He closed on a prescient note, telling the committee that he did not expect that monetary policy could solve the problem, but that the Fed should not be hesitant to use the tools that it had.
By the end of the year, the Fed had cut interest rates nearly to zero and started to buy mortgage bonds in a further effort to stimulate the housing market and the broader economy. More than five years later, it is still pursuing both policies even as the economic recovery remains incomplete.
Some Fed officials have argued that the Fed was blind in 2008 because it relied, like everyone else, on a standard set of economic indicators.
As late as August 2008, "there were no clear signs that many financial firms were about to fail catastrophically," Mr. Bullard said in a November presentation in Arkansas that the St. Louis Fed recirculated on Friday. "There was a reasonable case that the U.S. could continue to 'muddle through.' "
Within weeks, Mr. Bernanke also began to insist that the failure of Lehman could not have been prevented without changes in federal law. Furthermore, some officials began to argue that the importance of the failure had been overstated because the economy was already falling apart.
"The whole framing, which seems to have hardened now, that the world ended with the Lehman bankruptcy is just deeply unfair to the basic truth," Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said at an October meeting. "Independent of whether there was an option available at the time, the erosion in underlying economic conditions and in confidence in the future outlook was powerful and substantial going into August and early September."
The Fed entered the year on edge. Officials did not know that the economy already was in recession, but Mr. Bernanke and his closest advisers worried that the Fed's initial response to the financial crisis at the end of 2007 had been insufficient, and that tumbling stock prices were the beginning of a broader pullback.
Mr. Bernanke hoped to delay any action until the first scheduled meeting of 2008 in late January, but over the three-day Martin Luther King weekend, he concluded that the Fed could not wait. He convened a conference call at 6 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 21, and won agreement to cut the Fed's benchmark interest rate 0.75 percentage point, the largest cut in more than two decades.
"The risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high," Ms. Yellen said at the meeting.
Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said this week that the decision was an awakening. "If maybe we were a little slow to recognize what was happening, Martin Luther King weekend in January 2008 was a decisive point in terms of interest rate policy," he said.
By early March, the Fed was moving to replace investors as a source of funding for Wall Street.
Financial firms, particularly in the mortgage business, were beginning to fail because they could not borrow money. Investors had lost confidence in their ability to predict which loans would be repaid. Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender, sold itself for a relative pittance to Bank of America. Bear Stearns, one of the largest packagers and sellers of mortgage-backed securities, was teetering toward collapse.
On March 7, the Fed offered companies up to $200 billion in funding. Three days later, Mr. Bernanke secured the Fed policy-making committee's approval to double that amount to $400 billion, telling his colleagues, "We live in a very special time."
Finally, on March 16, the Fed effectively removed any limit on Wall Street funding even as it arranged the Bear Stearns rescue.
And then the Fed paused. By the end of April, it had cut short-term rates to 2 percent from 5.25 percent the previous September -- one of the fastest falls in Fed history -- and officials said they had done enough to shore up the financial system. They predicted that the economy would narrowly avoid a recession.
"I think it is very possible that we will look back and say, particularly after the Bear Stearns episode, that we have turned the corner in terms of the financial disruption that we have just experienced," Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, said during a meeting at the end of April.
The summer passed relatively quietly. Officials began to fret about inflation. The transcripts include long conversations about when the Fed should start to raise interest rates.
"We saw growth of about 2 percent in the second quarter, which suggests a campaign slogan for the Republicans, 'The Economy: It Could Be Worse," Mr. Bernanke joked in early August.
But it was only the eye of the storm. By the third week of September, it was clear that Mr. Bernanke was right: Things could be worse. The financial crisis had arrived, as Ernest Hemingway once wrote of bankruptcy, "Gradually and then suddenly."

* Frick Collection: 'Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes From the Hill Collection' (through June 15) This sensational, beautifully presented show of 33 late-15th- to early-18th-century bronzes reflects a taste for historically important, big-statement examples in exceptional condition. They vividly reflect the Renaissance's new interest in antiquity and the human form while encouraging concentration on emotional expression, refined details (great hair!), struggling or relaxed figures and varied patinas. Works by the reigning geniuses Giambologna, Susini and the lesser-known Piamontini dominate, further enlivened by a handful of old master and late-20th-century paintings from the Hill collection. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, 212-288-0700, frick.org.

* Guggenheim Museum: 'Carrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Photography and Video' (through May 14) Color and class are still the great divides in American culture, and few artists have surveyed them as subtly and incisively as Carrie Mae Weems, whose traveling 30-year retrospective has arrived at the Guggenheim. From its early candid family photographs, through series of pictures that track the Africa in African-American, to work that probes, over decades, what it means to be black, female and in charge of your life, it's a ripe, questioning and beautiful show. All the more galling, then, that this museum has cut it down to nearly half its original size and split it between two floors of annex galleries, making an exhibition that should have filled the main-event rotunda into a secondary attraction. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
International Center of Photography: 'Capa in Color' (through May 4) Robert Capa first worked with color in 1938, though he only began shooting regularly in color in 1941. This exhibition includes more than 100 contemporary inkjet prints, a fraction of the roughly 4,200 color transparencies held in the center's Capa Archive. Sections of the exhibition include photographs of postwar Paris with spectators at the Longchamp racetrack, fashion models, people sitting in cafes. Black and white remained the standard for war photography as well as art during this time, however, and color during Capa's period was still for commerce, amateurs, leisure -- and stories featuring women. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, 212-857-0000, icp.org. (Martha Schwendener)
International Center of Photography: 'What Is a Photograph?' (through May 4) This exhibition is supposed to address a good question: What is photography in today's digital age with its mind-boggling new smorgasbord of ways to create and disseminate machine-made images? It brings together works from the past four decades by 21 artists who have used photography to ponder the nature of photography itself. But it's a strangely blinkered and backward-looking show. Most of what is on view has more to do with photography's analog past than with its cybernetic future. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, 212-857-0000, icp.org. (Ken Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The American West in Bronze, 1850-1925' (through April 13) This intriguing and spiritually troubling show presents 65 mostly pedestal-scale sculptures representing standard themes of the old American West: cowboys, Indians and wild animals. It includes famous practitioners of the genre like Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, as well as 26 others. Nearly all the sculptures are in a mode of three-dimensional illustrative realism and tend heavily to romantic idealization. There's the rub: The real history of the conquest of the West by white folks was much worse than what these artists imagined in their very popular works. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Antonio Canova: The Seven Last Works' (through April 27) At the end of his life Antonio Canova (1757-1822) produced this show's seven rectangular plaster reliefs for a neo-Classical church he designed and financed for his hometown, Possagno, Italy. Unlike his best known sculptures, they are not remotely erotic or even particularly sensual, and they have nothing to do with the Greek mythology. Rather, they illustrate biblical stories: four from the Book of Genesis and three revolving around the birth of Jesus. They have their moments, but on the whole it doesn't look like Christianity was a good influence on Canova's creative imagination. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Charles Marville: Photographer of Paris' (through May 4) As an official city photographer working under Napoleon III and his controversial urban planner, Baron Haussmann, Charles Marville recorded some 425 views of narrow, picturesque streets that were to be replaced by Haussmann's grand boulevards. Familiar images from that series are among the 100 or so photographs in this show, and they will doubtless be the main draw for visitors eager for a glimpse of a bygone Paris. But the curators also explore Marville's background in illustration and what little we know of his biography. He comes across as a cleareyed cartographer who never quite let go of the illustrator's imperative to make a beautiful, cohesive picture. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Flowering of Edo Period Painting: Japanese Masterworks from the Feinberg Collection' (through Sept. 7) The Met's Japanese galleries have been pulling crowds with a recent series of theme-based exhibitions. It now takes on a different challenge: how to present a cogent narrative within the parameters of a private collection. Given the material, it would have been hard to go wrong. What a collection this is. And what histories, new and old, it holds. Gleaming gold landscape screens, painted fans, painted views into urban brothels: The show is a magnetic beauty. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China' (through April 6) This museum's first survey of recent Chinese art uses the lens of the culture's ancient brush and ink tradition so basic to its landscape painting and calligraphy. It doesn't always work. The show endures a scattered installation, includes overly refined displays of empty skill and wanders off message in spots, especially with several sculptures that don't seem to belong here. But a few moments of visual life and many interesting questions about the weight of the old on the new make it worthwhile. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Jewels By JAR' (through March 9) Crowd-pleasers needn't represent lowered curatorial standards in terms of subject and execution, but this one does. It packs 400 efforts by the New York-born, Paris-based high-society jeweler, Joel Arthur Rosenthal (JAR), into a very dark gallery with insufficient labeling or historical backup. Large pave brooches, usually of flowers, abound; too many pieces date from 2010 or later. There are certainly redeeming works, but the show cries out for editing, scholarly support and better viewing conditions. Artist and audience are left hanging, with the museum's mercenary agenda in full view. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Making Pottery Art: The Robert A. Ellison Jr. Collection of French Ceramics (ca. 1880-1910)' (through Aug. 18) Nearly all the 40 works in this show -- from a collection recently donated to the museum -- are in a traditional form of vases, bowls and platters. They represent a marvelous variety of styles and influences, including Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, classic Chinese traditions and European folk art. What they share is a love for processes and materials and a candid way with the human touch. Most intriguing of all is a curiously clunky small vase by Paul Gauguin, who might have been the George Ohr of European ceramics if he'd stuck with it. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Piero della Francesa: Personal Encounters' (through March 30) None of the four works in this deceptively low-impact show are among Piero della Francesca's most celebrated. But they are all the devotional paintings for private clients Piero is known to have made, and this show is the first to bring them all together. Two picture Saint Jerome in his wilderness retreat and two portray the Madonna and Child, one of which is thought to be Piero's earliest known painting and the other among his last. As marriages of old religious faith and new forms of empirical consciousness, they are marvelous thought provokers. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Venetian Glass by Carlo Scarpa: The Venini Company, 1932-1947' (through March 2) Before he turned to architecture, Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) designed glass vessels, achieving a lifetime's worth of beauty and innovation in a short, remarkable burst of creativity. His achievement is honored with this sublime exhibition of nearly 300 of his splendidly sculptural, radiantly colored, ingeniously patterned vessels. They have an inspiring wholeness: process, form and decoration become a single thing; art, craft and science merge. And content of the non-narrative, experiential kind abounds. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'William Kentridge: The Refusal of Time' (through May 11) Everything is on the move in this mini-theater-cum-power-plant of an installation. In wraparound videos, metronomes pound. Clock-faces spin, spewing trails of stars. Drawings draw and erase themselves. Maps of Africa appear and disappear. White-coated figures mix potions amid giant watch springs. At the center of the gallery a wooden contraption pumps away like an energy source. A collaboration between Mr. Kentridge, who is based in South Africa, and Peter L. Galison, a science historian at Harvard, the piece refers to the European colonial experiment, which strove to shape other cultures to its own concepts of reality, only to find that those cultures had different, resistant, assertive realities of their own. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Visions and Nightmares: Four Centuries of Spanish Drawings' (through May 11) Skipping from 16th-century church commissions to Goya in just 25 objects, the Morgan's first show of Spanish drawings is necessarily awkward. But it delivers on the promise of its title, serving up heavenly apparitions and wicked phantasms aplenty. Highlights include a red chalk drawing of the satyr Marsyas by José de Ribera, an "Immaculate Conception" by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, several late Goya drawings, and a lavishly illustrated 1780 edition of "Don Quixote." 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
* Museum of Arts and Design: 'Out of Hand: Materializing the Postdigital' (through June 1) If you haven't quite wrapped your head around the concept of 3-D printing, or haven't yet had a digital scanner wrap itself around you, now you can do both in this survey of computer-assisted art, architecture and design. The show looks at art made since 2005 and fills nearly three floors, including many irresistible interactive projects. Its ideas may not be entirely new; the Museum of Modern Art's 2008 exhibition "Design and the Elastic Mind" covered much of the same territory, but there's something to be said for this more down-to-earth, production-focused exhibition. 2 Columbus Circle, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'A World of Its Own: Photographic Practices in the Studio' (through Oct. 5) This most lively if repetitive overview traces the history of photography as the Modern never has -- with images taken in the studio rather than out in the world. Its roughly 180 works span 160 years and represent some 90 portraitists, commercial photographers, lovers of still life, darkroom experimenters, Conceptual artists and several generations of postmodernists. Including film and video, it offers much to look at, but dwells too much in the past, becoming increasingly blinkered and cautious as it approaches the present. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Designing Modern Women 1890-1990' (through Sept. 21) Shoehorned into half the museum's design department, this conversation-starting display of objects from MoMA's permanent collection features items designed by more than 60 women, many of whom worked with male partners. Some, like Marianne Brandt and Eileen Gray, are well known to design aficionados, but most will be unfamiliar to a general audience. Most objects were created for domestic consumption. The pièce de résistance is a kitchen designed by Charlotte Perriand for the apartments in Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation in Marseille, France. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New' (through April 21) Ileana Sonnabend, who died in 2007 at 92, was one of the most foresighted art dealers of the late 20th century. This modest-size exhibition, made up of work she either owned or showed in her gallery, gives a sense of the range of her interests, from Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Modern Art: Isa Genzken: 'Retrospective' (through March 10) This prolific German sculptor -- for whom New York and its skyscrapers are a major source of inspiration -- receives her first comprehensive museum survey in this country. A grand, glamorous and sometimes grating 40-year overview, it traces her progress from idiosyncratic Minimalist monoliths to the distinctive -- often architectonic -- assemblages she began making in 1997 from cheesy materials and objects. These works concoct a raw, unapologetic beauty and a weirdly elliptical, if literal-minded, social commentary, frequently about the United States, power and war. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through March 9) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: "American Photographs," by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprise of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of the City of New York: 'City as Canvas: Graffiti Art from the Martin Wong Collection' (through Aug. 24) Drawn from a collection of graffiti-related materials assembled by the artist Martin Wong, this fascinating show and its indispensable catalog chronicle the rise and fall of the calligraphic, illegal art form known as "wild style" graffiti in New York in the 1970s and '80s. Presenting about 150 paintings, drawings, sketchbooks and documentary photographs, it features works by most of the underground movement's stars, including Daze (given name Chris Ellis), Dondi (Donald White), Futura 2000 (Leonard McGurr) and Lady Pink (Sandra Fabara). Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, 212-534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Gilded New York' (continuing) This period-piece of a show revolves around the ritual of the fancy-dress ball: an occasion for lavish expenditures by both host and guests. The gallery, upholstered in eggplant-colored brocade and stuffed with silver and porcelain, could serve as a set for the latest Wharton adaptation or Julian Fellowes's much-anticipated American follow-up to "Downton Abbey." Two mannequins wearing evening dresses by Maison Worth of Paris have been posed conversationally before a fireplace surround of Italian marble; one of them is clad in the sparkling "Electric Light" dress, festooned with silver bullion, worn by Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II at the Vanderbilt Ball of 1883. In the catalog, and just outside the gallery, photographs show guests at other balls dressed (with no apparent irony) as kings, queens and courtiers from Versailles. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, 212-534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
* New Museum: 'Pawel Althamer: The Neighbors' (through April 13) The work of the Polish artist Pawel Althamer includes influences from church art, European folk art and community activism, things that the mainstream New York art world doesn't know or care much about. But his New Museum show makes a stirring impression, particularly the early figure sculptures made from ceramics, wax and grass. A gallery in which visitors are invited to draw on the walls is a work in progress, with Mr. Althamer sometimes on hand for consultation. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
New-York Historical Society: 'Beauty's Legacy: Gilded Age Portraits in America' (through March 9) Rich in context and character-driven, this show of society portraits from the Gilded Age offers plenty of information on the New York social set known as Mrs. Astor's 400. Highlights include Theobald Chartran's painting of James Hazen Hyde, the Equitable Insurance Company heir whose come-hither stare is conspicuously modeled on Bronzino's "Portrait of a Young Man," and watercolor-on-ivory miniatures from the collection of Peter Marié that show society women in costume from the latest ball. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Rosenberg)
Queens Museum of Art: Peter Schumann 'The Shatterer' (through March 30) A recent expansion has doubled the size of the Queens Museum. Of five celebratory new shows, the largest and most moving is the solo museum debut of Peter Schumann, the founder and director of Bread and Puppet Theater, which is 50 years old this year. The show demonstrates how thoroughly Bread and Puppet is his creation. Its down-value look and activist ethos are evident in everything, including the black house-paint mural he has brushed, single-handedly, across one of the museum's wall and the hand-printed, hand-bound books he has placed in the gallery he designates as chapel and library. Every inch of this room is covered with figures and words: angels and ogres, exhortations and condemnations, art for one and for all, straight from the hand, right to the moral core. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 718-592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Carrie Mae Weems: The Museum Series' (through June 29) A set of recent pictures by Carrie Mae Weems are on view here as a supplement to the Guggenheim Museum's "Carrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Photography and Video" exhibition. These images show the artist dwarfed by the facades of international art institutions -- the Louvre, the Tate Modern, and so on -- which, to quote the Studio Museum news release, "affirm or reject certain histories through their collecting or display decisions. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Shadows Took Shape' (through March 9) Space is definitely the place in this lively group exhibition devoted to Afrofuturism, a contemporary art trend that takes the ultra-free-jazz musician Sun Ra as its patron saint and locates itself in a universe where racial and ethnic identities float free from stereotypes without losing track of the histories that created them. William Villalongo sets African sculpture and modernist painting soaring together among the stars; the Kenyan artist Wanuri Kahiu films ecological cataclysm and renewal in ages to come; William Cordova, who lives in New York and Lima, Peru, recreates the Millennium Falcon from "Star Wars," now equipped with a cultural studies library. 144 West 125th Street, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Galleries: Chelsea
* Josephine Halvorson and Burt Barr (through March 1) Working with generously loaded brushes, Ms. Halvorson paints poetically mournful pictures of richly weathered rural building parts like windows, doors and clapboards. From a distance the images appear strikingly realistic. Up close you discover a surprising degree of painterly simplification. It's a tricky balancing act between abstraction and trompe l'oeil realism performed with admirable finesse. In three riveting videos of a rolling tire, a swirling river and a scrolling brick wall, Mr. Barr also plays adroitly with the surfaces of things. Sikkema Jenkins & Company, 530 West 22nd Street, 212-929-2262, sikkemajenkinsco.com. (Johnson)
Richard Serra: 'New Sculpture' (through March 15) In this show, Richard Serra continues along the road that emerged from the hugely successful "Torqued Ellipses" of the 1990s, but also circles back to his earlier oeuvre. Here you have the Serra of the '60s and '70s, revised and updated: heavy rectilinear plates and cubes fabricated in steel rather than lead, his signature material in the '60s. 555 West 24th Street, 212-741-1111, gagosian.com. (Schwendener)
Galleries: Other
Guy Ben Ner (through March 8) "Soundtrack" (2013), the centerpiece of this show, takes a scene from Steven Spielberg's 2005 movie "War of the Worlds" as a "ready-made" soundtrack and pairs it with footage shot in Mr. Ben Ner's kitchen in Tel Aviv. Like Tom Cruise's character in that movie, Mr. Ben Ner's children from his first marriage play a pivotal role in "Soundtrack," billed alongside the cute baby from his second marriage. The artist's family situation would be none of our business except that we've literally watched his kids grow up in his oeuvre. In that sense, "Soundtrack" serves as an art analogue to "War of the Worlds" in which familial bliss is ruptured and plays itself out on embattled ground. Postmasters, 54 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, 212-727-3323, postmastersart.com. (Schwendener)
* Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (through March 31) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, 212-610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
* 'An Opening of the Field: Jess, Robert Duncan, and Their Circle' (through March 29) If you were young, gifted and odd, San Francisco was a good place to be in the years after World War II, when big changes were brewing in American art and culture. And this show feels like a chunk of Bay Area turf has been lifted from back then and set down, untrimmed and buzzing, in the New York of now. At its center are two gay men, the poet Robert Duncan (1919-88) and the artist Jess Collins (who went by the single name Jess). Committed partners living in a wonderland of an old house filled to roof with art, they gathered a fascinating creative community around them, and a lot of it shows up here. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, 212-998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Cotter)
Out of Town
* Carnegie Museum of Art: 2013 Carnegie International (through March 16) A welcome shock to the system of one of the art world's more entrenched rituals, this lean, seemingly modest, thought-out exhibition takes the big global survey of contemporary art off steroids. It is mostly devoid of the looming, often expensive installations called "festival art," while evincing a gratifying affinity for color, form, beauty and pleasure, and a discernible lack of interest in finger-wagging didacticism. Object-making of all kinds seems healthy, as do artist-initiated activist projects (which sometimes overlap). Interventionist and artist-as-curator efforts? Not as impressive. 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 412-622-3131, carnegieinternational.org. (Smith)
National Gallery of Art: 'Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium From Greek Collections' (through March 2) With about 170 objects, this show takes a processional sweep through Byzantine art from its Greco-Roman beginnings to its multicultural late phase in the 15th century, with a specific emphasis on its development in Greece itself. The history is fascinating, and the objects couldn't be more beautiful, including a glinting 13th-century icon of the Virgin and Child pieced together from glass, silver, gold and glass; a 17-foot-long parchment scroll painted with chirping birds and secret prayers; and a heavenly silk embroidery, found stashed away in a Thessaloniki church, depicting the body of the dead Christ surrounded by fan-wielding seraphs and a stitched chant, "Holy, holy, holy." On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, 202-737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Last Chance
* Ferran Adrià: 'Notes On Creativity' (closes next Friday) This unusual and engaging exhibition presents the drawings, charts and lists whereby Ferran Adrià and his collaborators devised the "deconstructivist" cuisine that made Mr. Adrià's El Bulli the best-known, most avant-garde restaurant in the world, as well as a kind of Gesamtkunstwerk involving graphic design, special utensils and architecture. Just don't miss the digitalized slide show downstairs. It consists of beautiful color photographs of the final dishes themselves -- 1,846 of them -- whose inspiring colors and structures should give artists in all mediums ideas. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, 212-219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Smith)
* 'The Age of Small Things' (closes on Sunday) This delightful, cheerfully eclectic grab bag of a show presents more than 50 small paintings, drawings and three-dimensional pieces from the mid-17th century to the present by 42 artists. Francis Picabia, Philip Guston, Vija Celmins and John Wesley are among the numerous boldface names represented. Some of the most arresting things are by unknown 19th-century creators: Victorian mourning paper weights in the form of miniature books and intricate, cut-paper works representing a hand holding a heart. Dodge Gallery, 15 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, 212-228-5122, dodge-gallery.com. (Johnson)
* Arahmaiani: 'Fertility of the Mind' (closes on Saturday) The first New York solo show for the Indonesian artist Arahmaiani Feisal, who uses only her first name, is a condensed, bare-bones retrospective. The artist was raised Muslim, though has taken the hybrid nature of Indonesian Islam, with its roots in Buddhism, Hinduism and animism, to mix images from across the religious spectrum. And her wide travels have made her a world citizen. From the start she has approached art as a form of political activism used to shake up orthodoxies of faith, gender and class in a country that has experienced increasing political repression and bloody religious sectarianism. Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, 212-229-9100, trfineart.com. (Cotter)
Julien Bismuth: 'An image as the _____ of a surface' (closes on Friday) As the show's title suggests, Julien Bismuth is concerned not only with how images are made, but also with their relationship to surfaces. Pink mesh silk screens sit on the floor, leaning against the wall, sometimes stacked like an archive. Above them are images printed in dark gray ink directly onto the wall. Two videos focus on what we experience privately in the realm of images, and an audio work features an actress reading "statements of intention" by artists, pop stars and others. Ripped from context, intentions mean nothing. Here they serve as poetic reminders of the great synapse between art and experience. Simone Subal, 131 Bowery, at Grand Street, second floor, Lower East Side, 917-409-0612, simonesubal.com. (Schwendener)
* Edward Clark: 'Big Bang' (closes on Saturday) This fabulously stately show, organized by the artist David Hammons, takes Edward Clark from his just-back-from-Paris New York years of the 1950s through to the present in just nine abstract paintings. But what paintings! They alternately explode like sunspots and layer-up like landscapes rich with weather. His work is interspersed with pieces by some artists he has felt particularly close to -- Donald Judd, Joan Mitchell, Yayoi Kusama -- but Mr. Clark's art, painted with brooms, his formal instrument of choice, sweeps all before it. Tilton Gallery, 8 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-737-2221, jacktiltongallery.com. (Cotter)
* Stan Douglas: 'Luanda-Kinshasa' (closes on Saturday) An obvious precedent for Mr. Douglas's monumental jazz-jam film "Luanda-Kinshasa" is his 1992 video "Hors-Champ" ("Off-Screen"), which was a sort of aural essay on free jazz as an expression of the black consciousness in the 1960s. For this new film, a consideration of African sources for jazz, he moves the period to the 1970s, extends the film time to six hours, and lets an extraordinary group of musicians, including a Senegalese drummer and an Indian tabla player, do their improvisation, assisted by a looping patchwork of edited and repeated parts. The result is about a poetics, as much as a politics, of music. It's about jazz as a form of pan-cultural transport, a kind of freedom train that goes on and on. David Zwirner, 533 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Cotter)
Daniel Levine: 'The Way Around' (closes on Saturday) You may begin this quietly forceful exhibition of meticulously made white-on-white paintings thinking of Robert Ryman, but chances are he will have faded by the end. Mr. Levine applies a few thin coats of oil paint on fine cotton. He works in minute, nearly invisible brush strokes most of the time, and you can almost count the layers of paint. He seems almost to love the cotton as much as the paint, and their tenderly maintained balance is a palpable strength. Churner and Churner, 205 10th Avenue, near 22nd Street, Chelsea, 212-675-2750, churnerandchurner.com. (Smith)
'Looking Back: The Eighth White Columns Annual' (closes on Saturday) As usual, the White Columns Annual reviews the New York art world's past year in ways idiosyncratic, ultrahip and useful. This year's version, organized by the independent curator Pati Hertling, is also excellent, and installed spaciously with care and some wit. Over 30 artists are represented, with women in the great majority, and there is almost nothing here that does not repay your undivided attention. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, enter on Horatio Street, West Village, 212-924-4212, whitecolumns.org. (Smith)
* 'Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart: Collected by Julie Ault' (closes on Sunday) Julie Ault, an artist, writer and curator, was a founding member of the New York collaborative Group Material, which, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, used exhibitions and public events to investigate the overlap of art and politics. During decades of depression, inflation, multiculturalism, conservatism and AIDS, she and her colleagues led improvised lives on the city's fringes. Within their world, art was currency for giving gifts, bartering, buying and selling among friends. This show, spread over two locations, is a moving record of such transactions. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo; Artists Space: Books & Talks, 55 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, 212-226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Silla: Korea's Golden Kingdom' (closes on Sunday) This intriguing show presents more than 130 objects from Silla, a kingdom that dominated the Korean peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries. The first two of three sections include gold jewelry, formally austere pottery, glassware and other objects excavated from mound shaped, earth-covered tombs in the city of Gyeongju. The third section displays sculpture made after Buddhism was adopted as the state religion. Among the most captivating is a beautiful three-foot-high, gilt bronze sculpture of a young Bodhisattva, which, like a number of other works in the show, has been designated a Korean National Treasure. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Moira Dryer Project (closes on Saturday) The first exhibition in 20 years of the obdurate yet romantic wood-panel paintings of Moira Dryer (1957-92) is a two-part affair that is especially relevant at a time when younger painters, many of them women, are exploring new ways of getting physical with their medium. Dryer pitted the literalness of her paintings against thin, sometimes streaky applications of paint for results that are witty and startling, assertive yet suffused with a delicate, poetic atmosphere. A lively group show of paintings or painting-like works by six artists at the gallery's second space (at 195 Chrystie Street near Stanton) confirms the current relevance of Dryer's art. Eleven Rivington, two Lower East Side locations: 11 Rivington Street, 212-982-1930; 195 Chrystie Street, 212-477-2507, elevenrivington.com. (Smith)
* Andrew Moore: 'Dirt Meridian' (closes on Saturday) This series of large color photographs documents the devastation -- by abandonment and drought -- of rural Nebraska. The images of hollow houses, crumbling barns, desolate trees and a graffiti-filled blackboard might qualify as ruin porn if they didn't bring such heart-rending news of an existence that was solitary in the best of times. "The Murray House, Sears Roebuck Rockfaced Wizard No. 52, Sheridan County, Nebraska," might almost be a painting by Salvador Dalí, had he been an American Regionalist. Yancey Richardson Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, 646-230-9610, yanceyrichardson.com. (Smith)
* New-York Historical Society: 'The Armory Show at 100: Modern Art and Revolution' (closes on Sunday) The International Exhibition of Modern Art, otherwise known as the Armory Show, woke American art from its provincial slumbers a century ago. Was it a good thing or a bad thing, and is there any reason to care about it now? With more than 100 works from the original exhibition by American and European artists and a big, richly illuminating catalog, "The Armory Show at 100" offers an excellent opportunity to ponder such questions. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
* 'The Silent Way: Robert Breer, Matthew Buckingham, Jenny Perlin' (closes on Sunday) In this succinct and beautiful three-work show, Matthew Buckingham pays facts-only homage to light; Jenny Perlin celebrates color in film; and Robert Breer brings them together in "Form Phases IV," a 1954 three-minute classic of animated geometry that builds a passion for Malevich into something new. It's not to be missed. Simon Preston Gallery, 301 Broome Street, Lower East Side, 212-431-1105, simonprestongallery.com. (Smith)
'Simplest Means' (closes on Saturday) This suggestive exhibition presents works by eight artists along with a selection of useful objects produced by Shakers mostly in the 19th century. The connection is a predilection for simplicity and transparency. Shaker pieces include an intricately constructed wooden chip fork and a finely woven straw bonnet. Among works by the artists are geometric compositions painted by Don Voisine; a dusky painting of a broom and dustpan by Joshua Marsh; and loops and slender lengths of wood carved by Seth Koen. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, 212-989-0156, baileygallery.com. (Johnson)
* 'The Wayland Rudd Collection' (closes on Saturday) The black American actor Wayland Rudd emigrated to the Soviet Union in the 1930s in hopes of finding a more tolerant social climate; there he had a stage and film career until his death in 1952. The artist Yevgeniy Fiks makes Rudd the figurehead for this group show on the little-documented history of the African-American presence in Russia. In the process of assembling an archive on that, Mr. Fiks asked a dozen or so contemporary artists to submit work in some way related to the subject, and that's what we see here. Fascinating. Winkleman, 621 West 27th Street, Chelsea, 212-643-3152, winkleman.com. (Cotter)
Sue Williams: 'WTC, WWIII, Couch Size' (closes on Saturday) Painting with Crayola-bright colors and spontaneous verve on unprimed canvases up to 11 feet wide, Ms. Williams creates mostly abstract compositions of swerving lines and brushy fields peppered with crisply delineated cartoonish fragments, some organic, some geometric. The six works in this show are scrumptious confections of painterly panache. 303 Gallery, 507 West 24th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-1121, 303gallery.com. (Johnson)
Correction: February 22, 2014, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An art entry on the Listings pages on Friday and on Feb. 14 about an exhibition of paintings by Sue Williams at the 303 Gallery in Manhattan included an outdated address for the gallery, which moved last year. It is at 507 West 24th Street, not at 547 West 21st Street.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDCARACAS, Venezuela -- The only television station that relentlessly broadcast voices critical of the government was sold last year, and the new owners have softened its news coverage. Last week, President Nicolás Maduro banned a foreign cable news channel after it showed images of a young protester shot to death here.
Opposition legislators have been barred from debates and stripped of committee posts in the National Assembly. And when an opposition leader called for a protest this week, Mr. Maduro scheduled his own march to start at the same spot and dispatched the National Guard to try to block protesters from rallying elsewhere.
Venezuela is being convulsed by the biggest protests since the country's longtime president, the charismatic Hugo Chávez, died nearly a year ago.
And while the demonstrators condemn a wide range of perennial problems, including rampant crime, high inflation and shortages of basic goods like sugar and toilet paper, the intensity of the protests has been fueled by something more subtle and perhaps stronger -- a sense that the spaces to voice disagreement with the government are shrinking and disappearing.
"You have a government that increasingly, since the time of Chávez but even more with Maduro, has practically closed the channels of communication," said Margarita López Maya, a historian who studies protest movements. "If you have a society that has no institutional channels to raise its complaints, make demands, form policy, the tradition in Venezuela and in Latin America and I think throughout the world is to take to the streets."
Of the opposition she said, "They feel choked, penned in."
Since last week, four people have been shot to death in protests, dozens have been wounded and scores have been arrested. A local newspaper said some of the shots fired in one killing appeared to have come from a group that included uniformed security officers and men accompanying them in civilian clothes.
In the most recent death, a beauty queen, Génesis Carmona, 22, a student who was crowned Miss Tourism 2013 for the state of Carabobo, died Wednesday, a day after being shot in the head during a march in Valencia, the country's third-largest city. Protesters said attackers on motorcycles had fired on the march.
But the government has been quick to blame protesters for the worst violence, and on Thursday the interior minister, Miguel Rodríguez Torres, said that one of her fellow demonstrators fired the shot that killed Ms. Carmona. "This girl died from a bullet that came from her own ranks," he said.
Many protesters are calling for Mr. Maduro to resign, but beyond that, the rallies seem to be general expressions of outrage, often with few specific demands. Even some opposition activists admit to being bewildered about how to direct the anger into concrete political objectives.
So far, Mr. Maduro's response has been to crack down, but that has only fanned the flames. This week, he expelled three American diplomats, accusing them of recruiting students to take part in violent demonstrations. Then he arrested an opposition politician, Leopoldo López, saying that he had trained gangs of youths to sow violence in the country as part of a coup to overthrow the government.
Thousands of people turned out in Caracas on Tuesday to accompany Mr. López as he surrendered to the authorities. And on Wednesday night, as demonstrators in several cities clashed with the riot police, Mr. Maduro threatened to declare a form of martial law known as a "state of exception" in the western state of Táchira, on the border with Colombia, a traditional opposition stronghold where protests have been particularly intense.
"If I have to declare a state of exception in Táchira, I'm ready to declare it and send in the tanks, the troops, planes, all of the military force of the country," the president said. He also threatened to jail other opposition politicians and protest leaders.
Parts of the capital, Caracas, and some other cities have become battlegrounds. National guard soldiers on motorcycles patrol Caracas at night, using tear gas and rubber bullets to drive off protesters who block streets with barricades of burning trash.
On one night, a group of soldiers fired rubber bullets at apartment buildings where people were banging pots to protest the crackdown. During a melee after a rally in downtown Caracas on Feb. 12, the police, enraged that some of their vehicles were set on fire, beat and kicked protesters, news photographers and cameramen.
Mr. Maduro belittles the protesters and has largely ignored their complaints, trying to focus attention on smaller groups involved in violent clashes. "These aren't students. They're fascist vandals," he said on Thursday.
The United States has voiced concern.
"In Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people," President Obama said on Wednesday during a meeting in Mexico. He called for Mr. Maduro's government to release jailed protesters and engage in dialogue.
The current round of protests began this month when students in Táchira and other cities demonstrated against violent crime. Several students were arrested and a march was called in Caracas to demand their release. After that march ended peacefully, a few hundred youths rioted, throwing rocks at the police and breaking windows in a government building. A protester and a government supporter were shot to death, and another protester was gunned down that night.
Venezuela became a bitterly divided country during the 14 years of Mr. Chávez's presidency, which ended with his death in March. He fostered a cult of personality and dominated all aspects of political life, pushing the country, which has the world's largest oil reserves, toward his vision of socialist revolution.
Mr. Chávez reviled and insulted the opposition, but since his death, there is a sense that there is even less room for criticism -- despite Mr. Maduro's promises that he is open to dialogue.
In a psychological blow to many in the opposition, a stridently antigovernment television station, Globovision, was sold last year to investors believed to be close to the government. Since then, the station has toned down its programming and ceased to be a counterweight to the relentlessly pro-government tone of several government-run television stations.
Last week Mr. Maduro ordered a Colombian news channel, NTN24, removed from cable because of its coverage of the demonstrations.
Now, there has been little live news coverage of the wave of protests, while government television has relentlessly vilified the demonstrators.
"There are very few outlets where the opposition can make itself heard," said Cedomir Mimia, 27, a lawyer at a recent protest, who said his top concern was "the information blackout."
Many protesters say they are simply fed up with the country's bitter divide. "I'm here because I'm tired of the crime, of the shortages, tired of having to stand on line to buy anything," said María Luchón, 21, at a recent rally. "I'm tired of the politicians of both sides."
Correction: February 28, 2014, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about concerns by opponents of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela that they have fewer and fewer locations in which to demonstrate and express their discontent referred incorrectly to Globovision, a Venezuela TV station. Before its sale last year, it broadcast more voices critical of the Venezuelan government than other television stations, but it was not the only one to regularly feature government critics.

Abstract: Signaling how difficult the atmosphere for retailers remains across a wide range of customers, Walmart Stores and Nordstrom on Thursday both issued fairly weak forecasts for the coming year as they reported disappointing earnings for the fourth quarter. In a call with reporters, William S. Simon, the chief executive of Walmart U.S., said that cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, crimped the company's results.

Full text:   Signaling how difficult the atmosphere for retailers remains across a wide range of customers, Walmart Stores and Nordstrom on Thursday both issued fairly weak forecasts for the coming year as they reported disappointing earnings for the fourth quarter.
Walmart cited international uncertainties like currency fluctuations and an economically struggling customer base at home as partial reasons for such sluggishness.
It reported a fourth quarter-profit, which included the pivotal holiday shopping season, that was down 21 percent from the same period last year. Sales at American stores open for at least a year were down 0.4 percent -- its fourth consecutive negative number in that category -- and traffic in United States locations declined 1.7 percent.
Excluding certain one-time costs, like store closings in Brazil and China, the company came in at the low end of its guidance.
The company also said on Thursday that it was seeing success at its small-format stores, and planned to introduce more locations than previously announced.
In a call with reporters, William S. Simon, the chief executive of Walmart U.S., said that cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, crimped the company's results. An exceptionally ferocious winter with multiple storms also cut into earnings, Mr. Simon said, detracting from a positive performance during the six-week holiday shopping period. He said the storms "aren't an excuse, but merely an explanation."
Ken Perkins, founder of Retail Metrics, said the company's central problem was the plight of its core consumers, who are still struggling with stagnant wages and have been left out of areas of economic growth, like rising stocks and home values.
"It's emblematic of the space," he said. Companies "that serve lower- and moderate-income consumers have been struggling to grow their business."
Mr. Perkins also said that most of the higher-income consumers who went to Walmart during the height of the recession have mostly vanished from its aisles, and the company has had trouble making lasting inroads with those customers.
Despite Nordstrom's wealthier customer base, the company's earnings report also revealed certain weaknesses. Fourth-quarter profits were $268 million, or $1.37 a share, down from $284 million, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier. While sales at stores open for at least a year were up 2.6 percent over the year before, and the company said online sales had significant growth, the sales for its full-line Nordstrom stores open for at least one year dropped 3.3 percent.
Craig Johnson, president of the retail consulting and research firm Customer Growth Partners, said that Nordstrom's growth was coming from "ancillary businesses," rather than its core business.
Internationally, Walmart struggled as well. Net sales were down 0.4 percent, partly because of currency fluctuations, as the dollar strengthened against other currencies. In addition to several one-time costs in India, China and Brazil, the company cited relatively high unemployment and low inflation as challenges to its business.
For the first quarter of this fiscal year, the company forecast earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 a share, below the analyst consensus of $1.23 according to Thomson Reuters.
One area where the retailer appeared to fare well was in its small-store format, whose sales grew 5 percent in the quarter. The company announced on Thursday that it would speed up its expansion of such stores, opening about 270 to 300 locations during the fiscal year, double its initial plan of 120 to 150.
Mr. Simon said traffic at the small stores was up and same-store sales growth was "in the top tier amongst grocery competitors."
"So that's why we're expanding and really stepping on the pedal on the small stores," he said.
Analysts say this increase in smaller stores could help the company pick up business on midweek shopping trips, where customers buy a few items rather than stock up in a big way. Walmart has lost some ground on these visits to retailers like dollar stores. But Faye Landes, an analyst at Cowen and Company, cautioned that it would be difficult for those new stores to make much of a dent.
"Small stores seem to be a very solid idea, but you need a lot of them to make a difference to the overall company," she said. "Small stores are such a small fraction of the overall business."
The company will also open about 115 new supercenters this year, despite declining American store traffic over all.
In a statement, Doug McMillon, who took over as Walmart chief executive on Feb. 1, said improving sales at stores open for at least a year would be "a key priority."
"We'll invest aggressively in e-commerce and increase our small store rollout in the U.S., as we've done in several other countries, to deliver value and convenience," he said. "The combination of supercenters and smaller formats closer to customers' homes, along with e-commerce and mobile commerce, will enable us to increase our relevance for the Walmart brand around the world."
Walmart's stock was down about 1.8 percent on Thursday, and Nordstrom stock fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading.

Full text:   Stocks slid on Wednesday in a late sell-off after minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest policy-setting meeting indicated that the central bank would keep trimming its bond-buying stimulus unless there was a significant economic surprise.
Wall Street also faced technical resistance as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index traded within a point of last month's record closing price.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 89.84 points or 0.56 percent, to end at 16,040.56. The S.&P. 500 slipped 12.01 points or 0.65 percent, to finish at 1,828.75. The Nasdaq dropped 34.83 points or 0.82 percent, to close at 4,237.95. The S.&P. 500 set a nominal closing high of 1,848.38 on Jan. 15, and came within a point of that level at its session high on Wednesday.
Minutes from the January meeting of the Fed's policy-setting committee do not deviate much from its previous communications, but market participants have been expecting the Fed to point to recent weakness in American economic data to reinforce its commitment to stimulating the economy.
"I think the rally that we've seen," said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York, "was largely driven by the sense the Fed is going to slow down their retracement if it's necessary." He added, "Anything that puts a crimp in that belief is going to scare this market. This market is trading at nosebleed levels, and so it will not have a huge tolerance even for news that can be shaded in a bad direction."
Data on Wednesday showed housing starts recorded their biggest drop in almost three years in January. Also Wednesday, the seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index rose 0.2 percent, no real indication of a broad pickup in inflation pressures.
The data was among a spate of recent economic reports affected by a severe winter in the United States, including an index on homebuilder confidence from Tuesday, which suffered its largest one-month drop ever in February. The weather was also largely faulted for the sharp slowdown in hiring in December.
Some economists, however, lowered their first-quarter growth estimates on the back of the weak housing starts data. Goldman Sachs cut its first-quarter growth estimate by a tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent annual rate. Barclays reduced its forecast by 0.3 percentage point to a 1.9 percent rate.
Shares of Safeway, the second-largest mainstream grocery store operator in the United States, rose 3.2 percent in extended-hours trading after said it was in talks about a possible sale of the company.
In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 9/32 to 100 3/32, and its yield rose to 2.74 percent from 2.71 percent late Tuesday.

Study Finds Greater Income Inequality in Nation's Thriving Cities

Author: Lowrey, Annie

Publication info: New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]20 Feb 2014: B.3.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1500233144?accountid=11752

Abstract: The study, released on Thursday, comes as a number of cities across the country are trying to tackle income inequality and expand opportunity through measures like increasing the minimum wage, which President Obama has promised to do at the federal level. Any individual city's earnings ratios might be more defined by who can afford to and wants to live there -- whether a family of relatively low-skilled new immigrants, or a computer programmer in high demand or a financier from abroad -- than by tidal economic trends like unionization and technological change.\n

That is one of the implications of a new study of local income trends by the Brookings Institution, the Washington research group. It found that inequality is sharply higher in economically vibrant cities like New York and San Francisco than in less dynamic ones like Columbus, Ohio, and Wichita, Kan.
The study, released on Thursday, comes as a number of cities across the country are trying to tackle income inequality and expand opportunity through measures like increasing the minimum wage, which President Obama has promised to do at the federal level. In no city is the effort more prominent than in New York, where the new mayor, Bill de Blasio, has promised higher taxes for rich families and better services for poor ones, including expanded early-childhood education and affordable-housing developments.
"The truth is, the state of our city, as we find it today, is a tale of two cities, with an inequality gap that fundamentally threatens our future," Mr. de Blasio said this month, echoing his campaign speeches. "It must not, and will not, be ignored by your city government."
Local officials here in Washington and in Boston, New Haven, San Francisco and Seattle have also seized on the issue.
But in some cases, higher income inequality might go hand in hand with economic vibrancy, the study found. "These more equal cities -- they're not home to the sectors driving economic growth, like technology and finance," said its author, Alan Berube. "These are places that are home to sectors like transportation, logistics, warehousing."
He added, "In terms of actual per capita income growth, these are not places that would be high up the list."
That does not mean that measures intended to mitigate inequality will necessarily reduce the vibrancy of a local community. But the study confirms what many others have shown: The country's big cities tend to have higher income inequality than the country as a whole. For instance, in the 50 biggest American cities in 2012, a high-income household -- which the study measured at the 95th earnings percentile, putting it just into the top 5 percent -- earned about 11 times as much as a low-income household, at the 20th percentile. Nationally, that ratio was 9 to 1.
Some places tend to have much more intense income inequality than others. A high-income family might earn 15 or 16 times what a low-income family earns in San Francisco or Boston, compared with earnings multiples of six or eight in places like Virginia Beach or Wichita.
Low-inequality cities, the study found, tend to be located in the South and the Midwest. They also tend to be geographically large, encompassing neighborhoods that in many other cities would be considered suburbs. Generally, the average for the top income group in such cities tends to be lower than it is in high-inequality cities -- $150,000 to $200,000 a year, compared with $354,000 in San Francisco and $280,000 in Atlanta.
The driving force behind spiraling inequality at a national level is the rich getting richer. But in many cases, the Brookings numbers indicated, poverty is as important a factor at the local level. In Miami, for instance, a household in the bottom 20th income percentile earned just $10,000 a year in 2012.
Inequality in the 50 biggest cities grew modestly from 2007 to 2012, the study found. The effect was not primarily because of rapid income growth among the richest families -- generally, earnings for the top 1 percent of the income distribution have not yet surpassed their prerecession peak. Rather, it was because poor families, saddled with debt and high unemployment rates, have suffered through the recession and the recovery.
The single biggest increase in inequality over that period occurred in San Francisco, where earnings for the typical low-income household dropped $4,000 and soared $28,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars for a high-income household. But in most other places, inequality intensified because the poor got poorer, including in Cleveland, Sacramento, Tucson and Fresno, Calif.
"High-income households did not lose much ground during the recession," Mr. Berube of Brookings said. "Low-income households lost ground and haven't gained it back. And the pressures around cost of living are higher at the low end than they are at the high end."
Researchers say local inequality trends are related to national inequality trends, but are not the same. Any individual city's earnings ratios might be more defined by who can afford to and wants to live there -- whether a family of relatively low-skilled new immigrants, or a computer programmer in high demand or a financier from abroad -- than by tidal economic trends like unionization and technological change.
But New York and many other cities have promised to tackle inequality, in part by shifting the tax burden, but also through initiatives aimed at attracting middle-class families with cheaper housing and better schools.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- When Federal Reserve officials last met at the end of January, they were surprised by the strength of the economy, cheered by the optimism of consumers and convinced they should continue to dismantle the Fed's economic stimulus campaign, according to an account the Fed released Wednesday.
The account left little doubt Fed officials intend to steadily reduce purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, notwithstanding a recent run of disappointing economic data. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said Wednesday on CNBC that even a third consecutive month of paltry job creation was not likely to deter the Fed from tapering again.
"In my view, the hurdle is pretty high on changing the pace of the step-downs in our purchases that we started back in December," Mr. Williams said. "I think that, in fact, to my mind, it would take more than just some weak, relatively weak, reports."
And there were no indications from the meeting that the Fed was particularly concerned about the effect its actions might have on emerging markets, some of which were in turmoil at the beginning of the year because of fears that tighter money and higher interest rates might harm their prospects for growth.
In contrast to the consensus on continuing to reduce bond purchases, the account showed that officials remain conflicted about the next major step in the Fed's retreat: What to tell investors about when the Fed plans to start raising short-term interest rates, which it has held near zero since 2008.
One leading possibility is that the Fed will choose to obscure its internal divisions for a time by retreating from its recent practice of tying policy to specific economic thresholds, instead substituting a less specific description of its goals.
The next meeting of the policy-making committee, scheduled for March 18 and 19, will be the first under the leadership of the new Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
Fed officials cited the resurgence of consumer spending, the main engine of domestic economic growth, as the reason for their growing optimism.
"While noting that households remained cautious, participants cited a number of factors that were likely to continue to underpin gains in household spending, including rising house prices, growing confidence in the sustainability of the economic expansion, increasing payrolls," according to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, released after a standard three-week delay.
Indeed, there was little sign of concern about a string of underwhelming economic reports during the early weeks of 2014, which has checked the optimism of some economic forecasters. Officials, the account said, "generally did not expect the recent pace of economic growth to be sustained, but they nonetheless anticipated that the economy would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters."
The Fed expects growth this year between 2.8 percent and 3.2 percent.
"The economic data released since the Fed's January 28-29th meeting has been largely disappointing," James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. "However, the bout of unseasonably cold weather has made deciphering weather from weakness in economic data increasingly difficult. Unless the data continues to deteriorate, it is unlikely to change the Fed's position."
There were some shadows. Concern about the sluggish pace of inflation remained at a steady simmer. While the account reiterated the Fed's official expectation that price increases will gradually return to the Fed's preferred 2 percent annual pace, it noted "several factors that cast doubt on this outcome," including the slow pace of wage growth and the low level of inflation in other developed countries.
The account noted the turbulence in emerging markets, a slowdown in the housing recovery and "the financing situation of the Puerto Rican government."
These concerns did not weigh heavily. The account said that even Fed officials who have strongly supported asset purchases agreed that "a pause in the reduction in purchases was not justified at this stage." In a further indication of the direction of internal debate, the account said "a few participants" suggested the possibility the Fed would need to start raising interest rates "relatively soon."
The Fed has said since 2012 that it intended keep short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. It said in December that it intended to wait well beyond that time, but it did not elaborate. With the unemployment rate at the time of the most recent meeting having fallen to 6.6 percent, the account said that officials agreed that it would "soon be appropriate" to say more.
Some officials would like to move the threshold to a lower unemployment rate. Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has proposed 5.5 percent. Others would prefer to be vague, broadly describing the Fed's economic goals without providing specific benchmarks. While this would diminish the Fed's power to shape market expectations, it would accommodate the reality that Fed officials do not agree what the benchmarks should be.
In calibrating its efforts, the Fed is trying to assess the health of labor markets.
The share of Americans with jobs remains far lower than before the financial crisis. According the account, however, Fed officials are increasingly convinced that monetary policy cannot reverse much of that decline. Work-force participation was falling before the recession, and a growing number of Fed officials think that the long-term trend -- driven by the march of the baby boomers into retirement -- is now close to catching up with the precipitous drop during the recession.
The Fed's staff also reduced its formal estimate of the economy's potential output, suggesting they believe the economy will not return to the higher growth rates achieved before the Great Recession.
The share of younger adults with jobs also declined sharply during the recession, but Fed officials seem increasingly doubtful about reversing that trend, too.
The account said only "a few participants judged that the decline in participation for younger and prime-age workers likely reflected the slow recovery in jobs and wages and so might be reversed as labor market conditions strengthened."
Correction: February 21, 2014, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Thursday with an article about the minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting misstated the role of Narayana Kocherlakota at the Fed. As the article correctly noted, he is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, not a Fed governor.

Abstract: The budget office found that lifting the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, would have a complicated effect on the labor market, acting as a boon and a burden for businesses and workers. "The Congressional Budget Office confirms the president proposes an unprecedented increase in the minimum wage that will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs," said James Sherk, who analyzes the labor markets for the Heritage Foundation, a right-of-center research group.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A popular Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, championed by President Obama, could reduce total employment by 500,000 workers by the second half of 2016. But it would also lift 900,000 families out of poverty and increase the incomes of 16.5 million low-wage workers in an average week.
That is the mixed conclusion of an assessment on how raising the minimum wage would affect incomes, employment and the federal budget. The report was released on Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, whose views often have a powerful influence on the fate of legislation.
The nuanced analysis provided instant fuel for both supporters and critics of raising the federal minimum wage, a policy heavily favored by Democrats but viewed skeptically by Republicans in Congress.
Republicans contended the policy would be a job-killer, while Democrats asserted it would help alleviate poverty. Economists said both might be right.
And the White House, in an unusual twist, openly disputed the budget office's math.
Jason Furman, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said that the office's estimate of the potential lost jobs might be too high. In a call with reporters, Mr. Furman said that finding no jobs effect at all would be a "perfectly reasonable estimate."
The analysis does not reflect "the consensus view of economists," he said. "Sometimes, you have to have respectful disagreement."
But the report was embraced by leading Republicans, who have opposed the legislation despite its widespread popularity in public opinion polls. "Raising the minimum wage could destroy as many as one million jobs, a devastating blow to the very people that need help most in this economy," said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader. "If and when Democrats try to push this irresponsible proposal, they should be prepared to explain why up to a million Americans should be kept from having a job."
Democratic lawmakers and liberal groups joined the White House in challenging that view. "I haven't seen Republicans this excited about something that bucked the trend in their favor since the last poll showing Mitt Romney was about to be elected president," said Brad Woodhouse, the president of Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group. "But sorry to rain on their parade -- one report does not a trend make."
The budget office found that lifting the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, would have a complicated effect on the labor market, acting as a boon and a burden for businesses and workers.
Over all, the budget office estimated that lifting the minimum wage to $10.10 and indexing it to inflation would reduce total employment by about 0.3 percent, or 500,000 workers. But it cautioned that the estimate was imprecise, with the job losses likely to fall in a range from practically nothing to one million.
The proposal would result in winners and losers among the low-wage workers it would target, the report found. Some businesses, squeezed between increased costs and the inability to raise prices or sell more goods, would hire fewer low-wage workers because of a higher minimum wage, the report said.
But increasing the minimum wage would bolster the earnings of about 16.5 million workers: providing $5 billion a year more for families living in poverty, $12 billion a year more for families earning from one to three times the poverty threshold.
Several top labor economists said on Tuesday that the budget office was overstating the proposal's effect on the job market. Lawrence Katz of Harvard, for instance, said that the budget office had used "a lot of off-the-shelf estimates" of the jobs effect, and that if it had emphasized findings from higher-quality studies, it would have found a smaller or negligible impact on total employment.
More conservative economists said that the profession had long viewed raising the minimum wage, like any increase in price, as having an effect on the demand for jobs.
"The Congressional Budget Office confirms the president proposes an unprecedented increase in the minimum wage that will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs," said James Sherk, who analyzes the labor markets for the Heritage Foundation, a right-of-center research group.
Liberal economists said that quibbling over the jobs numbers neglected a central finding in the report: that many workers would benefit from an increase in income.
"The C.B.O. chose a higher number than I think reflects the best work, but they're not way off the reservation," said Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration economist now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "Even if they're right, the beneficiaries far, far outweigh the people who are hurt by this."
The budget office analyzed two proposals in its report. The first would increase the minimum wage to $10.10 by mid-2016 and would tie it to the Consumer Price Index, so that it would increase with inflation over time. It would also increase the minimum wage for workers who receive tips for services.
The second proposal would increase the minimum wage to $9, without any indexing for inflation. That would have much smaller effects, the budget office found. It would reduce employment by 100,000 workers by the second half of 2016, and push about 300,000 people above the poverty line.
The higher minimum wage would reduce employment in two main ways, the budget office report said. Businesses facing higher labor costs would raise prices, passing those higher costs on to their customers. That would lead their customers to cut back on their purchases, meaning that businesses would need fewer workers.
Raising the minimum wage would also make hiring low-wage workers more expensive relative to other investments, like new machinery. Businesses might then reduce their use of low-wage workers and shift their spending toward other things, like automated systems.
But a higher minimum wage would offset at least part, if not all, of that effect by helping increase spending by lower income workers throughout the economy.
Several Democratic lawmakers said that the budget office's findings only underscored the need for the $10.10 minimum wage to pass. "The C.B.O. made it absolutely clear: raising the minimum wage would lift almost one million Americans out of poverty, increase the pay of low-income workers by $31 billion and help build an economy that works for everyone," said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela on Monday ordered three American Embassy officials to leave the country, saying they had been recruiting students to take part in violent antigovernment protests, in the latest in a series of expulsions that have marked a low point in relations between the two countries.
The expulsions came as the country's socialist president, Nicolás Maduro, was facing more than a week of sometimes violent demonstrations led by students in several cities, fueled by broad discontent over rampant crime, high inflation, product shortages and mounting government pressure on the media. Three people were shot to death during protests here in Caracas, the capital, last Wednesday.
It was the third time in less than a year that the government had expelled American diplomats, as Mr. Maduro has repeatedly accused the United States of supporting opponents who he says are plotting a coup. But critics say that he regularly seeks to provoke crises with the United States to distract from problems at home.
Mr. Maduro announced the expulsions Sunday night, and on Monday the foreign minister, Elías Jaua, said the three officials, who all worked for the embassy's consular section, had 48 hours to leave the country.
Mr. Jaua said that the officials had been visiting universities under the pretext of granting visas to students. He charged that "at bottom that is a cover to establish contacts with leaders who they recruit for training, for financing and the creation of youth organizations through which violence is promoted in Venezuela."
The State Department denied the accusations.
"The allegations that the United States is helping to organize protesters in Venezuela is baseless and false," a State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said in a written statement. "Venezuela's political future is for the Venezuelan people to decide."
Mr. Jaua said the activities of the consular officials were part of a longstanding pattern of meddling by the United States government in Venezuelan politics. To make his point, he read from three diplomatic cables sent from the American Embassy to the State Department.
Mr. Jaua said the cables were among several documents that either were released by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks or were unearthed by Venezuelan intelligence services. But a search of WikiLeaks documents obtained by The New York Times appeared to show that all of the cables read by Mr. Jaua were among a collection of documents released by WikiLeaks in 2010.
There are dozens of WikiLeaks cables from the American Embassy that include references to the financing of civil society groups and some refer to accusations by the Venezuelan government that the activity represented improper meddling in Venezuelan politics.
But Mr. Jaua appeared to frequently misrepresent the content of the cables he quoted by inserting references to student or youth groups or saying that the embassy acknowledged that financing was meant to support partisan groups, when the cables said the opposite. He also exaggerated the financial support the United States gave to such groups and tried to suggest the activity was more recent than the cables indicated.
He said that the three cables he cited were from 2009 to 2011, but the document search revealed that the cables he appeared to be quoting dated instead from 2006 to early 2009. Two were from the time that George W. Bush was president and the United States maintained a more openly hostile posture toward Venezuela's government, while the most recent one was from March 2009, less than three months after President Obama took office.
Mr. Jaua quoted one cable that he said was from 2011, which he said referred to an annual budget of $57 million for programs to "strengthen youth organizations," and a request for an additional $30 million to increase those efforts ahead of Venezuela's presidential election in 2012.
But the WikiLeaks cables end in early 2010, and a cable with almost the exact language as that quoted by Mr. Jaua -- with some key differences -- is dated March 27, 2009. It talks about annual spending of $7 million to support local governments and civil society groups and asks for an additional $3 million to increase outreach efforts and "to continue programs to strengthen civil society and prepare for the next round of elections in 2010."
While the numbers are different, some of the language quoted by Mr. Jaua is almost identical, including a passage he emphasized that said that the American Embassy "helped create" some of the organizations that it was continuing to finance, and that those groups "arguably represent the best hope for a more open democratic system in Venezuela."
Mr. Jaua also read from another cable, which he said was from 2010, in which he said an American official told student leaders "that while all embassy programs are directed at strengthening civil society and stimulating participation in the opposition process, these actions should be perceived as being close to the embassy to send a clear message to the government."
But the reference appears to come instead from a 2008 WikiLeaks cable that quotes the official saying something quite different. "While all embassy programs are directed at strengthening civil society and encouraging participation in the democratic process, not partisan politics, perceived proximity to the embassy may lead to BRV harassment," he was quoted as saying, using an abbreviation for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
A Foreign Ministry official refused to provide copies of the documents cited by Mr. Jaua.
Mr. Maduro, who was elected in April, ordered the expulsion of the American chargé d'affaires and two other American diplomats in September. In March, on the same day that his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, died, he said he was expelling two American military attachés. In both cases, he said the officials were plotting against his government.

Abstract: "Bolivia has been in a way an outlier," said Ana Corbacho, the International Monetary Fund's chief of mission here, adding that falling commodity prices and other factors have downgraded economic expectations throughout the region. According to the monetary fund, Bolivia has the highest ratio in the world of international reserves to the size of its economy, having recently surpassed China in that regard.

Full text:   LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Argentina's currency has plunged, setting off global worries about developing economies. Brazil is struggling to shake concerns over years of sluggish growth. Venezuela, which sits atop the world's largest oil reserves, has one of the world's highest inflation rates. Farther afield, countries like Turkey and South Africa have watched their currencies suffer as investors search for safer returns elsewhere.
And then there is Bolivia.
Tucked away in the shadow of its more populous and more prosperous neighbors, tiny, impoverished Bolivia, once a perennial economic basket case, has suddenly become a different kind of exception -- this time in a good way.
Its economy grew an estimated 6.5 percent last year, among the strongest rates in the region. Inflation has been kept in check. The budget is balanced, and once-crippling government debt has been slashed. And the country has a rainy-day fund of foreign reserves so large -- for the size of its economy -- that it could be the envy of nearly every other country in the world.
"Bolivia has been in a way an outlier," said Ana Corbacho, the International Monetary Fund's chief of mission here, adding that falling commodity prices and other factors have downgraded economic expectations throughout the region. "The general trend is we have been revising down our growth forecast, except for Bolivia we have been revising upward."
Bolivia has taken an unlikely path to becoming the darling of international financial institutions like the monetary fund, not least because the high praise today is coming from some of the same institutions that the country's socialist president, Evo Morales, loves to berate.
Mr. Morales often speaks harshly of capitalism and some of its most ardent defenders, like big corporations, the United States, the monetary fund and the World Bank. He nationalized the oil and gas sector after taking office in 2006, and he has expropriated more than 20 private companies in a variety of industries.
Yet while Mr. Morales calls himself a revolutionary, others have begun using a very different word to describe him: "prudent."
Both the monetary fund and the World Bank, in recent reports, praised what they called Mr. Morales's "prudent" macroeconomic policies. Fitch Ratings, a major credit rating agency, cited his "prudent fiscal management."
While Mr. Morales remains firmly in Latin America's leftist camp, on many economic matters he fits within a broader trend away from ideological rigidity in the region.
In Peru, President Ollanta Humala went from ardent leftist to centrist. In Colombia, President Juan Manuel Santos, a former defense minister, now plays the role of peacemaker, negotiating with the country's largest guerrilla group. In El Salvador, presidential candidates from left and right moved toward the center to woo voters. In Uruguay, President José Mujica, a leftist and a former Marxist guerrilla, has carried out business-friendly economic policies.
"There's definitely an underappreciated element of pragmatism" in the region, said Maxwell A. Cameron, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia.
Not long ago, Bolivia was a focal point of political and economic instability, and while it remains South America's poorest country, much has changed.
Economic growth last year was the strongest in at least three decades, according to the monetary fund, and it continued a string of several years of healthy growth. The portion of the population living in extreme poverty fell to 24 percent in 2011, down from 38 percent in 2005, the year before Mr. Morales took office.
Though there is still much misery, the economic transformation is widely visible, in thriving urban markets or in the new tractors tilling land where farm animals pulled plows not long ago. In El Alto, a working-class city perched above the capital, the newly wealthy flaunt their success in the form of brightly colored mansions. Another recent addition: the proliferation of bakeries selling elaborate cakes, a sign that even those of more modest means have extra cash to spend.
One of the most surprising developments is the way that Bolivia has amassed foreign currency, salting away a rainy-day fund of about $14 billion, equal to more than half of its gross domestic product, or 17 months of imports, that can help it get through economic hard times.
According to the monetary fund, Bolivia has the highest ratio in the world of international reserves to the size of its economy, having recently surpassed China in that regard.
"We are showing the entire world that you can have socialist policies with macroeconomic equilibrium," said Economy and Finance Minister Luis Arce. "Everything we are going to do is directed at benefiting the poor. But you have to do it applying economic science."
The country is doing well thanks to relatively high prices for natural gas -- its most important export -- during Mr. Morales's presidency. That enabled Mr. Morales to order in November that all government and many private sector workers get double the customary year-end bonus of a full month's salary.
It was a populist move that critics linked to the coming election season -- Mr. Morales will run for a new term in October. But it is consistent with a broader effort to redistribute wealth and direct some of the country's natural gas income directly into people's pockets.
"I wouldn't necessarily say these are mainstream economic policies," Ms. Corbacho said. "What we have assessed as very positive are the outcomes they have achieved when it comes to growth, social indicators" and other criteria.
Bolivia's turnaround is noteworthy because for many years the country was a proving ground for the kind of orthodox, free market policies long promoted by the monetary fund and other international institutions. Grappling with a host of economic problems, including hyperinflation that reached 24,000 percent in 1985, the government cut spending, eliminated fuel subsidies, partially privatized government-owned companies and fired many workers.
Critics say that while those policies tamed inflation, they also did long-term damage, exacerbating the unequal distribution of wealth, pushing newly out-of-work miners and farmers into coca farming that increased cocaine production, and ultimately contributing to the social unrest that helped usher in Mr. Morales as president.
"The Morales administration has basically cast off the recommendations of the I.M.F. and other huge international lending organizations, and for the first time, during his tenure, you see those macroeconomic indicators improve significantly, which finally gains the approval of organizations like the I.M.F.," said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a research group based in Bolivia.
Mr. Morales has benefited by being president during a time of high commodity prices, which have driven economic growth here and in many countries throughout the region. In a highly contentious move, he nationalized the energy sector by taking a greater stake in the companies that extract the nation's gas and demanding a bigger share of the revenues. That has greatly increased government income, giving him the money to pay for social programs like cash payments to young mothers, improved pensions and infrastructure projects.
But while the nationalization rattled foreign investors, Mr. Morales now gets generally good marks for the way he has handled the windfall.
"You could mismanage this opportunity, and the reality is they have not," said Faris Hadad-Zervos, the resident representative of the World Bank in La Paz, who cited the large foreign reserves stock and substantial increases in government spending on infrastructure.
Not that there are no areas of concern. Both the monetary fund and the World Bank say much more should be done to encourage private investment. Bolivia has less than half the rate of private investment of most other countries in South America.
There are also worries about what will happen if natural gas prices fall significantly, and whether Bolivia is simply in the midst of the typical boom-and-bust cycle that often bedevils poor countries.
Bolivia's gas exports go entirely to Brazil and Argentina on long-term contracts, meaning that sustained economic problems in those countries could eventually spell problems for Bolivia. But a greater concern is over a low level of investment in gas exploration, which could endanger Bolivia's ability to maintain production levels in the future.
"This is not sustainable in the long term," said Jose L. Valera, a lawyer based in Houston who has represented energy companies doing business in Bolivia. "The model is not designed to generate substantial profits for an oil industry that is going to then be incentivized to reinvest in Bolivia."
Bolivia's relations with the monetary fund and the World Bank, both based in Washington, are a sharp contrast to those of some of its leftist allies. Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina refuse to take part in annual economic reviews by the monetary fund.
Mr. Morales's public statements have also often been highly critical. He once said the World Bank tried to blackmail him into changing his economic policies. And in a speech in December 2012, he called for the dismantling of "the international financial system and its satellites, the I.M.F. and the World Bank."
But his attitude toward the bank seemed to have changed in July at an event to announce a World Bank project to support quinoa farmers.
"The World Bank does not blackmail, or impose conditions, not anymore," Mr. Morales said, according to a publication on the bank's website. To celebrate, he played a friendly soccer game with the bank's president, Jim Yong Kim.

Full text:   AN idea for the Senate: brown paper bags. You know, the kind in which you cut little holes for your eyes and your nose and a bigger, wider hole for your mouth. Senators could wear these in the chamber, so that the C-Span cameras and the outside world wouldn't know precisely who's supporting what. Or maybe ski masks, though those wreak havoc on hairdos. Alternately, the lawmakers could communicate in code: anything to obscure their actions and make it easier for them to actually cast votes in line with their best judgment and consciences. Oh, you thought they always did that? Well then I won't spill the beans on Santa or the Easter bunny, either.
Last week was a doozy, and not in the usual way. The nation didn't lurch toward another cliff; the suffixes -geddon and -pocalypse didn't come out to play; the air didn't grow thick with dire "s" words like stalemate, standoff and the direst of all, shutdown. No, last week ended with Congress's having steered clear of disaster by passing a measure to lift the debt ceiling. Congress functioned, more or less. And yet -- here's the clincher -- it looked as ugly as usual, if not uglier.
At issue was the way it functioned, a dysfunction of its own. Over in the House, Republican leaders brought the lifting of the debt ceiling to a vote so that they and a smattering of their party colleagues could pass the measure with the help of nearly all of the Democrats. You might naïvely wonder how this wouldn't estrange the leaders from their caucus. But you'd be failing to take into account that many members of that caucus wanted the measure to succeed, recognizing that this was in the nation's interest, but wanted at the same time to vote no, so as not to draw attacks from party extremists. In Congress, this isn't considered a contradiction. It's not even considered undignified. It's considered canny self-preservation. (You serve, above all, to get re-elected.) The phenomenon is common enough that in a recent story in The Times, my colleagues Ashley Parker and Jonathan Weisman assigned it a name: Vote No, Hope Yes.
In a given chamber of Congress, the majority party usually takes responsibility for raising the debt ceiling, while the minority is permitted to balk and rail theatrically about wanton government spending. In fact Barack Obama did such balking and railing when he was in the Democratic minority of the Senate. Now Democrats run the show there, and they were poised to provide the necessary support to get the ceiling lifted. But the inimitable and irrepressible Ted Cruz insisted on a 60-vote threshold to allow the measure to be taken up, and getting past this hurdle required at least five Republicans to side with Democrats.
If the Republicans in the Senate had really cared to doom the measure, this was their big chance. But their true and ardent desire was to appear adamantly opposed without being so, and thus to appease party loudmouths without actually letting those loudmouths get their way.
This was where the brown paper bags would have come in very handy, because to avoid a filibuster and let the measure ultimately succeed, some Republicans had to step up and actually cast a vote in favor of its consideration. Their solution: to conduct this first, procedural vote in silence -- an extremely rare and exceedingly curious thing -- so that it wasn't immediately clear to observers which Republicans were effectively helping to make sure the debt ceiling got raised. The theory, presumably, was that by the time it did become clear, those same Republicans would have proceeded to cast a subsequent "no" vote against the raise itself, whose passage required only the simple majority of votes that Democrats alone could provide.
The world's greatest deliberative body at work! Make sure the children are watching! Inspiring civic lessons for all!
This isn't just about the debt ceiling. On too many other fronts, the gulf between how lawmakers know they should behave and what they have the political courage to do is painfully wide. This has happened with Hurricane Sandy relief, with the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, with budgetary matters.
The week before last, immigration reform fell apart, and not because of the number of lawmakers who think it's a horrid idea, but because of the number who think it's probably a good idea but don't want to commit to that and confront any blowback.
And last week the Senate, in a 95-3 vote, and the House, by a 326-90 margin, reversed a portion of a budget agreement that would have limited cost-of-living increases in many military veterans' pensions to 1 percent below the rate of inflation.
Bob Kerrey, a former Democratic senator and a veteran, told me that the limit, which the Pentagon endorsed, was utterly reasonable and absolutely necessary, and he assured me that most lawmakers knew this. But they worried that if they stood by that conviction, veterans groups would succeed in branding them enemies of the nation's heroes.
"It's all about inoculating yourself against the sound bite," he said. "And now it's more than a sound bite. It's also what's trending on Twitter." Most lawmakers, he added, believe that the failure to rein in Medicare and Social Security represents a serious threat to the country's future, but they're too politically timid to reflect that in their votes.
SUCH cowardice and self-interest aren't new. But certain wrinkles are. Kerrey mentioned Twitter and, indeed, complaints and catcalls circulate with unprecedented efficiency and reach. It's quicker for interest groups and opponents to fasten targets on lawmakers' backs. It's easier to rouse the rabble.
"With the ability to use computers, it's worsened," Mike Castle, a Delaware Republican who served in the House for nearly two decades, said. He added that websites and social media, not to mention cable TV and talk radio, have turned the political atmosphere more broadly and instantaneously caustic. "You have that constant carping. It has made Congress a more difficult place to achieve the greater good."
Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University, noted that in the past, some votes in Congress wouldn't even be recorded by individual lawmakers' names. There was also more hidden back-room dealing. "That kind of insularity allowed legislators to take positions that might not be politically great but were the right thing to do," he said.
I asked Kerrey: Do the politicians who frequently buck their own consciences at least feel misgivings about that? Struggle with it?
"Now you're presuming that they're in contact with their consciences on a regular basis," he said. "I haven't actually met many human beings who are. That's a tough transaction: looking out for your conscience."

Full text:   Stephen Roach proposes to remake the two largest economies on the globe, ours and China's. For decades, he writes, the United States and China relied too much on a "marriage of convenience" that guaranteed China a huge market for its exports. In exchange, China gave American consumers a cornucopia of inexpensive products, while creating a willing buyer of the United States government's swollen debt. But that marriage has played out, Mr. Roach says; it has warped the two economies, leaving them ill-equipped for further growth.
In "Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China," Mr. Roach asserts that it's time for the two nations to switch identities: that the United States should change its emphasis from consuming to producing, and that China should do the opposite.
Mr. Roach suggests that the way for the two nations to prosper is jointly. If China is to build a consumer society and find jobs for millions of peasants flooding into cities looking for work, it must create a robust services sector. The trick for the United States is to build its exports by helping China meet that need, exploiting American expertise in everything from running retail chains to overnight delivery to professional services.
China is already the third-largest importer of American products. It has gobbled up American producer goods, so prospects for broader American exports are good. Mr. Roach calculates that a $4 trillion market is opening up for foreign providers.
None of that will come easily, Mr. Roach concedes. He says China can probably pull it off -- its consumerist goals are already built into its Five-Year Plan. But he wonders, without offering much of a blueprint, whether the American people and their elected leaders can stomach the sacrifices of saving rather than consuming.
The alternative, he worries, might be more fist-shaking toward China and, conceivably, a devastating trade war that nobody wants. Strident anti-Chinese voices in Congress aren't entirely bad, Mr. Roach says -- a Senate bill proposing trade sanctions spooked China into lifting the value of its currency, thus raising the price of Chinese products. But if the United States economy doesn't revive and Washington actually enacts trade sanctions, a tit-for-tat exchange of curbs could carom out of hand as Beijing replies in kind.
Mr. Roach offers an evenhanded, thorough response to the anti-China potshots from Democrats and Republicans alike. It is surprising, though, how matter-of-factly he seems to accept that America is on a downhill slope. In the fresh relationship that he sketches for the two world powers, China is the mature senior partner and America its problematic, less-reliable junior.
Mr. Roach is a global affairs senior fellow at Yale who once led Morgan Stanley Asia. A top Wall Street global economist, he was struck by how adroitly China dodged being drawn into the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s (by pushing cheap exports to finance huge dollar reserves). "It didn't take long for me to get hooked on the Chinese development miracle," he writes.
And hooked he remains. Much of his book is devoted to defusing hostility toward China. He notes, for instance, that though Chinese exports ravaged American manufacturing, their low prices reduced consumer inflation in the United States. (Some 70 percent of what Walmart sells comes from China.) And though China gets a black eye for excessive exports to the United States, Mr. Roach sees it as wrongly blamed. China is often just the final link in a long supply chain, assembling parts made elsewhere. Yet under accounting rules, the entire value of such products is recorded as Chinese exports, though much of their value was produced in other countries. China's enormous holdings of United States Treasury debt are a grave worry, he acknowledges. If China were abruptly to stop buying Treasury debt, Uncle Sam would be hard-put to find buyers for so much volume and almost certainly would have to pay higher interest.
The root problem, Mr. Roach says repeatedly, is America's inability to save enough at home to finance its growth -- a situation that is hardly China's fault. And a day of reckoning is coming. If China devotes more of its surplus savings to funding a decent pension plan or health care for its citizens, it will spend that much less at Treasury auctions.
Mr. Roach walks a line between explaining China and excusing it. He stresses that its modern economy, barely three decades old, is still learning the game. He notes that though China has a terrible record on intellectual-property rights, the West has dealt with intellectual-property issues since the 1400s; China's patent law dates only to 1985.
And, yes, the Internet is censored, often heavy-handedly, but it does exist and even thrive in China; it has by far the world's largest Internet community, which plays a vital role in creating the new consumer economy.
Mr. Roach understands that China, in many ways still a poor country, differs vastly from the United States. He acknowledges the Chinese Communist Party's many flaws. He knows that it cracks down proactively on any dissent that threatens its rule. He is aware that dealings between Washington and Beijing can sour for innumerable reasons. And he is terribly pessimistic about political myopia and paralysis in Washington.
But "the endgame provides enormous opportunity for each," he writes. "The challenge is for both to see it."

Abstract: According to an August 2013 report from AARP, 11.6 percent of women ages 80 to 84 were childless in 2010. The trend means that "there are going to be far fewer of the traditional caregivers," said Donald Redfoot, a co-author of the study and a senior policy adviser with the AARP Public Policy Institute in Washington.

Full text:   HAVING children was never on Francine Tint's to-do list. A painter of large abstract canvases, Ms. Tint never felt a biological imperative to reproduce or pass on her name to future generations.
"My paintings are my children," said Ms. Tint, who is "over 65," and whose work has been featured in galleries and museums across the country. But though she was always clear on her decision, in the back of her brain one thing slightly nagged at her: Without offspring, on whom could she rely in her old age?
"People don't have children to take care of them later on in life," said Ms. Tint, who is divorced and lives in Greenwich Village. "It's not a reason to have children. They may come for a second on your deathbed, and that's it. But of course, I worry."
Ms. Tint's situation is one that more and more elderly people will face over the next few decades as fewer women choose to have children. According to an August 2013 report from AARP, 11.6 percent of women ages 80 to 84 were childless in 2010. By 2030, the number will reach 16 percent. What's more, in 2010, the caregiver support ratio was more than seven potential caregivers for every person over 80 years old. By 2030, that ratio is projected to decline to four to one. By 2050, it's expected to fall to three to one.
Unlike China, whose Law of Protection of Rights and Interests of Elderly People requires children of parents older than 60 to visit their parents "often" and tend to their financial and spiritual needs, the United States has no such law.
The trend means that "there are going to be far fewer of the traditional caregivers," said Donald Redfoot, a co-author of the study and a senior policy adviser with the AARP Public Policy Institute in Washington. "It raises the question: Then who?"
"Many people are extending the notion of family itself, to nieces and nephews, cousins and so on," he continued. "But it's also expanding to 'pseudo kin' of friends and neighbors. We see this in the L.G.B.T. community, many of whom have been alienated from their families."
Not only does it raise questions of who will care for them, it also brings up issues of housing arrangements, estate planning and whom to put in charge of financial affairs.
This is something Batya Lewton, 82, a former teacher and librarian in New York who never married and has no children, has been contemplating. "You have to think in advance; you can't assume that people are going to know what you want done for yourself, or how you want to be taken care of, whether you want to stay in your home or not," she said. "It's important that people who you care about and who care about you know exactly what you want."
About eight years ago, Ms. Lewton appointed two friends who live in her building to oversee her future. Both have power of attorney and are executors of her will. She has filed important papers in clearly marked boxes, and also given explicit instructions on where she would like to be buried, what she wants engraved on her headstone and how the funeral should proceed. (She did not, however, prepay the event. "I'm superstitious," she said.)
Both Ms. Lewton and Ms. Tint hope to stay in their apartments rather than move into a facility for the elderly. "I know a lot of people in my building," said Ms. Tint. "It's like an assisted living center or a dorm," or, in modern parlance, a naturally occurring retirement community.
Others -- both singles and couples without children -- are considering cohousing situations with people of all ages.
"My fear in life is being put in a nursing home," said Nancy Squires, 58, who owns an I.T. consulting firm in the Washington area. Ms. Squires, who is divorced with no children, has been saving for retirement since the 1980s. "I come from a family that's thrifty," she said. "I reuse paper towels. My friends laugh at me; I wipe my hands and put it on the counter until I come back. But I was taught that retirement was very important. My parents were not wealthy. They earned a nickel and saved a dime."
She and her friends have bandied about the idea of moving in together. "I love the idea of a communal living arrangement with separate spaces and shared expenses," she said. "Not like in the '60s with LSD. More of a 21st-century model, like a large farm where someone has horses, another raises/trains dogs for others, some of the people might coordinate an organic garden, some might cook gourmet dinners a few times a month. It's all about really living to your fullest without eating dinners alone -- unless you want to, of course."
Bill Strubbe, 58, a travel writer and painter living in San Francisco's East Bay, plans to leave the country. In the fall, Mr. Strubbe, who has no children and is single, is relocating to a kibbutz outside Haifa, Israel, that he has been visiting since he was 20.
"I'll be living among a community of people I have known all my adult life and has systems in place for care of the elderly," he said. "Unlike the U.S.A., Israel has excellent health care for all its citizens, and that will take a big load off of my mind, knowing that I won't be left flapping in the breeze if something happens to me."
According to Dave Littell, a retirement income program director at the American College of Financial Services, in Bryn Mawr, Pa., children usually provide about 70 percent of long-term care. But they're not always the best people to make decisions about their parents. A 2012 study of 975 parents and 152 adult children conducted by Fidelity Investments found that only 3 percent of parents agreed that their children would take care of them if they became ill. The study also found that only 10 percent of children believed conversations about health and eldercare were very detailed.
"While it's great to have kids who are available to help, there are a lot of complications with having kids around," said Audrey K. Chun, a doctor who is also a medical director at the Martha Stewart Center for Living at Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York. "A lot of the dynamics, decisions that have to be made around the end of life, disagreements that arise between siblings, what mom or dad may have wanted, can be very emotional. Many of my patients without kids are interested in not wasting resources at the end of life -- when it's their time, they don't want unnecessary suffering, or to be a burden on society. They want to die naturally. Because they don't have children to advocate for them, they're much more open and direct about that."
Those without children also tend to have the resources to pay for professional assistance. As the Department of Agriculture reports, a middle-income family with a child born in 2012 can expect to spend about $241,080 ($301,970 adjusted for projected inflation) in expenses for that child over the next 17 years. If that money were saved for 35 years, it would amount to about $1.5 million, with compounding interest, Mr. Littell said.
"You save so much money not having a child, not to mention two or three," said Joni Evans, the chief executive of WowOWow, a website for women, who is married but never wanted children. "And you're saving millions of dollars when you span it over 20 years. For me, when the time comes I'll hire someone, or I'll have a really great friend move in with me. Whatever it takes, I feel like I have the money to take care of myself in my old age.
Of course, one issue facing the childless is what to do with their estates. Some establish foundations in their name or leave money to charity, said David W. Nethery, senior vice president for wealth management at Merrill Lynch in Dallas. Others bequeath money to siblings, nieces and nephews, or friends, as did Ms. Lewton.
In Mr. Strubbe's ideal world, he won't have any cash left. "Hopefully I will have used it all up," he said. Should there be any, he said he would most likely leave it to "nieces and nephews and/or some of the children of close friends on the kibbutz."
Among the stipulations, he said, he is ordering recipients not to use their inheritance "to pay bills, taxes, rent or other such mundane things, but to earmark it for taking a trip you could never afford, enrolling in an art class that was not in the budget, or do something meaningful, wild and fun."

Abstract: While there are plenty of federal regulations governing the basic administration and safeguarding of employer-provided retirement accounts, companies have a lot of leeway to alter their own plans in ways that can cost employees plenty. AOL's attempt is an unpleasant reminder that employers can and will make changes to employee benefits programs for any reason at all.

Full text:   AOL's chief executive, Tim Armstrong, drew plenty of attention earlier this month when he seemed to attribute a change in the company's 401(k) plan in part to a couple of employees whose infants required expensive care. But what was mostly lost in the discussion was just how much it would cost employees if every employer tried to do what AOL did.
The answer? Close to $50,000 in today's dollars by the time they retired, according to calculations that the 401(k) and mutual fund giant Vanguard made this week. That buys a lot of trips to see the grandchildren -- or scores of nights in a nursing home.
Mr. Armstrong ultimately reversed the change after the uproar over the singling out of particular employees. Still, everyone who saves in a 401(k) or similar plan needs to take a close look at what AOL was trying to do, so they can recognize it and protest if their employer tries to do something like it. While there are plenty of federal regulations governing the basic administration and safeguarding of employer-provided retirement accounts, companies have a lot of leeway to alter their own plans in ways that can cost employees plenty. AOL's attempt is an unpleasant reminder that employers can and will make changes to employee benefits programs for any reason at all.
Most companies that match your contributions to a workplace retirement account deposit that match each time you get a paycheck. AOL wanted to wait until the end of each year and deposit any match all at once. People who left the company during the year, by choice or by layoff, would have gotten no match at all, not even a prorated one.
Not many companies have adopted these so-called last-day rules so far. As of the end of 2011, just 7 percent of clients at the benefits consulting firm Mercer deposited their 401(k) matches annually. Aon Hewitt's 2013 study put the number at 8 percent. The latest Plan Sponsor Council of America survey puts the figure at 17 percent.
Last-day rules tend to be a bit more popular among banks. There, however, it may not hurt employees quite as much, since employees tend not to walk out under their own power until after they've gotten their year-end bonus. If they hang around long enough to cash that check, their match will have already cleared. (Midyear retirees usually get their matches as well.)
IBM generated a fair bit of attention in late 2012 when it adopted a last-day rule, and a couple of United States senators tried to pressure it into reversing its move. It refused, and it was hard to make IBM the boogeyman given that its 401(k) match is extremely generous compared with most other companies. It also offers free comprehensive financial planning to employees, something more employers ought to offer.
Those last-day-rule survey numbers haven't grown much over time, not yet anyway. But there is reason for concern. The IBM move drew enough notice that a move to year-end 401(k) contributions is now on the menu of cost-saving changes that many employers consider each year. How much they could save depends on annual staff turnover, among other things.
As more employers automatically enroll employees in the 401(k) plans, those employers are naturally paying more in matches. Sometimes it doesn't cost that much more, say if over 90 percent of employees are already participating. But Rob Austin, the director of retirement research at Aon Hewitt, says that in rare cases the cost increase could approach 25 percent.
That money has to come from somewhere, and some employers may be willing to bet that workers won't understand the impact of a move to a last-day rule. But if every employer made a similar move, the numbers would grow quite large. Vanguard ran two calculations for me over a 40-year period, assuming the employee worked from age 25 to 65. The starting salary was $40,000, with 10 percent of it going to the retirement account, plus an employer match. The match was 50 percent of the employee contribution up to 6 percent of salary, a formula many employers use. The worker changed jobs seven times in 40 years, an assumption based on figures that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has generated.
Vanguard took inflation into account and used today's dollars in its 4 percent real investment return assumption and 1 percent annual wage raise projection. The result was an ending retirement account balance of $595,272 for an employee who received an employer match all 40 years and got it every two weeks. The person who didn't get the match in each of the seven years when there was a job change, however, ended up with $547,611. That's a difference of $47,661. (In the 33 other years, the person received the match at the end of the year.) Without any inflation adjustments in the original numbers, which is how it might look if you were using a standard web-based retirement calculator to make a basic projection, the difference would be $190,845. Some employees might get lucky and have their match arrive at the end of a year like 2008, when American stock markets suffered enormous losses. Others might end up leaving employers in years like 2013, when it would have been awfully nice to have every extra cent possible riding the markets upward.
Certain people may look at all this and figure a last-day rule is better than employers reducing a match, say to 4 percent from 5 percent. But employers are unlikely to make a permanent move like that. Not only does it affect everyone in an obvious way, amounting to a wage cut, it also has the potential to throw the plan out of balance. Bigger matches provide an incentive for more low-paid workers to contribute. If they don't participate in enough numbers, it can place the plan in violation of federal rules. And without a 401(k) plan, there won't be any more pretax contributions that are especially valuable to the highly paid executives who make the call on whether to cut retirement plans in the first place.
It's entirely possible that a more generous retirement plan can lead to lower week-to-week take-home pay. After all, if it's an either-or proposition, employers may favor a generous 401(k) program and offer raises of, say, 1 percent instead of 2 percent. But many employees spend raises rather than saving them. The upside of a good employer matching contribution is that it lands in an account that comes with significant penalties for people who try to take the money out early. For those who resist temptation, the savings multiply over time.
So there's a couple of lessons here. First, small changes can make a big difference over time. If you want more evidence of that, check out our online calculator that shows what can happen if you change your savings rate by just one percentage point. It also appears in the online version of this column.
Second, the change at AOL might well have simply sailed through had Mr. Armstrong not tried to pin it partly on a couple of infants. He may have done us all a favor, though. In an Aon Hewitt survey of employers taken right after IBM announced its change, 22 percent of them said that the primary barrier to moving to a last-day rule was concern about their own employees reacting badly.
Now AOL has inspired us to learn the full scope of the potential cost if last-day rules were to truly catch on, and employers will know that we know. Hopefully that concerns them even more. In the switch from pension plans to 401(k) and other programs where employees bear all of the risk, we've already lost plenty. So this seems like one of many good places to draw a line in the sand and demand no further cutbacks. Keep it in mind, because some other employer will undoubtedly try something like this again, sooner rather than later.

Abstract: The 0.1 percent quarterly growth in Italy, where Prime Minister Enrico Letta resigned on Friday to clear the way for his Democratic Party rival Matteo Renzi, was the first expansion in the country's beleaguered economy -- the third-largest in the euro zone -- since the first half of 2011.

Full text:   PARIS -- The euro zone economy grew slightly faster than expected in the last three months of 2013, an official report showed on Friday, bringing welcome news for the global economy amid signs of slowing in the United States and China.
Although growth in the 18-nation currency union is still weak, at a 1.1 percent annualized rate, it was the euro zone's third straight quarter in positive territory, indicating that the bloc is well beyond the year-and-a-half recession that ended in mid-2013.
The broader 28-member European Union also grew, though weakly, for the third consecutive quarter. The Union, with a market of 500 million consumers and an economy worth about 11.7 trillion euros, or $16 trillion, is one of the pillars of the global economy, and the extended weakness there has been a major source of concern for officials in the United States.
Germany and France, the two largest euro zone members, led the upturn. The Netherlands broke out of recession, and the pace of growth picked up modestly in Portugal, Spain and Italy.
The 0.1 percent quarterly growth in Italy, where Prime Minister Enrico Letta resigned on Friday to clear the way for his Democratic Party rival Matteo Renzi, was the first expansion in the country's beleaguered economy -- the third-largest in the euro zone -- since the first half of 2011.
"The most important point is that the recession really is over, and the periphery is growing again," Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said. And yet, he quickly added, the pace is inadequate to have a meaningful impact on Europe's biggest problem, the 26 million people without jobs.
The euro zone economy grew 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter, when it expanded 0.1 percent, according to Eurostat, the Luxembourg-based statistical agency of the European Union. The quarterly rise was better than the 0.2 percent growth economists had been expecting.
The 1.1 percent annualized rate continued to lag that of the United States, where growth perked up to 3.2 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter.
But the Eurostat report nonetheless came as a welcome surprise as more recent data from the United States, including a disappointing report on industrial production on Friday and a weak retail sales report on Thursday, were suggesting that a slowdown might be in the offing. China's economy, the second-largest in the world after the United States', appears increasingly fragile in the face of a push by the authorities in Beijing to deflate what is widely regarded as a giant credit bubble.
The euro zone figures released on Friday might also have brought at least a small measure of relief to Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. He and his colleagues on the bank's Governing Council have been watching the economic data for signs that ultralow inflation in the euro zone might be a sign of underlying weakness that could tip the bloc into outright deflation, a downward spiral of falling prices and economic torpor that can be hard to reverse.
Mr. Draghi said in the last week that he wanted to see additional data, including the euro zone gross domestic product report, before making any further adjustments to monetary policy. His critics have been urging the central bank to take steps to stimulate the economy, but Mr. Draghi's options are limited, particularly with the bank's benchmark interest rate down to a record of 0.25 percent.
Mr. Krämer said the data on Friday was in line with the E.C.B.'s own forecasts and would merely confirm the central bank's expectation for a slow, steady recovery. It will want to see additional data before deciding whether to move on monetary policy, he said, with reports on inflation, money supply and bank lending, as well as a survey of purchasing managers, before the March 6 meeting of the Governing Council. The bank's own economists will also be making new forecasts next month, including the inflation outlook for 2016.
"The likelihood of a further rate cut in March is lowered somewhat" by the growth report on Friday, Mr. Krämer said. But if the coming reports "come in on the weak side, that would support the case for more action."
The acceleration in growth is reflected in the automobile industry, one of the sectors hit hardest by the slowdown in the euro zone. Ford Motor said on Friday that sales in its 20 most important European countries rose 9.2 percent in January compared with a year earlier. It was the eighth consecutive month of improving sales, Ford said, and followed several months of upturn in the overall car market.
ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel maker, said in the last week that it expected demand in Europe to increase as much as 2.5 percent this year, a welcome change from the steep slump the industry has endured since 2008.
Financial markets met the news calmly, with the broad Stoxx Europe 600 index adding 0.6 percent on Friday and the euro ticking up 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.3698.
As welcome as the growth report might be, Europe's recovery remains fragile.
Growth "is likely to remain a long way short of the rates needed to tackle the problems of sky-high unemployment and crippling debt levels in many euro zone countries," Jonathan Loynes, an economist in London with Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. "And with G.D.P. still almost 3 percent below its 2008 peak, the dangers of deflation in the currency union will persist."
The "modest expansion" does not, he added, reduce "the urgent need for more policy action from the European Central Bank."
Germany's gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent from the previous quarter, the Federal Statistics Office reported from Wiesbaden, citing stronger foreign trade as an impetus. That was better than the 0.3 percent growth recorded for the July-September period, and better than the 0.3 percent analysts were expecting. It works out to a roughly 1.6 percent annual rate.
German growth was the result of higher exports, the country's Federal Statistical Office said on Friday. In addition, German companies stepped up investment in construction projects as well as equipment.
But German household spending dipped slightly in the fourth quarter compared with the third period, according to seasonally adjusted figures. The decline may come as a disappointment to those who hoped that Germans would help stimulate the euro zone economy by buying more products from their neighbors or taking more lavish vacations.
Mohsen Sohi, chief executive of the Freudenberg Group, a German manufacturer, said that 2013 was "an exceptionally challenging market environment" but that there were signs of improvement in the second half.
The company, which makes a wide variety of products such as gaskets and sealers used in cars, "expects to see a slight recovery in the global economy in 2014," Mr. Sohi said in an email. "In our opinion, established economies will experience gentle growth."
France's gross domestic product expanded 0.3 percent in the October-December period compared with the previous three months, Insee, the national statistical agency, reported. It cited a year-end burst of household spending and business investment for the spurt that finally pushed the French economy back above the precrisis level of early 2008.
"This is obviously not enough," Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister, told France 2 television, "but it well shows the strength of our economy."
Even with the modestly good news, Europe continues to operate far below its capacity, with an output gap -- the gulf between actual and potential output -- of as much as 3.8 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That means weak demand has left the economy with plenty of slack.

Abstract: (Holland Cotter) * Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

Brooklyn Museum: 'Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt' (through December 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, this show is for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum's renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

* Frick Collection: 'Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes From the Hill Collection' (through June 15) This sensational, beautifully presented show of 33 late-15th- to early-18th-century bronzes reflects a taste for historically important, big-statement examples in exceptional condition. They vividly reflect the Renaissance's new interest in antiquity and the human form while encouraging concentration on emotional expression, refined details (great hair!), struggling or relaxed figures and varied patinas. Works by the reigning geniuses Giambologna, Susini and the lesser-known Piamontini dominate, further enlivened by a handful of old master and late-20th-century paintings from the Hill collection. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, 212-288-0700, frick.org. (Roberta Smith)
* Guggenheim Museum: 'Carrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Photography and Video' (through May 14) Color and class are still the great divides in American culture, and few artists have surveyed them as subtly and incisively as Carrie Mae Weems, whose traveling 30-year retrospective has arrived at the Guggenheim. From its early candid family photographs, through series of pictures that track the Africa in African-American, to work that probes, over decades, what it means to be black, female and in charge of your life, it's a ripe, questioning and beautiful show. All the more galling, then, that this museum has cut it down to nearly half its original size and split it between two floors of annex galleries, making an exhibition that should have filled the main-event rotunda into a secondary attraction. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
International Center of Photography: 'Capa in Color' (through May 4) Robert Capa first worked with color in 1938, though he only began shooting regularly in color in 1941. This exhibition includes more than 100 contemporary inkjet prints, a fraction of the roughly 4,200 color transparencies held in the center's Capa Archive. Sections of the exhibition include photographs of postwar Paris with spectators at the Longchamp racetrack, fashion models, people sitting in cafes. Black and white remained the standard for war photography as well as art during this time, however, and color during Capa's period was still for commerce, amateurs, leisure -- and stories featuring women. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, 212-857-0000, icp.org. (Martha Schwendener)
International Center of Photography: 'What Is a Photograph?' (through May 4) This exhibition is supposed to address a good question: What is photography in today's digital age with its mind-boggling new smorgasbord of ways to create and disseminate machine-made images? It brings together works from the past four decades by 21 artists who have used photography to ponder the nature of photography itself. But it's a strangely blinkered and backward-looking show. Most of what is on view has more to do with photography's analog past than with its cybernetic future. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, 212-857-0000, icp.org. (Ken Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The American West in Bronze, 1850-1925' (through April 13) This intriguing and spiritually troubling show presents 65 mostly pedestal-scale sculptures representing standard themes of the old American West: cowboys, Indians and wild animals. It includes famous practitioners of the genre like Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, as well as 26 others. Nearly all the sculptures are in a mode of three-dimensional illustrative realism and tend heavily to romantic idealization. There's the rub: The real history of the conquest of the West by white folks was much worse than what these artists imagined in their very popular works. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Antonio Canova: The Seven Last Works' (through April 27) At the end of his life Antonio Canova (1757-1822) produced this show's seven rectangular plaster reliefs for a Neo-Classical church he designed and financed for his hometown, Possagno, Italy. Unlike his best known sculptures, they are not remotely erotic or even particularly sensual, and they have nothing to do with the Greek mythology. Rather, they illustrate biblical stories: four from the Book of Genesis and three revolving around the birth of Jesus. They have their moments, but on the whole it doesn't look like Christianity was a good influence on Canova's creative imagination. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Charles Marville: Photographer of Paris' (through May 4) As an official city photographer working under Napoleon III and his controversial urban planner, Baron Haussmann, Charles Marville recorded some 425 views of narrow, picturesque streets that were to be replaced by Haussmann's grand boulevards. Familiar images from that series are among the 100 or so photographs in this show, and they will doubtless be the main draw for visitors eager for a glimpse of a bygone Paris. But the curators also explore Marville's background in illustration and what little we know of his biography. He comes across as a cleareyed cartographer who never quite let go of the illustrator's imperative to make a beautiful, cohesive picture. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Flowering of Edo Period Painting: Japanese Masterworks from the Feinberg Collection' (through Sept. 7) The Met's Japanese galleries have been pulling crowds with a recent series of theme-based exhibitions. It now takes on a different challenge: how to present a cogent narrative within the parameters of a private collection. Given the material, it would have been hard to go wrong. What a collection this is. And what histories, new and old, it holds. Gleaming gold landscape screens, painted fans, painted views into urban brothels: The show is a magnetic beauty. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China' (through April 6) This museum's first survey of recent Chinese art uses the lens of the culture's ancient brush and ink tradition so basic to its landscape painting and calligraphy. It doesn't always work. The show endures a scattered installation, includes overly refined displays of empty skill and wanders off message in spots, especially with several sculptures that don't seem to belong here. But a few moments of visual life and many interesting questions about the weight of the old on the new make it worthwhile. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Jewels By JAR' (through March 9) Crowd-pleasers needn't represent lowered curatorial standards in terms of subject and execution, but this one does. It packs 400 efforts by the New York-born, Paris-based high-society jeweler, Joel Arthur Rosenthal (JAR), into a very dark gallery with insufficient labeling or historical backup. Large pave brooches, usually of flowers, abound; too many pieces date from 2010 or later. There are certainly redeeming works, but the show cries out for editing, scholarly support and better viewing conditions. Artist and audience are left hanging, with the museum's mercenary agenda in full view. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Piero della Francesa: Personal Encounters' (through March 30) None of the four works in this deceptively low-impact show are among Piero della Francesca's most celebrated. But they are all the devotional paintings for private clients Piero is known to have made, and this show is the first to bring them all together. Two picture Saint Jerome in his wilderness retreat and two portray the Madonna and Child, one of which is thought to be Piero's earliest known painting and the other among his last. As marriages of old religious faith and new forms of empirical consciousness, they are marvelous thought provokers. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Silla: Korea's Golden Kingdom' (through Feb. 23) This intriguing show presents more than 130 objects from Silla, a kingdom that dominated the Korean peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries. The first two of three sections includes gold jewelry, formally austere pottery, glassware and other objects excavated from mound shaped, earth-covered tombs in the city of Gyeongju. The third section displays sculpture made after Buddhism was adopted as the state religion around 530. Among the most captivating is a beautiful three-foot-high, gilt bronze sculpture of a young Bodhisattva, which, like a number of other works in the show, has been designated a Korean National Treasure. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Venetian Glass by Carlo Scarpa: The Venini Company, 1932-1947' (through March 2) Before he turned to architecture, Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) designed glass vessels, achieving a lifetime's worth of beauty and innovation in a short, remarkable burst of creativity. His achievement is honored with this sublime exhibition of nearly 300 of his splendidly sculptural, radiantly colored, ingeniously patterned vessels. They have an inspiring wholeness: process, form and decoration become a single thing; art, craft and science merge. And content of the non-narrative, experiential kind abounds. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'William Kentridge: The Refusal of Time' (through May 11) Everything is on the move in this mini-theater-cum-power-plant of an installation. In wraparound videos, metronomes pound. Clock-faces spin, spewing trails of stars. Drawings draw and erase themselves. Maps of Africa appear and disappear. White-coated figures mix potions amid giant watch springs. At the center of the gallery a wooden contraption pumps away like an energy source. A collaboration between Mr. Kentridge, who is based in South Africa, and Peter L. Galison, a science historian at Harvard, the piece refers to the European colonial experiment, which strove to shape other cultures to its own concepts of reality, only to find that those cultures had different, resistant, assertive realities of their own. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Visions and Nightmares: Four Centuries of Spanish Drawings' (through May 11) Skipping from 16th-century church commissions to Goya in just 25 objects, the Morgan's first show of Spanish drawings is necessarily awkward. But it delivers on the promise of its title, serving up heavenly apparitions and wicked phantasms aplenty. Highlights include a red chalk drawing of the satyr Marsyas by José de Ribera, an "Immaculate Conception" by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, several late Goya drawings, and a lavishly illustrated 1780 edition of "Don Quixote." 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
* Museum of Arts and Design: 'Out of Hand: Materializing the Postdigital' (through June 1) If you haven't quite wrapped your head around the concept of 3-D printing, or haven't yet had a digital scanner wrap itself around you, now you can do both in this survey of computer-assisted art, architecture and design. The show looks at art made since 2005 and fills nearly three floors, including many irresistible interactive projects. Its ideas may not be entirely new; the Museum of Modern Art's 2008 exhibition "Design and the Elastic Mind" covered much of the same territory, but there's something to be said for this more down-to-earth, production-focused exhibition. 2 Columbus Circle, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'A World of Its Own: Photographic Practices in the Studio' (through Oct. 5) This most lively if repetitive overview traces the history of photography as the Modern never has -- with images taken in the studio rather than out in the world. Its roughly 180 works span 160 years and represent some 90 portraitists, commercial photographers, lovers of still life, darkroom experimenters, Conceptual artists and several generations of postmodernists. Including film and video, it offers much to look at, but dwells too much in the past, becoming increasingly blinkered and cautious as it approaches the present. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Designing Modern Women 1890-1990' (through Sept. 21) Shoehorned into half the museum's design department, this conversation-starting display of objects from MoMA's permanent collection features items designed by more than 60 women, many of whom worked with male partners. Some, like Marianne Brandt and Eileen Gray, are well known to design aficionados, but most will be unfamiliar to a general audience. Most objects were created for domestic consumption. The pièce de résistance is a kitchen designed by Charlotte Perriand for the apartments in Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation in Marseille, France. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New' (through April 21) Ileana Sonnabend, who died in 2007 at 92, was one of the most foresighted art dealers of the late 20th century. This modest-size exhibition, made up of work she either owned or showed in her gallery, gives a sense of the range of her interests, from Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Modern Art: Isa Genzken: 'Retrospective' (through March 10) This prolific German sculptor -- for whom New York and its skyscrapers are a major source of inspiration -- receives her first comprehensive museum survey in this country. A grand, glamorous and sometimes grating 40-year overview, it traces her progress from idiosyncratic Minimalist monoliths to the distinctive, often architectonic, assemblages she began making in 1997 from cheesy materials and objects, concocting a raw, unapologetic beauty and a weirdly elliptical if literal-minded social commentary, often about the United States, power and war. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through March 9) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: "American Photographs," by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprise of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of the City of New York: 'City as Canvas: Graffiti Art from the Martin Wong Collection' (through Aug. 24) Drawn from a collection of graffiti-related materials assembled by the artist Martin Wong, this fascinating show and its indispensable catalog chronicle the rise and fall of the calligraphic, illegal art form known as "wild style" graffiti in New York in the 1970s and '80s. Presenting about 150 paintings, drawings, sketchbooks and documentary photographs, it features works by most of the underground movement's stars, including Daze (given name Chris Ellis), Dondi (Donald White), Futura 2000 (Leonard McGurr) and Lady Pink (Sandra Fabara). Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, 212-534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Gilded New York' (continuing) This period-piece of a show revolves around the ritual of the fancy-dress ball: an occasion for lavish expenditures by both host and guests. The gallery, upholstered in eggplant-colored brocade and stuffed with silver and porcelain, could serve as a set for the latest Wharton adaptation or Julian Fellowes's much-anticipated American follow-up to "Downton Abbey." Two mannequins wearing evening dresses by Maison Worth of Paris have been posed conversationally before a fireplace surround of Italian marble; one of them is clad in the sparkling "Electric Light" dress, festooned with silver bullion, worn by Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II at the Vanderbilt Ball of 1883. In the catalog, and just outside the gallery, photographs show guests at other balls dressed (with no apparent irony) as kings, queens and courtiers from Versailles. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, 212-534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
* New-York Historical Society: 'The Armory Show at 100: Modern Art and Revolution' (through Feb. 23) The International Exhibition of Modern Art, otherwise known as the Armory Show, woke American art from its provincial slumbers a century ago. Was it a good thing or a bad thing, and is there any reason to care about it now? With more than 100 works from the original exhibition by American and European artists and a big, richly illuminating catalog, "The Armory Show at 100" offers an excellent opportunity to ponder such questions. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
New-York Historical Society: 'Beauty's Legacy: Gilded Age Portraits in America' (through March 9) Rich in context and character-driven, this show of society portraits from the Gilded Age offers plenty of information on the New York social set known as Mrs. Astor's 400. Highlights include Theobald Chartran's painting of James Hazen Hyde, the Equitable Insurance Company heir whose come-hither stare is conspicuously modeled on Bronzino's "Portrait of a Young Man," and watercolor-on-ivory miniatures from the collection of Peter Marié that show society women in costume from the latest ball. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Rosenberg)
Queens Museum of Art: Peter Schumann 'The Shatterer' (through March 30) A recent expansion has doubled the size of the Queens Museum. Of five celebratory new shows, the largest and most moving is the solo museum debut of Peter Schumann, the founder and director of Bread and Puppet Theater, which is 50 years old this year. The show demonstrates how thoroughly Bread and Puppet is his creation. Its down-value look and activist ethos are evident in everything, including the black house-paint mural he has brushed, single-handedly, across one of the museum's wall and the hand-printed, hand-bound books he has placed in the gallery he designates as chapel and library. Every inch of this room is covered with figures and words: angels and ogres, exhortations and condemnations, art for one and for all, straight from the hand, right to the moral core. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 718-592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Carrie Mae Weems: The Museum Series' (through June 29) A set of recent pictures by Carrie Mae Weems are on view here as a supplement to the Guggenheim Museum's "Carrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Photography and Video" exhibition. These images show the artist dwarfed by the facades of international art institutions -- the Louvre, the Tate Modern, and so on -- which, to quote the Studio Museum news release, "affirm or reject certain histories through their collecting or display decisions. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Shadows Took Shape' (through March 9) Space is definitely the place in this lively group exhibition devoted to Afrofuturism, a contemporary art trend that takes the ultra-free-jazz musician Sun Ra as its patron saint and locates itself in a universe where racial and ethnic identities float free from stereotypes without losing track of the histories that created them. William Villalongo sets African sculpture and modernist painting soaring together among the stars; the Kenyan artist Wanuri Kahiu films ecological cataclysm and renewal in ages to come; William Cordova, who lives in New York and Lima, Peru, recreates the Millennium Falcon from "Star Wars," now equipped with a cultural studies library. 144 West 125th Street, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Galleries: Chelsea
* Arahmaiani: 'Fertility of the Mind' (through Feb. 22) The first New York solo show for the Indonesian artist Arahmaiani Feisal, who uses only her first name, is a condensed, bare-bones retrospective. The artist was raised Muslim, though has taken the hybrid nature of Indonesian Islam, with its roots in Buddhism, Hinduism and animism, to mix images from across the religious spectrum. And her wide travels have made her a world citizen. From the start she has approached art as form of political activism used to shake up orthodoxies of faith, gender and class in a country that has experienced increasing political repression and bloody religious sectarianism. Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, 212-229-9100, trfineart.com. (Cotter)
* Andrew Moore: 'Dirt Meridian' (through Feb. 22) This series of large color photographs documents the devastation -- by abandonment and drought -- of rural Nebraska. The images of hollow houses, crumbling barns, desolate trees and a graffiti-filled blackboard might qualify as ruin porn if they didn't bring such heart-rending news of an existence that was solitary in the best of times. "The Murray House, Sears Roebuck Rockfaced Wizard No. 52, Sheridan County, Nebraska," might almost be a painting by Salvador Dalí, had he been an American Regionalist. Yancey Richardson Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, 646-230-9610, yanceyrichardson.com. (Smith)
Richard Serra: 'New Sculpture' (through March 15) In this show, Richard Serra continues along the road that emerged from the hugely successful "Torqued Ellipses" of the 1990s, but also circles back to his earlier oeuvre. Here you have the Serra of the '60s and '70s, revised and updated: heavy rectilinear plates and cubes fabricated in steel rather than lead, his signature material in the '60s. 555 West 24th Street, 212-741-1111, gagosian.com. (Schwendener)
'Simplest Means' (through Feb. 22) This suggestive exhibition presents works by eight contemporary artists along with a selection of useful objects produced by Shakers mostly in the 19th century. The connection is a predilection for simplicity and transparency. Shaker pieces include an intricately constructed wooden chip fork and a finely woven straw bonnet. Among works by the artists are geometric compositions painted by Don Voisine; a dusky painting of a broom and dustpan by Joshua Marsh; and loops and slender lengths of wood carved by Seth Koen. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 625 West 27th Street, 212-989-0156, baileygallery.com. (Johnson)
Sue Williams: 'WTC, WWIII, Couch Size' (through Feb. 22) Painting with Crayola-bright colors and spontaneous verve on unprimed canvases up to 11 feet wide, Ms. Williams creates mostly abstract compositions of swerving lines and brushy fields peppered with crisply delineated cartoonish fragments, some organic, some geometric. The six works in this show are scrumptious confections of painterly panache. 303 Gallery, 507 West 24th Street, 212-255-1121, 303gallery.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Other
* 'The Age of Small Things' (through Feb. 23) This delightful, cheerfully eclectic grab bag of a show presents more than 50 small paintings, drawings and three-dimensional pieces from the mid-17th century to the present by 42 artists. Francis Picabia, Philip Guston, Vija Celmins and John Wesley are among the numerous boldface names represented. Some of the most arresting things are by unknown 19th-century creators, including Victorian mourning paper weights in the form of miniature books and intricate, cut-paper works representing a hand holding a heart. Dodge Gallery, 15 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, 212-228-5122, dodge-gallery.com. (Johnson)
Guy Ben Ner (through March 8) "Soundtrack" (2013), the centerpiece of this show, takes a scene from Steven Spielberg's 2005 movie "War of the Worlds" as a "ready-made" soundtrack and pairs it with footage shot in Mr. Ben Ner's kitchen in Tel Aviv. Like Tom Cruise's character in that movie, Mr. Ben Ner's children from his first marriage play a pivotal role in "Soundtrack," billed alongside the cute baby from his second marriage. The artist's family situation would be none of our business except that we've literally watched his kids grow up in his oeuvre. In that sense, "Soundtrack" serves as an art analogue to "War of the Worlds" in which familial bliss is ruptured and plays itself out on embattled ground. Postmasters, 54 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, 212-727-3323, postmastersart.com. (Schwendener)
* Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (through March 31) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, 212-610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
* 'Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart: Collected by Julie Ault' (through Feb. 23) Julie Ault, an artist, writer and curator, was a founding member of the New York collaborative Group Material, which, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, used exhibitions and public events to investigate the overlap of art and politics. During decades of depression, inflation, multiculturalism, conservatism and AIDS, she and her colleagues lived improvised lives on the city's fringes. Within their world, art was currency for giving gifts, bartering, buying and selling among friends. This show, spread over two different locations, is a moving record of such transactions. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo; Artists Space: Books & Talks, 55 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, 212-226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)
* Moira Dryer Project (through Feb. 22) The first exhibition in 20 years of the obdurate yet romantic wood-panel paintings of Moira Dryer (1957-92) is a two-part affair that is especially relevant at a time when younger painters, many of them women, are exploring new ways of getting physical with their medium. Dryer pitted the literalness of her paintings against thin, sometimes streaky applications of paint for results that are witty and startling, assertive yet suffused with a delicate, even poetic atmosphere. A lively group show of paintings or painting-like works by six artists at the gallery's second space (at 195 Chrystie Street near Stanton) confirms the current relevance of Dryer's art. Eleven Rivington, two Lower East Side locations: 11 Rivington Street, 212-982-1930; 195 Chrystie Street, near Stanton Street, 212-477-2507, elevenrivington.com. (Smith)
* 'An Opening of the Field: Jess, Robert Duncan, and Their Circle' (through March 29) If you were young, gifted and odd, San Francisco was a good place to be in the years after World War II, when big changes were brewing in American art and culture. And this show feels like a chunk of Bay Area turf has been lifted from back then and set down, untrimmed and buzzing, in the New York of now. At its center are two gay men, the poet Robert Duncan (1919-88) and the artist Jess Collins (who went by the single name Jess). Committed partners living in a wonderland of an old house filled to roof with art, they gathered a fascinating creative community around them, and a lot of it shows up here. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, 212-998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Cotter)
* 'The Silent Way: Robert Breer, Matthew Buckingham, Jenny Perlin' (through Feb. 23) In this succinct and beautiful three-work show, Matthew Buckingham pays facts-only homage to light, Jenny Perlin celebrates color in film and Robert Breer brings them together in "Form Phases IV," a 1954 three-minute classic of animated geometry that builds a passion for Malevich into something new. It's not to be missed. Simon Preston Gallery, 301 Broome Street, Lower East Side, 212-431-1105, simonprestongallery.com. (Smith)
Out of Town
* Carnegie Museum of Art: 2013 Carnegie International (through March 16) A welcome shock to the system of one of the art world's more entrenched rituals, this lean, seemingly modest, thought-out exhibition takes the big global survey of contemporary art off steroids. It is mostly devoid of the looming, often expensive installations called "festival art," while evincing a gratifying affinity for color, form, beauty and pleasure, and a discernible lack of interest in finger-wagging didacticism. Object-making of all kinds seems healthy, as do artist-initiated activist projects (which sometimes overlap). Interventionist and artist-as-curator efforts? Not as impressive. 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 412-622-3131, carnegieinternational.org. (Smith)
National Gallery of Art: 'Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium From Greek Collections' (through March 2) With about 170 objects, this show takes a processional sweep through Byzantine art from its Greco-Roman beginnings to its multicultural late phase in the 15th century, with a specific emphasis on its development in Greece itself. The history is fascinating, and the objects couldn't be more beautiful, including a glinting 13th-century icon of the Virgin and Child pieced together from glass, silver, gold and glass; a 17-foot-long parchment scroll painted with chirping birds and secret prayers; and a heavenly silk embroidery, found stashed away in a Thessaloniki church, depicting the body of the dead Christ surrounded by fan-wielding seraphs and a stitched chant, "Holy, holy, holy." On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, 202-737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Last Chance
Julien Bismuth: 'An image as the _____ of a surface' (closes next Friday) As the show's title suggests, Julien Bismuth is concerned not only with how images are made, but also with their relationship to surfaces. Pink mesh silk screens sit on the floor, leaning against the wall, sometimes stacked like an archive. Above them are images printed in dark gray ink directly onto the wall. Two videos focus on what we experience privately in the realm of images, and an audio work features an actress reading "statements of intention" by artists, pop stars and others. Ripped from context, intentions mean nothing. Here they serve as poetic reminders of the great synapse between art and experience. Simone Subal, 131 Bowery, at Grand Street, second floor, Lower East Side, 917-409-0612, simonesubal.com. (Schwendener)
* Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Tony Feher' (closes on Sunday) Almost anything can be beautiful if it's presented in the right way. That's where the sculptor Tony Feher comes in. His palette consists almost entirely of cheap manufactured objects, including glass and plastic bottles; metal and plastic bottle tops; marbles, coins, nuts and bolts, metal rings, plastic bags, broken pieces of glass, rope, plastic cord, shredded paper, cans and cardboard boxes. He organizes these and other things into simple but surprisingly exciting, often funny configurations with intriguing philosophical implications. This beautiful show surveys a 25-year career. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* 'Devotion: Excavating Bob Mizer' (closes on Saturday) Bob Mizer is best known as a producer and publisher of beefcake photography for a gay market. This show makes a good case for him as an artist with interests and an imagination considerably more expansive than what his popular reputation suggests. The show's first picture is of a Siamese cat on a sofa. Further on are Arbus-like portraits of women and children; photographs of odd staged events like a magic show; and a picture of a cop writing a parking ticket for a group of teenage girls that could have been made into a painting by Norman Rockwell. A spirit of good-humored generosity prevails. 80WSE, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, 212-998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Johnson)
* Lori Ellison (closes on Sunday) Art is always something made from nothing, these small drawings and paintings exalt. They build on little more than doodles that are carefully cultivated and meditatively repeated -- always freehand -- until they form a fluctuating network or pattern. The motifs come equally from nature, geometry and instinct: worms, cells, flowers, triangles, eyes and circles-within-squares are among the words they bring to mind without accounting for their mesmerizing yet adamantly modest effects. McKenzie Fine Art Inc., 55 Orchard Street, near Grand Street, Lower East Side, 212-989-5467, mckenziefineart.com. (Smith)
* Saul Fletcher (closes on Saturday) This photographer's studio wall has long served him as both a backdrop and a canvas, a surface on which to draw or pose models or pin up Arte Povera-ish arrangements of leaves, fabric scraps and other found objects. In his latest photographs, small, scrappily poetic, mainly black-and-white prints, two smudgy markings on the wall serve as comfortingly familiar bookends for a series of living and dead subjects: wilted flowers, a Shaker-style chair, a plucked pigeon, friends and family members, and a pet dog. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street, Chelsea, 212-367-9663, antonkerngallery.com. (Rosenberg)
* Ulrike Müller: 'Weather' (closes on Sunday) The latest paintings from this wide-ranging artist are small, compressed and built to last, being baked enamel on steel. Using two to five colors and a flexible geometric vocabulary that doesn't rule out the human body, they conjure shifting conditions of light, complementary shadows and even the coming of a full moon. The colors could be less muted, but that is just one of many possibilities opened in this impressive show. Callicoon Fine Arts, 124 Forsyth Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, 212-219-0326, callicoonfinearts.com. (Smith)
Jackie Nickerson: 'Terrain' (closes on Saturday) Jackie Nickerson works in a traditional social documentary format, and her photographs ripple with politics, particularly around the issues of food production, agribusiness and labor. She upsets one of documentary's central tenants, however, by photographing farm workers in southern and eastern Africa holding the materials and tools of their trades. Tobacco or banana leaves or plastic crates obscure their faces and bodies. Where earlier social documentary used people as its "universal" currency, "Terrain" puts plants and work implements in the foreground, creating what might be called post-human social documentary. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, Chelsea, 212-645-1701, jackshainman.com. (Schwendener)
Davina Semo: 'Ruder Forms Survive' (closes on Saturday) A promising young artist overdoes it, spreading herself too thin with pat, generic results -- especially when remaking the modernist monochrome in industrial-strength materials like cement, heavy chains, stainless steel mesh and acid-stained one-way mirrors. The histrionic punk-noir titles also don't help. For a sense of her talent for creating tantalizing confusions of perception, material and emotion, turn to three small wall pieces made of brass: two metal-lined crevices redolent of armored female genitalia and archers' slits and their ambiguously protruding opposite, a shiny bronze flange that tapers upward and outward from the wall. Marlborough Chelsea, 545 West 25th Street, 212-463-8634, marlboroughchelsea.com. (Smith)
* Hayley Tompkins: 'Space Kitchen' (closes on Saturday) A painter known for avoiding canvas musters a beautiful show dominated by luminous abstract paintings in pale colors on (or in) translucent plastic (kitchen) trays perfectly suited to her needs. Fusing surface and frame while allowing the white wall to shine through, they protect skewed moonstruck orbs that conjure embryos, petri-dish experiments, strange moons and other primal motifs with an engaging, unfussy mix of panache and restraint. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 537 West 22nd Street, 212-741-8849, andrewkreps.com. (Smith)
Honza Zamojski: 'Self Portrait With Fish' (closes on Saturday) This promising young Polish artist returns to New York with an installation that expands the definition of "drawing in space." Beautiful, funny and exceedingly economical, it consists of an immense, greatly attenuated, visibly male figure made of graphite-covered wood that one way or another touches all six planes of the room. His raised arms exaggerate the length of a recent catch with more than the usual Pinocchio-like effect. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, 212-741-8849, andrewkreps.com. (Smith)
Correction: February 22, 2014, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An art entry on the Listings pages on Friday and on Feb. 14 about an exhibition of paintings by Sue Williams at the 303 Gallery in Manhattan included an outdated address for the gallery, which moved last year. It is at 507 West 24th Street, not at 547 West 21st Street.

Full text:   Sales of Iranian crude oil rose by 100,000 barrels a day in January, to 1.32 million, the International Energy Agency reported on Thursday in its monthly survey, offering what appeared to be a glimpse at the initial impact of the temporary nuclear agreement that eased some of the Western sanctions against Iran.
American supporters of strong sanctions against Iran seized on the increased oil sales as new evidence that the temporary agreement, negotiated in Geneva in November and put into effect last month, had disproportionately favored Iran. The Obama administration said at the time the agreement was reached that Iran's oil exports would not increase, remaining around one million barrels a day.
"It is clear that the Geneva negotiations and the signing of the interim agreement significantly altered the outlook for Iran's oil market and overall economy, due to both the easing of restrictions and the reduced risks for purchasers and traders," said Mark D. Wallace, the chief executive of United Against Nuclear Iran, a group based in New York that has supported stronger sanctions.
Asked about the reported monthly increase at a daily press briefing, Marie Harf, a deputy State Department spokeswoman, said, "I'm having our folks take a look at it." She acknowledged that the temporary agreement specifies that Iran's oil customers "don't have to reduce further, but they can't increase."
The International Energy Agency, a group based in Paris that represents 28 energy-importing countries, including the United States, said China accounted for most of the Iranian increase, at 95,000 barrels a day. Small increases in imports by Japan and India were offset by small reductions in imports by South Korea, Taiwan and Syria.
The Iranian data compiled by the agency is a closely watched barometer of the effect of sanctions on Iran, which suffered a huge drop in oil industry revenue in the past few years.
Under the temporary nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, Iran agreed to suspend most nuclear activities in exchange for a modest easing of sanctions. The easing included a suspension of a United States restriction that would have forced Iran's oil buyers to cut their imports to avoid big penalties. Another provision will allow Iran to have access to $4.2 billion of its own money that has been frozen in foreign banks.
Most Western sanctions against Iran remain in force, including a European oil embargo and extensive prohibitions on international banking transactions. The Obama administration has warned repeatedly that the temporary agreement should not be interpreted as a signal that these sanctions will be dismantled.
The agreement between Iran and the so-called P5-plus-1 group of countries, comprising the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany, was intended to allow negotiators more time to reach a permanent accord on the disputed nuclear program, which Iran says is peaceful but other nations suspect is a cover for achieving the ability to make atomic bombs.
The first talks on a permanent accord are scheduled for next Tuesday in Vienna.
The oil data came a day after the International Monetary Fund, in its first on-the-ground assessment of Iran's economy in nearly three years, said the country faced anemic growth and rampant inflation, caused in part by the effects of the sanctions. Although optimism over the temporary nuclear accord may have helped stabilize Iran's decline, the fund's report said Iran remained economically weak and vulnerable.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   The International Monetary Fund issued a sobering appraisal of Iran's economy on Wednesday, warning that years of government mismanagement aggravated by the impact of the West's antinuclear sanctions had left the country vulnerable to anemic growth and rampant inflation that require urgent attention.
The I.M.F. appraisal was the organization's first on-the-ground assessment of the Iranian economy in nearly three years. It was issued as Iran is seeking to undo the Western sanctions through negotiations on its disputed nuclear program.
A temporary agreement reached in November and put into effect last month provided some limited sanctions relief to Iran. But the basic restraints remain in force, and they have limited Iran's ability to sell oil, its most important export, and have largely paralyzed its ability to conduct international financial transactions electronically.
"Large shocks and weak macroeconomic management over the past several years have had a significant impact on macroeconomic stability and growth," Martin Cerisola, the I.M.F. assistant director for its Middle East and Central Asia department, said in a statement on the I.M.F. website.
Mr. Cerisola said difficulties with the Iranian government's attempts to reduce subsidies for fuel and food, inadequately funded social programs and "a marked deterioration in the external environment stemming from the intensification of trade and financial sanctions, have weakened the economy."
"Inflation and unemployment are high, while the corporate and banking sectors show signs of weakness," he said. "These shocks have exposed structural weaknesses in the economy and in the policy framework."
Mr. Cerisola, who led a delegation to Tehran from Jan. 25 to Feb. 8, said that the authorities in the administration of President Hassan Rouhani, which took over last summer, "are well aware of these challenges and the need to advance reforms, and have begun the preparatory work in many of these areas."
He said a more comprehensive Iran report would be prepared by late March.
To some sanctions advocates, the I.M.F. assessment suggested that the effects of the temporary agreement to ease sanctions reached last November in Geneva may have helped to stabilize the economy. Mr. Cerisola said the I.M.F. expected the economy to grow 1 percent to 2 percent this year after having declined in 2012 and 2013.
"I actually think Iran's economy has stabilized and is on a path to a modest albeit fragile recovery due in no small part to sanctions relief and shifts in market psychology as a result of the Geneva agreement," Mark Dubowitz, executive director of Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that supports more sanctions, said in an email.
Mr. Cerisola's statement said the inflation rate had fallen from a 45 percent annualized rate in July to below 30 percent as of last December, partly because the currency, the rial, had stabilized after a prolonged decline. Still, it said, "external shocks" could undermine the rial's stability. The statement also said that while the economic outlook may have improved partly because of the temporary nuclear agreement and the plans for negotiations on a permanent agreement, the prospects for Iran's economy "still remain highly uncertain."
The I.M.F.'s tone contrasted sharply with the optimism about the economy espoused by Iran's government, which has contended that the temporary agreement on the nuclear issue had caused fatal fractures in the regimen of Western sanctions and that they would eventually collapse.
The official news media in Iran has reported on revived foreign business interest in trade and investment with Iran, particularly regarding a delegation from France last week. The Obama administration has sought to blunt that message. On Tuesday, President Obama, in the most pointed reminder yet, said the United States would come down "like a ton of bricks" on sanctions evaders. He issued the warning while hosting France's president, François Hollande, in Washington.
The Obama administration also has expressed annoyance over news reports that Russia may be negotiating a deal with Iran to trade goods for $1.5 billion worth of Iranian oil per month, which would substantially increase Iran's oil exports. American officials have said such a deal would violate sanctions and undermine the negotiations.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Courts are normally supposed to resolve disputes. But a decision last week by the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany has raised more questions than it has answered about the legality of a financial weapon that many analysts say saved the euro in its darkest hour -- without even firing a shot.
In the view of the German court, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, made a promise he could not legally keep in the summer of 2012, when he resolved to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the euro currency union.
By doing so, the court inadvertently exposed another weakness in the construction of the European Union, which remains a relatively feeble federation compared with its strongest member states. The decision suggests that the European court system suffers from the same kind of turf battles that have often hampered political decision-making in the euro zone and prolonged the crisis.
Mr. Draghi stepped in at a critical time for the European Union. During the summer of 2012, the high levels of borrowing costs of some of the euro zone's weakest members, as measured by the interest rates on their bonds, were unsustainable. The specter of big bailouts for Italy and Spain was looming, and no one believed the euro zone could possibly afford such rescues.
The Draghi vow alone helped to start easing the crisis. And soon after, the European Central Bank announced a plan to buy huge quantities of euro zone government bonds, which would ensure enough demand to keep the rates reasonably low.
Having brandished the weapon, Mr. Draghi never needed to use it. Market interest rates for Spanish and Italian bonds plummeted and the euro zone crisis receded. That rendered any argument about the legality of the bank's bond buying to be largely theoretical.
Still, thousands of Germans, fearful that they would have to bear the cost of rescuing Italians and Spaniards, petitioned the Constitutional Court to declare the program illegal. After deliberating for seven months, the court, which meets in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe, ruled Friday that purchases of euro zone government bonds would violate a provision in the bank's charter that prohibits it from financing member governments.
But rather than blocking any future bond buying, a move that might have caused havoc in financial markets, the court punted to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Some analysts saw the decision as little more than a way for the German court to express its disapproval of any bond purchases, without the risk of reigniting the euro zone crisis. The German court even reserved the right to block a higher court decision.
"They want to appear true to their legal principles, but they don't want to go where that takes them," said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Many experts say the muddled decision places no immediate restraint on the European Central Bank, a view expressed Wednesday by Benoît Coeuré, a member of the bank's executive board.
"The status of the O.M.T. is not changed," Mr. Coeuré said in an interview with Reuters, referring to what the bank calls the bond purchases, the outright monetary transactions. "It is ready to be used, but it is highly unlikely it would have to be used at the moment."
Many outside analysts agree, and there has been little market reaction to the decision.
"I don't think the E.C.B.'s room to maneuver will be limited by this decision," Michael Heise, chief economist of the German insurer Allianz, told a small group of reporters on Wednesday in Frankfurt. If the central bank had not promised to intervene in bond markets last year, he said, the euro might have collapsed, with grave economic consequences.
But the German court decision has been fodder for euro-skeptics, confirming their view that the bank has illegally grabbed power. And the decision highlights a major unresolved question of jurisprudence in the region: Does the European Court of Justice reign over national supreme courts?
Mr. Kirkegaard predicted that the European Court of Justice, which could take more than a year to issue a decision, will find language that addresses the concerns of the German court and avoids a crisis.
Still, the dispute creates uncertainty.
Treaties give the European Court of Justice the final say in matters of European law. But the German Constitutional Court has a history of insisting on its right to decide whether European law violates the German Constitution, according to Franz Mayer, a professor at the University of Bielefeld. In its decision on Friday, the German court reiterated that it had the right to block policies that would expand the powers of the European Union beyond what has been agreed to by treaty.
The German court also effectively told the European Court of Justice how it should rule. The bond-buying program would be legal, the German court said, only under certain conditions: if the amounts were limited; if the central bank insisted that bonds it buys be paid in full by the issuing governments; and if the bank did not distort market prices for the bonds. Analysts say that imposing limits on bond buying would encourage speculators to challenge the bank's resolve.
The German decision was controversial within the court, as well. Two of the eight judges who considered the case issued unusually sharp dissenting opinions.
"In an effort to secure the rule of law, a court may happen to exceed judicial competence," Judge Gertrude Lübbe-Wolff wrote in dissent. "In my view, this has occurred here."
Michael Gerhardt, the other judge who dissented, said the complaints against the European Central Bank filed by thousands of individual Germans were inadmissible. It is the responsibility of the elected members of the German Parliament, not ordinary citizens, to challenge the bank's decisions, Mr. Gerhardt said. Parliament has not tried to block the bank's policies because most legislators favor them.
The German Constitutional Court's condemnation of bond buying has no legally binding force. But it could act as a constraint on the bank if, as some economists fear might still happen, the euro zone slipped into a broad decline in prices. Such deflation could be ruinous for consumer spending, corporate profits and jobs.
One obvious strategy against deflation would be the wholesale purchase of government bonds, the same tool that the Federal Reserve has been using to stimulate the United States economy.
Mr. Coeuré said on Wednesday that the European Central Bank saw no sign of deflation at the moment, though it was alert to the risks of very low inflation. Bond purchases remain an option as a monetary policy tool, he said.
And Mr. Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute said he did not think that Mr. Draghi was worried about the German court. On the contrary, Mr. Draghi, a master of using words and veiled threats to impose discipline on politicians and financial markets, may find the German howling about his policies to be useful. The complaints give Mr. Draghi a counterweight to the majority of members of the bank's governing council who would like to open the monetary policy floodgates.
"It's always useful to have a mad dog on your team," Mr. Kirkegaard said. "It intimidates the opposition."

Full text:   LONDON -- The Bank of England on Wednesday abandoned its six-month-old strategy of pledging to consider raising interest rates only when unemployment falls to 7 percent, saying it would now take a number of factors into account.
Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, also stressed that higher interest rates were still some way off and that any increase would be gradual. The central bank also raised its growth forecast for 2014 again, to 3.4 percent from 2.8 percent which it had forecast in November.
Overhauling his forward guidance strategy, Mr. Carney said that decisions on a rate increase would now be linked to a broader range of factors, including spare capacity in the economy, labor productivity and wage growth.
"As yet the recovery is neither balanced nor sustainable," Mr. Carney told a news conference, adding that the central bank would take no risks with the fragile economic rebound.
Securing the recovery could be achieved by "waiting to raise the bank rate until spare capacity has been absorbed further and then eventually through gradual and limited rate increases. Bank rates may need to stay at low levels for some time to come," Mr. Carney said.
As in Britain, the economic outlook has improved in the United States, where the Federal Reserve has cut back on the bond-buying part of its stimulus effort. When it comes to interest rates, and linking them to the unemployment rate, the Fed has also made adjustments in its guidance.
In 2012, the Fed said that it planned to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. The Fed revised that in December, saying it was likely to maintain that policy well past that threshold. Some Fed officials have said there is a need now for greater clarity about their plans because the jobless rate has since fallen to 6.6 percent.
Overtaken by events, the British central bank has had little alternative but to review its August pledge to start considering raising interest rates, from a current record low of 0.5 percent, only when the unemployment rate falls to 7 percent.
Years of record low interest rates and other government stimulus measures have helped revive the economy and push unemployment close to that 7 percent threshold years earlier than the central bank had anticipated.
However, Mr. Carney argued that his policy "is working" and had instilled business confidence by giving more certainty, helping growth prospects. Even critics of forward guidance had not predicted such a sharp fall in unemployment, he said, while admitting that the central bank had learned from its experience.
The speed with which the central bank has had to change strategy raises some awkward questions about its credibility nonetheless. The policy was introduced with much fanfare by Mr. Carney as he took over as Bank of England governor in the summer, when the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent and Britain's economy was in much need of support.
Some economists have said the policy lacked credibility from the start because the unemployment rate threshold was too high, leaving investors and consumers wondering about how soon interest rates would rise again.
Robert Wood, an economist at Berenberg bank in London, welcomed Wednesday's move, which he said was "an abrupt U-turn" and marked a return to "inflation targeting, with a few bells and whistles attached."
The bank said inflation had returned to its 2 percent target and suggested it would remain under control during the next three years.
The pound jumped on Wednesday, suggesting that financial markets were factoring in a rate increase in 2015 despite Mr. Carney's comments. Brian Hilliard, chief economist for Britain at Société Générale in London, said the Bank of England might see the positive side of a rise in the value of sterling, which would help reduce inflation.
But he added that the bank would be disappointed that the markets had not believed that interest rates would stay low for some time. Mr. Carney's updated forward guidance gave "no firm message," Mr. Hilliard said.
"His guidance today was no surprise but the strength of the growth forecast was," Mr. Hilliard said, adding that this suggested that spare capacity in the economy might be absorbed relatively quickly, leading to higher interest rates.
Mr. Carney's comments about the unbalanced nature of the recovery highlight the difficult juggling act he faces. While growth in Britain is impressive by European standards, much of it appears driven by consumer demand. Productivity growth has been disappointing and there is a risk of a property bubble developing in the southeast of England.
A rise in interest rates might choke off recovery and push up the value of the pound sterling, which has appreciated against the euro in recent months.
In a sign that the economic recovery in Britain is gaining momentum, the unemployment rate fell to 7.1 percent in the three months through November from 7.8 percent in the summer, when the Bank of England announced its forward guidance strategy. At the time, the bank did not expect unemployment to fall that low until 2016. Now it expects to have data by the spring showing that the rate reached 7 percent in January.
As the economic outlook improved, more economists started to expect the Bank of England to start raising rates earlier than 2016.
Britain's main business lobby group, the Confederation of British Industry, welcomed Mr. Carney's policy shift. "The bank's new guidance will give businesses further peace of mind that interest rates will stay low for some time, until investment and incomes are growing at sustainable rates," said Katja Hall, the body's chief policy director. "The bank has made clear that even when the economy is operating at more normal levels, rates will only increase gradually."

Full text:   The millennials -- born after 1980 -- are the best-educated generation in history. By early adulthood, a third have college degrees, and those degrees help them earn more than ever before. So scholars at the Pew Research Center were puzzled when they found that the median, inflation-adjusted income of 25- to 32-year-olds had changed very little since 1965.
The reason, they discovered, is that even though a college degree is worth more, a high school degree alone is worth a lot less. Its value, in terms of wages, has declined enough to cancel out almost all the gains by all the millennials who have earned four-year degrees.
From 1965 to 2013, according to a new Pew report called "The Rising Cost of Not Going to College," the typical high school graduate's earnings fell more than 10 percent, after inflation.
"That is one of the great economic stories of our era, which you could define as income inequality," said Paul Taylor, an author of the report. "The leading suspects are the digital economy and the globalization of labor markets. Both of them place a higher premium on the knowledge-based part of the work force and have the effect of drying up the opportunities for good middle-class jobs, particularly for those that don't have an education."
Even middle-class jobs that are still available increasingly require a college degree, either because they require more skill than they used to or because employers have become pickier.
The Pew report found that the wage premium for having a college degree was at a record high. The median annual wage for young college-educated workers now is $45,500, compared to $28,000 for high school graduates -- a gap of $17,500. In 1965, the gap was much smaller: $7,400. (All the figures are in 2012 dollars.)
Not surprisingly, in a survey conducted by Pew, young college graduates were more likely to report satisfaction with their careers. "On virtually every measure of economic well-being and career attainment -- from personal earnings to job satisfaction to the share employed full time -- young college graduates are outperforming their peers with less education," said the report, which included economic data from the United States Census in the analysis of the survey results.
The value of a college degree is well established, but the high cost of tuition and fees has made many question whether it is worth the investment. Most young college graduates surveyed by Pew said their degree had already paid off or would pay off, even though many are saddled with debt. In the survey, 66 percent of millennials said they had borrowed to pay for school, compared to 59 percent of Gen Xers, those aged 33 to 48, and 43 percent of baby boomers, ages 49 to 67.
"For today's young adults, the only thing more expensive than going to college is not going to college," Mr. Taylor said. "And that sort of captures the dilemma that many find themselves in."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, told a House committee on Tuesday that she strongly supported and planned to continue the policies adopted under her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke.
At the same time, in emphasizing her concern about unemployment -- and in agreeing to spend almost six hours answering the committee's questions -- Ms. Yellen also began the delicate process of imposing her own influence on the Fed's direction.
Ms. Yellen made clear that the Fed planned to keep cutting back on its bond buying, which had been a crucial part of its economic stimulus campaign, unless there was a "notable change" in the economy toward a more negative outlook. "I served on the committee as we formulated our current policy strategy, and I strongly support that strategy," she said.
But she described the recovery of the labor market as "far from complete," and said she retained her longstanding conviction that the Fed had the power to improve the situation. That suggests the Fed may continue to strengthen the mainstay of its campaign, keeping short-term interest rates at extraordinarily low levels.
Ms. Yellen's marathon testimony was a statement in the same vein. As the Fed's vice chairwoman, she pushed to increase communication with investors and the public, reflecting her view that clear communication enhances the power of monetary policy. Communication, in the form of assurances that the Fed intends to keep rates low, is now the Fed's primary means of suppressing rates.
The stock markets rose in the morning following the release of Ms. Yellen's testimony, and again when she began to speak. Some analysts speculated that investors were reassured by the message of continuity. The news that House Republicans planned to allow a debt ceiling increase reinforced the good mood on Wall Street. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 19.91 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,819.75.
Similarly, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 192.98 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 15,994.77. The Nasdaq composite increased 42.87 points, or 1 percent, to 4,191.05.
In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 2.73 percent, from 2.67 percent late Monday. Its price fell 16/32, to 100 6/32.
Ms. Yellen, in her inaugural public appearance as Fed chairwoman, was fluid in discussing monetary policy, but appeared less assured in answering questions about financial regulation. She sometimes consulted a binder that she kept open on the witness table and at times turned to ask questions of her aides.
"The work of making the financial system more robust has not yet been completed," she said, but she mostly skirted questions about the details.
She faced some confrontational questions, particularly from Republicans concerned the Fed's stimulus campaign was doing more harm than good, by seeding inflation, starving savers of income and destabilizing financial markets.
Rep. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, played a video message from a 76-year-old veteran inviting Ms. Yellen to a town-hall meeting to discuss low interest rates.
By contrast, some Democrats questioned whether the Fed could do more to cut unemployment. "I hope you will press your colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee to take into account the ongoing impact that this long-term unemployment crisis is having on millions of American families," said Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democrat on the House committee.
But Ms. Yellen appeared to disarm the committee members by agreeing to stay as long as they liked. It took almost six hours to field questions from every interested member of the Financial Services Committee -- one of the largest House committees, in part because lawmakers clamor to be on it because they can raise money from the financial services industry.
Members thanked her for her time and several mentioned that their daughters said her very presence was an inspiration.
The harshest criticism came after Ms. Yellen left, when a panel of experts was called to comment on the Fed's performance.
The central bank's stimulus campaign has "driven up asset prices without adding significantly to job creation," said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation at the Cato Institute. He said low borrowing costs might be making it easier for companies to invest in technology rather than hiring workers.
The economy remains scarred by the collapse of the housing bubble and the consequent 2008 financial crisis. Growth is tepid, unemployment high, inflation sluggish. Ms. Yellen acknowledged those problems, but reiterated the Fed's upbeat forecast.
"The economic recovery gained greater traction in the second half of last year," she said, citing the growth of spending by consumers and businesses. She said the Fed expected "economic activity and unemployment will expand at a moderate pace this year and next."
Ms. Yellen acknowledged that she was "surprised" by disappointing estimates of job growth in December and January, but she cautioned against "jumping to conclusions" in assessing the longer-term trend. She noted the government would release an estimate of February job growth before the Fed's March meeting.
She played down concerns about the consequences of Fed policy. Asked about the impact of low interest rates on savers, particularly the elderly, she said that the Fed could not raise rates without damaging the economy, and noted that low rates had a variety of effects. Retirees with savings accounts, for example, often own stocks too, which have soared in recent years.
Like her predecessor, Ms. Yellen said the Fed's greatest concern was the risk of destabilizing financial markets. And like Mr. Bernanke, she said the Fed was watching closely but didn't see problems yet. "I haven't seen threats to financial stability that have built to the point of flashing orange or red," Ms. Yellen said.
The Fed said in 2012 that it planned to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent. It has since said that it was likely to maintain that policy well past that threshold, but with the unemployment rate reaching 6.6 percent in January, some Fed officials have said there is a need for greater clarity about its plans.
To provide that clarity, however, the Fed must first resolve an internal debate. Much of the decline in the unemployment rate was because people have stopped looking for work. The share of Americans with jobs has not increased since the recession.
Changing demographics, including the aging of the baby boom, is part of the explanation. Some Fed officials see it as the prime cause. "While I do expect some discouraged workers to re-enter the labor force as the economy improves, I still believe the overall unemployment rate remains a good summary statistic of labor market conditions," Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech Tuesday in Newark, Del.
"Continuing to buy assets is neither helpful nor essential," Mr Plosser said.
Other officials, however, predict that a significant number of Americans will return to the labor market as the economy improves, helping keep a lid on inflation.
Ms. Yellen, asked about the issue, appeared to place a greater emphasis on economic factors. She said demographics explained "a significant part of the decline."
But she continued, with typical caution, "There may also be, and I am inclined to believe myself based on the evidence, that there are also cyclical factors at work."

Full text:   FOR investors, this year is off to a mixed start. Stock market indexes maintained their gains from last year before dropping. Treasury bonds continued their losing streak in the weeks after the Federal Reserve announced that it was reducing its bond-buying program -- until the stock sell-off caused people to buy bonds. Interest in emerging markets has dropped.
On a positive note, politicians in Washington did nothing in January to cause jitters in the financial markets. But there are still 11 months to go, and another deadline to raise the debt ceiling.
A variety of legislative actions and policy changes have gone into effect, are in effect but are only being felt now, or could come along later this year. What impact they could have on the financial markets and investors' psyche is hard to predict. Putting aside the unpredictability of the troubled health care overhaul, here's a look at some of the main policy events that could affect returns.
FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY One consequence of the end of the Fed's bond-buying program, which it said it expected to decrease by $10 billion at each meeting, is that interest rates are expected to rise. If this happens, investors in existing Treasury bonds would face more losses.
What are the alternatives? The simple one is to invest in stocks, but many investors have a parallel fear -- heightened, no doubt, in the last few weeks -- that stocks are overvalued. Anh Tran, a managing director at Modern Wealth Advisors in Irvine, Calif., said she had told clients to consider high-dividend-paying stocks and variable-rate high-yield bonds as alternatives to Treasuries. These two assets offer income and a hedge against rising inflation that fixed-rate bonds do not.
"They aren't your Facebooks or tech companies," she said. "These are large-cap companies that have remained consistent, like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola."
For investors who prefer to hold bonds for income, there are products that can insulate them from rising rates and inflation. Steve Sachs, head of capital markets for ProShares, a provider of exchange-traded funds, said his firm had started two E.T.F.'s to hedge the risks for high-yield and investment-grade bonds.
Mr. Sachs said the E.T.F.'s were created to answer the question many investors have about Treasury bonds now: "What happens when the risk management tool you've been using to mitigate your risk becomes the source of your risk?"
There is a contrarian view of the Fed's actions.
The Fed is tapering "at a time when the government is shrinking its deficit," said Gary Ran, managing partner at Telemus Capital, a Focus Financial Partners firm. But that situation "doesn't mean rates are going to go higher."
Still, he said his firm had advised clients not to go too far one way or another. He said his firm was mindful that the economy could improve more quickly, which would cause the Fed to raise rates sooner than expected.
BANK REGULATION This is the year when a host of rules with names like Volcker, Dodd-Frank and Basel III are set to rein in how banks in the United States have been doing business. Their goal is to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial collapse.
"They've been stated, postponed, somewhat implemented, but the end result is heightened regulation of banks is breaking the traditional business model," said Greg Peterson, director of investment research at Ballentine Partners, an adviser to high-net-worth clients. "They can't make the loans they used to."
This is not great for businesses that need loans, but it is an opportunity for nontraditional lenders. Mr. Peterson said he had talked to clients about investing in funds that lend directly to smaller companies. They are not without risks.
"In some sense, the systemic risks in the economy have been pushed out of the banks and onto the investors," he said. "If one of these firms goes bankrupt, there's no recourse. The investors have lost their investment."
For this reason, he said investors needed to be vigilant in assessing managers and making sure their qualifications were not overstated.
MUNICIPAL BOND CONCERNS When a judge allowed Detroit to file for bankruptcy last year, it was hard on the city's workers and pensioners, not to mention its pride. But it also struck fear into the hearts of municipal bond holders, who were treated as unsecured creditors. Would this signal a way for struggling municipalities to not pay their debts?
For many municipal bond analysts, the bigger concern is Puerto Rico, whose bonds are more widely owned because of the tax advantages. The island's ability to pay on these bonds has been questioned for months, and last week two ratings agencies downgraded its rating to junk.
Jim Cahn, chief investment officer at the Wealth Enhancement Group, said that what he called the "Detroit effect" caused investors to be more discerning, but that he hadn't lost faith. Higher taxes will continue to make municipal bonds attractive, he said, because the interest they pay is not taxed federally.
BROKER RULES Standards governing brokers and advisers are a longstanding issue. The fiduciary standard requires advisers to adhere to a higher ethical standard when making investment decisions for clients. The suitability rule allows brokers to recommend investments they think are suitable, even if their firm created the product and will profit more from the client buying it over a similar product.
This year the Labor Department is expected to rule on whether a fiduciary standard needs to be in place for the management of 401(k) plans and other investment vehicles that come under its purview. The ruling is expected to make anyone who offers advice on these plans adhere to the fiduciary standard.
But Knut A. Rostad, regulatory and compliance officer at Rembert Pendleton Jackson Investment Advisors and president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, said how transformative the ruling would be would depend on how advice and education were defined. A firm calling its advice education might not be bound by the fiduciary standard.
"Many brokers work very hard underneath the headlights to provide a fiduciary level of service, even though they're not required to," Mr. Rostad said. "But there are many who don't do that. From a regulatory point of view there is no way for a broker to be a fiduciary for retirement assets but not everything else."
This is where any ruling from the Securities and Exchange Commission would have a broader impact.
Advisers like Mr. Rostad worry that an S.E.C. requirement for brokers to be fiduciaries could be so vague it would be worse than no requirement at all.
"Virtually overnight every single financial investment intermediary would call themselves a fiduciary, but they would be working under the same rules that they are now," he said.
This is where investors need to become more vigilant in the questions they ask about how their advisers or brokers are paid and whether they are given further incentives to sell products by their own firm or any other.
"I think investors should understand what rubric they're falling under," said Mr. Cahn, whose firm operates as both a registered investment adviser with a fiduciary responsibility and a registered representative of a broker-dealer. "What kind of responsibility does the person have? They need to ask that question."
SHALE GAS AND OIL An absence of policy is helping the returns for investors in this industry. The new technologies that allow horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in formerly untapped regions of the United States are contentious to some. But Ernest Moniz, the secretary of Energy, has called natural gas a bridge to alternative fuels, which has heartened investors who now see no change in policy for years.
Mr. Peterson said the investment opportunities were great, particularly in companies building refineries and pipelines to move oil and natural gas. "Oil production increased to such a high rate last year that it flooded the system and we couldn't move any more," he said.
YOUR TAX BILL While there is no big change set for federal tax policy in 2014, now is the time when people realize just how much their taxes went up last year. In many cases, they went up significantly. What many advisers are focused on is how these higher tax bills are going to cause people to react.
In addition to higher taxes on earnings, taxes on capital gains went up last year. Couple that with a banner year for stocks and there are two immediate problems. The first is that investors may be hesitant to sell a stock on which they will have to pay a large capital gains tax, even though the company behind that stock is no longer as strong.
But at least those investors have a choice. The second problem is that people who owned stocks in mutual funds, which are required by law to distribute capital gains, had no choice but to pay taxes on the gains.
Michael Cronkhite, a senior vice president at Stephens Wealth Management, said he could imagine investors looking to replace mutual funds that simply track an index with lower-cost exchange-traded funds that are not required to make the capital gains distributions.
"The caveat is if the mutual fund you're in has appreciated a lot, you'll trigger capital gains by selling it," he said. "It's more about control for the client."
And when it comes to policy decisions, that is one area where investors do not have as much control as they might like.

Full text:   ISTANBUL -- It was late afternoon in Istanbul. But seven time zones away, on Wall Street, the opening bell was ringing.
Seconds later, in a dingy alley of Istanbul's vast Grand Bazaar, several dozen men with cellphones pressed to their ears began gesturing and shouting loudly.
They were currency traders, who every day buy and sell tens of millions of dollars, euros and Turkish liras in a narrow space that is sheltered by a sagging blue-striped canopy and furnished with an old refrigerator and a few plastic stools.
The traders had been noisily plying their craft since early morning. But when they learned from the television screens inside the nearby gold shops that the Dow Jones industrial average had opened higher in New York, the trading turned even more tumultuous. The dealers locked in or unwound their bets on which direction the dollar would head in relation to the Turkish lira.
The frenzy was a demonstration of how the value of Turkey's money -- which has broad implications for the national economy -- is determined largely by events beyond the country's control. And lately the lira has been alarmingly weak.
The currency has lost as much as a third of its value against the dollar, since the Federal Reserve in Washington began making noises last May about cutting back on its stimulus program, prompting investors to move their money from risky emerging markets to the United States in anticipation of higher interest rates there. More recently, the steady exit of foreign money has been more of a stampede, with about half the lira's decline occurring since mid-December, as political turmoil engulfed the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and violence raged in neighboring Syria and Iraq.
Investors' jitters about Turkey might grow after weekend clashes between the riot police and demonstrators protesting a new law that would allow the government to block web pages without a court order.
The lira's plunge has endangered the Turkish economy, which is heavily dependent on dollar- and euro-pegged transactions and loans for the country's everyday business. The decline has raised fears of a fresh financial crisis on the edge of Europe. On Friday the ratings agency Standard & Poor's lowered Turkey's credit rating to "negative," down from "stable."
The currency trading in the Grand Bazaar represents but a sliver of Turkey's multibillion-dollar foreign exchange market, in which most trades are conducted anonymously on electronic exchanges. Here in the bazaar, the trading is done mainly on behalf of money-changing shops.
No cash changes hands in the impromptu exchange. The sums are transferred among the traders' clients later.
But lately this narrow alleyway has become a microcosm of Turkish macroeconomics. While traders and some financial analysts say that Turkey is not in an economic crisis -- not yet, anyway -- there is a rough sense of uncertainty about the financial future.
Osman Atac, a 52-year-old currency trader known as Billiard Osman for his prowess with a pool cue, conceded that this slump in the lira was different -- sharper and deeper -- than others he had seen in the quarter century since he switched from selling used cars to trading money in an alley.
"We earned in '94, we earned in 2001," said Mr. Atac, referring to past global currency upheavals, when the lira plummeted but traders profited by arbitraging the exchange rates. But the steady, inexorable decline this time has provided fewer sharp swings that would give the traders opportunities for arbitrage.
"In this turbulence," Mr. Atac said, "no one is making any money."
Mr. Atac, clutching the battered Nokia cellphone he uses to keep in touch with his customers, said he thought the lira would not get any weaker than the record of 2.39 to the dollar it hit on Jan. 27. That is a sentiment shared widely in Turkey.
So far, Mr. Atac has been right. The lira has recovered somewhat since the low point, strengthening Monday to about 2.21 to the dollar, a 23 percent decline since May.
But the consequences of a further decline would be serious. Turkish companies have borrowed $130 billion in foreign currencies, according to the International Monetary Fund. Such loans offered lower interest rates, but came with a higher risk that is now materializing. When the lira goes down, it becomes more expensive for a Turkish company to make its payments on a dollar loan. If the lira weakens further, hundreds of companies could go bust.
"The depreciation of the lira has already eaten into revenues and profits," said Sinan Ulgen, chairman of the Center for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, known by its Turkish initials EDAM, a research organization in Istanbul. "The next steps will be to force them toward a process of bankruptcy."
A steep rise in official interest rates, imposed by the Turkish central bank the week before last in an effort to halt the lira's decline, is likely to choke the easy credit that has fueled a boom in consumer spending.
"At the present time what we are looking at is not a meltdown but a sharp slowdown in growth," said Adam Slater, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in Oxford, England. But he added, "It's a moving target."
Turkey might seem to offer disturbing parallels to countries like Ireland or Spain at the beginning of the euro zone crisis four years ago. As in those countries, Turkish developers funneled foreign capital into construction projects, covering the dry hills surrounding Istanbul with endless tracts of high-rise apartments, office buildings and shopping centers connected by crowded freeways.
But many Turks insist there is no property bubble like the one that devastated Ireland and Spain.
Baris Dumankaya, vice chairman of a construction company that bears his family name, pointed out that half of Turkey's 81 million people are younger than 30, which he says should ensure steady demand for housing. Banks require high down payments, which means that prices would have a long way to fall before homeowners owed more than their properties were worth, Mr. Dumankaya said. Inflation, at more than 7 percent and rising, also makes declines in real estate prices less likely.
Nor does Turkey have the government debt and deficit problems that crippled the Greek economy and continue to threaten Italy's.
Mr. Dumankaya, whose family has been in the construction business for half a century, agreed that the flood of easy money attracted people into the industry who had little experience and might be overextended. Sales of apartments in newly constructed buildings have slowed slightly, he said, and banks have become choosier about lending.
The plunge of the lira has already exposed the Turkish economy's dependence on short-term foreign investment. Most foreign capital is invested in Turkish stocks and bonds rather than longer-term projects.
All it takes is a phone call or a few clicks of a mouse for short-term investors to move their money elsewhere, and that is what foreign investors have been doing, not only in pulling money out of Turkey but from countries like Russia, Argentina and South Africa, whose currencies have also fallen as a result.
Mehmet Kutman, chief executive of Global Investment Holdings, a private equity firm in Istanbul that invests in assets like port facilities for cruise and cargo ships, said he thought the lira could still fall 5 to 10 percent further.
"The good thing is that it will stop excess leverage," Mr. Kutman said, referring to the country's high level of private debt.
Whatever the outcome, Turkey is largely at the mercy of foreign investors and policies made in Washington. No one is more aware of that than the currency traders at the Grand Bazaar.
Mr. Atac, the trader, looked like an ordinary shopkeeper in his wool cap, long wool coat and fleece-lined snow boots to protect against the cold paving stones. But though his education stopped at high school, he is well versed in his chosen field. He could recite the calendar of upcoming U.S. economic data releases and talk at length on the likely direction of Fed policy as Janet L. Yellen takes over as chairman from Ben S. Bernanke.
"Yellen was Bernanke's strongest supporter and is going to stick with his plan," Mr. Atac said.
Yet, in an ominous sign, some of the traders in the bazaar had already burned up their capital and gone bankrupt as the lira plunged, Mr. Atac said.
Whether that proves to be a metaphor for the Turkish economy will be revealed in coming months.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- Sorry, George Clooney. Hollywood's biggest star, at least for the moment, is a Lego.
"The Lego Movie," initially questioned by some film veterans as little more than an offering for very young children, stunned this movie capital over the weekend by snapping together about $69.1 million in North American ticket sales. That astounding result was on par with Pixar's "Cars," which went on to take in more than $500 million worldwide in 2006, after adjusting for inflation.
"The Lego Movie" cost Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow $60 million to make, after accounting for tax rebates, a relatively low price for a 3-D animated film. (This animated picture's lack of complicated fur or hair -- it's an all-plastic affair -- helped keep costs down.)
Mr. Clooney's delayed film "The Monuments Men," a $70 million action drama from Sony and 20th Century Fox, was the weekend's second-biggest movie. It took in $22.7 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data. The only other new wide-release film, "Vampire Academy" (Weinstein Company), fizzled with $4.1 million in ticket sales.
It is too early to pass hit-or-miss judgment on "The Monuments Men," which is counting on older moviegoers -- the kind who eventually powered "Captain Phillips" to $106.6 million in domestic ticket sales -- to meander into theaters in the weeks ahead. "We expect the film to be around for a very long time," said Rory Bruer, Sony's president for worldwide distribution, calling the opening results "terrific."
Still, weak reviews for this period film by Mr. Clooney make that an uncertain expectation.
"The Lego Movie," which took in an additional $18 million in relatively limited overseas release, was powered by extremely positive reviews, a shortage of family options at multiplexes, a built-in fan base (from the play sets and related video games) and an expert marketing campaign by Warner's Sue Kroll and Blair Rich that allowed the movie to sneak up on ticket buyers.
"Rather than reacting to the naysayers who popped up along the way, we stayed under the radar in guerrilla mode," said Dan Lin, who produced "The Lego Movie" with Roy Lee. "Then, when the full marketing campaign finally did kick in, people were surprised at what they saw and wanted to be a part of it all the more."
In the end, what struck some skeptics as weird -- the movie mixes animated Legos with real plastic bricks, and the character movement is choppy -- turned into a strength. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who directed the movie and collaborated on its witty screenplay, based their vision partly on the crude stop-motion shorts that Lego fans post online.
"We made a decision early on that we weren't going to cheat by giving the characters bendy arms and legs," Mr. Lin said. "We wanted to make it look authentic, like your Lego play set was truly coming to life."
There was some fear last week that snowstorms in parts of the United States and the start of the Winter Olympics would keep families at home. But Hollywood snapped to attention on Thursday, when the online ticket seller Fandango reported that "The Lego Movie" was its second biggest animated preseller, behind only "Toy Story 3." Analysts started hoping that "The Lego Movie" might take in about $50 million.
But then Saturday results started rolling in, and Warner started popping the Champagne. Deadline.com, an entertainment news blog, wrote of the sky-high total for Saturday, "That is not a typo."
"The lesson is a simple one: It has to feel fresh," said Bruce Berman, chief executive of Village Roadshow. "This animated movie felt different from typical animated fare."

Abstract: [...]in a weak job market long-term unemployment tends to be self-perpetuating, because employers in effect discriminate against the jobless.

Full text:   Back in 1987 my Princeton colleague Alan Blinder published a very good book titled "Hard Heads, Soft Hearts." It was, as you might guess, a call for tough-minded but compassionate economic policy. Unfortunately, what we actually got -- especially, although not only, from Republicans -- was the opposite. And it's difficult to find a better example of the hardhearted, softheaded nature of today's G.O.P. than what happened last week, as Senate Republicans once again used the filibuster to block aid to the long-term unemployed.
What do we know about long-term unemployment in America?
First, it's still at near-record levels. Historically, the long-term unemployed -- those out of work for 27 weeks or more -- have usually been between 10 and 20 percent of total unemployment. Today the number is 35.8 percent. Yet extended unemployment benefits, which went into effect in 2008, have now been allowed to lapse. As a result, few of the long-term unemployed are receiving any kind of support.
Second, if you think the typical long-term unemployed American is one of Those People -- nonwhite, poorly educated, etc. -- you're wrong, according to research by the Urban Institute's Josh Mitchell. Half of the long-term unemployed are non-Hispanic whites. College graduates are less likely to lose their jobs than workers with less education, but once they do they are actually a bit more likely than others to join the ranks of the long-term unemployed. And workers over 45 are especially likely to spend a long time unemployed.
Third, in a weak job market long-term unemployment tends to be self-perpetuating, because employers in effect discriminate against the jobless. Many people have suspected that this was the case, and last year Rand Ghayad of Northeastern University provided a dramatic confirmation. He sent out thousands of fictitious résumés in response to job ads, and found that potential employers were drastically less likely to respond if the fictitious applicant had been out of work more than six months, even if he or she was better qualified than other applicants.
What all of this suggests is that the long-term unemployed are mainly victims of circumstances -- ordinary American workers who had the bad luck to lose their jobs (which can happen to anyone) at a time of extraordinary labor market weakness, with three times as many people seeking jobs as there are job openings. Once that happened, the very fact of their unemployment made it very hard to find a new job.
So how can politicians justify cutting off modest financial aid to their unlucky fellow citizens?
Some Republicans justified last week's filibuster with the tired old argument that we can't afford to increase the deficit. Actually, Democrats paired the benefits extension with measures to increase tax receipts. But in any case this is a bizarre objection at a time when federal deficits are not just falling, but clearly falling too fast, holding back economic recovery.
For the most part, however, Republicans justify refusal to help the unemployed by asserting that we have so much long-term unemployment because people aren't trying hard enough to find jobs, and that extended benefits are part of the reason for that lack of effort.
People who say things like this -- people like, for example, Senator Rand Paul -- probably imagine that they're being tough-minded and realistic. In fact, however, they're peddling a fantasy at odds with all the evidence. For example: if unemployment is high because people are unwilling to work, reducing the supply of labor, why aren't wages going up?
But evidence has a well-known liberal bias. The more their economic doctrine fails -- remember how the Fed's actions were supposed to produce runaway inflation? -- the more fiercely conservatives cling to that doctrine. More than five years after a financial crisis plunged the Western world into what looks increasingly like a quasi-permanent slump, making nonsense of free-market orthodoxy, it's hard to find a leading Republican who has changed his or her mind on, well, anything.
And this imperviousness to evidence goes along with a stunning lack of compassion.
If you follow debates over unemployment, it's striking how hard it is to find anyone on the Republican side even hinting at sympathy for the long-term jobless. Being unemployed is always presented as a choice, as something that only happens to losers who don't really want to work. Indeed, one often gets the sense that contempt for the unemployed comes first, that the supposed justifications for tough policies are after-the-fact rationalizations.
The result is that millions of Americans have in effect been written off -- rejected by potential employers, abandoned by politicians whose fuzzy-mindedness is matched only by the hardness of their hearts.

Abstract: There are still many such issues: how to deal with current account deficits, for example, or how to face the consequences of tighter monetary policy in the United States. Turkey has a well-diversified and fairly productive economy, but its central bank is facing speculative attacks on the currency as market confidence in Turkish policies has plummeted.

Full text:   In recent weeks, Argentina, Turkey, Ukraine and Thailand have endured plunging currencies, capital flight and political disruptions in varying combinations. While they have all been affected by global economic tides, these nations are facing crises because of problems in their national governance. And if we look elsewhere around the world, we find that governance has been re-emerging as a major factor behind success or failure in many emerging nations.
It's not that macroeconomic quandaries have gone away in all of those countries. There are still many such issues: how to deal with current account deficits, for example, or how to face the consequences of tighter monetary policy in the United States. But these concerns were foreseeable, and some countries have been meeting them, if imperfectly, while others are letting these problems push them over the precipice. In this context, good governance means directing political energies at strengthening the economy rather than trying to cement power and keep down the opposition.
This new world contrasts with two earlier waves of change. The first started in the 1990s, when a rising China bought and invested in raw materials at an unheard-of pace. That flow of purchasing power was so strong that it brought better times to other emerging nations, including many in South America and Africa, regardless of whether the individual countries had good governance in place.
The second major wave was the recent global recession, which damaged the commercial prospects of many nations. For instance, in the first quarter of 2009, the gross domestic product of Singapore fell at an annualized rate of 8.9 percent. That wasn't because Singapore had bad economic policy, but because exports were hit by a global downturn beyond the country's control.
The two waves have had such noticeable effects that we've become unaccustomed to evaluating political fundamentals in individual nations. But these waves, though not quite over, have slowed. Many of the advanced economies have returned to financial normalcy, albeit with stunted employment. And the Chinese growth juggernaut is slowing.
Let's consider the role of governance in four countries facing some of the most pressing crises:
ARGENTINA Not long ago, Keynesian economists were heralding Argentina's economic policy as an example of successful economic stimulus. But the government continued to inflate the currency excessively, legally suppressed accurate economic statistics to cover up this inflation and confiscated pensions to pay the government's bills. The results have been a currency crisis and a hemorrhaging of reserves.
TURKEY Its once-heralded political turnaround turned out to have serious flaws, including a government that imprisons many journalists and is arguably heavily influenced by secret internal cliques that are sometimes called "shadow states." Turkey has a well-diversified and fairly productive economy, but its central bank is facing speculative attacks on the currency as market confidence in Turkish policies has plummeted.
UKRAINE Having rejected a European trade deal, the country accepted Russia's guarantee of part of its budget, temporarily stemming a financial crisis. Now Ukraine is torn between building closer ties to Russia or to the European Union. There is political chaos and violence, possibly to be followed by a financial crisis after all.
THAILAND Like Turkey, Thailand was widely considered a middle-income country that had turned the corner on governance and sustained economic growth. Yet now there is regular violence in Bangkok, and significant political forces want to suspend democracy. Tourists and foreign investors are growing wary of the country, which probably faces an economic slowdown and possibly worse.
What is striking about these stories is how rooted they are in each country's daily internal struggles. Indonesia, India, South Africa, Brazil and Russia also appear vulnerable -- and, again, it's largely because of an inability to solve domestic problems. It's not primarily because they have been whipsawed by unstoppable global trends.
But by no means are all countries headed down such dangerous paths. Chile, Mexico and Malaysia are a few more positive examples. They have persistent problems, but the economic data in each case indicates a brighter future. Mexico, for instance, has had a marked economic slowdown, but it has pressed forward with liberalizing its energy sector and has begun some much-needed reforms to primary education. Drug-related violence is worsening in Michoacán, but subsiding in some northern cities. Democracy appears robust.
It's not yet clear how to characterize China, as far as governance goes. For all of its economic progress, there are still many signs of dysfunction in political institutions, like corruption among the party elite and an unwillingness to take on state-owned factories and energy companies to fight worsening air pollution. It's also not clear whether the Chinese are succeeding at rebalancing their economy toward consumption. Most important, we don't how robust its political system would be in a serious economic downturn. Yet China is important enough globally that if its economy imploded, many other nations would have crises, too, no matter what they did on their own.
So we're now at a point where many global macroeconomic factors have been muted. That means tougher tests, including political ones, for quite a few emerging-market nations. And maybe 20 years from now, we will no longer be calling this entire group of countries "emerging." It's not only that many will have emerged -- it's also that some may fall off the track of progress altogether.

Abstract: [...]making the health care sector more efficient not only frees up people, money and office space in places like Boston's hospital district, but it also cuts labor costs in other industries by cutting insurance premiums. An analysis last year by David Cutler, a Harvard economist who was President Obama's chief health care adviser during the 2008 presidential campaign, attributed 37 percent of the decline in health care spending from 2003 to 2012 to the recession and another 8 percent to specific changes in federal health care spending.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- LOST in all the debate last week about whether or not the Affordable Care Act will hurt the economy is the fact that health care is already imposing a drag on growth.
The health care sector has repeatedly helped to pull the economy from recession in recent decades, but this time around it is lagging behind the recovery.
Health care spending grew more slowly than the economy in 2011 and 2012 and will probably be found to have done so again in 2013. Meanwhile, health care employment also expanded more slowly than overall employment last year -- and the government estimates that in January employment actually shrank for only the second time since 1990.
The reasons for this slowdown are not well understood. The Great Recession is clearly part of the story. Experts also point to changes in technology and in the way care is delivered and paid for. It seems likely that the landmark 2010 legislation is playing at least a small part, but the magnitude of its impact is hotly disputed.
The consequences are easier to see, though: Lower health care spending isn't helping the economy to heal.
Spending less on health care is a longstanding goal of pretty much everyone who doesn't work in the health care industry. The United States spends much more on health care than do other countries, and it seems likely that some of the money could be put to better use elsewhere. Also, making the health care sector more efficient not only frees up people, money and office space in places like Boston's hospital district, but it also cuts labor costs in other industries by cutting insurance premiums.
But in the nation's current economic malaise, idled resources are not being put to better use. Workers, companies and the federal government are all paying down debt rather than spending and investing. Fewer homes are being bought; companies are building few factories. The government has been cutting back at a pace exceeded in modern times only during the military demobilizations after the Vietnam War and the Cold War.
In the past, the health care industry leaned against the wind during downturns. The industry added jobs in every month from January 1990 through December 2013, save for a month in the summer of 2003. In 2001, a recession year that saw total employment shrink 1.3 percent, health care jobs rose 3.5 percent.
But the expansion of health care employment has slowed sharply over the past five years. Last year industry payrolls grew just 1.4 percent -- almost a percentage point below the average annual increase in the decade before the 2007-9 recession.
Health care prices are also rising more slowly. The 1.4 percent increase in 2013 was the slowest pace of health care inflation in at least half a century, and it was a key contributor to the sluggish 1.1 percent annual pace of overall inflation.
This seems good. Inflation is widely reviled. But there is evidence that moderate inflation can help to stimulate economic activity. Rising prices spur people to borrow and spend more quickly. Rising prices also tend to raise nominal wages, making it easier for borrowers to pay fixed debts like mortgage loans.
And sluggish inflation can be self-perpetuating. Inflation is rising slowly because the economy is weak, and slow inflation is restraining faster growth.
Some economists see the slowdown in health care spending as a straightforward consequence of our broader economic problems: We're spending less on health care because we're spending less on everything. The implication is that the trend is temporary.
But that does not explain why health care spending has been recovering more slowly than spending on everything else. The most recent data, for 2012, show that health care spending grew 3.7 percent while the economy grew 4.6 percent.
An analysis last year by David Cutler, a Harvard economist who was President Obama's chief health care adviser during the 2008 presidential campaign, attributed 37 percent of the decline in health care spending from 2003 to 2012 to the recession and another 8 percent to specific changes in federal health care spending.
The rest, he said, is harder to explain -- but also more likely to endure. Expensive innovations like new drugs are arriving at a slower pace. A new focus on efficiency appears to be reducing costs. And changes that require patients to pay for a larger share of the care they receive may be inducing more second thoughts.
The White House argued in a November analysis that the Affordable Care Act "is contributing to the recent slow growth in health care prices and spending." And last week, the Congressional Budget Office agreed that specific cuts in spending on Medicare have "contributed to the overall slow rate of cost growth in health care since the law's enactment." Since that time, the budget office has reduced its estimate of Medicare spending in 2020 by 12 percent, or $109 billion.
The impact of these changes might have been less painful in good times. But Professor Cutler said it would have been ridiculous to argue for the preservation of the existing system, even temporarily, as a kind of economic stimulus program.
"If you take an industry that's countercyclical and you make it grow slower, then that's going to hurt you in a recession," he said. "That's absolutely true. But I'm not sure the right answer is to say, 'Let's take one sector that's clearly bloated and imposing a horrible tax on the economy and make that sector stay bloated.' "
Katherine Baicker, a professor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health, said it was a mistake to focus on the pain caused to workers in the health care industry rather than the benefits to everyone else.
The cost of health care, she noted, is broadly distributed. Everyone pays for the industry's prosperity, either directly or in the form of insurance premiums.
"Do you really want to pay for surgeons' salaries by having low-income people not be able to afford health insurance?" she said. "It's like the world's least efficient jobs program. No one is suggesting that spending money on health care is bad. It's just that for a given outcome, if you could get it with fewer resources, that would be better for everyone. You could get more health. You could get more other stuff."

Full text:   The United States tax code is fast approaching 75,000 pages, and it is growing every year in complexity and bulk. Yet as the tax code has become more byzantine, the budget for enforcing it has been shrinking.
In the name of saving money, Congress has cut funding for the agency whose job is to collect revenue and fill government coffers.
The numbers tell the story. In current dollars, the I.R.S. enforcement budget declined from $5.9 billion in 2010 to $5 billion in 2013, including the effects of the government fiscal sequestration. That's a 15 percent cut in inflation-adjusted spending.
Without adjusting for inflation, the numbers are these: The enforcement budget dropped from $5.5 billion in 2010 to $5 billion last year, while the overall I.R.S. budget declined from $12.15 billion to $11.2 billion.
The budget cuts have meant less staffing, with reductions in the ranks of auditors, collections officers and criminal investigators. Last year alone, staff positions in enforcement dropped 6.4 percent, to the lowest total in a decade: 19,531.
With declines like that, it should be no surprise that the number of audits has dropped and that revenue resulting from audits plummeted $7 billion, or roughly 40 percent, in the three years through 2013.
The I.R.S. isn't popular among taxpayers, of course, and members of Congress know that. But even if cutting funds for the I.R.S. brings in votes, it's not likely to reduce the budget deficit.

Full text:   Chronic problems have been flaring up in financial markets lately, and some of them may emanate from the United States. Yet none of these issues have seriously damaged the exalted status of what Washington Irving once called "the almighty dollar."
In fact, a familiar pattern has been emerging: When the world's financial system runs into trouble, the position of the dollar as the world's crucial currency becomes more formidable.
Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell economics professor and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has written a thoughtful new book that clarifies this counterintuitive phenomenon. Its title is "The Dollar Trap: How the U.S. Dollar Tightened Its Grip on Global Finance" (Princeton University Press).
In a conversation last week, Professor Prasad, formerly the head of the financial studies and China divisions of the International Monetary Fund, said: "There's a dollar paradox. You might think that after the global financial crisis -- after the world experienced so much financial turmoil because of U.S. policy actions -- that the dollar would be losing some of its importance. But the truth is the opposite of that. We're seeing this today as emerging markets run into trouble. It's just making the dollar stronger."
It's not that the dollar is universally viewed as an ideal linchpin for global finance, or that other countries believe that the United States should enjoy the "exorbitant privilege" of minting the world's money. That's what Valéry Giscard d'Estaing called it when he was French finance minister in the 1960s. Mr. d'Estaing and Charles de Gaulle, the French president, sought unsuccessfully to reduce the dollar's clout.
The United States, de Gaulle said, was using the dollar to expand American influence, making it cheaper for American companies to operate and for the American government to finance its activities. All of this, he said, amounted to hidden subsidies paid by the rest of the world.
Similar critiques have continued sporadically ever since. The euro, the Chinese renminbi and even a kind of synthetic currency, the Special Drawing Rights of the I.M.F., have been proposed as alternatives in some aspects of world finance. All of them have a role to play, and perhaps a larger one in the future. But as Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, has written, no viable challenger to the dollar's dominance has yet arisen.
Professor Prasad takes the argument further: What we have been seeing lately is that even after a global system centered on the dollar has undergone the greatest stress since the Great Depression, the dollar has become more central in world affairs, not less so. And this happened as America's fiscal deficit soared, and as the federal government repeatedly flirted with a default of its sovereign debt -- developments that might have reduced the dollar's international relevance. "The problem for the rest of the world," he told me, "is that for safety and for ease of transactions, in many cases, there's really been nowhere else to go."
Consider some of the issues that have grabbed headlines recently. For starters, turmoil has been erupting in a vast and diverse group of emerging-market nations. Countries like Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela have been struggling with shaky currencies, capital flight and plummeting stock markets. Local issues are at play, of course, and cause and effect is sometimes hard to pinpoint.
Nevertheless, when searching for the immediate reasons for their current predicament, it's hard to exclude the announcements and actions of the Federal Reserve in Washington. In fact, the Fed has been moving markets worldwide for a very long time. After years of flooding the planet with liquidity, it is now ratcheting down its monetary policy. Until it began reversing course late last year, it had been explicitly encouraging investors to put their money into riskier assets, and some of the funds ended up in emerging markets. Now, investors are paring down risk and many emerging-market nations are hurting.
In Argentina, while the stock market is up 5.3 percent so far this year in local currency terms, it's down 20.1 percent in dollars, reflecting the devaluation of the peso. After resisting for months and depleting its foreign exchange reserves, Argentina devalued its currency in order to combat capital flight and to account for some of the effects of rampant inflation. Undoubtedly, it brought some of its problems on itself. But the ebb and flow of global money, heavily influenced by the Fed, has exacerbated them. Investors have responded to global turmoil in a familiar way: by moving money from other currencies and asset classes to the United States dollar and to Treasury securities.
Interest rates in the United States have been driven extraordinarily low. Ten-year Treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction as prices, have declined to 2.68 percent, from 3.03 percent on Dec. 31. Rates had been expected to rise because of the Fed's tighter monetary policies. Flight to safety investing explains at least some of this, and it has helped keep rates relatively low for several years.
This "exorbitant privilege" has been a mixed blessing for the United States. It has, for example, hurt retirees who rely on fixed-income investments, which are generating very little money. And it's allowed the government to operate with relatively little fiscal discipline, because foreigners have been ready and able to finance the debt. Still, it has made it easy to fund the federal budget deficit and has helped corporations, small businesses and homeowners who have been able to get loans and mortgages at very low rates.
Richard Madigan, the chief investment officer of J.P. Morgan Private Bank, agrees that many of these developments have occurred because of a "global dollar trap."
"People have moved money into Treasuries and made interest rates on U.S. government debt much lower than they probably ought to be," he said. "It's counterintuitive, but even when finances are unsettled in the United States, it's still the center of the global financial system and it's where people go for safety."
It's where they go, even though in some ways the United States is a very odd place to seek financial security. On Friday, after all, the Treasury had to resume its now-familiar routine of taking "extraordinary measures" to avoid a sovereign debt default. Yet investors were generally not alarmed. That's because the Treasury was repeating a frequent pattern of recent years, as Republicans in Congress have refused to raise the statutory limit on the federal debt ceiling in an effort to obtain concessions from the White House. In previous episodes, the ceiling has been raised, debt payments have been made and the dollar has remained strong. Still, this "Perils of Pauline" routine seems an unusual way to ensure the stability of the currency at the global system's core.
Why it continues isn't simple, but Professor Prasad provides a very useful way of thinking about it. "What we're seeing isn't pretty, but it's the best system we have," he said. "And at the moment, until there's something better, the world just seems to be stuck with the dollar."

McDonald's Opens in Vietnam, Bringing Big Mac to Fans of Banh Mi

Abstract: A representative for McDonald's declined requests for a meeting or telephone interview with Mr. Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American business tycoon who moved to the United States as a child and returned with degrees from Harvard and Northwestern University to run the Vietnam office of IDG Ventures, a network of venture capital funds based in San Francisco.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDHANOI, Vietnam -- When Nguyen Hoang Anh and Nguyen Thi My Hao started dating, the 23-year-olds agreed to disagree about food: Mr. Anh adores Western-style fast food, but Ms. Hao mainly eats pho, a popular noodle soup, and other northern Vietnamese foods she has loved since childhood.
"He dragged me here," Ms. Hao, a secretary at a Hanoi university, said recently at a new Burger King restaurant here.
But though she does not eat fast food almost every day like her boyfriend, Ms. Hao said she was not entirely opposed to it once in a while.
"Sometimes I want to try something different," she said, before taking a bite of her Whopper hamburger.
Attitudes like hers -- and appetites like her boyfriend's -- have made Vietnam attractive for American fast-food brands, which view the country as one of Asia's last consumer markets with significant untapped potential, according to industry analysts.
The latest entrant is McDonald's, the fast-food giant, which has restaurants in more than 100 countries and will open its first Vietnam location on Saturday in downtown Ho Chi Minh City.
Vietnam has a surging middle class, and most of its 90 million citizens were born after the Vietnam War ended, in 1975. Many young Vietnamese are insatiably curious about foreign cuisine and culture, like kebabs and K-pop, and the McDonald's opening has been widely discussed on Vietnamese websites in recent weeks.
KFC opened in Vietnam in 1997, two years after the country normalized relations with the United States. But not until 2010 did American brands begin to enter Vietnam's market in earnest. They still trail Asian brands by a large margin. American-style Asian fast-food chains, like Lotteria from South Korea and Jollibee from the Philippines, have slowly introduced restaurants in a few major cities. Two Vietnamese coffee chains -- Highlands Coffee and Trung Nguyen -- have also made a splash in a market dominated by mom-and-pop cafes.
It was inevitable, consultants said, that more American brands would enter the country once the economics looked more appealing. Vietnam's per capita income rose to $1,550 in 2012 from $1,000 in 2008, according to World Bank estimates, and inflation has stabilized.
"It's got a big population, the government is making it easier to enter," said Ralf Matthaes, managing director for Vietnam and the Mekong region at TNS Global, a British market-research consulting firm, "and Vietnamese are now having that basic income level where there is not just sustainability but genuine opportunity for growth and profits."
McDonald's waited a long time to open in Vietnam, given its global brand recognition and likely appeal to young Vietnamese consumers. When it did, it tagged Henry Nguyen, the son-in-law of Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, as its local franchisee.
Bill Hayton, a former foreign correspondent in Vietnam and the author of "Vietnam: Rising Dragon," a 2010 book that explored links between money and power in the one-party state, said: "Laws and regulations are often rather vaguely written, giving officials plenty of opportunity to delay or assist an investor's plans, but Mr. Nguyen has been able to negotiate these difficulties with ease. Having the second-most-powerful man in the country as father-in-law is like having a golden ticket and get-out-jail-free card all rolled into one."
A representative for McDonald's declined requests for a meeting or telephone interview with Mr. Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American business tycoon who moved to the United States as a child and returned with degrees from Harvard and Northwestern University to run the Vietnam office of IDG Ventures, a network of venture capital funds based in San Francisco.
In a statement, Liam Jeory, a McDonald's vice president for corporate relations, wrote: "The contract with Henry Nguyen as developmental licensee is the result of a rigorous selection process that began years ago. Nguyen brings a strong passion for the brand that he developed while working as a part-time crew member for McDonald's as a young student in the United States."
Food industry experts say McDonald's and other American fast-food brands typically market themselves in Asia as a lifestyle choice for the middle class, rather than as an inexpensive option for the poor, and that their Vietnam strategy is no exception.
Meals at a Burger King on Lo Duc Street in Hanoi were selling the other day for 65,000 dong ($3) -- twice what Nguyen Thi Hang Nga charges for a bowl of pho in her restaurant across the street, where patrons sit on blue plastic stools.
"That food may be tasty, but it's expensive for normal Vietnamese," Ms. Nga said of the American company's offerings.
A 2012 report by the market forecaster Euromonitor International predicted that Vietnam's food service industry would grow to $670 million in 2015, from $383 million in 2010, according to Lucia Vancura of Promar Consulting, a firm in Tokyo that advises on food and agriculture. However, she said, the exact parameters of "fast food" were not clearly defined in the forecast.
Virginia Ferguson, a spokeswoman in Kentucky for Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, said KFC grew quickly after its 1997 opening because it was the first of its kind in Vietnam. KFC now has 134 Vietnam locations, and Pizza Hut, which opened a decade later, has 34.
Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts, which opened in Vietnam in 2012 and 2013, now have a combined 18 locations. The two brands plan together to open 60 to 80 locations each year in Southeast Asia.
The coffee giant Starbucks, which opened its first three stores in Vietnam last year, all in Ho Chi Minh City, said the company planned to open in Hanoi in 2014. "For us, the Vietnam market is a huge opportunity, and we're taking a long-term view on how we build our business there the right way," said John Culver, the company's president for China and Asia-Pacific.
Industry experts say that although Vietnam's fast-food market is far from saturated, multinationals trying to expand their operations face logistical challenges.
One is finding affordable and central sites in the smallish downtown areas of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, where competition is fierce and monthly rents in prime locations can reach as much as $19 a square foot, according to Richard Leech, executive director at the Vietnam office of CBRE, a real estate consulting firm based in Los Angeles. He said fast-food companies in Ho Chi Minh City typically sought to pay about $6 a square foot.
Another obstacle is establishing an efficient food distribution and refrigeration network that extends into second-tier cities.
Some international companies have found they need to adapt their food to local tastes. The South Korean bakery chain Paris Baguette offers multiple variations on the banh mi, a Vietnamese sandwich that typically includes sliced pork and sprigs of cilantro. KFC serves rice and seafood alongside its fried chicken, and both Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts brew beverages to appeal to the Vietnamese penchant for extra-sweet coffee.
Nguyen Hoang Anh, the 23-year-old who loves fast food, said before lunch on a recent weekday that he welcomed American brands to Vietnam, partly because he had never liked Vietnamese food very much. He said eating hamburgers and fried chicken reminded him of living in Australia, where he earned a degree three years ago in design and visual communications.
"It's not as complex -- it doesn't have many mixed flavors, like Vietnamese food," Mr. Anh said.
Nguyen Thi My Hao, his girlfriend, shook her head and said Mr. Anh's fast-food habit was a disappointment to his mother.
Correction: February 12, 2014, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the expansion of McDonald's into Vietnam misstated, in some editions, the location where fast-food companies typically seek to pay about $6 a square foot in rent. It is Ho Chi Minh City, not the United States.

Full text:   For the more than 10 million Americans who are out of work, finding a job is hard. For the 145 million or so who are employed, getting a raise is even harder.
The government said on Friday that employers added 113,000 jobs in January, the second straight month of anemic growth, despite some signs of strength in the broader economy. The unemployment rate inched down in January to 6.6 percent, the lowest level since October 2008, from 6.7 percent in December.
But the report also made plain what many Americans feel in their bones: Wages are stuck, and barely rose at all in 2013. They were up 1.9 percent last year, or a mere 0.4 percent after accounting for inflation. Not only was that increase even smaller than the one recorded in 2012, it was half the normal rate of wage gains in the two decades before the last recession.
The stagnation helps explain why many people feel apprehensive even though the economy grew at a robust pace in the second half of 2013, corporate profits rose, the stock market boomed and the housing market continued to gain ground. The issue cuts across the American work force. In fact, white-collar workers did a bit worse than blue-collar workers last year in terms of wage growth.
"People are running in place in terms of their living standards," said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "There's almost no growth in spending power." As recently as 2008, when the economy sank deeper into recession and Lehman Brothers collapsed, wages still managed to rise by 3.5 percent, before inflation. But the combination of a backlog of workers left behind in the recession's wake, as well as productivity gains resulting from new technologies, means salaries may not rebound anytime soon.
"We won't see stronger wage growth until unemployment gets below 6 percent and we begin adding 200,000 jobs a month," Mr. Harris predicted. Friday's data from the Labor Department shows an economy performing well below that level, however. The 113,000 jobs that were added in January fell far short of the 180,000 economists had anticipated, and came after a particularly weak December. Despite the decline in the jobless rate, some economists said on Friday that job creation had indeed slowed, in what might be called a winter wobble for the economy -- the cold weather equivalent of last year's summer swoon.
Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays, noted that over the course of November, December and January, the more reliable three-month pace of job creation stood at 154,000, roughly 75,000 positions fewer than employers added in September, October and November. Initially, the weak report for December was blamed on wintry conditions that inhibited hiring, but Mr. Maki said a second straight month of disappointing job gains led him to conclude that the cold and snow could not be blamed this time.
"I don't think we can say weather affected January payrolls," Mr. Maki said, noting that the construction sector, for example, bounced back in January after a weak showing in December. Nevertheless, Mr. Maki and most other economists said they did not believe the weak numbers for job creation in December and January would prompt the Federal Reserve to reverse course on its decision late last year to steadily reduce its stimulus efforts in 2014.
"This will get the Fed's attention, but it won't affect their trajectory," Mr. Maki said. Still, another poor showing for hiring when the next employment report comes out in early March might prompt a pause among Fed policy makers at their meeting later that month, especially if other indicators show a parallel cooling.
Wall Street shrugged off the unemployment report on Friday, as bullish investors sent stocks higher, with market indexes finishing higher for the week after three straight weeks of losses. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 165.55 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 15,794.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 23.59 points, or 1.3 percent, finishing at 1,797.02. The Nasdaq surged by 68.74 points, or 1.7 percent, to 4,125.86.
In bond trading, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32 to 100 18/32, while its yield dropped to 2.69 percent from 2.7 percent late Thursday.
One reason Wall Street may have looked on the bright side Friday is that the separate survey of households the Labor Department uses to calculate the unemployment rate told a different story from the payroll data survey. It showed a gain of more than 600,000 workers, helping bring down the unemployment rate.
In the payroll data survey for January, the public sector held back overall payrolls, as government employment shrank by 29,000 jobs in January. Excluding that loss, private employers added 142,000 positions, a slightly better showing. Several other sectors which had been strong in recent months -- education and health care, as well as retail -- also lost positions, contributing to the overall weakness.
The falloff in hiring in the health care sector was especially noteworthy. In December and January together, just 2,600 health care positions were filled. By contrast, as recently as November, nearly 25,000 health care workers were added to payrolls.
Although this area of the economy is undergoing a transformation as President Obama's new health care plan is slowly introduced, that is unlikely to have caused the abrupt slowdown in hiring, said Mr. Harris, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist. If anything, he said, the law should create new jobs in the sector as health care coverage is expanded, even if higher costs for some employers result in job cuts elsewhere in the economy.
As for retail, which lost nearly 13,000 jobs in January, Mr. Harris said that some of the reduction could have been because of excess hiring in December, when stores added nearly 63,000 positions as the holiday shopping season peaked. The cuts may also have been spurred by weak results at some retailers, with chains like J. C. Penney announcing major job cuts last month, and Loehmann's, the venerable discounter, now in liquidation.
The employment-population ratio, which has been falling as more workers drop out of the job market, edged up 0.2 percentage points, to 58.8 percent in January.
While salary gains have been muted across the work force, more educated workers continue to enjoy much better employment options than those with a high school degree or less. The unemployment rate for college graduates in January stood at just over 3 percent, compared to 6.5 percent for high school graduates and 9.6 percent for people who lack a high school diploma.
The problem for economic growth in general, and wage growth in particular, is that only one-third of the American work force -- 50.4 million out of 155 million -- have a college degree or more. By contrast, there are approximately 73 million workers who have a high school diploma or some college, and 11 million workers who did not finish high school.
With many less educated workers chasing a limited number of new jobs, employers have little reason to increase wages. "It's just an extremely competitive environment for workers, where people have little negotiating power," Mr. Harris said.

Abstract: The Turkish lira has fallen about 9 percent in the same period because Turkey's central bank has been too slow to raise interest rates despite an annual inflation rate of 7.4 percent.

Full text:   In recent years developing countries like Brazil complained that the United States and other industrialized countries were waging a "currency war" against them by artificially driving down the value of dollars, euros and yen. Now officials in some nations, like Argentina and Turkey, are blaming foreign "vultures" and "the interest rate lobby" for the sharp depreciation of their currencies.
Policy makers fear any big and sudden changes in the value of their currencies. A rapid appreciation makes their country's exports less competitive on the world market, while a fast depreciation raises the cost of imported commodities like oil and makes it harder for governments to repay loans they took out in dollars or euros.
So it should come as no surprise that officials are upset by the recent market movements. But their anger is misplaced. There is no foreign conspiracy against the Argentine peso, the Turkish lira or other currencies that have fallen against the dollar. The Federal Reserve's recent decisions to slow its bond-buying program have strengthened the dollar. But most of these currencies have declined primarily because of domestic problems.
For example, the Argentina peso has been under pressure for months because misguided government policies caused inflation to surge to 28 percent last year. The peso has fallen nearly 22 percent against the dollar since the end of November. The Turkish lira has fallen about 9 percent in the same period because Turkey's central bank has been too slow to raise interest rates despite an annual inflation rate of 7.4 percent. And investors have been unnerved by the autocratic style of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has tried to squash corruption investigations of senior officials.
What leaders of developing countries ought to be doing now is addressing economic problems like inflation and corruption while investing in infrastructure and education. Going forward, emerging markets could better protect themselves from the rapid flow of foreign capital into and out of their financial systems by regulating them. Unfortunately, many countries, including India and Turkey, made themselves more dependent on speculative foreign capital flows in recent years, according to the economists Dani Rodrik and Arvind Subramanian. That has made their economies more vulnerable to sudden changes in the sentiments of investors.
Blaming the Fed is particularly misguided. Its bond-buying program, which was always meant to be temporary, has lowered interest rates and offset some of the damage from the financial crisis, though not nearly enough. Had the Fed not intervened, the global economy would have suffered a much deeper and longer recession.

Abstract: (Holland Cotter) * Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

Museums
* Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Tony Feher' (through Feb. 16) Almost anything can be beautiful if it's presented in the right way. That's where the sculptor Tony Feher comes in. His palette consists almost entirely of cheap manufactured objects, including glass and plastic bottles; metal and plastic bottle tops; marbles, coins, nuts and bolts, metal rings, plastic bags, broken pieces of glass, rope, plastic cord, shredded paper, cans and cardboard boxes. He organizes these and other things into simple but surprisingly exciting, often funny configurations with intriguing philosophical implications. This beautiful show surveys a 25-year career. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt' (through December 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, this show is for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum's renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
* Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Frick Collection: 'Renaissance and Baroque Bronzes From the Hill Collection' (through June 15) This sensational, beautifully presented show of 33 late-15th- to early-18th-century bronzes reflects a taste for historically important, big-statement examples in exceptional condition. They vividly reflect the Renaissance's new interest in antiquity and the human form while encouraging concentration on emotional expression, refined details (great hair!), struggling or relaxed figures and varied patinas. Works by the reigning geniuses Giambologna, Susini and the lesser-known Piamontini dominate, further enlivened by a handful of old master and late-20th-century paintings from the Hill collection. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, 212-288-0700, frick.org. (Roberta Smith)
* Guggenheim Museum: 'Carrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Photography and Video' (through May 14) Color and class are still the great divides in American culture, and few artists have surveyed them as subtly and incisively as Carrie Mae Weems, whose traveling 30-year retrospective has arrived at the Guggenheim. From its early candid family photographs, through series of pictures that track the Africa in African-American, to work that probes, over decades, what it means to be black, female and in charge of your life, it's a ripe, questioning and beautiful show. All the more galling, then, that this museum has cut it down to nearly half its original size and split it between two floors of annex galleries, making an exhibition that should have filled the main-event rotunda into a secondary attraction. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The American West in Bronze, 1850-1925' (through April 13) This intriguing and spiritually troubling show presents 65 mostly pedestal-scale sculptures representing standard themes of the old American West: cowboys, Indians and wild animals. It includes famous practitioners of the genre like Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, as well as 26 others. Nearly all the sculptures are in a mode of three-dimensional illustrative realism and tend heavily to romantic idealization. There's the rub: The real history of the conquest of the West by white folks was much worse than what these artists imagined in their very popular works. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Antonio Canova: The Seven Last Works' (through April 27) At the end of his life Antonio Canova (1757-1822) produced this show's seven rectangular plaster reliefs for a Neo-Classical church he designed and financed for his hometown, Possagno, Italy. Unlike his best known sculptures, they are not remotely erotic or even particularly sensual, and they have nothing to do with the Greek mythology. Rather, they illustrate biblical stories: four from the Book of Genesis and three revolving around the birth of Jesus. They have their moments, but on the whole it doesn't look like Christianity was a good influence on Canova's creative imagination. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Charles Marville: Photographer of Paris' (through May 4) As an official city photographer working under Napoleon III and his controversial urban planner, Baron Haussmann, Charles Marville recorded some 425 views of narrow, picturesque streets that were to be replaced by Haussmann's grand boulevards. Familiar images from that series are among the 100 or so photographs in this show, and they will doubtless be the main draw for visitors eager for a glimpse of a bygone Paris. But the curators also explore Marville's background in illustration and what little we know of his biography. He comes across as a cleareyed cartographer who never quite let go of the illustrator's imperative to make a beautiful, cohesive picture. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Flowering of Edo Period Painting: Japanese Masterworks from the Feinberg Collection' (through Sept. 7) The Met's Japanese galleries have been pulling crowds with a recent series of theme-based exhibitions. It now takes on a different challenge: how to present a cogent narrative within the parameters of a private collection. Given the material, it would have been hard to go wrong. What a collection this is. And what histories, new and old, it holds. Gleaming gold landscape screens, painted fans, painted views into urban brothels: The show is a magnetic beauty. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China' (through April 6) This museum's first survey of recent Chinese art uses the lens of the culture's ancient brush and ink tradition so basic to its landscape painting and calligraphy. It doesn't always work. The show endures a scattered installation, includes overly refined displays of empty skill and wanders off message in spots, especially with several sculptures that don't seem to belong here. But a few moments of visual life and many interesting questions about the weight of the old on the new make it worthwhile. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Jewels By JAR' (through March 9) Crowd-pleasers needn't represent lowered curatorial standards in terms of subject and execution, but this one does. It packs 400 efforts by the New York-born, Paris-based high-society jeweler, Joel Arthur Rosenthal (JAR), into a very dark gallery with insufficient labeling or historical backup. Large pave brooches, usually of flowers, abound; too many pieces date from 2010 or later. There are certainly redeeming works, but the show cries out for editing, scholarly support and better viewing conditions. Artist and audience are left hanging, with the museum's mercenary agenda in full view. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Piero della Francesa: Personal Encounters' (through March 30) None of the four works in this deceptively low-impact show are among Piero della Francesca's most celebrated. But they are all the devotional paintings for private clients Piero is known to have made, and this show is the first to bring them all together. Two picture Saint Jerome in his wilderness retreat and two portray the Madonna and Child, one of which is thought to be Piero's earliest known painting and the other among his last. As marriages of old religious faith and new forms of empirical consciousness, they are marvelous thought provokers. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Silla: Korea's Golden Kingdom' (through Feb. 23) This intriguing show presents more than 130 objects from Silla, a kingdom that dominated the Korean peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries. The first two of three sections includes gold jewelry, formally austere pottery, glassware and other objects excavated from mound shaped, earth-covered tombs in the city of Gyeongju. The third section displays sculpture made after Buddhism was adopted as the state religion around 530. Among the most captivating is a beautiful three-foot-high, gilt bronze sculpture of a young Bodhisattva, which, like a number of other works in the show, has been designated a Korean National Treasure. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Venetian Glass by Carlo Scarpa: The Venini Company, 1932-1947' (through March 2) Before he turned to architecture, Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) designed glass vessels, achieving a lifetime's worth of beauty and innovation in a short, remarkable burst of creativity. His achievement is honored with this sublime exhibition of nearly 300 of his splendidly sculptural, radiantly colored, ingeniously patterned vessels. They have an inspiring wholeness: process, form and decoration become a single thing; art, craft and science merge. And content of the non-narrative, experiential kind abounds. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'William Kentridge: The Refusal of Time' (through May 11) Everything is on the move in this mini-theater-cum-power-plant of an installation. In wrap-around videos, metronomes pound. Clock-faces spin, spewing trails of stars. Drawings draw and erase themselves. Maps of Africa appear and disappear. White-coated figures mix potions amid giant watch springs. At the center of the gallery a wooden contraption pumps away like an energy source. A collaboration between Mr. Kentridge, who is based in South Africa, and Peter L. Galison, a science historian at Harvard, the piece refers to the European colonial experiment, which strove to shape other cultures to its own concepts of reality, only to find that those cultures had different, resistant, assertive realities of their own. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Visions and Nightmares: Four Centuries of Spanish Drawings' (through May 11) Skipping from 16th-century church commissions to Goya in just 25 objects, the Morgan's first show of Spanish drawings is necessarily awkward. But it delivers on the promise of its title, serving up heavenly apparitions and wicked phantasms aplenty. Highlights include a red chalk drawing of the satyr Marsyas by José de Ribera, an "Immaculate Conception" by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, several late Goya drawings, and a lavishly illustrated 1780 edition of "Don Quixote." 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
* Museum of Arts and Design: 'Out of Hand: Materializing the Postdigital' (through June 1) If you haven't quite wrapped your head around the concept of 3-D printing, or haven't yet had a digital scanner wrap itself around you, now you can do both in this survey of computer-assisted art, architecture and design. The show looks at art made since 2005 and fills nearly three floors, including many irresistible interactive projects. Its ideas may not be entirely new; the Museum of Modern Art's 2008 exhibition "Design and the Elastic Mind" covered much of the same territory, but there's something to be said for this more down-to-earth, production-focused exhibition. 2 Columbus Circle, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Designing Modern Women 1890-1990' (through Sept. 21) Shoehorned into half the museum's design department, this conversation-starting display of objects from MoMA's permanent collection features items designed by more than 60 women, many of whom worked with male partners. Some, like Marianne Brandt and Eileen Gray, are well known to design aficionados, but most will be unfamiliar to a general audience. Most objects were created for domestic consumption. The pièce de résistance is a kitchen designed by Charlotte Perriand for the apartments in Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation in Marseille, France. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New' (through April 21) Ileana Sonnabend, who died in 2007 at 92, was one of the most foresighted art dealers of the late 20th century. This modest-size exhibition, made up of work she either owned or showed in her gallery, gives a sense of the range of her interests, from Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Modern Art: Isa Genzken: 'Retrospective' (through March 10) This prolific German sculptor -- for whom New York and its skyscrapers are a major source of inspiration -- receives her first comprehensive museum survey in this country. A grand, glamorous and sometimes grating 40-year overview, it traces her progress from idiosyncratic Minimalist monoliths to the distinctive, often architectonic, assemblages she began making in 1997 from cheesy materials and objects, concocting a raw, unapologetic beauty and a weirdly elliptical if literal-minded social commentary, often about the United States, power and war. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through March 9) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: "American Photographs," by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprise of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Gilded New York' (continuing) This period-piece of a show revolves around the ritual of the fancy-dress ball: an occasion for lavish expenditures by both host and guests. The gallery, upholstered in eggplant-colored brocade and stuffed with silver and porcelain, could serve as a set for the latest Wharton adaptation or Julian Fellowes's much-anticipated American follow-up to "Downton Abbey." Two mannequins wearing evening dresses by Maison Worth of Paris have been posed conversationally before a fireplace surround of Italian marble; one of them is clad in the sparkling "Electric Light" dress, festooned with silver bullion, worn by Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II at the Vanderbilt Ball of 1883. In the catalog, and just outside the gallery, photographs show guests at other balls dressed (with no apparent irony) as kings, queens and courtiers from Versailles. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, 212-534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
* New-York Historical Society: 'The Armory Show at 100: Modern Art and Revolution' (through Feb. 23) The International Exhibition of Modern Art, otherwise known as the Armory Show, woke American art from its provincial slumbers a century ago. Was it a good thing or a bad thing, and is there any reason to care about it now? With more than 100 works from the original exhibition by American and European artists and a big, richly illuminating catalog, "The Armory Show at 100" offers an excellent opportunity to ponder such questions. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
New-York Historical Society: 'Beauty's Legacy: Gilded Age Portraits in America' (through March 9) Rich in context and character-driven, this show of society portraits from the Gilded Age offers plenty of information on the New York social set known as Mrs. Astor's 400. Highlights include Theobald Chartran's painting of James Hazen Hyde, the Equitable Insurance Company heir whose come-hither stare is conspicuously modeled on Bronzino's "Portrait of a Young Man," and watercolor-on-ivory miniatures from the collection of Peter Marié that show society women in costume from the latest ball. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Rosenberg)
Queens Museum of Art: Peter Schumann 'The Shatterer' (through March 30) A recent expansion has doubled the size of the Queens Museum. Of five celebratory new shows, the largest and most moving is the solo museum debut of Peter Schumann, the founder and director of Bread and Puppet Theater, which is 50 years old this year. The show demonstrates how thoroughly Bread and Puppet is his creation. Its down-value look and activist ethos are evident in everything, including the black house-paint mural he has brushed, single-handedly, across one of the museum's wall and the hand-printed, hand-bound books he has placed in the gallery he designates as chapel and library. Every inch of this room is covered with figures and words: angels and ogres, exhortations and condemnations, art for one and for all, straight from the hand, right to the moral core. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 718-592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Carrie Mae Weems: The Museum Series' (through June 29) A set of recent pictures by Carrie Mae Weems are on view here as a supplement to the Guggenheim Museum's "Carrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Photography and Video" exhibition. These images show the artist dwarfed by the facades of international art institutions -- the Louvre, the Tate Modern, and so on -- which, to quote the Studio Museum news release, "affirm or reject certain histories through their collecting or display decisions. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Shadows Took Shape' (through March 9) Space is definitely the place in this lively group exhibition devoted to Afrofuturism, a contemporary art trend that takes the ultra-free-jazz musician Sun Ra as its patron saint and locates itself in a universe where racial and ethnic identities float free from stereotypes without losing track of the histories that created them. William Villalongo sets African sculpture and modernist painting soaring together among the stars; the Kenyan artist Wanuri Kahiu films ecological cataclysm and renewal in ages to come; William Cordova, who lives in New York and Lima, Peru, recreates the Millennium Falcon from "Star Wars," now equipped with a cultural studies library. 144 West 125th Street, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Galleries: Chelsea
* Arahmaiani: 'Fertility of the Mind' (through Feb. 22) The first New York solo show for the Indonesian artist Arahmaiani Feisal, who uses only her first name, is a condensed, bare-bones retrospective. The artist was raised Muslim, though has taken the hybrid nature of Indonesian Islam, with its roots in Buddhism, Hinduism and animism, to mix images from across the religious spectrum. And her wide travels have made her a world citizen. From the start she has approached art as form of political activism used to shake up orthodoxies of faith, gender and class in a country that has experienced increasing political repression and bloody religious sectarianism. Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, 212-229-9100, trfineart.com. (Cotter)
* Saul Fletcher (through Feb. 15) This photographer's studio wall has long served him as both a backdrop and a canvas, a surface on which to draw or pose models or pin up Arte Povera-ish arrangements of leaves, fabric scraps and other found objects. In his latest photographs, small, scrappily poetic, mainly black-and-white prints, two smudgy markings on the wall serve as comfortingly familiar bookends for a series of living and dead subjects: wilted flowers, a Shaker-style chair, a plucked pigeon, friends and family members, and a pet dog. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street, 212-367-9663, antonkerngallery.com. (Rosenberg)
* Andrew Moore: 'Dirt Meridian' (through Feb. 22) This series of large color photographs documents the devastation -- by abandonment and drought -- of rural Nebraska. The images of hollow houses, crumbling barns, desolate trees and a graffiti-filled blackboard might qualify as ruin porn if they didn't bring such heart-rending news of an existence that was solitary in the best of times. "The Murray House, Sears Roebuck Rockfaced Wizard No. 52, Sheridan County, Nebraska," might almost be a painting by Salvador Dalí, had he been an American Regionalist. Yancey Richardson Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, 646-230-9610, yanceyrichardson.com. (Smith)
Jackie Nickerson: 'Terrain' (through Feb. 15) Jackie Nickerson works in a traditional social documentary format, and her photographs ripple with politics, particularly around the issues of food production, agribusiness and labor. She upsets one of documentary's central tenants, however, by photographing farm workers in southern and eastern Africa holding the materials and tools of their trades. Tobacco or banana leaves or plastic crates obscure their faces and bodies. Where earlier social documentary used people as its "universal" currency, "Terrain" puts plants and work implements in the foreground, creating what might be called post-human social documentary. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, 212-645-1701, jackshainman.com. (Martha Schwendener)
Davina Semo: 'Ruder Forms Survive' (through Feb. 15) A promising young artist overdoes it, spreading herself too thin with pat, generic results -- especially when remaking the modernist monochrome in industrial-strength materials like cement, heavy chains, stainless steel mesh and acid-stained one-way mirrors. The histrionic punk-noir titles also don't help. For a sense of her talent for creating tantalizing confusions of perception, material and emotion, turn to three small wall pieces made of brass: two metal-lined crevices redolent of armored female genitalia, archers' slits and their ambiguously protruding opposite, a shiny bronze flange that tapers upward and outward from the wall. Marlborough Chelsea, 545 West 25th Street, 212-463-8634, marlboroughchelsea.com. (Smith)
Richard Serra: 'New Sculpture' (through March 15) In this show, Richard Serra continues along the road that emerged from the hugely successful "Torqued Ellipses" of the 1990s, but also circles back to his earlier oeuvre. Here you have the Serra of the '60s and '70s, revised and updated: heavy rectilinear plates and cubes fabricated in steel rather than lead, his signature material in the '60s. 555 West 24th Street, 212-741-1111, gagosian.com. (Schwendener)
'Simplest Means' (through Feb. 22) This suggestive exhibition presents works by eight contemporary artists along with a selection of useful objects produced by Shakers mostly in the 19th century. The connection is a predilection for simplicity and transparency. Shaker pieces include an intricately constructed wooden chip fork and a finely woven straw bonnet. Among works by the artists are geometric compositions painted by Don Voisine; a dusky painting of a broom and dustpan by Joshua Marsh; and loops and slender lengths of wood carved by Seth Koen. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 625 West 27th Street, 212-989-0156, baileygallery.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Other
Guy Ben Ner (through March 8) "Soundtrack" (2013), the centerpiece of this show, takes a scene from Steven Spielberg's 2005 movie "War of the Worlds" as a "ready-made" soundtrack and pairs it with footage shot in Mr. Ben Ner's kitchen in Tel Aviv. Like Tom Cruise's character in that movie, Mr. Ben Ner's children from his first marriage play a pivotal role in "Soundtrack," billed alongside the cute baby from his second marriage. The artist's family situation would be none of our business except that we've literally watched his kids grow up in his oeuvre. In that sense, "Soundtrack" serves as an art analogue to "War of the Worlds" in which familial bliss is ruptured and plays itself out on embattled ground. Postmasters, 54 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, 212-727-3323, postmastersart.com. (Schwendener)
Julien Bismuth: 'An image as the _____ of a surface' (through Feb. 16) As the show's title suggests, Julien Bismuth is concerned not only with how images are made, but also with their relationship to surfaces. Pink mesh silk screens sit on the floor, leaning against the wall, sometimes stacked like an archive. Above them are images printed in dark gray ink directly onto the wall. Two videos focus on what we experience privately in the realm of images, and an audio work features an actress reading "statements of intention" by artists, pop stars and others. Ripped from context, intentions mean nothing. Here they serve as poetic reminders of the great synapse between art and experience. Simone Subal, 131 Bowery, at Grand Street, second floor, Lower East Side, 917-409-0612, simonesubal.com. (Schwendener)
* 'Devotion: Excavating Bob Mizer' (through Feb. 15) Bob Mizer is best known as a producer and publisher of beefcake photography for a gay market. This show makes a good case for him as an artist with interests and an imagination considerably more expansive than what his popular reputation suggests. The show's first picture is of a Siamese cat on a sofa. Further on are Arbus-like portraits of women and children; photographs of odd staged events like a magic show; and a picture of a cop writing a parking ticket for a group of teenage girls that could have been made into a painting by Norman Rockwell. A spirit of good-humored generosity prevails. 80WSE, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, 212-998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Johnson)
* Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (through March 31) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, 212-610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
* 'Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart: Collected by Julie Ault' (through Feb. 23) Julie Ault, an artist, writer and curator, was a founding member of the New York collaborative Group Material, which, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, used exhibitions and public events to investigate the overlap of art and politics. During decades of depression, inflation, multiculturalism, conservatism and AIDS, she and her colleagues lived improvised lives on the city's fringes. Within their world, art was currency for giving gifts, bartering, buying and selling among friends. This show, spread over two different locations, is a moving record of such transactions. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo; Artists Space: Books & Talks, 55 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, 212-226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)
* Moira Dryer Project (through Feb. 22) The first exhibition in 20 years of the obdurate yet romantic wood-panel paintings of Moira Dryer (1957-92) is a two-part affair that is especially relevant at a time when younger painters, many of them women, are exploring new ways of getting physical with their medium. Dryer pitted the literalness of her paintings against thin, sometimes streaky applications of paint for results that are witty and startling, assertive yet suffused with a delicate, even poetic atmosphere. A lively group show of paintings or painting-like works by six artists at the gallery's second space (at 195 Chrystie Street near Stanton) confirms the current relevance of Dryer's art. Eleven Rivington, two Lower East Side locations: 11 Rivington Street, 212-982-1930; 195 Chrystie Street, near Stanton Street, 212-477-2507, elevenrivington.com. (Smith)
* Ulrike Müller: 'Weather' (through Feb. 16) The latest paintings from this wide-ranging artist are small, compressed and built to last, being baked enamel on steel. Using two to five colors and a flexible geometric vocabulary that doesn't rule out the human body, they conjure shifting conditions of light, complementary shadows and even the coming of a full moon. The colors could be less muted, but that is just one of many possibilities opened in this impressive show. Callicoon Fine Arts, 124 Forsyth Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, 212-219-0326, callicoonfinearts.com. (Smith)
* 'An Opening of the Field: Jess, Robert Duncan, and Their Circle' (through March 29) If you were young, gifted and odd, San Francisco was a good place to be in the years after World War II, when big changes were brewing in American art and culture. And this show feels like a chunk of Bay Area turf has been lifted from back then and set down, untrimmed and buzzing, in the New York of now. At its center are two gay men, the poet Robert Duncan (1919-88) and the artist Jess Collins (who went by the single name Jess). Committed partners living in a wonderland of an old house filled to roof with art, they gathered a fascinating creative community around them, and a lot of it shows up here. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, 212-998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Cotter)
* 'The Silent Way: Robert Breer, Matthew Buckingham, Jenny Perlin' (through Feb. 23) In this succinct and beautiful three-work show, Matthew Buckingham pays facts-only homage to light, Jenny Perlin celebrates color in film and Robert Breer brings them together in "Form Phases IV," a 1954 three-minute classic of animated geometry that builds a passion for Malevich into something new. It's not to be missed. Simon Preston Gallery, 301 Broome Street, Lower East Side, 212-431-1105, simonprestongallery.com. (Smith)
Out of Town
* Carnegie Museum of Art: 2013 Carnegie International (through March 16) A welcome shock to the system of one of the art world's more entrenched rituals, this lean, seemingly modest, thought-out exhibition takes the big global survey of contemporary art off steroids. It is mostly devoid of the looming, often expensive installations called "festival art," while evincing a gratifying affinity for color, form, beauty and pleasure, and a discernible lack of interest in finger-wagging didacticism. Object-making of all kinds seems healthy, as do artist-initiated activist projects (which sometimes overlap). Interventionist and artist-as-curator efforts? Not as impressive. 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 412-622-3131, carnegieinternational.org. (Smith)
National Gallery of Art: 'Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium From Greek Collections' (through March 2) With about 170 objects, this show takes a processional sweep through Byzantine art from its Greco-Roman beginnings to its multicultural late phase in the 15th century, with a specific emphasis on its development in Greece itself. The history is fascinating, and the objects couldn't be more beautiful, including a glinting 13th-century icon of the Virgin and Child pieced together from glass, silver, gold and glass; a 17-foot-long parchment scroll painted with chirping birds and secret prayers; and a heavenly silk embroidery, found stashed away in a Thessaloniki church, depicting the body of the dead Christ surrounded by fan-wielding seraphs and a stitched chant, "Holy, holy, holy." On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, 202-737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Last Chance
Martina Bacigalupo: 'Gulu Real Art Studio' (closes on Saturday) In 2010 the Italian photojournalist Martina Bacigalupo spent time in the city of Gulu in northern Uganda, where she came across a curious form of portraiture. In a local shop called the Gulu Real Art Studio she found dozens of full-length pictures of sitters from which the heads had been neatly cut out. The shop's owner, Obal Denis, explained why. His machine for developing passport-size photos automatically produced four prints at a time, but most people coming for an ID picture needed only one. So it was easier, and cheaper, to shoot a regular full-length portrait, edit out a head shot and toss what was left. The pictures in this remarkable show are the result: studies in body language and clothing, accompanied by audio-taped interviews made with some of the sitters. The Walther Collection Project Space, 508-526 West 26th Street, suite 718, Chelsea, 212-352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
* 'Hooray for Hollywood!' (closes on Saturday) This big, sumptuous exhibition revisits the ecumenical gallery and vivid personality of Holly Solomon (1934-2002), offering a relatively wide-angle view of the 1970s and the '80s than is usual these days. Founded in 1975, Solomon's SoHo gallery exhibited staunch Post-Minimalists and Conceptualists (Gordon Matta-Clark, Peter Hutchinson) beside younger artists reacting against such stringency, especially those of the Pattern and Decoration persuasion (Robert Kushner, Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt, Ned Smyth). Both sides are well-represented, and portraits of Solomon commissioned from artists she knew or showed further enliven the proceedings. Mixed Greens, 212-331-8888, mixedgreens.com; Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 212-675-7490, pavelzoubok.com; both at 531 West 26th Street. (Smith)
* Janet Malcolm: 'The Emily Dickinson Series' (closes on Saturday) The writer Janet Malcolm has had a long, impressive and less often noted parallel career as an artist. In this show of subtle, meticulously judged recent collages, she combines facsimiles of Dickinson's letters to Otis P. Lord, a man with whom the poet appears to have shared a late-blooming love, with astronomical images, layering visual and verbal elements to suggest complex personal histories lost and found in the stars. Lori Bookstein, 138 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, 212-750-0949, loribooksteinfineart.com. (Cotter)
* Boris Mikhailov: 'Four Decades' (closes on Saturday) The photographer Boris Mikhailov, born in Ukraine in 1938, has become widely known in late career for his wry and wrenching pictures of post-Soviet life. This mini-survey explores some of the less confrontational but equally challenging work Mr. Mikhailov made before the collapse of the Soviet Union. It's dominated by the series "At Dusk," which finds Mr. Mikhailov playing street photographer in his hometown, Kharkov, from 1990 to 1993, during the early stages of Ukraine's post-Soviet transition. With Ukraine embroiled in political turmoil, these photos give us a deeply human perspective on its street culture. Dominique Lévy, 909 Madison Avenue, at 73rd Street, 212-772-2004, dominique-levy.com. (Rosenberg)
* Neue Galerie: 'Vasily Kandinsky: From Blaue Reiter to the Bauhaus, 1910-1925' (closes on Monday) The Neue's first show on Kandinsky centers on a rich 15-year period, also the purview of the Museum of Modern Art's recent "Inventing Abstraction, 1910-1925." During this time Kandinsky shifted from the prismatic Expressionism of Der Blaue Reiter into pure abstraction and from easel paintings into set designs and murals. A reconstruction of one of those mural projects is on view, as are abundantly decorative wall panels made for a private collector in New York. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, 212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
'Para-Real' (closes on Saturday) This philosophically catchy 14-artist show reflects a few forms in which reality, whatever that is, impinges. It includes a pile of scrub brushes by Robert Therrien; a self-portrait of Maurizio Cattelan as a real puppet; Hiroshi Sugimoto's photograph of stuffed golden eagles in a museum diorama; and Thomas Demand's "Ghost," a photograph of a colored paper and cardboard construction of a kitchen, wherein some culinary objects hover above the stove, as if tossed up by a poltergeist. 601Artspace, 601 West 26th Street, Chelsea, 212-243-2735, 601artspace.org. (Johnson)
* Larry Poons: 'New Paintings' (closes on Saturday) Larry Poons's preference for fields of pulsating color has sustained him for more than five decades. His latest versions present expanses of often separate, distinctly unmacho, nonvirtuoso small brush strokes whose crazed curling generate pointillized drifts, ripples and vortexes of pastel colors. Looking back while forging ahead, they add intimations of bacchanals, Claudian landscapes and Cézannian vistas to his pursuit of allover painting in the tradition of Jackson Pollock. Danese/Corey, 511 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, 212-223-2227, danesecorey.com. (Smith)
* Rubin Museum of Art: 'Allegory and Illusion: Early Portrait Photography From South Asia' (closes on Monday) "Allegory and Illusion" is a fascinating little piece of a very complicated puzzle. Ostensibly a focused, regional exhibition, it has much to say about the larger relationship between photography and colonialism. Included are many different forms of early photography, representing an array of markets and social classes: grand portraits of Nepalese royals and palm-size cartes de visite for the masses, ethnographic albums by British photographers and hand-painted photographs from Indian portrait studios. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Rosenberg)
* 'Selling the Dwelling: The Books That Built America's Houses, 1775-2000' (closes on Friday) More than 200 books, prints and objects trace the history of home building in America. Starting with 18th-century builder's guides, this exhibition chronicles the rise and fall of popular styles like Greek Revival, Gothic fantasy, Colonial Revival and Beaux-Arts. The 20th century brings prefab house-building kits and Levittown-style mass production. In the postmodern era you find plans for a traditional "dream house" designed by Gary Brewer of Robert A.M. Stern Architects that were published by Life magazine. This display is a richly rewarding intellectual journey. Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, Manhattan, 212-838-6690, grolierclub.org. (Johnson)
Richard Serra: 'New Sculpture' (closes on Saturday) In this show running at two branches of the Gagosian Gallery, Richard Serra continues along the road that emerged from the hugely successful "Torqued Ellipses" of the 1990s, but also circles back to his earlier oeuvre. The portion at the navelike space at 522 West 21st Street, closing this weekend, you have the new-old Serra: an 80-foot-long curvilinear sculpture fabricated in weatherproof steel called "Inside Out" (2013). For the one at 555 West 24th Street, closing in March, you have the Serra of the '60s and '70s, revised and updated: heavy rectilinear plates and cubes fabricated in steel rather than lead, his signature material in the '60s. 212-741-1717, gagosian.com. (Schwendener)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'T.J. Wilcox: In the Air' (closes on Sunday) A Romantic miniaturist best known for short, poetic films pieced together from found and made footage goes big in a dazzling 360-degree, 30-minute, day-to-night-to-day view of Lower Manhattan. Six brief collagelike films pop onto the panorama one at a time, zeroing on a specific event, person or experience, including Sept. 11. We see the city as a kaleidoscopic archive, alive with buildings, history, memories and people, and understand anew that the metropolis and the moving image were made for each other. 212-570-3600, whitney.org.

Correction: February 12, 2014, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An art entry in the Listings pages on Friday about an exhibition of photographs by Andrew Moore at the Yancey Richardson Gallery in Manhattan included an outdated address for the gallery, which moved in September. It is at 525 West 22nd Street, not 535 West 22nd Street.

Full text:   Dolores Riley has many questions and few answers. Along with every other employer in New Jersey, she woke up on New Year's Day to a new minimum wage -- $8.25 an hour, up from $7.25. Even before the increase, Ms. Riley, who owns Gramma's School House Childcare and Learning Center in Cinnaminson, had been operating on the razor's edge.
Since 2008, the number of children her company cares for has dropped to 40 from 75, reducing her annual revenue to $350,000 from $600,000 and forcing her to cut her own salary 75 percent. In business since 2000, Ms. Riley said she paid all of her 16 employees more than minimum wage -- her lowest-paid workers make $7.75, the highest $15 -- but she fears that increasing the minimum will force her to raise everybody's pay to maintain her structure.
The latest increase, she said, is likely to add $10,000 to $15,000 a year to payroll costs that already make up nearly 80 percent of her operating expenses. "This really scares me," she said. "I hope I don't have to close."
On Jan. 1, 13 states raised their minimum wage, and an additional 22 and the federal government are expected to consider increases this year as well. President Obama is backing a bill to raise the $7.25 federal minimum to $10.10 an hour, to be put into effect in three stages, with annual adjustments indexed to inflation. And in his State of the Union address, the president said he would raise the minimum paid to federal contractors by executive order.
There is widespread disagreement about the impact of the increases. Paul Ballew, chief economist at Dun & Bradstreet, says small businesses are a diverse universe, with some more sensitive to policy changes than others. That said, he added: "There remains a lot of economic pressure on small businesses. The downturn was so severe, and any time you have a policy change, you are going to get pushback. They've had a really rough go of it the past six years, and they've already squeezed out a lot of the fat."
Others point out that the proposed increases barely keep up with inflation. The current federal minimum of $7.25, when adjusted for inflation, is about 23 percent lower than it was in 1968. In addition, the increases do not reflect an evolving labor landscape in which the number of minimum-wage earners who work full time has increased substantially, prompting some to ask, Is there never a time when the minimum could be raised without objection? And if a business cannot afford to pay minimum wage, might it be doing something wrong?
Ms. Riley said her options were limited. She has already laid off nine employees in recent years. Having raised her rates two years ago, by $5 a week, she is reluctant to do so again -- especially since it would take an increase of $30 a week per child, to $255 from $225, to cover the increased wages. That, she said, would cause many of her clients to withdraw their children and rely instead on less expensive (and unregulated) babysitters.
Like Ms. Riley, Charlene Conway is watching her numbers. For 22 years, Ms. Conway and her husband have run Carousel Family Fun Centers in Fairhaven and Whitman, Mass. The business has annual revenue of less than $500,000 and depends exclusively on part-time minimum-wage earners, mostly teenagers, to handle tasks like running the snack bar and maintaining the games.
This year, Massachusetts is considering raising its minimum to $9 an hour, from $8. Should that happen, Ms. Conway said, she will probably need to reduce her staff of 20. Her employees currently make an average of $9 an hour, with managers earning from $10 to $15. Like Ms. Riley, Ms. Conway said that an increase in the minimum would force her to raise pay across the board.
And she, too, is reluctant to raise prices again. In 2011 and 2012, she increased her admission fees by a dollar -- they generally run from $5 to $10 now, based on age and time of day. Another increase, she said, would just make things worse: "We will price ourselves out of business."
In the past, when Massachusetts increased the state's minimum, Ms. Conway responded by increasing the minimum age of her workers to 16 from 14. "I'm not going to pay a 14-year-old $9 an hour with no experience, maturity or work ethic," she said. More recently, she has been hiring 18-year-olds with college experience. "What this does," she said, "is eliminate the opportunity for young people to get started in the work force."
Should minimum wage reach $10 an hour, Ms. Conway said she would reduce her staff to 10 employees and double up on work tasks. "This is a slippery slope that could absolutely cause me to shut down and force me into bankruptcy," she said.
But with income equality a political issue and with some studies challenging the notion that minimum-wage increases damage small businesses, there are also business owners who support the increases. These owners suggest that businesses actually benefit from paying higher wages because of reduced turnover and the additional money that goes into local economies.
Amanda Rothschild, co-owner of Charmington's, a cafe in Baltimore, calls the arguments against raising the minimum "shortsighted." Since opening in 2010, the cafe has paid new hires $8 an hour, more than the current $7.25 minimum (they also earn tips).
"I think those against increases underestimate how business success is tied to employee satisfaction," said Ms. Rothschild, who employs 11 people full time and three part time. She said her employees were part of the reason her cafe's revenue increased to $600,876 last year, up 31 percent from $457,940 in 2012. She expects another increase this year.
Paying higher hourly wages was part of Charmington's business plan from the start. "We felt that we would end up with more dedicated employees, who would be happier, and we found that to be true," Ms. Rothschild said, adding that she had a 22 percent employee turnover rate, compared with a restaurant industry average of 50 to 75 percent. A stable staff, she said, helps productivity, saves her money on training and food waste, and leads to better customer service.
With Maryland looking to raise the state's minimum to $8.25, Ms. Rothschild said she was considering several plans, including raising all base pay to $8.25 in preparation. She says she believes that it is possible to increase wages and still keep her payroll within 35 percent of operating costs without cutting hours, jobs or benefits. "I believe part of our costs in running a business includes investing in employees," she said.
There are examples of small businesses that have made paying higher wages a cornerstone of their operations -- and then grew much larger. Costco, for example, pays its hourly employees an average of $20.89 an hour (Walmart's hourly workers make an average of $12.81). When In-N-Out Burger, the California-based chain, opened in 1948 (the same year as McDonald's), the minimum wage was 65 cents an hour but its founder, Harry Snyder, paid $1 an hour (plus one burger per shift).
Today, In-N-Out Burger pays a starting wage of $10.50 (McDonald's pays on average $7.73 an hour by one estimate). It has close to 300 stores in five states (McDonald's has more than 34,000 globally), and according to Technomic Inc., a research firm that centers on the food industry, it ranks second only to McDonald's in revenue per location for fast-food chains.

Abstract: Stephen Schwartz, chief economist for Asia at BBVA Research in Hong Kong, said the drop in Indonesia's year-on-year and quarterly growth rates had not been as severe as expected and could be viewed positively, given signs in 2013 that the economy was overheating because of rapid credit growth and record foreign investment.

Full text:   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's economy grew last year at an annual rate of less than 6 percent, the country's Central Statistics Agency reported on Wednesday, the first time that has happened since 2009.
A poor fourth quarter exposed an economy hampered by an ailing currency, higher interest rates, a current-account deficit and other problems that analysts said could linger well into this year.
Indonesia posted gross domestic product growth of 5.78 percent in 2013, the statistics agency said, compared with annual growth of more than 6 percent in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The country's G.D.P. grew 4.6 percent in 2009.
For the fourth quarter of 2013, the economy shrank 1.42 percent from the previous quarter, although the agency noted it grew 5.72 percent compared with the same period in 2012.
Didik Rachbini, director of the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance and a member of the National Economics Committee, which advises the Indonesian president, said multiple factors were influencing G.D.P. growth.
"First, the tensions on the rupiah because the central bank forced the interest rate up too much, which has influenced the private sector to postpone investment," he said. "And also, there is the decline in the importation of raw materials and machinery. This decline will not happen only this quarter, but maybe the next two or three quarters will be slower."
The Indonesian central bank raised its benchmark rate five times -- a total of 1.75 percentage points -- in 2013 to try to contain a current account deficit that hit $10 billion in the second quarter of 2013.
Most recently, in November, Bank Indonesia unexpectedly increased that rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 7.5 percent.
The rupiah has fallen 21 percent in the last 12 months, according to data from Bloomberg.
Stephen Schwartz, chief economist for Asia at BBVA Research in Hong Kong, said the drop in Indonesia's year-on-year and quarterly growth rates had not been as severe as expected and could be viewed positively, given signs in 2013 that the economy was overheating because of rapid credit growth and record foreign investment.
"The good news is the Indonesian rupiah has stabilized in the last couple of months, and it's encouraging with the latest volatility we've seen in emerging markets -- Indonesia seems to be on the sideline," he said.
"It suggests that at least for now, the markets are giving Indonesia credit for policies, for addressing issues such as the current-account deficit, which is narrowing, and FX reserves are increasing," he said, referring to foreign exchange reserves.
Indonesia, which has long aspired to become a member of the BRICS group of major emerging economies, is now part of the so-called Fragile Five -- the others being Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey -- which are experiencing turmoil and have become too dependent on foreign investment to finance their growth ambitions, according to analysts.
On Tuesday, Finance Minister Chatib Basri of Indonesia called for improved corporate governance to attract more foreign investors.
"During the era of easy money, foreign investors usually place their portfolio without a full assessment of the country," Mr. Chatib was quoted as saying in an event hosted by the Financial Services Authority in Jakarta. "As that era ends, investors will take more time with their decisions and start looking to corporate governance as one of the indicators."
India, another member of the Fragile Five, has gone from having annual G.D.P. growth rates like China's, more than 9 percent from 2005 to 2007, to projected growth of less than 5 percent in 2013. This has raised questions about whether its economic slowdown is a result of structural problems.
"We find that over half of the slowdown is due to cyclical factors and the remainder is structural, and it's a good thing, because many people think the slowdown is due to structural factors," said Mr. Schwartz of BBVA Research. Among these, he said, are corruption, inflation, inadequate infrastructure and the government's sluggish pace in opening sectors to greater foreign investment.
"The government is initiating reforms, it's fair to say," he said. "It looks promising, but it's uncertain, because there's an election coming up this year."
Japan, which is Asia's second-largest economy after China and the third-biggest globally after the United States and China, also faces a critical year with its Abenomics policy under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mr. Schwartz said.
"Monetary policy has helped exports, the fiscal packages have helped stimulate growth, but the hard part is their structural reform agenda," he said. "It's critical for them to do these supply-side reforms. A lot of people think this is a very critical year, and that Abenomics could fail if reforms aren't made."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: The Fed's retreat also appears to be contributing to volatility in emerging markets, which in turn is weighing on domestic stock markets.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- For the last eight years, on most weekdays and many weekends, Ben S. Bernanke was driven to work as chairman of the Federal Reserve. On Monday, he drove himself to a new job as an economic studies fellow at the Brookings Institution, a research group about a mile north of his old office.
Mr. Bernanke will work on a book about his time at the Fed, and Brookings said he would contribute to an initiative on government economic policy.
"We're looking forward to helping Mr. Bernanke with the book he plans to write, and to getting his advice as we work to improve public understanding of fiscal and monetary policy and improve the quality and effectiveness of those policies," said David Wessel, director of the institution's new Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy.
Shortly after Mr. Bernanke's 8 a.m. arrival at his new job, Janet L. Yellen was sworn into office as chairwoman of the Fed in a quiet ceremony in the central bank's boardroom. She was acting chairwoman during the weekend interregnum.
Mr. Bernanke's installation as Fed chairman in 2006 was a public event. President George W. Bush spoke -- the occasion was only the third time a president had visited the Fed. The audience included congressional leaders and former Fed chairmen.
Ms. Yellen's installation was not even televised. The Fed released a picture of the administration of the oath by Daniel K. Tarullo, the longest-serving member of the Fed's board of governors. Ms. Yellen did not issue a public statement.
She is expected to make her first public appearance next week, when she delivers the Fed's twice-a-year report on monetary policy to House and Senate committees.
The Fed under Mr. Bernanke started a slow retreat from its efforts to stimulate the economy. Under Ms. Yellen, it must determine the pace at which that retreat will continue.
Fed officials are optimistic about economic growth in 2014, but early economic reports have been disappointing. Manufacturing activity was weaker than expected in January, the Institute for Supply Management said on Monday.
The Fed's retreat also appears to be contributing to volatility in emerging markets, which in turn is weighing on domestic stock markets. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down almost 5 percent this year after falling 41 points to close at 1,741.89 on Monday.
"Against this nervous global backdrop all eyes will be on this Friday's January employment report," Julia Coronado, chief North America economist at BNP Paribas, wrote in a note to clients. "The report will likely set the tone, either easing concerns or deepening worries."
Fed officials also are debating how much of the damage from the recession can still be repaired. The share of adults with jobs shrank sharply during the recession, and has not recovered. The Fed, to avoid pushing too long or too hard, must decide how many of those who lost jobs are no longer willing or able to work.
Officials also are watching inflation. The usual concern among central bankers is that prices will rise too quickly, but now the greater concern is that prices are not rising fast enough. The sluggish pace of inflation may be impeding necessary economic adjustments, for example, by making it harder to repay debts. It is confounding the Fed's official forecasts and standard economic models.
Ms. Yellen, formerly the Fed's vice chairwoman, also inherits from Mr. Bernanke a long list of incomplete changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act to strengthen financial regulations.
Mr. Bernanke's decision to join Brookings was not a surprise. He had said he planned to stay in Washington, and he made his final public appearance as Fed chairman last month at the opening event for the Hutchins Center, which is financed by $10 million from the family foundation of Glenn Hutchins, a private equity investor and vice chairman of the Brookings board of trustees.
Mr. Bernanke's predecessors as Fed chairman, including Alan Greenspan and Paul A. Volcker, mostly came from the business world and returned to it. But Mr. Bernanke has never worked in that world. He was a professor of economics at Princeton University before he joined the Fed's board of governors in 2002.
At Brookings, Mr. Bernanke will be reunited with his friend Donald Kohn, who was the Fed's vice chairman during Mr. Bernanke's first four-year term.
"Brookings scholars have a well-established reputation for contributing innovative ideas and trenchant analysis to economic and other public policy debates," Mr. Bernanke said in a statement released by Brookings. "I welcome the opportunity to engage in that vibrant community through research and writing."

Full text:   In a year when three dozen governors are up for election, unexpectedly robust revenues from taxes and other sources are filling most state coffers, creating surpluses not seen in years and prompting statehouse battles over what to do with the money.
After so many years of sluggish revenues, layoffs and draconian service cuts, governors and legislators are eager to use the newfound money to cut taxes, restore spending or, in some cases, pay down debts or replenish rainy-day funds for future recessions. But though revenues are improving, lawmakers are likely to find that there is not enough to pay for everything they want to do, experts say.
"The states are going to have what seems like extra money," said Scott D. Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. "Expectations will be high, but the money is not going to be enough to satisfy everyone's expectations."
While Republicans are tending to advocate more tax cuts and Democrats are more often pushing to restore spending on education and other programs, the differences between the two camps are not always so stark, with some governors outlining plans that appeal across party lines.
Joining Republican anti-tax stalwarts like Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Scott Walker of Wisconsin in calling for more tax cuts, for instance, is a Democrat, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.
And while Democratic governors like Jay Nixon of Missouri and John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado are pushing for significantly more education spending, so are Republican governors in Kansas, Georgia and Idaho, among others.
In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback, among the most conservative, is calling for full-day kindergarten for all students. In her State of the State address, Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico, a Republican, talked about increasing teacher salaries.
"Next to their parents, the adults children see most in their life are their teachers," Governor Martinez said. "We should support our teachers with additional pay."
Still, Ms. Martinez's view was not shared by her fellow Republicans in Missouri, where Republican legislators sharply criticized Governor Nixon's proposal to increase education spending by $493 million. "It is really unfortunate that this governor's only solution is to throw money at problems," said Tim Jones, the speaker of the Missouri House.
In some states where one party controls both the governor's seat and the legislature, intraparty battles are looming over how to use the surpluses.
One example is in California, where Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, called in his State of the State address for more money to go into a rainy-day fund rather than into renewed spending -- over the loud objections of some Democratic legislators who want to restore more of what had been trimmed in recent years.
"For a decade, budget instability was the order of the day," Mr. Brown said. "A lethal combination of national recessions, improvident tax cuts and too much spending created a financial sinkhole that defied every effort to climb out."
Darrell Steinberg, the Senate president pro tem and a fellow Democrat, shot back, saying that while putting some money into the rainy-day fund was laudable, the governor's plan shortchanged crucial needs. "We must invest in the people of California, especially those living in the economic margins," he said. "I've proposed and remain committed to a balanced framework of 'a third, a third, a third,' where we divide the surplus into reserves, repayment and reinvestment."
Jostling among Republicans over how to spend the surpluses is also underway in Michigan, where Gov. Rick Snyder, a conservative Republican, announced a $791 million budget surplus and called for additional spending on education and infrastructure, as well as tax cuts. In response, the Republican-dominated Senate Finance Committee approved a bill that put specific numbers on the governor's proposal, cutting the state's income tax from 4.25 percent to 3.9 percent by 2017.
States are seeing these surpluses because early projections by their budget officers are proving to have been too conservative. An overall strong year for the stock market and a general economic uptick are generating more income, property and sales tax revenues than expected. At the same time, a milestone is about to be reached: In the coming months, budget officials expect that state revenues will climb back to their pre-recession level, even accounting for inflation.
The result: Optimism about digging out of the recession is occurring at the same moment surpluses are landing. But many experts in state finances say governors and legislatures may be too eager to spend the new money rather than paying down debt, bolstering shaky pension systems or setting aside money for the next downturn.
States got a taste of improved revenues last year, when estimates of how many investors would sell holdings by the end of 2012 to avoid new tax regulations proved too low -- leading to a sharp rise in state revenues, 5.7 percent nationwide.
Fearing that this had been an isolated bump, most states again were very conservative in their revenue estimates for the current fiscal year. Now that actual revenues are being collected, the projections are turning out to be low.
"It seems that the bump was not just a one-time bump," said Eileen Norcross, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia, who specializes in state and local finances. "The rate of growth in 2014 for revenues was slower than in 2013, but still significant."
With memories of recent deficit struggles still fresh in their minds, many governors are joining Mr. Brown in talking about putting at least some money into rainy-day funds, including governors in Michigan, Colorado and Hawaii, among others.
And while several governors, including Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, have called for more attention to state pension debt, few have yet to offer specifics. One exception was Gov. Sean Parnell of Alaska, a Republican, who wants to transfer $3 billion from state reserves for the state's pension system.
There has also been ample talk in legislatures this month about infrastructure, much of it fairly vague but some aimed at specific projects. This is a sizable switch from recent years, when borrowing for large capital projects like bridges and highways had all but vanished amid budget shortfalls.
"With huge pressure to deal with some of these infrastructure issues, I think you will see that getting more attention in the coming months," said Mr. Pattison of the budget officers association.
Still, state officials and analysts caution that trying to gauge the outcome of a legislative session by a governor's opening address can be foolhardy. Political give-and-take, as usual, will shape the outcomes.
"I actually think most states, if they look pretty honestly at it, would have a hard time making a case for big new tax cuts or big new expenditures," said Nicholas Johnson, vice president for state fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
"Managing ongoing services and undoing some of the worst things done during the recession will account for all or more than all of the revenue growth out there," he said. "We are going up, but we are not free and clear yet."

Full text:   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. -- IN his nearly 19 years as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan was notorious for speaking in an elliptical, oracular, even mystifying style. Mindful that a single errant syllable might cause markets to soar -- or tumble -- Mr. Greenspan mastered a language, "Fed-speak," so turgid that it made economics textbooks seem like children's literature by comparison.
"Since I've become a central banker, I've learned to mumble with great incoherence," Mr. Greenspan once boasted. "If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said."
Mr. Greenspan deliberately cultivated a reputation as an inscrutable "maestro," who used his mastery of reams of financial and economic data to pull the levers of monetary policy, keeping inflation in check but without stifling economic growth. Like the Wizard of Oz, he acted from behind a thick curtain.
Those days are long gone. Partly but not only because of the global financial crisis -- which caused the Fed to take unprecedented steps to stabilize the financial system, prevent big banks from going bust and keep interest rates low to stimulate the economy -- the Fed communicates more than ever before. Once strong and silent, the central bank is now positively gushy. The change is not one of style, but of substance: For the Fed to be effective, it needs the public (and the markets) to listen clearly to what it says, and to act accordingly.
Janet L. Yellen, who took over on Feb. 1 as the of the Fed (and the first woman to hold the job), has been both an observer and an engineer of this crucial shift. Last April, when she was still the Fed's No. 2 official, six months before President Obama nominated her to succeed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, she gave an important speech to business editors and writers about the significance of communication as a policy tool.
Ms. Yellen, who led a Fed subcommittee on communication while serving under Mr. Bernanke, said that what happens to the federal funds rate (the Fed's core instrument of monetary policy) today, or in the next few weeks, is "relatively unimportant." Instead, what matters is the public's expectation of how the Fed will use that rate to shape economic conditions over the next few years.
That's because, she said, "significant spending decisions -- expanding a business, buying a house or choosing how much to spend on consumer goods over the year -- depend on expectations of income, employment and other economic conditions over the longer term, as well as longer-term interest rates."
The changes Ms. Yellen described have been a long time coming but have accelerated in recent years. It wasn't until 1994, about halfway through Mr. Greenspan's tenure, that the Fed's policy committee started to announce, after each meeting, any actions it had taken. Even more significantly, in 2003, as the economy still struggled to recover from the 2001 recession, the committee said its low interest rate policy would be "maintained for a considerable period." This was a big moment: "For the first time," Ms. Yellen said, "the committee was using communication -- mere words -- as its primary monetary policy tool."
In 2011, Mr. Bernanke, a staunch proponent of transparency as a tenet of monetary policy, gave the first scheduled news conference by a chairman in Fed history. His comments to reporters went beyond mere openness; he expressed remarkable candor and established, albeit tentatively, the basis for a regular rapport with the public.
At the end of 2012, the Fed announced that it would keep short-term interest rates low so long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent -- the first time the central bank had ever declared so precise an economic objective. (The Fed has a dual mandate, to maximize employment while at the same time keeping inflation below 2 percent.)
For the last decade I've studied the behavior of policy makers at the Fed, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Germany, New Zealand and Sweden. Their leaders have for decades searched for a new conceptual anchor for monetary affairs -- no longer gold or fixed exchange rates, but an evolving relationship with the public. Communication has become a fulcrum of policy. Policy makers shape expectations and, thus, economic behavior.
By the late 1990s a vast majority of the central banks had begun to incorporate elements of inflation targeting. The aim is to shape the expectations around the most fundamental dynamic of market economies: the evolution of prices. The experiments relied on theories going back decades. As far back as the 1930s, the economists Knut Wicksell, Irving Fisher and John Maynard Keynes proposed that price behavior was based in large part on expectations.
The pronouncements by central banks, through statements, testimony and news conferences, endow the future with discernible features that we can reflect and act upon, animating or curtailing our propensities to produce, consume, borrow, lend and so on. Markets are, after all, a function of language.
Ms. Yellen faces immense challenges: The most immediate is the gradual slowing of the policy of "quantitative easing" that the Fed has used to hold down interest rates, through large-scale purchase of bonds. Ms. Yellen has to continue to articulate the Fed's dual mandate -- maximum employment and stable prices -- to the markets, to consumers and to government officials. She will have to orchestrate and communicate decision making within the Fed, so that disagreements can enhance rather than diminish confidence in monetary policy. She also has the added burden, which the Fed has shouldered since the financial crisis, of ensuring the stability of the American financial system.
A senior official of the European Central Bank, Benoît Coeuré, said in a speech last year that monetary stability was "a cornerstone of the social contract." Fed officials who remember the high inflation of the 1970s, brought under control by Mr. Greenspan's predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, pretty much agree.
Ms. Yellen is likely to continue the policies of Mr. Bernanke, who helped make Fed policy much more transparent. Like him, she will have to communicate to multiple audiences -- members of Congress, the financial markets and consumers -- who have come to expect clear and precise messages from the central bank.
The incremental experiments with language and explanation pursued by the Fed over the last decade are setting a new relationship with the public, one in which ordinary people's predicaments are recognized and have come to serve as a fulcrum of policy. The days in which the leader of the Fed could mumble incoherently, obscuring his true intentions behind a cloud of verbiage, are gone.

Full text:   Americans increased their spending at a solid pace for the second straight month in December, even though their incomes were flat.
Consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in December after an increase of 0.6 percent in November, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. The November increase was the biggest gain in five months.
Income, however, showed no gain in December after a 0.2 percent rise in November. Wages and salaries were essentially flat in December, reflecting a sharp slowdown in employment growth. For all of 2013, income growth was 2.8 percent, the weakest performance since 2009, when income fell 2.8 percent as the country struggled with a deep recession.
Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.
For the October-December quarter, consumer spending was rising at the fastest pace in three years, giving economists hope that the economy had finally turned the corner to faster growth after a prolonged period of subpar activity following the end of the recession in June 2009.
This year, analysts say the economy will get a lift from continued gains in hiring, which would give more households money to spend. Manufacturers are also expected to benefit from rising global demand, and housing construction and auto sales are expected to improve further.
Some economists say they think growth could accelerate to around 3 percent this year. If it does, 2014 would be the best year for growth since the recession ended.
Stronger growth and the improving job market are the primary reasons the Federal Reserve is pressing ahead with a plan to scale back its economic stimulus.
Most forecasters think the economy will manage to withstand such factors as turmoil in emerging economies, which have been rattled by the pullback in the Fed's stimulus and the prospect of higher domestic interest rates.
One major reason for optimism: A belief that the government will be less of a drag than in 2013, when higher federal taxes and spending cuts trimmed overall growth by an estimated 1.5 percentage points.
A budget deal Congress approved earlier this month halted tens of billions in additional spending cuts that were scheduled to kick in this year.
Many global investors are concerned that the Fed's pullback in its bond purchases will raise interest rates and cause investors to shift money out of emerging markets and into the United States for higher returns. Currency values in emerging economies have fallen over that concern.
For December, prices measured by an inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose only 0.2 percent compared with November, and were up just 1.1 percent for the entire year, well below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target.
While consumer confidence has been rising, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment showed a slight drop in January, to 81.2, from its December reading of 82.5, a decline attributed in part to recent setbacks in the stock market.
The combination of stronger spending in December but no improvement in income meant that many consumers tapped into savings to finance their spending. The saving rate slipped to 3.9 percent of after-tax income in December, down from 4.3 percent in November. It was the lowest monthly saving rate since last January, when the rate dropped to 3.6 percent. For the year, the saving rate was 4.5 percent, the lowest since 2007.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDBUENOS AIRES -- As Argentines stew over a currency crisis that has shaken markets around the world, many residents here are asking the same question: Where is the president?
President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner spoke in public just once in the six weeks before the currency plunge last week that set off global concerns about the fragility of developing economies. As her country's currency began its slide, she spoke about a subsidy for college-age students instead.
Then, after the steepest drop in the Argentine peso since the country's economy collapsed over a decade ago, Mrs. Kirchner steered clear of the turmoil yet again, flying to Cuba for a summit meeting. Once there, she avoided mentioning the simmering crisis almost entirely, opting to send Twitter messages about meeting Fidel Castro's grandchildren. Only later did she post a few Twitter messages attributing Argentina's market upheaval to "speculative pressures" by unnamed economic groups and banks.
"The president does not feel she owes any explanation to the citizenry as a whole," said Federico Finchelstein, an Argentine historian at the New School for Social Research in New York.
The problems in Argentina have quickly turned it into a symbol of the economic pressures building on developing countries, stirring fears that the trouble could spread if global demand for commodities wanes and investors look for better bets in the United States.
The peso plunged 15 percent on Jan. 22 and 23, from around 6.9 pesos to the dollar to 8 pesos, according to Bloomberg News, and has since stablized. It closed on Friday at 8 pesos to the dollar. It weakened by a total of 19 percent in January.
Many economists say that the trouble here stems from the decisions Mrs. Kirchner and her government have championed for years. She describes her politics as "national and popular," referring to efforts to promote national interests and industry, and to put in place policies that reach out to the masses.
Generous social spending after the economic collapse, like freezing household electricity rates, has widened Argentina's budget deficit, encouraged energy consumption and increased the country's dependence on energy imports, eroding the central bank's hard currency reserves. Inflation is so high that it has become a heated political issue, with economists saying it exceeded 28 percent in 2013 and officials insisting it was 10.9 percent.
Now Mrs. Kirchner's recent absences from Argentina's political scene have left her without much of a public defense and fueled a debate over whether a power vacuum is emerging -- a striking contrast to her strong presence during the rest of her presidency. Until recently, Argentines have grown accustomed to her appearing extensively around the country, speaking regularly on television and expressing herself prolifically on Twitter about everything from the quality of Argentine beef to the importance of asserting influence in Antarctica.
"It's at this time when a strong presence is needed, but presidential communication is in a stage of strategic retreat," said Marcelo J. García, a political communications researcher at the Society for International Development here, which studies global development.
In a barrage of more than 20 Twitter messages early on Friday morning, Mrs. Kirchner again stayed away from the turmoil in Argentina's currency markets, striking out instead at influential news organizations that have criticized the infrequency of her public appearances in recent weeks. Then on Friday night, she appeared in televised images greeting Prince Akishino of Japan in the presidential palace here.
Mrs. Kirchner, 60, whose office did not respond to several requests for comment, began to withdraw from the public eye last October when she underwent surgery here to drain a blood clot near her brain, the result of a head injury that was never fully explained by the president, her doctors or her advisers.
Later in October, voters dealt a blow to any ambitions that she might have had of running for a third consecutive term by giving new momentum to her opposition in midterm legislative elections. Her party, the Front for Victory, fell far short of the two-thirds majority it needed in Congress to amend the Constitution to allow her to run again.
Mrs. Kirchner seemed to recover well from her surgery, but Argentina's economy came under greater stress. With inflation soaring, she overhauled her economic team in November, thrusting two young officials into prominent roles.
With Mrs. Kirchner largely avoiding the public eye and leaving explanations of the abrupt economic policy shifts to her aides, many Argentines are fuming.
"She puts the blame on everybody else, but she's the one running the country," said Iván Orozco, 53, a travel agent. "She sees a reality that doesn't exist."
Even before the currency tumult, polls showed support for Mrs. Kirchner falling sharply. Her approval rating plunged to 27 percent in January, from 42 percent in November, according to a nationwide survey by Management and Fit, a polling company that interviewed 1,600 people across Argentina shortly before the peso tumbled against the dollar.
"This is this government's most important crisis," said María Casullo, an expert on populist politics at the University of Buenos Aires.
Mrs. Kirchner took office in 2007 and still draws support from her base, including many poor voters who have benefited from social welfare programs that she and her husband, Néstor Kirchner, who preceded her in the presidency and died in 2010, put into effect after the financial collapse of 2001 and 2002. Her supporters, who point out that Argentina's economy is still expected to grow modestly this year, have also assembled an array of pro-government news organizations in an attempt improve perceptions of her in a highly critical media landscape.
Cynthia García, a panelist on 678, a pro-government news debate program, rejected the notion that Mrs. Kirchner was avoiding discussing the currency crisis.
"If she doesn't use the words that represent neoliberal interests, they say she's silent," Ms. García said, referring to the market-oriented economic policies that prevailed here in the 1990s. "But she is by no means a coward."
The decline in economic growth from the boom years until 2011 is also exposing Mrs. Kirchner to greater criticism about her own wealth, which has skyrocketed since 2003, the year her husband came to power, according to sworn declarations presented to the federal anticorruption office.
The Kirchners were worth about $2.3 million a decade ago, largely the result of property dealings in Patagonia, their political bastion. In 2010, their fortune had grown to approximately $18 million, including debt, according to Mrs. Kirchner's sworn declaration, during a period in which she was a senator before her election as president.
It is thought that Mrs. Kirchner inherited half of Mr. Kirchner's estate, with the other half going to their two children. Subsequently, in 2011, her declared wealth dropped to about $9.4 million before growing again to about $10.5 million in 2012, according to her most recent submission of documents to the anti-corruption office.
She declared 25 percent and 50 percent ownership stakes in 26 properties in Buenos Aires and the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz, where Mr. Kirchner was governor for over a decade.
When a student asked her about the rise in her wealth after a televised speech at Harvard University in 2012, Mrs. Kirchner said that judicial investigations had not revealed any irregularities. "We had, and I have, a certain economic position, which is the product of the fact I have worked my whole life and I have been a very successful lawyer," she said. "Now, I'm also a successful president."
As many Argentines resort to buying dollars in the black market here, her expanding wealth and near silence as the currency tumult unfolds are opening Mrs. Kirchner to greater criticism.
"She used to speak every day and now it's once every 45 days," said José Fernández Montero, 65, a baker. "She's looking out for her own interests, her own money. The country is going backward."
Still, the crisis has not fazed her staunchest supporters. "She's a capable lady, an honest lady," said Jacinta Giménez, 68, a retired saleswoman. "I'd vote for her until the very end."

Full text:   TOKYO -- The rate of core consumer inflation in Japan rose at the fastest pace in more than five years in December and the job market improved, encouraging signs for the country's central bank as it seeks to vanquish deflation with aggressive money printing.
Factory output also grew in December, and manufacturers expect to keep increasing production, although some analysts fret about potential damage from the recent turmoil in emerging markets.
The data released Friday point to an economy that continues to pick up momentum on strong domestic demand. But Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, expressed some caution about export demand, as many of Japan's Asian trading partners remain weak.
Core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include energy costs, rose 1.3 percent in December from the same month a year earlier, the data showed, just above a median market forecast for a 1.2 percent gain. That followed a 1.2 percent increase in November, and was the fastest year-over-year gain since 1.9 percent in October 2008, the data showed.
In 2013, Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, the first increase in five years.
In a further sign that price gains are broadening, the so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.7 percent in December compared with the previous year, matching a high hit in August 1998.
"The core consumer price index was stronger than expected, and durable goods prices seem to be rebounding," said Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities. "Consumer prices will likely continue moderate growth. I think the B.O.J. is unlikely to adopt additional easing because there is no reason to justify it given the positive macroeconomic environment."

That follows a 1.2 percent increase in November, and marks the fastest year-over-year gain since 1.9 percent in October 2008, data from the Japanese statistics bureau showed.

Japan's industrial output rose 1.1 percent in December, suggesting that robust domestic demand is underpinning the economy as consumers rush to beat an increase in the national sales tax that is coming in April. The demand is making up for soft exports to emerging markets. The rise in industrial output roughly matched a median market forecast of a 1.2 percent increase, and followed a 0.1 percent drop in November.
The jump in output is a welcome sign for an economy that has steadily recovered over the past year on the back of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's fiscal and monetary stimulus policies.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to rise 6.1 percent in January and increase 0.3 percent in February, data showed on Friday.
Robust domestic demand, coupled with a weak yen that inflates import costs, helped Japan pass the halfway mark toward achieving the central bank's target of 2 percent inflation.
However, a recent sell-off in emerging-market stocks and currencies has reminded investors that Japan still faces risks that a renewed downturn in overseas economies will sap demand for Japanese goods.
"One reason Japan's exports have struggled to pick up momentum is that emerging Asean countries that Japan has a close relationship with have not recovered as quickly as expected," Mr. Kuroda, the central bank chief, told Parliament. "These economies are expected to recover, but we cannot say this will apply to every case."
Mr. Kuroda has expressed confidence that prices will reach the bank's target in the two-year time frame it pledged when adopting an aggressive stimulus policy last April. But an International Monetary Fund official has said Japan's economy is likely to take longer to reach the inflation goal, even though prices are rising steadily.
Many analysts remain skeptical on whether price growth will accelerate, worried about an expected slump in consumption after the tax increase and the fading price support from the weak yen.
Annual wage negotiations, which take place in the spring, will be an important test of whether labor unions can secure higher salaries needed to help consumer spending weather the tax increase.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   ISTANBUL -- First, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the bold move by Turkey's central bank this week to raise interest rates sharply to halt the decline in the country's currency, telling reporters that higher borrowing costs would lead to inflation -- an argument that contravenes accepted economic logic.
Mr. Erdogan's economic adviser, Yigit Bulut, then did little to reassure skittish investors, suggesting that the prime minister would do something that would be "very positive for the markets," but did not say exactly what Mr. Erdogan's plans were.
The remarks only added to jitters in financial markets, which have battered the Turkish stock market and in recent weeks sent the currency, the lira, to historic lows. While Turkey has suffered along with other developing nations from the "tapering" of bond purchases by the United States Federal Reserve and the threat of rising global interest rates, its problems go beyond that to basic questions about the stability of the government and its ability to grapple with the economy's problems.
To some extent, Turkey and Mr. Erdogan are victims of their own success, having created an attractive investment climate that brought in billions in dollar-denominated lending, particularly after the financial crisis of 2008. Officials in Western capitals, including President Obama, came to see him as the prime example of a leader who could meld democratic values, Islam and economic prosperity.
But much of the money was funneled to a group of insiders who made fortunes while building malls and other developments that increasingly lacked sound economic underpinnings. Now, with bond investors fleeing and interest rates rising, Mr. Erdogan's economic turnaround is in jeopardy of unraveling in a toxic stew of bad loans, accusations of cronyism and the appearance of seat-of-the-pants economic stewardship.
The first cracks in Mr. Erdogan's aura of invincibility came in the summer, with violent street protests against yet another mall that was to replace a popular Istanbul park. Mr. Erdogan emerged from that with his image tarnished but his power seemingly intact.
But he was jolted once again in December by a sweeping corruption inquiry aimed at his inner circle. That continues to unfold, further chipping away at his power.
At the same time, his ambitious foreign policy, which sought to position Turkey as the leader of a region in turmoil, failed amid the continuing civil war in Syria, where Turkey has supported the rebels, and the collapse of the Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, an important ally that Mr. Erdogan enthusiastically supported.
The political attacks, economic instability and higher interest rates come at an inopportune time for Mr. Erdogan, as he and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish initials A.K.P., face a series of elections that will determine if he remains in power.
Local elections in March, and especially the contest for the influential post of mayor of Istanbul, will be the first test. In the summer, voters, for the first time, will cast their ballots in a nationwide election for president, a post Mr. Erdogan is hoping to capture.
Mr. Erdogan, a pious Muslim who has been in power for more than a decade, is Turkey's longest-serving prime minister and, analysts say, its most consequential leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the secular founder of modern Turkey. Mr. Erdogan has burnished his power with his charisma and his appeal to the country's religious masses, a previously oppressed class under Turkey's former secular rulers.
But more than that, experts say, Mr. Erdogan owes his staying power atop Turkey's political system to his stewardship of an economic boom that has elevated Turkey to the global stage.
"Ultimately, he's popular because he's done well with the economy," said Murat Ucer, an economist at GlobalSource Partners, an economic research firm, and a former adviser to Turkey's Economy Minstry. "And Turks, I think, will want to continue to get rich."
Following a series of economic overhauls in the early 2000s, just before the A.K.P. came to power, Turkey's economy surged by an average of more than 5 percent a year. Per capita income more than quadrupled over that time, to $11,000 a year from $2,500, according to Sinan Ulgen, the chairman of the Center for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, a research organization in Istanbul.
With the boom in Turkey's private sector, Mr. Erdogan's government expanded social services, such as health care, and infrastructure, providing ordinary Turks with a sense of economic empowerment.
"Turks got to know what it means to be treated as a basic citizen, in many different ways," Mr. Ucer said.
Even so, there was plenty of evidence, even before the recent instability, of cracks in Turkey's economic facade.
Despite the impressive growth, unemployment, which has improved, remained relatively high at about 9 percent. An explosion of consumer credit in recent years has raised fears, even as it has powered a new consumer society and ensured that all the new shopping malls sprouting in Istanbul would have a steady flow of customers.
In November, the police captured a man near Mr. Erdogan's office in Ankara, the Turkish capital, who appeared to be carrying a bomb.
At first, the police thought he was trying to assassinate the prime minister. But it turned out that the bomb was fake, and that the man was trying to stage a protest over his mounting credit card debt, which local news reports put at $17,000.
On Thursday night, a group of men loudly debated the economy in a cafe in Ortakoy, an Istanbul neighborhood on the shores of the Bosporus. One of the men, Levent Koray, a fruit stall owner, spoke about what he viewed as the diminishing economic prospects for men like him.
"For the last 10 years, because of the opportunities given to us by the prime minister, we could come to this cafe and play games freely while relaxing and talking about football, our children, our dreams, but now all we do is talk about our financial problems," he said.
Big business, he said, has ultimately fared better under Mr. Erdogan, pushing out small players like him.
"Ten years ago, I was the fruit king of this district," Mr. Koray said. "Now, my stall is in the shadows of three giant grocery chains that were given land by the government. People walk straight past me now."
With the street protests, Mr. Erdogan was able to order a harsh police crackdown to restore order.
Mr. Erdogan has countered the corruption inquiry -- believed to be led by followers of the exiled Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who have taken up posts in the police force and judiciary -- by purging the state of police officials and prosecutors. But with the economy, with its reliance on foreign capital, Mr. Erdogan is largely powerless, forced for now to defend the currency with the higher interest rates he deplores.
"It's almost unavoidable for Turkey to go through a protracted period of low growth," Mr. Ulgen said.
Throughout these crises, Mr. Erdogan has been able to rely on the support of Turkey's religious conservatives, who account for roughly half of the electorate. But now, in the midst of economic uncertainty, his popularity is slipping.
A poll released this week by Metropoll, an Ankara-based firm, showed Mr. Erdogan's job approval at a historic low of 40 percent, compared with 48 percent in December. In 2011, after winning a third term, his popularity rating stood at 71 percent.
Yet even more is at stake for Mr. Erdogan than his electoral hopes. His ambitious economic goals for Turkey to reach by 2023 -- the 100th anniversary of the Turkish republic -- are now in peril. Some of his grandest construction projects, like a third airport for Istanbul that officials have said would be the world's largest, are in jeopardy.
"There is no economy to finance these projects anymore," Mr. Ucer said. "A lot of these things will probably get shelved."

Abstract: (Holland Cotter) * Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

Museums
* Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Tony Feher' (through Feb. 16) Almost anything can be beautiful if it's presented in the right way. That's where the sculptor Tony Feher comes in. His palette consists almost entirely of cheap manufactured objects, including glass and plastic bottles; metal and plastic bottle tops; marbles, coins, nuts and bolts, metal rings, plastic bags, broken pieces of glass, rope, plastic cord, shredded paper, cans and cardboard boxes. He organizes these and other things into simple but surprisingly exciting, often funny configurations with intriguing philosophical implications. This beautiful show surveys a 25-year career. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt' (through December 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, this show is for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum's renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
* Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Guggenheim Museum: 'Carrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Photography and Video' (through May 14) Color and class are still the great divides in American culture, and few artists have surveyed them as subtly and incisively as Carrie Mae Weems, whose traveling 30-year retrospective has arrived at the Guggenheim. From its early candid family photographs, through series of pictures that track the Africa in African-American, to work that probes, over decades, what it means to be black, female and in charge of your life, it's a ripe, questioning and beautiful show. All the more galling, then, that this museum has cut it down to nearly half its original size and split it between two floors of annex galleries, making an exhibition that should have filled the main-event rotunda into a secondary attraction. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The American West in Bronze, 1850-1925' (through April 13) This intriguing and spiritually troubling show presents 65 mostly pedestal-scale sculptures representing standard themes of the old American West: cowboys, Indians and wild animals. It includes famous practitioners of the genre like Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, as well as 26 others. Nearly all the sculptures are in a mode of three-dimensional illustrative realism and tend heavily to romantic idealization. There's the rub: The real history of the conquest of the West by white folks was much worse than what these artists imagined in their very popular works. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Antonio Canova: The Seven Last Works' (through April 27) At the end of his life Antonio Canova (1757-1822) produced this show's seven rectangular plaster reliefs for a neo-Classical church he designed and financed for his hometown, Possagno, Italy. Unlike his best known sculptures, they are not remotely erotic or even particularly sensual, and they have nothing to do with the Greek mythology. Rather, they illustrate biblical stories: four from the Book of Genesis and three revolving around the birth of Jesus. They have their moments, but on the whole it doesn't look like Christianity was a good influence on Canova's creative imagination. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China' (through April 6) This museum's first survey of recent Chinese art uses the lens of the culture's ancient brush and ink tradition so basic to its landscape painting and calligraphy. It doesn't always work. The show endures a scattered installation, includes overly refined displays of empty skill and wanders off message in spots, especially with several sculptures that don't seem to belong here. But a few moments of visual life and many interesting questions about the weight of the old on the new make it worthwhile. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Jewels By JAR' (through March 9) Crowd-pleasers needn't represent lowered curatorial standards in terms of subject and execution, but this one does. It packs 400 efforts by the New York-born, Paris-based high-society jeweler, Joel Arthur Rosenthal (JAR), into a very dark gallery with insufficient labeling or historical backup. Large pave brooches, usually of flowers, abound; too many pieces date from 2010 or later. There are certainly redeeming works, but the show cries out for editing, scholarly support and better viewing conditions. Artist and audience are left hanging, with the museum's mercenary agenda in full view. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Piero della Francesa: Personal Encounters' (through March 30) None of the four works in this deceptively low-impact show are among Piero della Francesca's most celebrated. But they are all the devotional paintings for private clients Piero is known to have made, and this show is the first to bring them all together. Two picture Saint Jerome in his wilderness retreat and two portray the Madonna and Child, one of which is thought to be Piero's earliest known painting and the other among his last. As marriages of old religious faith and new forms of empirical consciousness, they are marvelous thought provokers. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Silla: Korea's Golden Kingdom' (through Feb. 23) This intriguing show presents more than 130 objects from Silla, a kingdom that dominated the Korean peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries. The first two of three sections includes gold jewelry, formally austere pottery, glassware and other objects excavated from mound shaped, earth-covered tombs in the city of Gyeongju. The third section displays sculpture made after Buddhism was adopted as the state religion around 530. Among the most captivating is a beautiful three-foot-high, gilt bronze sculpture of a young Bodhisattva, which, like a number of other works in the show, has been designated a Korean National Treasure. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Venetian Glass by Carlo Scarpa: The Venini Company, 1932-1947' (through March 2) Before he turned to architecture, Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) designed glass vessels, achieving a lifetime's worth of beauty and innovation in a short, remarkable burst of creativity. His achievement is honored with this sublime exhibition of nearly 300 of his splendidly sculptural, radiantly colored, ingeniously patterned vessels. They have an inspiring wholeness: process, form and decoration become a single thing; art, craft and science merge. And content of the non-narrative, experiential kind abounds. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'William Kentridge: The Refusal of Time' (through May 11) Everything is on the move in this mini-theater-cum-power-plant of an installation. In wraparound videos, metronomes pound. Clock-faces spin, spewing trails of stars. Drawings draw and erase themselves. Maps of Africa appear and disappear. White-coated figures mix potions amid giant watch springs. At the center of the gallery a wooden contraption pumps away like an energy source. A collaboration between Mr. Kentridge, who is based in South Africa, and Peter L. Galison, a science historian at Harvard, the piece refers to the European colonial experiment, which strove to shape other cultures to its own concepts of reality, only to find that those cultures had different, resistant, assertive realities of their own. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Visions and Nightmares: Four Centuries of Spanish Drawings' (through May 11) Skipping from 16th-century church commissions to Goya in just 25 objects, the Morgan's first show of Spanish drawings is necessarily awkward. But it delivers on the promise of its title, serving up heavenly apparitions and wicked phantasms aplenty. Highlights include a red chalk drawing of the satyr Marsyas by José de Ribera, an "Immaculate Conception" by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, several late Goya drawings, and a lavishly illustrated 1780 edition of "Don Quixote." 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
* Museum of Arts and Design: 'Out of Hand: Materializing the Postdigital' (through June 1) If you haven't quite wrapped your head around the concept of 3-D printing, or haven't yet had a digital scanner wrap itself around you, now you can do both in this survey of computer-assisted art, architecture and design. The show looks at art made since 2005 and fills nearly three floors, including many irresistible interactive projects. Its ideas may not be entirely new; the Museum of Modern Art's 2008 exhibition "Design and the Elastic Mind" covered much of the same territory, but there's something to be said for this more down-to-earth, production-focused exhibition. 2 Columbus Circle, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Designing Modern Women 1890-1990' (through Sept. 21) Shoehorned into half the museum's design department, this conversation-starting display of objects from MoMA's permanent collection features items designed by more than 60 women, many of whom worked with male partners. Some, like Marianne Brandt and Eileen Gray, are well known to design aficionados, but most will be unfamiliar to a general audience. Most objects were created for domestic consumption. The pièce de résistance is a kitchen designed by Charlotte Perriand for the apartments in Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation in Marseille, France. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New' (through April 21) Ileana Sonnabend, who died in 2007 at 92, was one of the most foresighted art dealers of the late 20th century. This modest-size exhibition, made up of work she either owned or showed in her gallery, gives a sense of the range of her interests, from Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Modern Art: Isa Genzken: 'Retrospective' (through March 10) This prolific German sculptor -- for whom New York and its skyscrapers are a major source of inspiration -- receives her first comprehensive museum survey in this country. A grand, glamorous and sometimes grating 40-year overview, it traces her progress from idiosyncratic Minimalist monoliths to the distinctive, often architectonic, assemblages she began making in 1997 from cheesy materials and objects, concocting a raw, unapologetic beauty and a weirdly elliptical if literal-minded social commentary, often about the United States, power and war. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through March 9) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: "American Photographs," by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprise of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
* Neue Galerie: 'Vasily Kandinsky: From Blaue Reiter to the Bauhaus, 1910-1925' (through Feb. 10) The Neue's first show on Kandinsky centers on a rich 15-year period, also the purview of the Museum of Modern Art's recent "Inventing Abstraction, 1910-1925." During this time Kandinsky shifted from the prismatic Expressionism of Der Blaue Reiter into pure abstraction and from easel paintings into set designs and murals. A reconstruction of one of those mural projects is on view, as are abundantly decorative wall panels made for a private collector in New York. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, 212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
* New-York Historical Society: 'The Armory Show at 100: Modern Art and Revolution' (through Feb. 23) The International Exhibition of Modern Art, otherwise known as the Armory Show, woke American art from its provincial slumbers a century ago. Was it a good thing or a bad thing, and is there any reason to care about it now? With more than 100 works from the original exhibition by American and European artists and a big, richly illuminating catalog, "The Armory Show at 100" offers an excellent opportunity to ponder such questions. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
Queens Museum of Art: Peter Schumann 'The Shatterer' (through March 30) A recent expansion has doubled the size of the Queens Museum. Of five celebratory new shows, the largest and most moving is the solo museum debut of Peter Schumann, the founder and director of Bread and Puppet Theater, which is 50 years old this year. The show demonstrates how thoroughly Bread and Puppet is his creation. The exhibition's down-value look and activist ethos are evident in everything, including the black house-paint mural he has brushed, single-handedly, across one of the museum's wall and the hand-printed, hand-bound books he has placed in the gallery he designates as chapel and library. Every inch of this room is covered with figures and words: angels and ogres, exhortations and condemnations, art for one and for all, straight from the hand, right to the moral core. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 718-592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Rubin Museum of Art: 'Allegory and Illusion: Early Portrait Photography From South Asia' (through Feb. 10) "Allegory and Illusion" is a fascinating little piece of a very complicated puzzle. Ostensibly a focused, regional exhibition, it has much to say about the larger relationship between photography and colonialism. Included are many different forms of early photography, representing an array of markets and social classes: grand portraits of Nepalese royals and palm-size cartes de visite for the masses, ethnographic albums by British photographers and hand-painted photographs from Indian portrait studios. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Rosenberg)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Carrie Mae Weems: The Museum Series' (through June 29) A set of recent pictures by Carrie Mae Weems are on view here as a supplement to the Guggenheim Museum's "Carrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Photography and Video" exhibition. These images show the artist dwarfed by the facades of international art institutions -- the Louvre, the Tate Modern, and so on -- which, to quote the Studio Museum news release, "affirm or reject certain histories through their collecting or display decisions. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Shadows Took Shape' (through March 9) Space is definitely the place in this lively group exhibition devoted to Afrofuturism, a contemporary art trend that takes the ultra-free-jazz musician Sun Ra as its patron saint and locates itself in a universe where racial and ethnic identities float free from stereotypes without losing track of the histories that created them. William Villalongo sets African sculpture and modernist painting soaring together among the stars; the Kenyan artist Wanuri Kahiu films ecological cataclysm and renewal in ages to come; William Cordova, who lives in New York and Lima, Peru, recreates the Falcon spaceship from George Lucas's "Star Wars," now equipped with a cultural studies library. 144 West 125th Street, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'T.J. Wilcox: In the Air' (through Feb. 9) A Romantic miniaturist best known for short, poetic films pieced together from found and made footage goes big in a dazzling 360-degree, 30-minute, day-to-night-to-day view of Lower Manhattan. Six brief collagelike films pop onto the panorama one at a time, zeroing on a specific event, person or experience, including Sept. 11. We see the city as a kaleidoscopic archive, alive with buildings, history, memories and people, and understand anew that the metropolis and the moving image were made for each other. 212-570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

* 'Selling the Dwelling: The Books That Built America's Houses, 1775-2000' (closes next Friday) More than 200 books, prints and objects trace the history of home building in America. Starting with 18th-century builder's guides, this exhibition chronicles the rise and fall of popular styles like Greek Revival, Gothic fantasy, Colonial Revival and Beaux-Arts. The 20th century brings pre-fab house-building kits and Levittown-style mass production. In the postmodern era you find plans for a traditional "dream house" designed by Gary Brewer of Robert A.M. Stern Architects that were published by Life magazine. This display is a richly rewarding intellectual journey. Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, Manhattan, 212-838-6690, grolierclub.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Chelsea
Martina Bacigalupo: 'Gulu Real Art Studio' (through Feb. 8) In 2010 the Italian photojournalist Martina Bacigalupo spent time in the city of Gulu in northern Uganda, where she came across a curious form of portraiture. In a local shop called the Gulu Real Art Studio she found dozens of full-length pictures of sitters from which the heads had been neatly cut out. The shop's owner, Obal Denis, explained why. His machine for developing passport-size photos automatically produced four prints at a time, but most people coming for an ID picture needed only one. So it was easier, and cheaper, to shoot a regular full-length portrait, edit out a head shot and toss what was left. The pictures in this remarkable show are the result: studies in body language and clothing, accompanied by audio-taped interviews made with some of the sitters. The Walther Collection Project Space, 508-526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, 212-352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
* 'Hooray for Hollywood!' (through Feb. 8) This big, sumptuous exhibition revisits the ecumenical gallery and vivid personality of Holly Solomon (1934-2002), offering a relatively wide-angle view of the 1970s and the '80s than is usual these days. Founded in 1975, Solomon's SoHo gallery exhibited staunch Post-Minimalists and Conceptualists (Gordon Matta-Clark, Peter Hutchinson) beside younger artists reacting against such stringency, especially those of the Pattern and Decoration persuasion (Robert Kushner, Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt, Ned Smyth). Both sides are well-represented, and portraits of Solomon commissioned from artists she knew or showed further enliven the proceedings. Mixed Greens, 212-331-8888, mixedgreens.com; Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 212-675-7490, pavelzoubok.com; both at 531 West 26th Street. (Smith)
* Janet Malcolm: 'The Emily Dickinson Series' (through Feb. 8) The writer Janet Malcolm has had a long, impressive and less often noted parallel career as an artist. In this show of subtle, meticulously judged recent collages, she combines facsimiles of Dickinson's letters to Otis P. Lord, a man with whom the poet appears to have shared a late-blooming love, with astronomical images, layering visual and verbal elements to suggest complex personal histories lost and found in the stars. Lori Bookstein, 138 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, 212-750-0949, loribooksteinfineart.com. (Cotter)
Jackie Nickerson: 'Terrain' (through Feb. 15) Jackie Nickerson works in a traditional social documentary format, and her photographs ripple with politics, particularly around the issues of food production, agribusiness and labor. She upsets one of documentary's central tenants, however, by photographing farm workers in southern and eastern Africa holding the materials and tools of their trades. Tobacco or banana leaves or plastic crates obscure their faces and bodies. Where earlier social documentary used people as its "universal" currency, "Terrain" puts plants and work implements in the foreground, creating what might be called post-human social documentary. Jack Shainman Gallery, 513 West 20th Street, 212-645-1701, jackshainman.com. (Martha Schwendener)
'Para-Real' (through Feb. 8) This philosophically catchy 14-artist show reflects a few forms in which reality, whatever that is, impinges. It includes a pile of scrub brushes by Robert Therrien; a self-portrait of Maurizio Cattelan as a real puppet; Hiroshi Sugimoto's photograph of stuffed golden eagles in a museum diorama; and Thomas Demand's "Ghost," a photograph of a colored paper and cardboard construction of a kitchen, wherein some culinary objects hover above the stove, as if tossed up by a poltergeist. 601Artspace, 601 West 26th Street, 212-243-2735, 601artspace.org. (Johnson)
* Larry Poons: 'New Paintings' (through Feb. 8) Larry Poons's preference for fields of pulsating color has sustained him for more than five decades. His latest versions present expanses of often separate, distinctly unmacho, nonvirtuoso small brush strokes whose crazed curling generate pointillized drifts, ripples and vortexes of pastel colors. Looking back while forging ahead, they add intimations of bacchanals, Claudian landscapes and Cézannian vistas to his pursuit of all-over painting in the tradition of Jackson Pollock. Danese/Corey, 511 West 22nd Street, 212-223-2227, danesecorey.com. (Smith)
Davina Semo: 'Ruder Forms Survive' (through Feb. 15) A promising young artist overdoes it, spreading herself too thin with pat, generic results -- especially when remaking the modernist monochrome in industrial-strength materials like cement, heavy chains, stainless steel mesh and acid-stained one-way mirrors. The histrionic punk-noir titles also don't help. For a sense of her talent for creating tantalizing confusions of perception, material and emotion, turn to three small wall pieces made of brass: two metal-lined crevices redolent of armored female genitalia, archers' slits and their ambiguously protruding opposite, a shiny bronze flange that tapers upward and outward from the wall. Marlborough Chelsea, 545 West 25th Street, 212-463-8634, marlboroughchelsea.com. (Smith)
Richard Serra: 'New Sculpture' (through Feb. 8, and March 15) In this show running at two branches of the Gagosian Gallery, Richard Serra continues along the road that emerged from the hugely successful "Torqued Ellipses" of the 1990s, but also circles back to his earlier oeuvre. At 555 West 24th Street, you have the Serra of the '60s and '70s, revised and updated: heavy rectilinear plates and cubes fabricated in steel rather than lead, his signature material in the '60s. In the navelike space at 522 West 21st Street, you have the new-old Serra: an 80-foot-long curvilinear sculpture fabricated in weatherproof steel called "Inside Out" (2013). The difference between the installations in the two galleries might be described simply as austerity versus pleasure. Through Feb. 8 at 522 West 21st Street, 212-741-1717; through March 15 at 555 West 24th Street, 212-741-1111; gagosian.com. (Schwendener)
'Simplest Means' (through Feb. 22) This suggestive exhibition presents works by eight contemporary artists along with a selection of useful objects produced by Shakers mostly in the 19th century. The connection is a predilection for simplicity and transparency. Shaker pieces include an intricately constructed wooden chip fork and a finely woven straw bonnet. Among works by the artists are geometric compositions painted by Don Voisine; a dusky painting of a broom and dustpan by Joshua Marsh; and loops and slender lengths of wood carved by Seth Koen. Jeff Bailey Gallery, 625 West 27th Street, 212-989-0156, baileygallery.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: Other
Julien Bismuth: 'An image as the _____ of a surface' (through Feb. 16) As the show's title suggests, Julien Bismuth is concerned not only with how images are made, but also with their relationship to surfaces. Pink mesh silk screens sit on the floor, leaning against the wall, sometimes stacked like an archive. Above them are images printed in dark gray ink directly onto the wall. Two videos focus on what we experience privately in the realm of images, and an audio work features an actress reading "statements of intention" by artists, pop stars and others. Ripped from context, intentions mean nothing. Here they serve as poetic reminders of the great synapse between art and experience. Simone Subal, 131 Bowery, at Grand Street, second floor, Lower East Side, 917-409-0612, simonesubal.com. (Schwendener)
* 'Devotion: Excavating Bob Mizer' (through Feb. 15) Bob Mizer is best known as a producer and publisher of beefcake photography for a gay market. This show makes a good case for him as an artist with interests and an imagination considerably more expansive than what his popular reputation suggests. The show's first picture is of a Siamese cat on a sofa. Further on are Arbus-like portraits of women and children; photographs of odd staged events like a magic show; and a picture of a cop writing a parking ticket for a group of teenage girls that could have been made into a painting by Norman Rockwell. A spirit of good-humored generosity prevails. 80WSE, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, 212-998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Johnson)
* Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (through March 31) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, 212-610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
* 'Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart: Collected by Julie Ault' (through Feb. 23) Julie Ault, an artist, writer and curator, was a founding member of the New York collaborative Group Material, which, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, used exhibitions and public events to investigate the overlap of art and politics. During decades of depression, inflation, multiculturalism, conservatism and AIDS, she and her colleagues lived improvised lives on the city's fringes. Within their world, art was currency for giving gifts, bartering, buying and selling among friends. This show, spread over two different locations, is a moving record of such transactions. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo; Artists Space: Books & Talks, 55 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, 212-226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)
* Moira Dryer Project (through Feb. 22.) The first exhibition in 20 years of the obdurate yet romantic wood-panel paintings of Moira Dryer (1957-92) is a two-part affair that is especially relevant at a time when younger painters, many of them women, are exploring new ways of getting physical with their medium. Dryer pitted the literalness of her paintings against thin, sometimes streaky applications of paint for results that are witty and startling, assertive yet suffused with a delicate, even poetic atmosphere. A lively group show of paintings or painting-like works by six artists at the gallery's second space (at 195 Chrystie Street near Stanton) confirms the current relevance of Dryer's art. Eleven Rivington, two Lower East Side locations: 11 Rivington Street, 212-982-1930; 195 Chrystie Street, near Stanton Street, 212-477-2507, elevenrivington.com. (Smith)
* 'An Opening of the Field: Jess, Robert Duncan, and Their Circle' (through March 29) If you were young, gifted and odd, San Francisco was a good place to be in the years after World War II, when big changes were brewing in American art and culture. And this show feels like a chunk of Bay Area turf has been lifted from back then and set down, untrimmed and buzzing, in the New York of now. At its center are two gay men, the poet Robert Duncan (1919-88) and the artist Jess Collins (who went by the single name Jess). Committed partners living in a wonderland of an old house filled to roof with art, they gathered a fascinating creative community around them, and a lot of it shows up here. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, 212-998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Cotter)
Out of Town
* Carnegie Museum of Art: 2013 Carnegie International (through March 16) A welcome shock to the system of one of the art world's more entrenched rituals, this lean, seemingly modest, thought-out exhibition takes the big global survey of contemporary art off steroids. It is mostly devoid of the looming, often expensive installations called "festival art," while evincing a gratifying affinity for color, form, beauty and pleasure, and a discernible lack of interest in finger-wagging didacticism. Object-making of all kinds seems healthy, as do artist-initiated activist projects (which sometimes overlap). Interventionist and artist-as-curator efforts? Not as impressive. 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 412-622-3131, carnegieinternational.org. (Smith)
National Gallery of Art: 'Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium From Greek Collections' (through March 2) With about 170 objects, this show takes a processional sweep through Byzantine art from its Greco-Roman beginnings to its multicultural late phase in the 15th century, with a specific emphasis on its development in Greece itself. The history is fascinating, and the objects couldn't be more beautiful, including a glinting 13th-century icon of the Virgin and Child pieced together from glass, silver, gold and glass; a 17-foot-long parchment scroll painted with chirping birds and secret prayers; and a heavenly silk embroidery, found stashed away in a Thessaloniki church, depicting the body of the dead Christ surrounded by fan-wielding seraphs and a stitched chant, "Holy, holy, holy." On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, 202-737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Last Chance
* 'American Beauty' (closes on Saturday) The idea of this group show, organized by the artist William Villalongo, is that art can look good and think tough at the same time, and so it can. The show says much about how to size up damage and make it nice with works like a pretty ceiling installation by Maren Hassinger that takes us back to a 1970 performance piece she did in burned-out black neighborhoods in Los Angeles; Nicole Awai's gorgeously sinister wall sculptures; and Matthew Day Jackson's collaborations with his mother, Karen Jackson, on mending cut up covers from 1960s Life magazines. A small gallery of paintings by Mr. Villalongo comes as a bonus. Susan Inglett, 522 West 24th Street, Chelsea, 212-647-9111, inglettgallery.com. (Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'War/Photography: Images of Armed Conflict and Its Aftermath' (closes on Sunday) This flawed but intensely absorbing exhibition presents pictures by more than 280 photographers relating to conflicts from the Mexican-American War of 1846-49 to the Arab Spring revolution of 2010-11. Photographs from widely different times and places are grouped according to themes like "Recruitment and Embarkation" and "Homecoming," suggesting that all wars are somehow similar, which is debatable. The main problem, though, is the claustrophobic, overly busy installation, which is unfortunate because there is hardly a single picture that doesn't cry out to be seen and pondered by itself. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Sarah Crowner: 'The Wave' (closes on Sunday) Installed as a room-within-a-room, "The Wave" displays Ms. Crowner's signature sewn abstractions, stitched together from painted canvas, around a tiled viewing platform that's her most impressive foray yet into ceramics. Most of the paintings feature wide undulating stripes of red and orange, making them an excellent foil for the turquoise chevrons of the platform. As before, Ms. Crowner is using nonpainterly methods to make works that nonetheless register as paintings. But she's also integrating different periods of 20th-century design: everything from Alexander Girard's textiles for Herman Miller to the Wiener Werkstatte. Nicelle Beauchene Gallery, 327 Broome Street, between Bowery and Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, 212-375-8043, nicellebeauchene.com. (Rosenberg)
Cyprien Gaillard: 'Today Diggers, Tomorrow Dickens' (closes on Saturday) The familiar convention of giant, slightly altered, out-of-context ready-mades arrayed in a pristine gallery is reiterated by an artist best known for brutal videos that document the dehumanizing scale and effect of immense Eastern-bloc apartment complexes. Here he adds luxurious rods of yellow onyx to scarred excavation heads from earth-moving machines. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street, 212-206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Smith)
* Jewish Museum: 'Chagall: Love, War, and Exile' (closes on Sunday) This exhibition of Marc Chagall's work from the 1930s and '40s hinges on a group of paintings and drawings of Jesus on the cross, most of them made during, or shortly before or after, World War II. In these dark and anguished works, Chagall unexpectedly adopts Jesus as a Jewish martyr, as a symbol of a persecuted people and of the refugee artist in particular. The show's final gallery, however, glosses over this difficult period with some of Chagall's more romantic and nostalgic postwar paintings. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
* MoMA PS1: 'Mike Kelley' (closes on Sunday) This retrospective of the Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley fills 40,000 feet of gallery space at PS1. And it's that very rare thing, a huge show that should be huge. Kelley earned this blowout; his work sustains one. In a three-decade career, cut off by his suicide, at 57, in 2012, he did it all genrewise: performance, painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, video, installation, sound art and writing. And he wove together -- twisted together -- all of that into what amounted to a single conceptual project based on recurrent themes: class politics, popular culture, black humor, anti-formalist rigor and a moral sense, unshakably skeptical, that ran through everything like a spine. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Leonardo da Vinci: Treasures From the Biblioteca Reale, Turin' (closes on Sunday) A mere handful of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci are in this exquisite show. But in the case of the great multidisciplinary experimentalist and technician, even a little is a lot. Leonardo the scientist is here in the drawn and annotated "Codex on the Flight of Birds" and the artist in the exquisite silverpoint image called "Head of a Young Woman." Both works are in New York for the first time. The show is fleshed out with work by some of the master's followers and by the Morgan's own "Codex Huygens," a late-16th-century manuscript that has faithful copies of now-lost Leonardo drawings. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Dorothea Rockburne: Drawing Which Makes Itself' (closes on Sunday) The main attraction in this mini-survey of Dorothea Rockburne is a group of works from her 1973 show at the Bykert Gallery in New York. There, the artist developed a rigorously mathematical and strenuously physical method of drawing; she folded and scored large sheets of carbon paper as she moved them around the gallery, leaving a succession of marks -- lines and thumbprints -- on the wall and floor. They are a brain tease, especially if you try to follow the diagrams Ms. Rockburne has provided, but they also have a kind of poetry of movement; they make you think of professors scrawling equations on chalkboards. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
* 'Stay in Love' (closes on Sunday) This two-part group show about obsessive working practices -- "monomania and manual repetition" -- is a sign of the Lower East Side's maturation. The exhibition sometimes looks as if it belongs in Chelsea, or even in the contemporary galleries at the Museum of Modern Art. The Lisa Cooley gallery's part of the show is a mostly black-and-white affair with an impressive number of older contemporary works by the likes of On Kawara, Bernd and Hilla Becher, and Yayoi Kusama. At Laurel Gitlen, the works are more playful and colorful; an exuberant Josh Smith name-painting, an inspired B. Wurtz totem made from little more than wire, shoelaces and a red plastic bag. Lisa Cooley, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, 212-680-0564, lisa-cooley.com. Laurel Gitlen, 122 Norfolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, 212-274-0761, laurelgitlen.com. (Rosenberg)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Rituals of Rented Island: Object Theater, Loft Performance, and the New Psychodrama -- Manhattan, 1970-1980' (closes on Sunday) Four decades ago, performance art was young, funky and clunky, beyond modernism, or maybe perversely beneath it, meant to reflect a world in which materials were transient, old models useless and values shifty. We get a vivid flashback to those beginnings in this show of photographs, videos and objects that breathes surprising life into archival matter and brings wonderful artists like Stuart Sherman, Jared Bark, Julia Heyward, Jill Kroesen and Ralston Farina back into view. 212-570-3600, whitney.org.

Full text:   It is no fun to be a central banker in an emerging-market country when investors suddenly grow doubtful.
If you don't do what the foreign investors say you should do, your currency and your markets will be punished.
And if you do what you are told, well, they could be punished anyway.
Turkey's central bank set out this week to show that it was changing its ways. After months of watching the country's currency lose value, and of refusing to raise interest rates despite receiving lots of advice from overseas to do so, it called a news conference for midnight Tuesday, hinting that it would raise rates.
It not only raised them, it sent them soaring. One rate -- the central bank has a lot of them -- rose to 10 percent from 4.5 percent. That was enough to quiet the talk that the bank was subservient to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had loudly opposed any rate increase.
It impressed the currency market -- for a few hours. But by the end of the day Wednesday, the bounce was gone.
As a result, noted Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management, Turkey is receiving "the worst of both worlds." The higher rates will dampen local economic activity, "while foreign investors are hardly likely to be enticed by increased yields given the volatility and downside potential of the currency. The local crisis would seem to have room to run, and the question for global investors is the degree of international contagion that can be anticipated from Turkey's woes."
Not that long ago, Turkey seemed to be a rousing economic success story. Economic growth was impressive and foreign capital was coming in rapidly. Now inflation seems to have taken off, and the Turkish lira is down about 20 percent since the end of 2012. The Turkish stock market has lost a third of its value in lira since last spring.
Turkey's problems are not entirely economic. The government, which is in the middle of a corruption investigation that forced three ministers to resign and seemed to be pointing at the prime minister, decided to replace the police who were investigating it. Much of the country's growth has come from construction in Istanbul, and the investigation relates to possible bribes to change zoning rules.
The widespread worry about emerging markets -- investors are also nervous about Brazil, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia, to name a few -- can in some ways be traced to the fact that they did remarkably well during the credit crisis that began in 2008. Many of them had hefty foreign currency reserves, and their growth attracted foreign investment.
That investment helped to push up local asset prices, which intensified the boom and brought in more capital. Eventually, money flowed in from investors chasing performance, a sort of "What goes up must keep going up" attitude. The currencies appreciated, and countries began to buy more things from abroad while their industries were losing competitiveness. Current-account deficits began to soar, but that did not immediately matter because the capital was still coming in.
When the cycle turns, as it eventually must, investors who were clamoring to invest can suddenly demand to get out. How much a country is hurt may depend on what form that capital infusion took. Foreign direct investment, like building plants or buying local companies, cannot be quickly or easily reversed. But bank loans can fade away, and those who bought stocks on the local market can sell quickly. The worst problem can come from short-term debt to foreigners, who can get cold feet at the worst possible time.
That is why capital controls can make sense when times are good. Countries that have easy access to loans may be better off not taking them.
Morgan Stanley, which has been among the most bearish on emerging markets in recent months, looked at a variety of indicators this week and concluded that the most exposed countries were Brazil, South Africa, Ukraine and Turkey. It pointed out that a third of Turkey's external debt was short term and that the country's foreign exchange reserves were smaller than the amount of its short-term external debt.
Emerging markets swooned last spring after the Federal Reserve began to talk about pulling back on its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. The fear was that money would flow out of emerging markets as United States interest rates rose. They got over that when it became clear that scaling back was not going to immediately have a huge effect on markets.
But that plunge, even though many markets recovered, seems to have reminded investors that they needed to focus on market fundamentals and structural issues. And some countries appeared worse than others.
David A. Rosenberg, the chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, a Canadian research firm, looked at six indicators -- large current-account deficits, large capital inflows from 2010 to 2012, relatively high levels of fixed investment, slowing economic growth, rising inflation and weak productivity growth.
He found eight countries that he considered vulnerable on at least four of those measures: Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Thailand, Taiwan, Russia and Malaysia.
What, he asked, happened to all that capital that poured in? "One can reasonably draw the conclusion that, as we have seen time and again, the foreign capital inflow was squandered either on conspicuous consumption or noncompetitive investments," he wrote.
The last big crisis in the developing world was in Asia in the late 1990s. This one does not seem similar, simply because the lesson most countries learned was that fixed exchange rates were extremely dangerous. (Someone should have told Europe, which was then ramping up for the creation of the euro.)
Now currencies are generally allowed to float, and most of the countries viewed as vulnerable have experienced substantial currency depreciation, which will help their exporters grow more competitive. In 1998 and 1999, some countries lost huge sums trying to defend their currencies, which eventually crashed. Such sudden losses seem less likely now, although some countries have tried to slow the depreciation of their currencies.
The world leader in wasted investment is probably China, the home of easy credit in recent years -- credit that was often hidden from official statistics. That country has enough foreign exchange to weather a lot of write-offs, but if it does get into severe difficulties -- something that has been predicted for years by some bearish investors -- that could have significant consequences. Morgan Stanley now figures that countries that export a lot to China are more vulnerable than those that do not.
Morgan Stanley warns of a possible "suddEM stop" for one or more economies, a play on the abbreviation for emerging markets. But even if you are sure that is going to happen, forecasting the timing is far from easy.
Early in 1994, Rudi Dornbusch, an M.I.T. economist, wrote a prescient paper arguing that the Mexican peso would have to be substantially devalued. But the peso held its own until December, only to lose a quarter of its value in a few days. "The crisis takes a much longer time coming than you think," he later said, "and then it happens much faster than you would have thought, and that's sort of exactly the Mexican story. It took forever and then it took a night."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- In its final major decision under the leadership of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it would continue to slowly dismantle its stimulus campaign, citing "growing underlying strength in the broader economy."
The Fed's policy-making committee voted unanimously to pare monthly bond purchases by another $10 billion -- its first unanimous vote since 2011 -- despite lingering concerns about the health of the United States economy and growing signs that the Fed's retreat is causing problems in emerging markets including Turkey.
The decision reflected the optimism of Fed officials that the domestic economy is finally poised for faster growth after years of false starts and setbacks. It allows Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman since 2006, who once hoped to oversee the end of the stimulus campaign, to step down Friday having at least directed the first steps.
Looking ahead, Mr. Bernanke also leaves a clear road map pointing toward an end of the Fed's bond purchases in October or December. His successor, Janet L. Yellen, has supported that plan as the Fed's vice chairwoman. She is likely to give the first indication of her own views when she testifies before Congress next month.
Stock indexes fell Wednesday as the Fed's retreat rippled through global markets, driving money toward less risky investments like Treasury securities. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1 percent to close at 1,774.20, while the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit a two-month high.
The Fed's retreat is producing a global shift in investment patterns as investors who chased higher returns in foreign markets are beginning to anticipate the return of higher interest rates in the United States. That is causing problems in countries like Turkey that depend heavily on foreign investment.
In Turkey, the central bank tried to bolster that nation's currency Tuesday by sharply raising the benchmark rate, but the Turkish lira and other currencies of emerging markets -- including that of South Africa, which also raised interest rates -- continued to slump Wednesday.
Fed officials, focused on the health of the American economy, are unlikely to adjust policy in response to the foreign turmoil unless they see stronger evidence that it is a threat to the domestic economy.
"In the end of the day, we live in a modern, global financial system and this is, I think, just part of the world that we live in, in terms of monetary policy in the United States having effects outside the United States," John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said recently at the Brookings Institution.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making body, made no mention of emerging markets in its statement Wednesday.
"The clear Fed default position is that tapering will continue," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "It would take serious U.S. weakness or a real emerging market disaster to make the F.O.M.C. pause."
Indeed, the turmoil may make it easier for the Fed to retreat. Investors seeking to limit their risks are bidding up the price of Treasury bonds, counteracting the effect of the Fed's gradual reduction in the volume of its own purchases. Problems in Turkey, in other words, help to hold down interest rates in Omaha.
Some investors, and Fed officials, also view the turbulence as the unavoidable price of a necessary reduction in the central bank's role in financial markets -- particularly in the bond purchases, which are known collectively as quantitative easing.
"We applaud the continuing removal of QE -- even in the face of weaker economic data and higher market volatility," wrote Rick Rieder, a fixed-income investment manager at BlackRock. "We believe the program has outlived its usefulness."
The Fed expanded its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion each month in 2013 in an effort to spur job creation and drive down unemployment. In December the Fed announced that it would cut the volume to $75 billion in January. It said Wednesday that it would further reduce the volume of purchases to $65 billion in February: $30 billion of mortgage bonds, $35 billion of Treasuries. It also said it was "likely" to continue the retreat, setting the table for another $10 billion cut at the next meeting of the Fed's policy committee in March.
The Fed did not change its guidance that it intends to keep short-term interest rates near zero "well past the time" that the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The unemployment rate was 6.7 percent in December.
The question of what to say next about interest rates -- rather than how quickly to taper bond buying -- is likely to be the first significant challenge of Ms. Yellen's tenure.
"It will take a pretty big data surprise to knock the Fed off its course of a $10 billion per meeting reduction in asset purchases," Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote Wednesday. "This should make Yellen's job a little easier -- if we don't get any big data surprises -- but still leaves open the question of how forward guidance will evolve as unemployment continues to move lower."
Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have expressed growing optimism about the economic outlook for 2014, citing the combination of a strengthening private sector and the absence of fresh cuts in government spending.
Wednesday's statement said that growth "picked up in recent quarters," citing strength in household spending and business investment.
The government's initial estimate of lower-than-expected job growth in December, released in early January, did not appear to shift the views of Fed officials. Analysts expect figures to show that the American economy grew at a relatively strong annualized rate of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter; the figures are set to be released on Thursday.
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said this month that in conversations with business executives he was hearing "a better mood than I've heard before."
He added: "Another thing I'm hearing is that the fourth quarter was pretty good; December was stronger than people expected."
Despite the signs of an improving American economy, though, investors remain on edge about prospects here and in the rest of the world. The Dow Jones industrial average fell an even greater amount than the S.&P. 500, down 189.77 points, or 1.2 percent, to 15,738.79. The Nasdaq composite dropped 46.53 points, or 1.1 percent, to 4,051.43.
In the bond market, interest rates fell. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 2.68 percent, from 2.75 percent late Tuesday, while its price rose 21/32, to 100 20/32.
On Thursday, Asian stock markets also declined, with the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo falling about 3 percent in early trading.
The Fed also said Wednesday that it would expand an experimental program intended to help the central bank control the risk of inflation if the economy begins to grow more quickly. The Fed has authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to strike deals with banks called reverse repurchase agreements, which are intended to tie up money that might otherwise be used for loans. The authority was extended through 2014, and the per-deal maximum was increased to $5 billion.
It was a quiet end for Mr. Bernanke, who after failing to foresee the financial crisis led the Fed's widely praised efforts to contain the damage, and then its more tentative campaign to help restore the flow of economic activity.
The Fed did not observe the occasion publicly. It is likely that Mr. Bernanke's colleagues paid tribute during the meeting, but the Fed will not release a transcript for five years.
The praise that Fed officials lavished on his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, upon his retirement in 2006, was not disclosed until 2011. By then, of course, Mr. Greenspan's legacy had come to be seen in a very different light.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- Piles of unsold coal line rural roads in north-central China. Some iron ore mines near Beijing are operating at a fraction of capacity. Chinese farm products are even increasingly scorned by the Chinese consumer.
While China remains nearly self-sufficient in all these categories, it is importing more from other emerging markets. Economists and investors around the world have been fretting in recent days about the effects on smaller emerging markets if China's economic slowdown worsens. Those concerns have driven down share prices and currencies from Jakarta to Istanbul to Buenos Aires, although emerging markets staged a partial recovery on Wednesday. They helped to prod the central banks of Turkey and India to raise benchmark interest rates unexpectedly on Tuesday.
Yet the most vulnerable producers these days may not be the coal mines in Indonesia, palm oil plantations in Malaysia or soybean farms in Brazil, but the farms and particularly the mines in China itself.
China's role as the largest buyer of a long list of commodities, from iron ore to palm oil, means that emerging markets are heavily exposed to any economic slowdown. But their ability to capture ever-larger shares of the Chinese market at the expense of China's commodity producers has limited at least somewhat the exposure of emerging markets.
China's steadily strengthening renminbi, persistent inflation and soaring blue-collar wages have combined to erase much or all of the cost advantage of domestic production for a long list of commodities. At the same time, tightened pollution regulations have made it harder for steel mills to use China's low-grade iron ore reserves or for power plants to burn China's low-quality coal.
"With the increasing focus on the environment and high costs in some industries in China, China seems to be importing more of the key commodities they need," said Bruce Diesen, an analyst at the Oslo-based investment bank Carnegie.
Another profound change in Chinese society is also having an impact. Hundreds of millions of Chinese are eating more meat and drinking more milk. The extra animal feed, as well as chicken, beef and dairy products, for that shift is coming increasingly from farms as distant as Uruguay and Argentina. Chinese farms have grown uncompetitive because they tend to be small and inefficient and have a reputation for contaminated food.
Charter rates for bulk freighters, often a good leading indicator of China's commodity imports, have stayed strong. The shipping industry is betting that even when long-distance freight charges are included, new mines opening in Brazil and Australia will outcompete mines in China.
"That new capacity will probably squeeze out more expensive domestic capacity for iron ore and coal," said Timothy Huxley, chief executive of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport Holdings, a Hong Kong shipping company.
Emerging markets face many more pressures right now than the strength of China's demand for commodities. A gradual tapering in the pace of monetary stimulus by the United States Federal Reserve, where policy makers were concluding a two-day meeting on Wednesday, has sent interest rates drifting higher in America, drawing in investment dollars that might have previously gone to Bangkok or Rio de Janeiro.
Rising exports to China by emerging markets also mean that if a downturn in China is severe enough, emerging market exporters will be affected along with Chinese producers. China could also adopt a variety of measures to keep out imports during a downturn, like providing government subsidies to domestic producers -- although many of these possible steps would violate China's commitments to the World Trade Organization.
Many emerging markets, including India, have fought losing battles with inflation for years and are now struggling to maintain the value of their currencies. After announcing this month a two-year plan to slow inflation in consumer prices, the Reserve Bank of India announced on Tuesday that it was pushing up its benchmark short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.
Raghuram G. Rajan, the central bank's governor, acted even though his country's manufacturing sector, heavily dependent on borrowing and sensitive to any increase in rates, is already slowing. "It is only by bringing down inflation to a low and stable level that monetary policy can contribute to reviving consumption and investment in a sustainable way," he said in a statement.
The Turkish central bank raised its benchmark interest rate a surprisingly steep 4.25 percentage points on Tuesday in an attempt to defend the nation's currency.
If China's economy slows further in the coming months, that would not just hurt demand and world prices for raw materials. It would also reduce demand and prices for a range of industrial materials, like steel, produced in many emerging markets.
An HSBC survey last week found considerable gloom among many Chinese manufacturers, and an updated survey early Thursday confirmed that the industry was beginning to contract. Some wholesalers and retailers in China say that they also see signs of weakness in the crucial shopping period ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations beginning on Friday. The period is nearly as important for Chinese retailers as Christmas is for many Western retailers.
"Business this month is down 20 percent over the previous few months. I don't really know why, but people's desire for spending is just not there," said Michael Liu, a wholesaler of photo frames, bangles and other crafts in Guangzhou.
Yet the prospects for emerging markets are not entirely grim. Many economists have focused on slowing growth in the value of Chinese imports, and warned about troubles in emerging markets. That partly reflects that commodity prices have been falling. But the tonnage of Chinese commodity imports has kept rising. In December, China's imports were up only 4.3 percent in dollar terms compared with a year earlier. But they were up nearly twice as much, 7.8 percent, in terms of tonnage, according to China's General Administration of Customs.
The rising tonnage of imports has been hurting domestic production. China's coal imports have doubled in the last three years, even as many new open-pit mines have begun production in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. That is causing considerable hardship and closings at underground coal mines in traditional mining provinces like Shanxi and Shaanxi, just as many underground coal mines closed in Wales and Appalachia in the 1970s and 1980s when they could not compete with open-pit mines in emerging markets or Montana.
The iron ore industry in Hebei Province, near Beijing, has also been struggling as growth in steel production has stalled even as iron ore imports pour in from South Africa, Iran, Brazil and Australia.
Chinese statistics show that annual growth in the mined tonnage of iron ore slowed to 6 percent last year after hovering around 20 percent for a decade. Even the modest increase last year overstates the actual increase in iron extracted, because China is having to shift to lower-grade ore reserves as high-grade reserves are exhausted.
"You're moving more dirt to get the same amount of useful product," said Ephrem Ravi, the head of Asian metals research at Barclays.
The weakening value of iron ore production, together with low prices and costly pollution controls in the steel sector, is affecting the entire economy in Hebei.
"Business has not been good during the past few months, it is down 20 percent compared to the same period a year ago," said Yi Jinwei, marketing manager of a construction materials wholesaler in Handan City. "The economy is just not what it used to be."

Abstract: In "Freedom From Fear," his history of the United States through the Great Depression and World War II, David Kennedy notes that fears that what Keynes called "technological unemployment" might become a permanent feature of the labor market, especially among the less skilled and the elderly, date back to the administration of President Herbert Hoover. The bipartisan cooperation that would be needed to start a jobs program of the scale of what was tried during the New Deal -- not to mention the World War II production explosion that finally ended the Depression -- is out of the question today.

Full text:   We look back upon the Great Depression as a discrete event with a beginning and an end; a long and profound economic shock but one that turned out to be nonetheless temporary. In the 1930s, however, many feared that what John Maynard Keynes clinically called "equilibrium at less than full employment" might, in fact, be the new normal -- forever.
There is a lesson here for us, somewhere. In hindsight, the Depression suggests our era will, too, eventually emerge from its economic morass. Yet we should hardly let optimism carry us away.
Despite timid buds of growth, profusely irrigated with money by the Federal Reserve, we could be in for a much more enduring stagnation than our leaders in Washington are willing to concede.
As he delivered his fifth State of the Union address, President Obama, not unlike President Franklin D. Roosevelt early in his second term, seemed to have given up far too early in the game on trying to stimulate the recovery.
In "Freedom From Fear," his history of the United States through the Great Depression and World War II, David Kennedy notes that fears that what Keynes called "technological unemployment" might become a permanent feature of the labor market, especially among the less skilled and the elderly, date back to the administration of President Herbert Hoover.
He quotes Lorena Hickok, a former reporter for The Associated Press who joined the Roosevelt administration in 1933 to work on the New Deal: "The majority of those over 45 probably will NEVER get their jobs back," she said.
Her boss, Harry Hopkins, agreed: Given "improvements in management and technology," private businesses might never be able to absorb all able-bodied workers.
Indeed, the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, which created the Works Progress Administration that funneled over $13 billion into public jobs (the equivalent of about $218 billion today) and employed 8.5 million people over eight years, was hardly meant to be just "emergency relief" for the job market, Mr. Kennedy wrote. Rather, it aimed to relieve a potentially permanent shortcoming.
The job market is not in as bad a shape as it was at the depths of the downturn in the 1930s. The standard measure of unemployment stands at 6.7 percent rather than over 20 percent. Still, by any reading of the statistics, the economic emergency set off by the implosion of the housing bubble is far from over.
Broader measures of joblessness paint a bleak picture. As Lawrence Summers, President Obama's former top economic adviser, noted in a speech at the International Monetary Fund in November, "the share of men or women or adults in the United States who are working today is essentially the same as it was four years ago."
Today, the American economy is still roughly 8 percent smaller than it would be if it had followed the path the Congressional Budget Office forecast in August 2007. That's a gap of $1.5 trillion, or almost $5,000 for every person in the country.
The failure to rebound has revived the old, recurring fear: Is stagnation inevitable? Has the economy -- has the job market -- become stuck for good?
For all the political back-and-forth over these questions, calls for more radical moves to revive the economy have largely vanished from the policy debate.
The Obama administration's boldest propositions are sensible, from raising the minimum wage to $10.10 to extending emergency unemployment insurance. But they are not quite on the scale of a trillion dollars' worth of lost gross domestic product.
This is not just the president's doing. The bipartisan cooperation that would be needed to start a jobs program of the scale of what was tried during the New Deal -- not to mention the World War II production explosion that finally ended the Depression -- is out of the question today.
Perhaps more important, however, is that even among Democrats there remains little appetite for the kind of aggressive government action that was popular in F.D.R.'s day.
The fear, however, seems overdone.
Many economists go pale at the thought of a mass program of public jobs to combat unemployment. They envision a bungling bureaucracy choosing investments, hiring workers and firing them. Even if the right investments could be identified, they fear the new jobs would demand skills the unemployed simply do not have.
The aversion is anchored in history. In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter ran into trouble trying to increase jobs with the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.
Even as voters expressed skepticism of "fake" jobs, public employee unions demanded that the cheaper CETA workers not compete for tasks performed by government employees. Politically vulnerable to exposés of petty corruption, the program was killed as soon as Ronald Reagan came to office.
Though the program employed 750,000 workers at its peak in 1978, it was perceived largely as a failure.
The experience of the 1970s hardly settles the debate, however. Recent precedent with other forms of public job promotion is not all bad. Thirty-nine states used $1.3 billion from the fiscal stimulus package passed in 2009 to create more than 260,000 jobs by subsidizing private employers.
A subsequent evaluation of the program found that two-thirds of these jobs would not have existed without the subsidy. Many of those jobs went to people who were difficult to employ, including workers who had been jobless for a long time, people on welfare and workers with criminal records. Yet after the program ended in September 2010, 37 percent of the formerly subsidized workers kept their jobs.
Our experience, moreover, has taught us specific rules of thumb for governments searching to increase employment.
"It works best if you hire people that would not otherwise be hired, to do something productive that is not already being done by somebody else," said Lawrence Katz of Harvard, formerly chief labor economist in the Clinton administration. "Long overdue infrastructure investments would be a good place to start, coupled with funding for positions cleaning parks and the like, which could help disadvantaged workers like the long-term unemployed."
Not every unemployed worker may be qualified to build infrastructure. But many might. Today, there are 1.5 million fewer jobs in construction than there were before the financial crisis six years ago. Plenty of unemployed workers out there know how to build things.
There is a fair chance that the private sector, left to its own devices, will never hire them.
Mr. Summers proposed a list of factors that could be holding the economy back. A slowdown in the expansion of the labor force and weaker productivity growth might be restraining investment, he suggested. The concentration of income among the very richest could be curbing consumer spending.
Importantly, he has noted that the forces restraining growth preceded the crisis. "Even a great bubble wasn't enough to produce any excess in aggregate demand," Mr. Summers said in his November speech. Whatever is wrong with the United States economy has been wrong for a while.
There are potentially great benefits to government investments in public works at a time like this. The legacy of the Works Progress Administration of the 1930s included half a million miles of highways, 100,000 bridges and as many public buildings. It includes the Dock Street Theater in Charleston, S.C., and the Timberline Lodge on the slopes of Mount Hood in Oregon.
And it would not even be very expensive. With the borrowing costs of the federal government below the rate of inflation, investments would actually help reduce the nation's debt burden. Lenders are, in effect, paying the government to borrow money.
Perhaps the best argument for government investment to increase jobs and raise demand is that the alternatives seem much worse.
Our current path -- set by the Federal Reserve's huge stimulus to encourage lending -- seems dangerously similar to the wanton credit expansion that led to the crisis of a few years ago. Trusting it any further appears foolhardy.
It would be better to rely on fiscal policy, but the path favored by many Republicans in the House seems even worse. To slash government spending and let the economy run its bedraggled course would probably transform our economic emergency from a painful though temporary setback into a permanent feature called stagnation.
And yet this is essentially the policy the nation is following.

Abstract: Q. Did you agree with the decision to issue stronger forward guidance -- to tell investors the Fed intends to keep short-term interest rates near zero "well past the time" that the unemployment rate falls below the Fed's current threshold of 6.5 percent? A. If you think of somebody like me sitting at that table, the principal desire I had was to see us reduce the rate of accumulation of these [asset purchases], and if you think in terms of what you wanted to get out of the meeting versus what you had to pay for it, in my own little mind, for me, that was a cost that I was willing to pay in order to get a reduction in the rate of asset purchases.

Full text:   As the voting membership of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, turns over at a meeting this week, one of the new votes will be cast by Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
In pressing for a faster retreat from the Fed's bond-buying effort to stimulate the economy, he represents one extreme in a debate that will test the ability of the incoming chief, Janet L. Yellen, to unite the committee after she succeeds the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
Mr. Fisher sat for an interview this month to discuss monetary policy and the economy before the media blackout that precedes each Fed meeting -- as did another new voter, Narayana Kocherlakota of the Minneapolis Fed, who backs continued stimulus.
A transcript of the interview with Mr. Fisher, edited for clarity, follows.
Q.
You said after the Federal Reserve's December decision to reduce its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion that the reduction should have been twice as large. Would you like to see a $20 billion cut at the Fed's January meeting?
A.
I was pleased with the decision at the December meeting. It was a move in the right direction. I think that's the key. The economy is doing better and the benefits that we get from [asset purchases], relative to the costs, are diminishing. I was not unhappy. It was the change in direction that was important.
Q.
And in January? What would you do if you were in charge?
A.
If I were put in charge, I would abdicate immediately. I would worry for the nation.
But I think it's a matter of feel. I think there's an enormous amount of excess reserves, that the amount has never been this high in history, and basically I think the gas tank is full. The issue is, when will businesses step on the accelerator and use that gas to propel the economy forward? They are starting to do so at a greater speed. They are still being held back, but not because they don't have sufficient fuel.
Having gone down this path, which I believe was not necessary, of adding these last few gallons in the tank, and if you're going to withdraw that stimulus, how do you do so without creating market havoc? I think you have to go meeting by meeting but my desire as soon as is practicable is to get down to zero. In my view the minimum I would want to see would be $10 billion a meeting, but that would be a minimum.
Herb Kelleher [chairman emeritus of Southwest Airlines and the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas] is the single largest consumer of Wild Turkey bourbon in the world, and we were talking and we agreed that you can't go from Wild Turkey to cold turkey overnight. You can get tremors if you just cut it off entirely. I think we need to be cautious but we need to proceed in this direction.
Q.
Did you agree with the decision to issue stronger forward guidance -- to tell investors the Fed intends to keep short-term interest rates near zero "well past the time" that the unemployment rate falls below the Fed's current threshold of 6.5 percent?
A.
If you think of somebody like me sitting at that table, the principal desire I had was to see us reduce the rate of accumulation of these [asset purchases], and if you think in terms of what you wanted to get out of the meeting versus what you had to pay for it, in my own little mind, for me, that was a cost that I was willing to pay in order to get a reduction in the rate of asset purchases. Some people were advocating that we might move the threshold. We did not, so I was happy with that.
Q.
You have highlighted the decline in the unemployment rate as evidence that the economy is gaining strength. But a lot of the drop has happened because people are dropping out of the work force.
A.
We're close to 6.5 percent; I'm happy with that. I'm not happy with the fact that we have so many people that have dropped out of the work force but there's a limit to which monetary policy can have an impact there. I'm of the firm belief that monetary policy can only impact cyclical unemployment, which is a very important point. Whatever mismatches we have because of people that have dropped out of the work force, we cannot affect structural unemployment.
What I worry most about is that everybody is looking to the central bank of the United States to solve their problems. We get things done and we do so with comity, not comedy. There's none of the kind of angst that Congress creates. But because we work smoothly under Ben's leadership, and I believe we'll continue to do so under Janet's, I'm deeply worried that it will become commonplace to believe that the Fed will solve your problems. It can't.
Q.
Surely some part of the decline in labor force participation is cyclical? We've seen, for example, little recovery in the rate of employment among men ages 25 to 54.
A.
This crude number that we have of unemployment is a crude thing, but after listening to all the discussion we've had around that table, about gradations or submeasurements, I've concluded that the best we can do in terms of looking at a marker is the unemployment rate.
Q.
You make a point of talking with a long list of chief executives about the health of the economy. What are you hearing lately?
A.
What I'm hearing is a better mood than I've heard before. If I could summarize what I've heard, the mentality that still prevails is the drive to increase the productivity of their work forces and also to drive down the costs of operating their businesses. Another thing I'm hearing is that the fourth quarter was pretty good; December was stronger than people expected. And the third thing I'm hearing is that they would like clarity about taxes and federal spending and regulation -- particularly the health care initiative. I hear an enormous disdain for the current administration and for the Congress. I haven't heard in over a year plus that they need cheaper money or more access to money. There's not one business leader, woman or man, large or small, public or private that says we need more monetary accommodation.
Q.
Some of your colleagues say they see no evidence of the kind of overheating in financial markets that could threaten the stability of the financial system. You disagree. Why are people looking at the same markets and drawing such different conclusions?
A.
Fischer Black used to say that things look much more efficient on the banks of the Charles than they do on the banks of the Hudson. My background is different. I came out of the markets. I'm proud that I'm not an economist. I bring a different perspective and I think that perspective is important here. There's a lot of money out there chasing few good companies. There's too much money out there. The weak operators are priced beyond their value. Over time, something has to give.
Q.
You are notable among critics of the Fed's stimulus campaign for having avoided any warnings about the risk of short-term inflation.
A.
I have not been worried about short-term inflation. What I am worried about is, what do we do when we see a pickup in the velocity of money? I want to make sure that it is not a problem long term.
Q.
You had a memorable line in a recent speech describing your concern that the Fed's enormous balance sheet would make it harder to keep inflation under control: "The eye of the needle of pulling off a clean exit is narrow; the camel is already too fat." Do you doubt that the Fed has the necessary tools?
A.
Our New York desk is first-rate. The talent pool, the capacity to execute, no problem. It's really a question of whether we'll be conscious of -- and when I say we, there are a lot of people that won't be there going forward -- the question is whether future policy makers will be cowed by potential criticism.
Q.
You dissented twice during your last turn as a voting member of the F.O.M.C. in 2011. How do you decide when to disagree publicly?
A.
When I was asked to take this job, I went to see Alan Greenspan and I said, 'Now that I'm in the inner sanctum, what do you require?' And he said, 'Just speak the truth, Richard.' And that's exactly what I do.
The last thing I do before I dissent is I pray. I admire my colleagues so much, but when you are feeling that you can't support what is proffered. ... You don't do it easily. I've never done it to be a pain. You do it to disagree. And I always say a little prayer before I cast my vote. This is a solemn responsibility.
Q.
What do you pray for?
A.
To help me make the right decision. And to be fair-minded.
Q.
I've heard other F.O.M.C. participants say that they would only dissent as a means of influencing the debate -- that is, they see dissent as a tool, not a matter of principle.
A.
I think it's a little bit of both. You want to condition things to the degree that you can. But you'd have to be vainglorious to think that your dissent is going to have to become the subject of intense interest. There's no one who's vainglorious at that table. But it also is a question of how many dissents there are. I think every Fed chairman needs to remember that Paul Volcker was voted down by his committee, and Paul Volcker is the Moses of central banking.
Q.
Do you think that you have been influential in shaping the course of policy?
A.
I speak my mind and I'm encouraged to do so and that's gratifying enough.
Q.
You will turn 65 this year, the mandatory retirement age. ...
A.
Some people expect me to resign by midyear. No way! I'm very happy with the fact that I get along with my colleagues. Sometimes I win the arguments and sometimes I don't. This is a very refined game that we're involved in and I feel that I've had an influence to a degree and I'm comfortable. Absolutely. Why wouldn't I be? It's the greatest privilege in the world to be in this group. I've done a lot of things in my lifetime, I've served in two administrations. I've never had a job that was as fulfilling as this one. And then the last thing you need to understand is that I do run a bank. The presidents of the regional reserve banks operate businesses. That's my background and I love it. We run a big vault operation and two-thirds of U.S. currency is printed in Fort Worth, Texas, and we run the vaults and big cash operation. I like that business side of what I do. It's not just the F.O.M.C., and particularly in my case, I love the business of running a central bank division, which is the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. People forget that. I love both aspects.
Q.
We've talked about your disagreements with Ben Bernanke. Assess his legacy.
A.
The thing I admire most about Ben Bernanke, and I think Janet will be the same, is that he really goes all the way around the table, not just with the voters, he lets everyone speak however long they wish to, and he listens and respects whatever he hears at the table. When I contact him, he gets back to me in minutes. Unless he's there -- then he picks up the phone. He is a good captain.
Whether you are for QE3 or not, the issue here is, when the peanut butter hit the fan, who stepped up to the plate? Bernanke had just taken the job. He did know a great deal about the Depression, but he had to step up and take command when everything else was dysfunctional in the U.S. government. He led all of us. We had intense meeting after meeting -- how do you deal with this implosion of the financial system and the threat of the destruction of the global economy? The way he handled the crisis was brilliant. If you come from academia, to understand market operations and to learn as quickly as he did, I just admire the way that he was able to grip all of this.
Another aspect of Ben that I find remarkable: In a town where everybody is power-crazy, he has retained his humility. I will give you a specific example -- my wife was a trustee of Blair House, and they have receptions over there and my wife couldn't be with us one evening and they asked if I could take Anna, Bernanke's wife, as my date. She had never seen Blair House before. And at the end a giant limousine pulls up and another trustee asked Anna if she would like a ride home and she says, 'I took the Metro to get here and I'll take the Metro to get back.' This is the most powerful economic policy maker in the world and his wife travels by Metro! That's why I love these people. They have not let their heads be turned. He's an example of the way that public servants conduct themselves. Time will, of course, judge whether we went too far or didn't do enough or whatever it may be. But the fact that he has kept his humility -- I admire him enormously.
Q.
What changes do you expect under Janet Yellen?
A.
The economy is in a different place. To the extent that we're shifting gears here, that's where you'll see the change. It's really because of the different circumstances.
I think there's a little too much discussion of whatever personal biases she brings to the table. This is not Janet Yellen now. This is the chairman of the Fed. Everybody looks at her and says this is the way that things are going to go. It doesn't work like that. She's now a leader who has to bring consensus to the table. I personally think she'll do it very well.
Q.
A growing share of your colleagues on the F.O.M.C. are former academics and career public servants. You are unusual in having significant experience in the financial industry. Does that trend concern you?
A.
I worry about it a little bit. I'd certainly like to see some bankers on the Board of Governors and right now we don't have one. And amongst the presidents, the only two that were bankers are me and Dennis Lockhart [the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta]. I think you need to have a mix. We are increasingly preoccupied with market stability and how markets operate. As we unwind what we have created here, however long it takes, whatever the pace is, we have to be market-sensitive. It's helpful to have people understand how market operators and bankers think. We've got to have some of those at the table.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Whatever President Obama has accomplished, he has made little headway on the goal he values most: government action to lift long-term economic prospects for average Americans.
Mr. Obama calls it "make or break," "the defining issue of our time" and his personal measure of success in the White House. But his State of the Union address on Tuesday, which is sure to highlight once again the challenges facing the middle class and the poor, could underscore his inability so far to convert talk into the taxpayer-financed investments that he and other Democrats believe can make the biggest difference. Congress has shunned a $75 billion plan to expand early childhood education that Mr. Obama proposed in last year's State of the Union, and the infrastructure bank he has pushed for four years.
As aides draft their 2015 budget plan, their 2014 version shows this bottom line for Mr. Obama's sixth year in office: Government investments in infrastructure, research and development, and education and training, at 3.3 percent of the nation's economy, match the level from President George W. Bush's sixth year in office.
That reflects the impact of the economic emergency that consumed the opening of Mr. Obama's presidency and the effectiveness of congressional Republicans who don't share Democrats' confidence in government. In an era dominated by concern over deficits, Republicans have largely controlled the debate, even as Democrats have won four of the last six presidential elections.
President Bill Clinton, too, saw public investment in areas like education and transportation as critical to lifting the stagnation in middle-class living standards that began in the 1970s. Adjusted for inflation, the $283 billion in federal investments in 2000, Mr. Clinton's last full year in office, was $6 billion lower than it was in the last year of his predecessor, President George H.W. Bush.
"It has not been possible to significantly shift the needle," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who headed Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "We should be raising those levels, and we're not.
"I guess the good news," Ms. Tyson added, "is that the share hasn't been plummeting."
Over the last half-century, though, it has plummeted. Spending on what the federal government classifies as investments peaked in 1968 at 6.6 percent of the economy, twice the current proportion.
Mr. Obama's greatest success came during the recession and financial crisis in 2009. The two-year stimulus law included more than $125 billion for education and job training, $68 billion for energy projects, $48 billion for transportation and $22 billion for science and research. Some of that money has been used to spur larger investments by state and local governments and private businesses.
The administration can point to other major policies it believes have put ordinary Americans on sounder financial footing, now and in the future. The 2010 Wall Street regulation law includes new consumer protections. The Education Department's Race to the Top program has awarded $4 billion to 19 states to upgrade elementary and secondary schools.
The Affordable Care Act includes about $940 billion in spending over 10 years to expand health insurance coverage. So long as the recent moderation in health care costs persists, White House aides contend, the law will increase the ability of businesses to raise wages.
"From the vantage point of income inequality and ensuring economic mobility, providing health care access is a pretty significant thing," said Neera Tanden, a former Obama administration official who now directs the left-leaning Center for American Progress.
Yet that is not the answer to global economic pressures that have sapped the earning power of American workers. The two parties disagree sharply on what is an effective answer.
Republicans lean more heavily on individual initiative and the private market, Mr. Obama and Democrats on government's role in upgrading "human capital" as well as the physical kind. But since the Tea Party sweep of 2010, Democrats have faced mainly frustration.
The squeeze on investments in long-run projects reflects a basic truth of modern politics: Lawmakers tend to focus on the near term.
They also find it easier to cut discretionary spending -- the part of the budget containing investments, which Congress approves each year -- than the much larger "entitlement" spending that flows automatically to those who qualify. The biggest entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security, benefit retirees who vote in disproportionate numbers.
Republicans have fought virtually all the president's initiatives. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economic adviser to the younger President Bush, asserts that Mr. Obama might have won compromises on investments in areas like infrastructure had he shown a greater commitment to change government.
Some Democrats question the president's earlier priorities. Overhauling the health care system "was a worthy goal," Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a speech last week, but it was not the foremost concern of Americans facing declining incomes.
Still, Mr. Schumer sees the recent bipartisan budget deal -- though it merely restored domestic spending levels to those of the Bush era -- as an important signal of change. Others include falling budget deficits and a change of tone in Congress, where Republicans with national ambitions, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, are increasingly talking about helping the poor.
"We've been playing on a Reagan playing field -- a cut-government, shrink-programs field -- since 1981," Mr. Schumer said in an interview. "It's all turning around now."
If he is right, the president has three years left to capitalize. Neither Mr. Obama nor his aides evince much confidence.
The White House is increasingly depending on the president's executive authority and on seeking agreements outside the government. For example, Mr. Obama has used existing funds to start manufacturing innovation centers and pressed colleges to help vulnerable students. He plans to encourage states to raise minimum wages, major businesses to expand job training, and private backers to finance early childhood education if Congress will not.
No one knows if Mr. Obama can succeed with those alternate routes to expanding economic opportunity. Budget pressures, though easing now, will only grow in the next decade as more baby boomers move onto Social Security and Medicare rolls.
"If you score him by intent and things he has proposed, he'd get pretty good marks," said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. "If you were grading him on results, which is what matters to the next generation, he would get a much poorer grade."

Full text:   Nearly 50 years ago, federal law created a lower minimum wage for workers who receive tips. Congress decreed that it could not be less than 50 percent of the federal minimum wage.
But when the minimum wage inched up -- raised to $5.25 in 1996 under President Clinton -- Congress agreed, in a concession to the restaurant industry, to let the 50 percent rule on tip wages lapse.
Currently under federal law, restaurant owners are required to pay a minimum of $2.13 an hour toward a waiter's wages as long as customers' tips lift the waiter's pay to the $7.25 federal minimum wage. (If tips are too small to reach the minimum wage, then the restaurant is required to top off the waiter's pay.)
Nineteen states use the federal $2.13 tip wage, while 24 states have set a subminimum tip wage above that. Seven other states, most of them in the West, require waiters' base pay to be at least the state minimum wage. In Washington State, with the nation's highest state minimum wage, that means a waiter's base wage, before tips, is $9.32 an hour.
And now, as some Democratic senators and President Obama push to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, from $7.25, they are also backing increases to the tip wage (at $2.13, it is 29 percent of the minimum wage). Once again, the restaurant industry is fiercely opposed to a mandated increase.
Pointing to studies showing that many waiters live below the poverty line, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, argues that it is unfair that restaurant owners pay so little toward wages.
Advocates for restaurant workers protest that waiters' pay has remained flat for years. The tip wage alone has gone unchanged since 1991: Taking inflation into account, the $2.13 enacted back then is worth $1.24 today.
But the National Restaurant Association, which has played a pivotal role in keeping the tip wage unchanged, warns that if the tip wage is raised along with the federal minimum wage, customers will face higher menu prices and fewer waiters to serve them.
Beyond the moves in Congress, labor unions and restaurant worker groups are pushing to raise the tip wage in various cities and states through legislation or ballot initiatives. They are also pressing New York's governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, to use his executive authority to raise his state's tip wage.
"There is a lot of momentum around the country to increase the tip wage," said Saru Jayaraman, co-founder of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, a restaurant workers' group.
Dana Dreher, who works 20 to 40 hours a week as a waitress at a McCormick & Schmick's Seafood and Steaks in St. Louis, says she makes $20,000 a year including tips. "I don't think the tip wage is fair -- it definitely needs to be increased," she said. "There's so much variability in pay."
"Sometimes I have to ask myself, Am I going to pay my rent or my utilities?" said Ms. Dreher, who has a master's degree in social work from Washington University but has been unable to find a job in that field and owes $60,000 in student loans. "Once there was a bad snowstorm and business was really slow, and my pay was really cut. I had to plead with the woman at the utility to give me a few more weeks to pay my electric bill."
There is considerable disagreement about pay levels for waiters. Sylvia Allegretto, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, found that there were 3.3 million tipped workers nationwide, two million of them waiters, and that their median compensation was $9.22 an hour, including tips and tip wage.
"It's extremely variable -- if you're working third shift in a diner in a truck stop in Nebraska versus if you're working at a steakhouse in D.C.," she said, noting that 72 percent of waiters are women.
The National Restaurant Association said median pay was $16 an hour for less experienced waiters and $22 for experienced ones. The association said its wage numbers were based on a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of employers, while Ms. Allegretto's data rely on the bureau's household survey.
Scott DeFife, the restaurant association's executive vice president for government affairs, warns that any wage increases have a cost. "The cost comes from somewhere -- prices might be increased, operations might be cut back, different food choices might be offered, hours of operation might be diminished," he said.
Mr. Harkin's bill, supported by the Obama administration, would increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and raise the tip wage by 95 cents a year until it reached $7.10 an hour. It would then rise annually with inflation.
"The National Restaurant Association claims it can't afford to raise wages, but it says this every time we talk about raising the minimum wage," Mr. Harkin said in a Senate speech in December. Noting that the industry said it would be hurt badly by the 2007 minimum wage increase, which affected kitchen staff, Mr. Harkin said that "did not hurt the industry -- in fact, the industry is doing remarkably well."
Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez, the administration's point man on the minimum wage push, said the tip wage "hasn't been raised for more than two decades despite increases in the cost of living." But given stiff opposition among top Republicans, especially in the House, the chances of an increase passing Congress in a midterm election year are slim.
Rob Green, executive director of the National Council of Chain Restaurants, criticized the push for a $7.10 tip wage. "We don't see it as a very realistic proposal," he said. "They want to increase wages by over three times for restaurant employees who are typically compensated well above minimum wage, when gratuities are included."
Worker advocates say restaurants can easily afford to pay a higher wage, but Mr. DeFife said restaurant profit margins were tight, usually 2 to 4 percent. Mr. Green said they ran 4 to 6 percent.
Tom Boucher, who owns a chain of seven restaurants in New Hampshire including Cactus Jack's and T-Bones, said the proposed $7.10 tip wage "would mean a significant increase in business costs." Noting that each of his restaurants employs about 12 waiters on Saturday nights, he said such a wage increase would reduce that number to 10.
"That would be terrible for customer service," Mr. Boucher said, although some restaurant owners say they would more likely raise menu prices than cut back waiters and hurt table service.
Mr. Boucher said that if he had to pay far more to his tipped workers, "that takes away my ability to give raises to a dishwasher, prep cook or line worker, who may make $12 or $13 an hour as opposed to the servers or bartenders who make $20 an hour."
That's not Karlyn Dozier's story. Ms. Dozier, 34, recently stopped being a waitress at Coyote Blues, a Mexican restaurant in Metairie, La., in favor of making tortillas and overseeing takeout there because that position pays a straight $9 an hour, a dollar or so more than what she averaged as a waitress. She said she worked 28 to 30 hours a week as a waitress and averaged $250 a week in pay.
"It's not really enough for you to live off of," said Ms. Dozier, who has a 4-year-old son and used to be a waitress at Red Lobster. "I'm forced to live with my mother because I'm not making enough to live on my own. A lot of time I didn't make enough money to eat. I make sure my child is fed, but there were days I really didn't eat."
The Labor Department has long prohibited restaurants from requiring servers to share their tips with kitchen staff -- notwithstanding a 2010 federal appeals court ruling, involving an Oregon restaurant, that concluded federal law did not bar restaurants from creating a tip pool that shared gratuities with back-of-the-house workers.
Many worker advocates want to see the tip wage abolished, asserting that some waiters are too scared to ask their boss to make up the difference when their tips do not raise them to the minimum wage.
Anatole Yameogo, a 49-year-old pizza deliveryman for a Domino's in Manhattan, said many workers balked when that happened. "You never ask anybody about that," said Mr. Yameogo, an immigrant from Burkina Faso. "You're worried they're going to fire you."
He said that even though New York's tip wage was $5.65 for deliverymen, he usually averaged just $10 an hour. "The tip wage is not enough," he said. "We have a hard job -- we have to work when it's snowing or raining."

These dispiriting wage trends are a central reason for the slow economic recovery; without sustained income growth, consumers can't spend.

Full text:   WITH metronomic regularity, gauzy accounts extol the return of manufacturing jobs to the United States.
One day, it's Master Lock bringing combination lock fabrication back to Milwaukee from China. Another, it's Element Electronics commencing assembly of television sets -- a function long gone from the United States -- in a factory near Detroit.
Breathless headlines in recent months about a "new industrial revolution" and "the promise of a 'Made in America' era" suggest it's a renaissance. This week, when President Obama gives his State of the Union address, he will most likely yet again stress his plans to strengthen our manufacturing base.
But we need to get real about the so-called renaissance, which has in reality been a trickle of jobs, often dependent on huge public subsidies. Most important, in order to compete with China and other low-wage countries, these new jobs offer less in health care, pension and benefits than industrial workers historically received.
In an article in The Atlantic in 2012 about General Electric's decision to open its first new assembly line in 55 years in Louisville, Ky., it was not until deep in the story that readers learned that the jobs were starting at just over $13.50 an hour. That's less than $30,000 a year, hardly the middle-class life usually ascribed to manufacturing employment.
This disturbing trend is particularly pronounced in the automobile industry. When Volkswagen opened a plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., in 2011, the company was hailed for bringing around 2,000 fresh auto jobs to America. Little attention was paid to the fact that the beginning wage for assembly line workers was $14.50 per hour, about half of what traditional, unionized workers employed by General Motors or Ford received.
With benefits added in, those workers cost Volkswagen $27 per hour. Consider, though, that in Germany, the average autoworker earns $67 per hour. In effect, even factoring in future pay increases for the Chattanooga employees, Volkswagen has moved production from a high-wage country (Germany) to a low-wage country (the United States).
All told, wages for blue-collar automotive industry workers have dropped by 10 percent, after adjusting for inflation, since the recession ended in June 2009. By comparison, wages across manufacturing dropped by 2.4 percent during the same period, while earnings for Americans in equivalent private-sector jobs fell by "only" 0.5 percent. (To be fair, including benefits, compensation for manufacturing workers remains above that of service employees.)
These dispiriting wage trends are a central reason for the slow economic recovery; without sustained income growth, consumers can't spend.
Low wages are not the only price that America pays for its manufacturing "renaissance." Hefty subsidies from federal, state and local government agencies often are required. Tennessee provided an estimated $577 million for Volkswagen -- $288,500 per position! To get 1,000 Airbus jobs, Alabama assembled a benefits package of $158 million.
Now Boeing has just used the threat of moving to a nonunion, low-wage state to win both a record subsidy package -- $8.7 billion from Washington State -- and labor concessions.
Over objections from their local leadership, union workers approved a new contract that would freeze pensions in favor of less generous 401(k) plans, reduce health care benefits and provide for raises totaling just 4 percent over the eight-year term. (Boeing's stock price rose by over 80 percent last year.)
FOR all the hoopla, the United States has gained just 568,000 manufacturing positions since January 2010 -- a small fraction of the nearly six million lost between 2000 and 2009. That's a slower rate of recovery than for nonmanufacturing employment. "We find very little real evidence of a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing activity," a recent Morgan Stanley report stated, echoing similar findings from Goldman Sachs.
If anything, the challenges to American manufacturing have grown, as less developed countries have become more adept. In Mexico, where each autoworker earned $7.80 per hour in 2012, auto industry officials say productivity is as high as in the United States, where total compensation costs were $45.34 per hour. No surprise then that in 2013, Mexican automobile production was 50 percent higher than seven years earlier, while output in the United States was at the same 2006 levels.
For the United States to remain competitive against countries like Mexico, productivity must continue to rise. But unlike past gains in productivity, these improvements in efficiency are not being passed along to workers.
And these necessary productivity gains often take the place of hiring more workers; the United States remains the world leader in agriculture while employing less than 2 percent of Americans.
Advanced manufacturing -- a sector that many advocate as a path for the United States to remain relevant at making things -- also involves a high degree of efficiency, meaning not as many hires and particularly, not as many of those old-fashioned, middle-class, assemble-a-thousand-pieces jobs.
Moreover, the lead that the United States has in some advanced manufacturing areas -- notably aerospace -- is being compromised by growing capabilities of workers elsewhere. Bombardier is now assembling Learjets in Mexico, and later this year Cessna will start delivering Citation XLS+ business jets that were put together in China.
Similarly, while America's energy boom will provide an incentive for manufacturers to locate here, don't count on cheap natural gas to fuel an employment boom. According to a 2009 study, only one-tenth of American manufacturing involved significant energy costs.
While we shouldn't expect manufacturing to save our economy, we needn't despair. Among other things, we need to get over the notion that service jobs are invariably inferior. The United States remains a world leader in service industries like education and medicine. Not only do these fields generate well-paying jobs, but they also help with our balance of trade: when foreigners come to America to be educated or treated, those services are tallied as exports.
Manufacturing has been an emotional American touchstone since George Washington wore a wool suit that had been woven in Hartford, Conn., to his first inauguration to illustrate the importance of making stuff at home. We do need to maintain an industrial presence, but perhaps not for the obvious reasons.
For one thing, companies often locate research and development facilities -- stuffed with high-paying jobs -- near their manufacturing facilities. In addition to jobs, R&D yields high-value intellectual property that spills over into still more innovation and employment. And not surprisingly, every manufacturing position requires an additional 4.6 service and supplier positions to support it.
The challenge for the United States is particularly acute because manufacturing now accounts for just 12 percent of our economy, down from a peak of 28 percent in 1953 and on a par with France and Britain as the least industrialized of major economies.
While keeping that share from dipping further should be a priority, we should be careful to avoid raising false hopes (like Mr. Obama's unrealistic second-term goal of creating a million manufacturing jobs) and pursuing ill-conceived policies (such as special subsidies for manufacturing).
The president's proposals -- unveiled over the last several years -- include the two most important elements of a sensible manufacturing strategy: more training focused on the skills needed by employers and increased spending on research and development.
The United States work force is simultaneously overqualified (15 percent of taxi drivers are college graduates) and underqualified (we rank in the bottom half of many comparisons of developed countries).
When Volkswagen arrived in Chattanooga, it found that not enough eager applicants had the requisite technical skills, so it established a German-style training system (including three-year apprenticeships) at the factory.
As for research and development, the fiscal tightening by the federal government has prevented more investment in this critical area, the exact opposite of what is required. At the same time, while subsidies to draw jobs have become a necessary evil, we should be rigorous about analyzing the value of these costs. And we must stop short of excessive meddling in the private sector, and particularly the notion of picking winners. (Think Solyndra or Fisker.)
Mr. Obama skirted this problem by proposing to create 45 "manufacturing innovation institutes," which bring together companies, universities and government experts in a kind of laboratory setting to help develop advanced manufacturing strategies.
While these institutes are not going to turn the tide, they might help at the margin. But like the president's other proposals, they have been largely ignored by Congress. (The White House managed to establish a pilot center in Youngstown, Ohio, and another is coming in Charlotte, N.C.)
Manufacturing would benefit from the same reforms that would help the broader economy: restructuring of our loophole-ridden corporate tax code, new policies to bring in skilled immigrants, added spending on infrastructure and, yes, more trade agreements to encourage foreign direct investment and help get closer to Mr. Obama's seemingly unattainable goal of doubling our exports.
Those who see a brighter manufacturing picture for the United States argue that wages are rising more rapidly elsewhere, not just in China and Brazil but also in Japan, Germany and France. But just like the "feel good" stories, celebrating this fact ignores the reality that the flip side of wages' rising faster elsewhere means they are rising more slowly here.
And that is the essence of our challenge: In a flattened world, there will always be another China.

Some States Are Moving to Loosen Their Estate Taxes

Abstract: [...]he is not alone among governors of cold-weather states (along with the District of Columbia) that have realized affluent residents are moving to states without estate taxes (and in some cases, income taxes) and in doing so, depriving their old state of the other taxes they paid, like property, sales and income tax. "Once some of these other states see New York and D.C. are doing this, I would find it unsurprising if some of these other states join the bandwagon." [...]or if -- that happens, people who have more money than their state's exemption but less than the federal exemption generally have three options: set up trusts to reduce or defer the tax, start making gifts to reduce the estate or move. What complicates this for state estate planning is that the legislation that set the federal estate tax exemption and rate last year included a provision, called portability, that allows surviving spouses to use their deceased spouses' exemption even if they did not set up a credit shelter trust.

Full text:   FOR most of the United States, the estate tax is now something only the very wealthy have to plan for. The federal exemption for an individual this year is now $5.34 million, or $10.68 million for a married couple. And that amount is indexed to inflation, so it will continue to rise.
The exception is in the 16 states, mostly in the North, where state estate taxes remain and ensnare middle- and upper-middle-class residents -- the very people the high federal exemption was supposed to protect.
The worst for taxpayers is New Jersey, with the lowest exemption in the country, $675,000 a person, and a rate that tops out at 16 percent. (Rhode Island is second.) New Jersey also has an inheritance tax -- for bequests to, say, a niece or friend -- which starts to be applied at $500. The rate is 15 percent until the amount reaches $700,000 and then it rises to 16 percent. (One concession: The estate pays the higher of the two taxes, not both.)
This week, New York's governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, took a step toward bringing the state's estate tax in line with the federal one. And he is not alone among governors of cold-weather states (along with the District of Columbia) that have realized affluent residents are moving to states without estate taxes (and in some cases, income taxes) and in doing so, depriving their old state of the other taxes they paid, like property, sales and income tax.
"We have a lot of people moving out of these jurisdictions to avoid the state estate tax entirely," said Samuel Weiner, co-chairman of the tax, trusts and estates department at Cole Schotz, which has offices in New York and New Jersey. "I have people all over Florida. We even wrote a book on how to establish a residency in Florida."
New York's current exemption is $1 million a person with a top rate of 16 percent. Governor Cuomo proposed raising the exemption to $5.25 million by 2019, indexing that to inflation and lowering the top rate to 10 percent. (That tax is still in addition to the 40 percent federal estate tax rate.)
New York is not alone in re-evaluating this. Indiana repealed its inheritance tax, and Ohio ended its estate tax. Tennessee is in the process of phasing out its inheritance tax, and Maryland and the District of Columbia are reviewing their estate taxes.
"There is a strong possibility that the gap is going to be closed over a few years," said Jamie C. Yesnowitz, a principal at Grant Thornton and chairman of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountant's state and local tax technical resource panel. "Once some of these other states see New York and D.C. are doing this, I would find it unsurprising if some of these other states join the bandwagon."
Until -- or if -- that happens, people who have more money than their state's exemption but less than the federal exemption generally have three options: set up trusts to reduce or defer the tax, start making gifts to reduce the estate or move. All have complications and pitfalls.
Sharon L. Klein, managing director of family office services and wealth strategies at Wilmington Trust, said a married couple could set up a credit shelter trust for state estate taxes. When the first spouse dies, the amount of the state's exemption would go into a trust. The remainder would pass free of tax to the surviving spouse and any additional tax owed would be assessed when that spouse died.
Such trusts were commonly used as the federal estate tax exemption rose over the last decade. What complicates this for state estate planning is that the legislation that set the federal estate tax exemption and rate last year included a provision, called portability, that allows surviving spouses to use their deceased spouses' exemption even if they did not set up a credit shelter trust.
This means that a married couple today would have an exemption of $10.68 million without much planning at all. Not so with states like New York and New Jersey that do not have portability.
In New Jersey, a couple with $1.35 million would owe no estate tax when the first spouse died. If the second spouse died with that same amount, the estate would owe $55,000 in New Jersey tax.
"It's ironic because you'd think families with smaller estates don't need a complicated estate plan," said Laura A. Kelly, a partner at McCarter & English in Newark. "But these are the families that can least afford to pay the tax. If you have a credit shelter trust to get the New Jersey exemption, the surviving spouse can have access to it and get the rest."
Whereas such estate planning is standard for people worth tens of millions of dollars, it is less common for affluent couples worth several million dollars because of the cost and time needed to set them up. But it is worth it.
Consider a couple in New York with $5 million in assets. They would owe no federal estate tax. But what they would owe to New York would depend on their planning, said Ita M. Rahilly, a partner at the accounting firm Vanacore, DeBenedictus, DiGovanni & Weddell.
If each spouse had $2.5 million in his or her name, $1 million would go into a credit shelter trust upon death and the marginal estate tax rate on the remaining $1.5 million would be 8 percent, she said. If the spouse who died second had all $5 million in her name, that marginal rate would be 11.2 percent on the amount over the exemption.
"This requires a whole rethink," Ms. Rahilly said.
One upside: People who bought life insurance to cover federal estate taxes could use that policy to pay state estate taxes.
Another option is to give away money while you are still alive. Only Connecticut and Minnesota have state gift taxes that are applied below the federal gift tax exemption, which is the same as the federal estate tax exemption. (This is separate from the annual gift exclusion of $14,000.) Some states, however, consider gifts made close to death for estate tax purposes.
But when you give heirs a gift of, say, appreciated stock, you are also giving them all the unrealized gains the stock has from when you bought it -- known as your cost basis. When they sell that gift, they are going to have to pay capital gains on it.
This is where people need to make a calculation. Depending on the recipient's tax bracket, that rate could be lower than the state estate tax or it could be much higher. (When someone dies, the cost basis goes to what it was on the date of death, called a step-up in basis, and essentially erases all of the embedded gains.)
In Massachusetts, for example, anyone who received an asset with embedded gains and sold it would also be subject to the state's 5 percent capital gains tax, which is on top of the federal rates, said Beth C. Gamel, managing director at Argent Wealth Management. A person in the highest tax bracket for capital gains and subject to the 3.8 percent Medicare tax would pay a capital-gains tax of 28.8 percent on that asset. The highest rate for Massachusetts's estate tax is 16 percent, with an exemption of $1 million.
Ms. Gamel added that Massachusetts, unlike many other states and the federal government, allowed people to make large gifts on their deathbed and not have those assets counted for estate tax. This kind of gifting would work if the person had a lot of cash to give. It would also work if the recipient was in a lower tax bracket in a state like New Hampshire, which doesn't have its own capital gains tax.
None of this is terribly difficult for experts to figure out, but it is time-consuming and requires paying lawyers and accountants for advice. The headache factor is high, particularly when in most states a simple will would do the trick for federal estate taxes. For those dispirited by this, Mr. Weiner of Cole Schotz had simple advice: "Move to Florida."
But the risk is that people won't really move: They will spend the winter there and the rest of the year at their home in the Northeast. For the move not to be challenged, they have to establish residency there, with proof like drivers' licenses, voter registration, country club memberships and church affiliations.
"People want to straddle this gray line," Mr. Yesnowitz of Grant Thornton said. "But states are looking for that. New York is a hotbed for that kind of litigation because of the stakes involved."
The trouble could be worth the tax savings -- and warmer winters.

Abstract: Fears are rising that the demand for commodities, a centerpiece of Argentina's economy, is weakening in places like China, a slowdown that could threaten developing nations. Argentina's economy is still expected to grow at 2.8 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, but growth has slowed significantly from recent years, and capital flight has been a longstanding problem.

Full text:   BUENOS AIRES -- Cities across Argentina are still unnerved by all the looting that broke out last month after police officers went on strike, protesting salaries eroded by rampant inflation. Residents fumed over blackouts that left them sweltering during a recent heat wave. Then the currency plunged this week, the steepest decline since the nation's economic collapse in 2002, stirring fears that another major financial crisis could be around the corner.
"In 80 years, there've been tough times, but it's never been as bad as this," Irma Herrera, 80, a retired psychologist, said Friday after the government announced that it would make it easier for Argentines to buy dollars amid the financial upheaval.
"I'm not going to buy dollars when my monthly pension doesn't even stretch to buy food," Ms. Herrera said.
In a matter of days, Argentina has become a symbol of the economic stresses mounting in developing countries around the world. Fears are rising that the demand for commodities, a centerpiece of Argentina's economy, is weakening in places like China, a slowdown that could threaten developing nations.
At the same time, the prospect of better returns in the United States is drawing money out of the developing world and battering currencies from Turkey to Russia to South Africa.
The worries over contagion are spreading. In Brazil, the country's powerful automobile industry is bracing for the problems in Argentina, one of Brazil's biggest export markets. But beyond the global forces at play, the financial swings this week have called attention to the particular challenges for some of Latin America's most vulnerable economies.
"There's something that's happening all over Latin America, which is that the region is coming to the end of its commodities boom," said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Some countries are more vulnerable than others, and definitely the Venezuelas and Argentinas of the world are more vulnerable. Markets are getting very nervous about what will happen to them if you enter a period of a slump in commodities prices."
This week in Venezuela, the government announced what amounted to a partial devaluation and new currency controls. On Friday, travel agents said several airlines had either stopped selling tickets over the last few days or made only a very limited number of seats available.
The airlines say they have $3.3 billion in revenues in Venezuelan banks that the government has not let them take out of the country. They worry that the value of that money, which is still in local currency, could shrink significantly.
"This is one of the high points when you speak to airline C.E.O.'s," said Peter Cerda, regional vice president for the Americas of the International Air Transport Association. "What keeps them up at night is exactly this. What their money's worth today, it might not be worth tomorrow."
On Friday, Venezuela's government also put new limits on the dollars it promises to sell citizens traveling abroad, with a cap of $700 per trip to Florida, compared with $2,500 for travel elsewhere in the United States.
"It's madness," said Antonio Miglio, 42, a businessman, who flies to Orlando, Fla., every year with his family to go shopping. "The government made this decision because of the economic crisis, but this will only make the crisis worse."
In Argentina, the pressures have been building for years. Generous social spending after the crisis in 2002, like freezing household electricity rates and making payments to poor families, has widened Argentina's deficit. The country has been printing money, fueling inflation. The issue has been so polemical that the government has been in a fight for years over how high inflation really is; independent economists say it reached 28 percent in 2013, while officials say it was 10.9 percent.
Argentina's economy is still expected to grow at 2.8 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, but growth has slowed significantly from recent years, and capital flight has been a longstanding problem. Given that the government has nationalized businesses like YPF, the country's biggest oil company, some investors have pulled back, and many people here have tried to take their money out of the country.
To prevent that exodus, the authorities have tried to restrict access to foreign currency. Now, with a nearly 20 percent drop in the value of the peso just this week, the government said Friday that it would allow people to buy dollars with greater ease. The economy minister described the shift as a response to "psychosis" in Argentina's financial markets.
"The government is trying to find a way out of the mess it got into," said Fausto Spotorno, an economist at Orlando Ferreres y Asociados in Buenos Aires. "But there's so much more to do, like tackle inflation."
Rather than stemming the anxiety, the government's announcement on Friday seemed to sow confusion.
"This is all improvised," said Antonio López, 63, an administrator for an office building. "They don't know what they're doing."
The economy minister, Axel Kicillof, lashed out at financial analysts who contended that the peso might weaken further, calling them "great liars." In comments to an Argentine radio station, he attributed the sharp fall in the peso to a "speculative attack" put into motion by the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell.
"The authorities in Argentina are suffering from low credibility," said Alberto Ramos, an economist at Goldman Sachs. "The situation can get as bad as they want to make it."
The streets of downtown Buenos Aires were bustling but calm on Friday, with more dark humor than signs of panic. "Great, we can buy dollars now," said Nicolás Titaro, 61, a company treasurer. "We just need salaries that let us."
Other Argentines wondered whether another period of economic turmoil loomed. "It's always the same here, a crisis every 10 years," said Marcelo Rosales, 50, a security guard. "The government will not assume the political cost of dealing with this. It is only healing minor cuts with plasters."

Abstract: The concerns about developing economies are being heightened by the Fed's recent decision to begin pulling back on the bond-buying stimulus programs that have helped keep interest rates low around the world. The slump this week was the first serious break in a long stock market rally that took the broad United States stock market up nearly 30 percent last year, fueled by signs of an economic recovery.

Full text:   Updated, 9:20 p.m. | The ascent of developing countries over the last decade has been fueled by two global trends: the steady rise of China and the willingness of the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy.
Now, with both trends starting to retreat, investors have been heading for the exits in markets as far removed as Buenos Aires, Istanbul and Beijing, with effects spilling over into the rest of the world.
A decline this week picked up speed and spread around the globe on Friday, leading to the first sustained drop in United States stock indexes in 2014. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.1 percent on Friday, to end its worst week since June 2012.
But the damage is expected to be worse in places that have relied on demand for raw resources in China, whose economic advance is slowing. An index of Chinese manufacturing growth released on Thursday showed that the most important cog in the country's economy, the world's second-largest, was contracting for the first time in six months.
The damage has been particularly severe in countries that are already suffering from political instability, like Turkey and Argentina. Turkey's currency fell to a record low against the dollar on Friday, a drop that will hit the purchasing power of everyone in the country.
On a street corner in Istanbul, Yilmaz Gok, 51, said, "I'm a retiree making ends meet on a small pension and all I care about is a possible increase in prices."
"I will need to cut further," he said. "Maybe I should use my natural gas heater less."
The concerns about developing economies are being heightened by the Fed's recent decision to begin pulling back on the bond-buying stimulus programs that have helped keep interest rates low around the world. Now, many countries that had come to rely on those low rates could face a surge in borrowing costs and a period of painful readjustment. Many emerging countries could also be hurt if investors choose to pull their money to chase returns in the recovering economies in the United States and Europe.
"A lot of these currencies are getting trashed and people's standards of living are going down," said Michael Purves, the chief global strategist at Weeden & Company. "There is a potential for social unrest to accelerate."
The slump this week was the first serious break in a long stock market rally that took the broad United States stock market up nearly 30 percent last year, fueled by signs of an economic recovery. The extent of the rise had led many sophisticated investors to expect some kind of pullback in American stocks.
"This is a convenient and healthy short-term pullback," said David Lafferty, the chief market strategist for Natixis Global Asset Management. "The market really needs some time to digest last year's gains."
In the rest of the world, the damage so far is less severe than it was during similar turmoil in emerging markets last summer, when the Fed first talked about easing its bond-buying programs. Most markets ended up bouncing back from that episode. But there is a growing recognition that the developing world will not be the engine of growth that it has been for much of the last decade.
In China, the economy is still growing faster than almost anywhere else, but the pace is slowing and the government is intent on developing an economy that is less intent on exporting goods. This is weighing on everything from the soybean industry in Brazil to the nickel mines of Mozambique.
For some countries, though, the recent problems have been relatively independent of China.
In Argentina, the government's efforts to fend off inflation and artificially support the local currency backfired. This week, the government acknowledged the problem when it allowed the value of the peso to drop and made it easier to buy dollars, but that only spurred a greater sense of crisis. The peso finished the week down 16 percent. Many analysts have said that the government still has to deal with the fundamental problem of rampant inflation.
Some of the most drastic moves have been in Turkey, one of the largest emerging economies. On Friday, the Turkish lira was trading at 2.314 a dollar, creeping above 2.3 for the first time, after the central bank failed in its effort to control the slide.
Turkey had been one of many places where business magnates had used the Fed's low interest rates to pay for a building boom. It is now unclear whether Turkish businesses will be able to pay off those loans if interest rates rise.
The country has also been plunged into political turmoil, which is hurting business confidence. In late December, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan became entangled in a battle with the Gulen movement, a powerful pro-Islamic network and once a close ally of the government.
On Friday, Mr. Erdogan accused the country's largest business group of treason after its chairman warned about a possible retreat of global investors if the government continued political moves that endangered the country's democratic system. The business group had forecast that Turkey's economy would grow 3.4 percent in 2014, as opposed to a government projection of 4 percent.
Because Turkey and many other emerging market economies rely on low interest rates, their fate will depend, in part, on the Fed's future decisions about how to pull back on its bond-buying programs. In December, the Fed decided to cut back its monthly purchases for the first time, to $75 billion from $85 billion. Next week, the Fed is scheduled to meet and announce whether it will continue to reduce its bond purchases.
"Emerging markets can't seem to escape the shadow of the Federal Reserve," Andrew Wilkinson, the chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers, wrote to clients on Friday.
Economists are carefully watching the United States for any signs that it is vulnerable to the weakness overseas or that the economic recovery is slowing independently. The most recent monthly employment report showed a sharp slowdown in job creation for the first time in months and data this week showed that home sales came in slightly lower than expected.
But the main American indexes are still within a few percent of their record highs. The S.&P. 500 ended Friday down 2.1 percent, or 38.17 points, at 1,790.29, bringing it down 3.1 percent for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2 percent, or 318.24 points, to 15,879.11. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.2 percent, or 90.70 points, to 4,128.88.
United States, German and British bonds have been benefiting as investors seek them out as a refuge from the turmoil in riskier assets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.72 percent, from 2.78 percent on Thursday, after hovering near 3 percent earlier this month.
An array of United States economic data has continued to point to an economic recovery that is gaining strength and could actually benefit if investors are looking for somewhere to put money that was previously in developing countries.
"There's a part of this that actually strengthens the U.S.," Mr. Purves said. "You may have a flight to the best house on the block."

Abstract: (Holland Cotter) * Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

Museums
* Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Tony Feher' (through Feb. 16) Almost anything can be beautiful if it's presented in the right way. That's where the sculptor Tony Feher comes in. His palette consists almost entirely of cheap manufactured objects, including glass and plastic bottles; metal and plastic bottle tops; marbles, coins, nuts and bolts, metal rings, plastic bags, broken pieces of glass, rope, plastic cord, shredded paper, cans and cardboard boxes. He organizes these and other things into simple but surprisingly exciting, often funny configurations with intriguing philosophical implications. This beautiful show surveys a 25-year career. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt' (through December 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, this show is for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum's renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
* Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'War/Photography: Images of Armed Conflict and Its Aftermath' (through Feb. 2) This flawed but intensely absorbing exhibition presents pictures by more than 280 photographers relating to conflicts from the Mexican-American War of 1846-49 to the Arab Spring revolution of 2010-11. Photographs from widely different times and places are grouped according to themes like "Recruitment and Embarkation" and "Homecoming," suggesting that all wars are somehow similar, which is debatable. The main problem, though, is the claustrophobic, overly busy installation, which is unfortunate because there is hardly a single picture that doesn't cry out to be seen and pondered by itself. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Jewish Museum: 'Chagall: Love, War, and Exile' (through Feb. 2) This exhibition of Marc Chagall's work from the 1930s and '40s hinges on a group of paintings and drawings of Jesus on the cross, most of them made during, or shortly before or after, World War II. In these dark and anguished works, Chagall unexpectedly adopts Jesus as a Jewish martyr, as a symbol of a persecuted people and of the refugee artist in particular. The show's final gallery, however, glosses over this difficult period with some of Chagall's more romantic and nostalgic postwar paintings. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The American West in Bronze, 1850-1925' (through April 13) This intriguing and spiritually troubling show presents 65 mostly pedestal-scale sculptures representing standard themes of the old American West: cowboys, Indians and wild animals. It includes famous practitioners of the genre like Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, as well as 26 others. Nearly all the sculptures are in a mode of three-dimensional illustrative realism and tend heavily to romantic idealization. There's the rub: The real history of the conquest of the West by white folks was much worse than what these artists imagined in their very popular works. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China' (through April 6) This museum's first survey of recent Chinese art uses the lens of the culture's ancient brush and ink tradition so basic to its landscape painting and calligraphy. It doesn't always work. The show endures a scattered installation, includes overly refined displays of empty skill and wanders off message in spots, especially with several sculptures that don't seem to belong here. But a few moments of visual life and many interesting questions about the weight of the old on the new make it worthwhile. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Jewels By JAR' (through March 9) Crowd-pleasers needn't represent lowered curatorial standards in terms of subject and execution, but this one does. It packs 400 efforts by the New York-born, Paris-based high-society jeweler, Joel Arthur Rosenthal (JAR), into a very dark gallery with insufficient labeling or historical backup. Large pave brooches, usually of flowers, abound; too many pieces date from 2010 or later. There are certainly redeeming works, but the show cries out for editing, scholarly support and better viewing conditions. Artist and audience are left hanging, with the museum's mercenary agenda in full view. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: William Kentridge: 'The Refusal of Time' (through May 11) Everything is on the move in this mini-theater-cum-power-plant of an installation. In wraparound videos, metronomes pound. Clock-faces spin, spewing trails of stars. Drawings draw and erase themselves. Maps of Africa appear and disappear. White-coated figures mix potions amid giant watch springs. At the center of the gallery a wooden contraption pumps away like an energy source. A collaboration between Mr. Kentridge, who is based in South Africa, and Peter L. Galison, a science historian at Harvard, the piece refers to the European colonial experiment, which strove to shape other cultures to its own concepts of reality, only to find that those cultures had different, resistant, assertive realities of their own. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Piero della Francesa: Personal Encounters' (through March 30) None of the four works in this deceptively low-impact show are among Piero della Francesca's most celebrated. But they are all the devotional paintings for private clients Piero is known to have made, and this show is the first to bring them all together. Two picture Saint Jerome in his wilderness retreat and two portray the Madonna and Child, one of which is thought to be Piero's earliest known painting and the other among his last. As marriages of old religious faith and new forms of empirical consciousness, they are marvelous thought provokers. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Silla: Korea's Golden Kingdom' (through Feb. 23) This intriguing show presents more than 130 objects from Silla, a kingdom that dominated the Korean peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries. The first two of three sections includes gold jewelry, formally austere pottery, glassware and other objects excavated from mound shaped, earth-covered tombs in the city of Gyeongju. The third section displays sculpture made after Buddhism was adopted as the state religion around 530. Among the most captivating is a beautiful three-foot-high, gilt bronze sculpture of a young Bodhisattva, which, like a number of other works in the show, has been designated a Korean National Treasure. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Venetian Glass by Carlo Scarpa: The Venini Company, 1932-1947' (through March 2) Before he turned to architecture, Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) designed glass vessels, achieving a lifetime's worth of beauty and innovation in a short, remarkable burst of creativity. His achievement is honored with this sublime exhibition of nearly 300 of his splendidly sculptural, radiantly colored, ingeniously patterned vessels. They have an inspiring wholeness: process, form and decoration become a single thing; art, craft and science merge. And content of the non-narrative, experiential kind abounds. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
* MoMA PS1: 'Mike Kelley' (through Feb. 2) This retrospective of the Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley fills 40,000 feet of gallery space at PS1. And it's that very rare thing, a huge show that should be huge. Kelley earned this blowout; his work sustains one. In a three-decade career, cut off by his suicide, at 57, in 2012, he did it all genrewise: performance, painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, video, installation, sound art and writing. And he wove together -- twisted together -- all of that into what amounted to a single conceptual project based on recurrent themes: class politics, popular culture, black humor, anti-formalist rigor and a moral sense, unshakably skeptical, that ran through everything like a spine. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Leonardo da Vinci: Treasures from the Biblioteca Reale, Turin' (through Feb. 2) A mere handful of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci are in this exquisite show. But in the case of the great multidisciplinary experimentalist and technician, even a little is a lot. Leonardo the scientist is here in the drawn and annotated "Codex on the Flight of Birds" and the artist in the exquisite silverpoint image called "Head of a Young Woman." Both works are in New York for the first time. The show is fleshed out with work by some of the master's followers and by the Morgan's own "Codex Huygens," a late-16th-century manuscript that has faithful copies of now-lost Leonardo drawings. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Visions and Nightmares: Four Centuries of Spanish Drawings' (through May 11) Skipping from 16th-century church commissions to Goya in just 25 objects, the Morgan's first show of Spanish drawings is necessarily awkward. But it delivers on the promise of its title, serving up heavenly apparitions and wicked phantasms aplenty. Highlights include a red chalk drawing of the satyr Marsyas by José de Ribera, an "Immaculate Conception" by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, several late Goya drawings, and a lavishly illustrated 1780 edition of "Don Quixote." 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
* Museum of Arts and Design: 'Out of Hand: Materializing the Postdigital' (through June 1) If you haven't quite wrapped your head around the concept of 3-D printing, or haven't yet had a digital scanner wrap itself around you, now you can do both in this survey of computer-assisted art, architecture and design. The show looks at art made since 2005 and fills nearly three floors, including many irresistible interactive projects. Its ideas may not be entirely new; the Museum of Modern Art's 2008 exhibition "Design and the Elastic Mind" covered much of the same territory, but there's something to be said for this more down-to-earth, production-focused exhibition. 2 Columbus Circle, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Designing Modern Women 1890-1990' (through Oct. 5) Shoehorned into half the museum's design department, this conversation-starting display of objects from MoMA's permanent collection features items designed by more than 60 women, many of whom worked with male partners. Some, like Marianne Brandt and Eileen Gray, are well known to design aficionados, but most will be unfamiliar to a general audience. Most objects were created for domestic consumption. The pièce de résistance is a kitchen designed by Charlotte Perriand for the apartments in Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation in Marseille, France. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Dorothea Rockburne: Drawing Which Makes Itself' (through Feb. 2) The main attraction in this mini-survey of Dorothea Rockburne is a group of works from her 1973 show at the Bykert Gallery in New York. There, the artist developed a rigorously mathematical and strenuously physical method of drawing; she folded and scored large sheets of carbon paper as she moved them around the gallery, leaving a succession of marks -- lines and thumbprints -- on the wall and floor. They are a brain tease, especially if you try to follow the diagrams Ms. Rockburne has provided, but they also have a kind of poetry of movement; they make you think of professors scrawling equations on chalkboards. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New' (through April 21) Ileana Sonnabend, who died in 2007 at 92, was one of the most foresighted art dealers of the late 20th century. This modest-size exhibition, made up of work she either owned or showed in her gallery, gives a sense of the range of her interests, from Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Modern Art: Isa Genzken: 'Retrospective' (through March 10) This prolific German sculptor -- for whom New York and its skyscrapers are a major source of inspiration -- receives her first comprehensive museum survey in this country. A grand, glamorous and sometimes grating 40-year overview, it traces her progress from idiosyncratic Minimalist monoliths to the distinctive, often architectonic, assemblages she began making in 1997 from cheesy materials and objects, concocting a raw, unapologetic beauty and a weirdly elliptical if literal-minded social commentary, often about the United States, power and war. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through March 9) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: "American Photographs," by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprise of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
* Neue Galerie: 'Vasily Kandinsky: From Blaue Reiter to the Bauhaus, 1910-1925' (through Feb. 10) The Neue's first show on Kandinsky centers on a rich 15-year period, also the purview of the Museum of Modern Art's recent "Inventing Abstraction, 1910-1925." During this time Kandinsky shifted from the prismatic Expressionism of Der Blaue Reiter into pure abstraction and from easel paintings into set designs and murals. A reconstruction of one of those mural projects is on view, as are abundantly decorative wall panels made for a private collector in New York. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, 212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
* New-York Historical Society: 'The Armory Show at 100: Modern Art and Revolution' (through Feb. 23) The International Exhibition of Modern Art, otherwise known as the Armory Show, woke American art from its provincial slumbers a century ago. Was it a good thing or a bad thing, and is there any reason to care about it now? With more than 100 works from the original exhibition by American and European artists and a big, richly illuminating catalog, "The Armory Show at 100" offers an excellent opportunity to ponder such questions. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
Queens Museum of Art: Peter Schumann 'The Shatterer' (through March 30) A recent expansion has doubled the size of the Queens Museum. Of five celebratory new shows, the largest and most moving is the solo museum debut of Peter Schumann, the founder and director of Bread and Puppet Theater, which is 50 years old this year. The show demonstrates how thoroughly Bread and Puppet is his creation. Its down-value look and activist ethos are evident in everything, including the black house-paint mural he has brushed, single-handedly, across one of the museum's wall and the hand-printed, hand-bound books he has placed in the gallery he designates as chapel and library. Every inch of this room is covered with figures and words: angels and ogres, exhortations and condemnations, art for one and for all, straight from the hand, right to the moral core. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 718-592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Rubin Museum of Art: 'Allegory and Illusion: Early Portrait Photography From South Asia' (through Feb. 10) "Allegory and Illusion" is a fascinating little piece of a very complicated puzzle. Ostensibly a focused, regional exhibition, it has much to say about the larger relationship between photography and colonialism. Included are many different forms of early photography, representing an array of markets and social classes: grand portraits of Nepalese royals and palm-size cartes de visite for the masses, ethnographic albums by British photographers and hand-painted photographs from Indian portrait studios. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Rosenberg)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Shadows Took Shape' (through March 9) Space is definitely the place in this lively group exhibition devoted to Afrofuturism, a contemporary art trend that takes the ultra-free-jazz musician Sun Ra as its patron saint and locates itself in a universe where racial and ethnic identities float free from stereotypes without losing track of the histories that created them. William Villalongo sets African sculpture and modernist painting soaring together among the stars; the Kenyan artist Wanuri Kahiu films ecological cataclysm and renewal in ages to come; William Cordova, who lives in New York and Lima, Peru, recreates the Falcon spaceship from George Lucas's "Star Wars," now equipped with a cultural studies library. 144 West 125th Street, 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Rituals of Rented Island: Object Theater, Loft Performance, and the New Psychodrama -- Manhattan, 1970-1980' (through Feb. 2) Four decades ago, performance art was young, funky and clunky, beyond modernism, or maybe perversely beneath it, meant to reflect a world in which materials were transient, old models useless and values shifty. We get a vivid flashback to those beginnings in this show of photographs, videos and objects that breathes surprising life into archival matter and brings wonderful artists like Stuart Sherman, Jared Bark, Julia Heyward, Jill Kroesen and Ralston Farina back into view. 212-570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'T.J. Wilcox: In the Air' (through Feb. 9) A Romantic miniaturist best known for short, poetic films pieced together from found and made footage goes big in a dazzling 360-degree, 30-minute, day-to-night-to-day view of Lower Manhattan. Six brief collagelike films pop onto the panorama one at a time, zeroing on a specific event, person or experience, including Sept. 11. We see the city as a kaleidoscopic archive, alive with buildings, history, memories and people, and understand anew that the metropolis and the moving image were made for each other. 212-570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
* 'Selling the Dwelling: The Books That Built America's Houses, 1775-2000' (through Feb. 7) More than 200 books, prints and objects trace the history of home building in America. Starting with 18th-century builder's guides, this exhibition chronicles the rise and fall of popular styles like Greek Revival, Gothic fantasy, Colonial Revival and Beaux-Arts. The 20th century brings prefab house-building kits and Levittown-style mass production. In the postmodern era you find plans for a traditional "dream house" designed by Gary Brewer of Robert A.M. Stern Architects that were published by Life magazine. This display is a richly rewarding intellectual journey. Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, Manhattan, 212-838-6690, grolierclub.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Chelsea
Martina Bacigalupo: 'Gulu Real Art Studio' (through Feb. 8) In 2010 the Italian photojournalist Martina Bacigalupo spent time in the city of Gulu in northern Uganda, where she came across a curious form of portraiture. In a local shop called the Gulu Real Art Studio she found dozens of full-length pictures of sitters from which the heads had been neatly cut out. The shop's owner, Obal Denis, explained why. His machine for developing passport-size photos automatically produced four prints at a time, but most people coming for an ID picture needed only one. So it was easier, and cheaper, to shoot a regular full-length portrait, edit out a head shot and toss what was left. The pictures in this remarkable show are the result: studies in body language and clothing, accompanied by audio-taped interviews made with some of the sitters. The Walther Collection Project Space, 508-526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, 212-352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
Cyprien Gaillard: 'Today Diggers, Tomorrow Dickens' (through Feb. 1) The familiar convention of giant, slightly altered, out-of-context ready-mades arrayed in a pristine gallery is reiterated by an artist best known for brutal videos that document the dehumanizing scale and effect of immense Eastern-bloc apartment complexes. Here he adds luxurious rods of yellow onyx to scarred excavation heads from earth-moving machines. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street, 212-206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Smith)
* 'Hooray for Hollywood!' (through Feb. 8) This big, sumptuous exhibition revisits the ecumenical gallery and vivid personality of Holly Solomon (1934-2002), offering a relatively wide-angle view of the 1970s and the '80s than is usual these days. Founded in 1975, Solomon's SoHo gallery exhibited staunch Post-Minimalists and Conceptualists (Gordon Matta-Clark, Peter Hutchinson) beside younger artists reacting against such stringency, especially those of the Pattern and Decoration persuasion (Robert Kushner, Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt, Ned Smyth). Both sides are well-represented, and portraits of Solomon commissioned from artists she knew or showed further enliven the proceedings. Mixed Greens, 212-331-8888, mixedgreens.com; Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 212-675-7490, pavelzoubok.com; both at 531 West 26th Street. (Smith)
'Para-Real' (through Feb. 8) This philosophically catchy 14-artist show reflects a few forms in which reality, whatever that is, impinges. It includes a pile of scrub brushes by Robert Therrien; a self-portrait of Maurizio Cattelan as a real puppet; Hiroshi Sugimoto's photograph of stuffed golden eagles in a museum diorama; and Thomas Demand's "Ghost," a photograph of a colored paper and cardboard construction of a kitchen, wherein some culinary objects hover above the stove, as if tossed up by a poltergeist. 601Artspace, 601 West 26th Street, 212-243-2735, 601artspace.org. (Johnson)
Richard Serra: 'New Sculpture' (through Feb. 8, and March 15) In this show running at two branches of the Gagosian Gallery, Richard Serra continues along the road that emerged from the hugely successful "Torqued Ellipses" of the 1990s, but also circles back to his earlier oeuvre. At 555 West 24th Street, you have the Serra of the '60s and '70s, revised and updated: heavy rectilinear plates and cubes fabricated in steel rather than lead, his signature material in the '60s. In the navelike space at 522 West 21st Street, you have the new-old Serra: an 80-foot-long curvilinear sculpture fabricated in weatherproof steel called "Inside Out" (2013). The difference between the installations in the two galleries might be described simply as austerity versus pleasure. Through Feb. 8 at 522 West 21st Street, 212-741-1717; through March 15 at 555 West 24th Street, 212-741-1111; gagosian.com. (Martha Schwendener)
Galleries: Other
Julien Bismuth: 'An image as the _____ of a surface' (through Feb. 16) As the show's title suggests, Julien Bismuth is concerned not only with how images are made, but also with their relationship to surfaces. Pink mesh silk screens sit on the floor, leaning against the wall, sometimes stacked like an archive. Above them are images printed in dark gray ink directly onto the wall. Two videos focus on what we experience privately in the realm of images, and an audio work features an actress reading "statements of intention" by artists, pop stars and others. Ripped from context, intentions mean nothing. Here they serve as poetic reminders of the great synapse between art and experience. Simone Subal, 131 Bowery, at Grand Street, second floor, Lower East Side, 917-409-0612, simonesubal.com. (Schwendener)
* Sarah Crowner: 'The Wave' (through Feb. 2) Installed as a room-within-a-room, "The Wave" displays Ms. Crowner's signature sewn abstractions, stitched together from painted canvas, around a tiled viewing platform that's her most impressive foray yet into ceramics. Most of the paintings feature wide undulating stripes of red and orange, making them an excellent foil for the turquoise chevrons of the platform. As before, Ms. Crowner is using nonpainterly methods to make works that nonetheless register as paintings. But she's also integrating different periods of 20th-century design: everything from Alexander Girard's textiles for Herman Miller to the Wiener Werkstatte. Nicelle Beauchene Gallery, 327 Broome Street, between Bowery and Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, 212-375-8043, nicellebeauchene.com. (Rosenberg)
* 'Devotion: Excavating Bob Mizer' (through Feb. 15) Bob Mizer is best known as a producer and publisher of beefcake photography for a gay market. This show makes a good case for him as an artist with interests and an imagination considerably more expansive than what his popular reputation suggests. The show's first picture is of a Siamese cat on a sofa. Further on are Arbus-like portraits of women and children; photographs of odd staged events like a magic show; and a picture of a cop writing a parking ticket for a group of teenage girls that could have been made into a painting by Norman Rockwell. A spirit of good-humored generosity prevails. 80WSE, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, 212-998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Johnson)
* Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (through March 31) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, 212-610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
* 'Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart: Collected by Julie Ault' (through Feb. 23) Julie Ault, an artist, writer and curator, was a founding member of the New York collaborative Group Material, which, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, used exhibitions and public events to investigate the overlap of art and politics. During decades of depression, inflation, multiculturalism, conservatism and AIDS, she and her colleagues lived improvised lives on the city's fringes. Within their world, art was currency for giving gifts, bartering, buying and selling among friends. This show, spread over two different locations, is a moving record of such transactions. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo; Artists Space: Books & Talks, 55 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, 212-226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)
* Moira Dryer Project (through Feb. 22.) The first exhibition in 20 years of the obdurate yet romantic wood-panel paintings of Moira Dryer (1957-92) is a two-part affair that is especially relevant at a time when younger painters, many of them women, are exploring new ways of getting physical with their medium. Dryer pitted the literalness of her paintings against thin, sometimes streaky applications of paint for results that are witty and startling, assertive yet suffused with a delicate, even poetic atmosphere. A lively group show of paintings or painting-like works by six artists at the gallery's second space (at 195 Chrystie Street near Stanton) confirms the current relevance of Dryer's art. Eleven Rivington, two Lower East Side locations: 11 Rivington Street, 212-982-1930; 195 Chrystie Street, near Stanton Street, 212-477-2507, elevenrivington.com. (Smith)
* 'An Opening of the Field: Jess, Robert Duncan, and Their Circle' (through March 29) If you were young, gifted and odd, San Francisco was a good place to be in the years after World War II, when big changes were brewing in American art and culture. And this show feels like a chunk of Bay Area turf has been lifted from back then and set down, untrimmed and buzzing, in the New York of now. At its center are two gay men, the poet Robert Duncan (1919-88) and the artist Jess Collins (who went by the single name Jess). Committed partners living in a wonderland of an old house filled to roof with art, they gathered a fascinating creative community around them, and a lot of it shows up here. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Cotter)
* 'Stay in Love' (through Feb. 2) This two-part group show about obsessive working practices -- "monomania and manual repetition" -- is a sign of the Lower East Side's maturation. The exhibition sometimes looks as if it belongs in Chelsea, or even in the contemporary galleries at the Museum of Modern Art. The Lisa Cooley gallery's part of the show is a mostly black-and-white affair with an impressive number of older contemporary works by the likes of On Kawara, Bernd and Hilla Becher, and Yayoi Kusama. At Laurel Gitlen, the works are more playful and colorful; an exuberant Josh Smith name-painting, an inspired B. Wurtz totem made from little more than wire, shoelaces and a red plastic bag. Lisa Cooley, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, 212-680-0564, lisa-cooley.com. Laurel Gitlen, 122 Norfolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, 212-274-0761, laurelgitlen.com. (Rosenberg)
Out of Town
* Carnegie Museum of Art: 2013 Carnegie International (through March 16) A welcome shock to the system of one of the art world's more entrenched rituals, this lean, seemingly modest, thought-out exhibition takes the big global survey of contemporary art off steroids. It is mostly devoid of the looming, often expensive installations called "festival art," while evincing a gratifying affinity for color, form, beauty and pleasure, and a discernible lack of interest in finger-wagging didacticism. Object-making of all kinds seems healthy, as do artist-initiated activist projects (which sometimes overlap). Interventionist and artist-as-curator efforts? Not as impressive. 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, 412-622-3131, carnegieinternational.org. (Smith)
National Gallery of Art: 'Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium From Greek Collections' (through March 2) With about 170 objects, this show takes a processional sweep through Byzantine art from its Greco-Roman beginnings to its multicultural late phase in the 15th century, with a specific emphasis on its development in Greece itself. The history is fascinating, and the objects couldn't be more beautiful, including a glinting 13th-century icon of the Virgin and Child pieced together from glass, silver, gold and glass; a 17-foot-long parchment scroll painted with chirping birds and secret prayers; and a heavenly silk embroidery, found stashed away in a Thessaloniki church, depicting the body of the dead Christ surrounded by fan-wielding seraphs and a stitched chant, "Holy, holy, holy." On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, 202-737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Last Chance
'Danish Paintings From the Golden Age to the Modern Breakthrough: Selections From the Collection of Ambassador John L. Loeb Jr.' (closes on Saturday) Paintings dating from the late 1700s to the early 20th century play out a fascinating dialogue between Scandinavian restraint and imported (i.e., French) freedom and sensuality. Sunny French Impressionism evidently made an mark on Danish artists, but in the show's most compelling works -- funereal pictures of women in gray rooms by Vilhelm Hammershoi -- desire and repression fought to an agonized stalemate. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
'Eureka: William Wegman Photographs 1970-1975' (closes on Saturday) Mr. Wegman's hilarious, deadpan-profound photographs from the early 1970s are sampled here. They all revolve around visual gags involving contradictory realities. In "How They Are Toward Newspapers," Mr. Wegman sits on a couch reading a newspaper while his canine companion lies on the floor with a crumpled mess of newspaper between its forepaws. Who's to say which response to the reality of the paper is ultimately correct, man's or dog's? Craig F. Starr Gallery, 5 East 73rd Street, Manhattan, 212-570-1739, starr-art.com. (Johnson)
* Nasreen Mohamedi: 'Becoming One' (closes on Saturday) When Nasreen Mohamedi died in 1990, at 53, in India, few people outside a group of artist-friends in her home country knew of her. That has changed. Her international reputation has grown steadily, and this selection of her drawings, photographs and handwritten journals suggests why. I can't imagine seeing a more beautiful and tender gallery solo this winter. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, 212-673-3096, talwargallery.com. (Cotter)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'American Modern: Hopper to O'Keeffe' (closes on Sunday) An attempt to prove that the Museum of Modern Art did not neglect American art between the wars before the Abstract Expressionists arrived, this selection of 120 works in several mediums presents plenty to look at in a beautiful installation, but it is completely predictable in its choice of artists and its viewpoint. By making no effort to reimagine early American modernism, it is most notable as evidence of the Modern's current indifference to the field. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
* Noguchi Museum: 'Isamu Noguchi and Qi Baishi: Beijing 1930' (closes on Sunday) Isamu Noguchi worked with the Chinese ink painter Qi Baishi for just six months and could speak to him only through a translator. But this brief, mostly nonverbal tutelage had a lasting impact on Noguchi's art, as we see in this elegant and persuasive exhibition of ink paintings by both artists. Qi helped Noguchi to escape the long shadow of an intense two-year apprenticeship to Brancusi and to develop a new style of abstraction: one that was improvisational, urbane and broadly Asian-inspired. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, 718-204-7088, noguchi.org. (Rosenberg)
Anke Weyer: 'Du' (closes on Sunday) German-born and living in Brooklyn, Anke Weyer has the benefit of multiple art histories to draw from, as well as an irreverence for keeping postwar vocabularies in separate boxes. In her canvases, the brush strokes are bold and strong, like the New York School's, and there are plenty of drips and pours. The colors are electric, like those of Cobra, the group formed by northern Europeans in the early 1950s; stains and washes suggest Tachisme or Post-Painterly Abstraction. But the mark-making feels wonderfully subversive, reminding you that Ms. Weyer also grew up looking at the vernacular cultures of graffiti and punk.

Abstract: Across the country, public school activists and teachers' unions have criticized what they see as a pervasive culture of high-stakes testing that they say can contribute to cheating because educators fear the consequences if they do not raise scores. The Philadelphia district worked with lawyers from the white-collar crime division of the law firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius to review the other 19 schools.

Full text:   The first sign that something was wrong appeared more than two years ago when a company grading student tests from Philadelphia noticed that erasures from wrong to right answers showed what investigators delicately called "statistical evidence of improbable results."
Pennsylvania began an investigation, eventually instructing the school district to look into improprieties at 19 schools. Over the course of a year, the district found disturbing patterns in parts of the system that resulted in three principals being fired last week for test cheating in one of the largest such scandals in the country.
Some administrators were giving answer keys to teachers who passed them on to students. In other cases, principals took completed exams home at night and doctored the answer sheets. And in some schools, teachers and administrators gathered secretly in conference rooms with test booklets, pencils and erasers and changed wrong answers.
"Any time you've got cheating going on by adults, that's egregious," said Michael A. Davis, general counsel to the Philadelphia school district, who described some of the findings of the inquiry.
The tests spanned three years, from 2009 to 2011, and involved 138 educators at 27 schools, three of them public charter schools. The three principals fired last week -- Deidre Bennett at Lewis C. Cassidy Elementary, Michelle Burns at Kensington Urban Education High School and Marla Travis-Curtis at Lamberton Elementary School -- were the first to be disciplined by the district. Twenty other educators have retired, resigned or been laid off for economic reasons, and another 37 are still employed by the district, awaiting disciplinary action.
With the Philadelphia schools struggling to cope with pinched finances and school closings over the past year, the latest scandal is another blight for parents.
"We are cheating the students," said Johnny Bryant, 56, who had come to pick his 7-year-old granddaughter up from Lamberton on Thursday. He said he believed that schools were under pressure to raise test scores, but that grade inflation hurt students by indicating competency that might not exist.
Across the country, public school activists and teachers' unions have criticized what they see as a pervasive culture of high-stakes testing that they say can contribute to cheating because educators fear the consequences if they do not raise scores. School closings and individual teacher evaluations are increasingly based in part on test results.
Inquiries have found cheating in a number of large school districts, including Atlanta, Washington and El Paso. In Atlanta, the investigations led to the indictment of 35 educators, including a former superintendent, Beverly L. Hall. Test cheating incidents have been documented in 38 states in the past five years, said Robert Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, an advocacy group that has been critical of standardized testing.
State and district officials "are being unrealistic about the role of testing," said Helen Gym, a mother of three students in Philadelphia schools and a co-founder of Parents United for Public Education, an advocacy group. "I hope that along with some serious investigation into who did it and what happened that there's a serious amount of reflection on the culture of testing that has really corrupted learning and the education of students."
In the fall of 2011, the state identified 33 Philadelphia schools where at least 10 students in one or more classes had five or more irregular erasures. The state investigated 14 of those schools.
Timothy Eller, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Education, said its investigations were confidential. In an email, Mr. Eller wrote that the state had identified "poor institutional practices in test administration at some schools" as well as "individual educator misconduct."
The Philadelphia district worked with lawyers from the white-collar crime division of the law firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius to review the other 19 schools. The lawyers, who donated their time, scoured the data and interviewed teachers, principals, other administrators and a handful of students. Three schools were cleared of any wrongdoing, and another three were excused for inconclusive evidence.
Mr. Davis, the district general counsel, said that one teacher had bought erasers for every child in her class to use on a test day, and that they had been used. No improprieties were found.
The district is continuing to work through disciplinary hearings for the implicated school employees who are still working.
Mr. Davis would not comment on what the three fired principals had done to warrant action. After school at Lamberton on Thursday, Carletta Davis, a mother of two students and not related to Mr. Davis, said parents were simply told that the principal, Ms. Travis-Curtis, was leaving and would be replaced.
Ms. Davis said Ms. Travis-Curtis, who did not return a call seeking comment, had been at the school for about 12 years, and was well liked.
"I think this is atrocious," said Ms. Davis, 35, who works as a case manager for a low-income child-care agency. "It's the falsification, and the fact that the school district didn't reach out to the parents to let them know exactly what took place. No one knows anything."

Full text:   The crime gripped the public's imagination, for both its magnitude and its moxie: In the predawn hours of Dec. 11, 1978, a group of masked gunmen seized about $6 million in cash and jewels from a cargo building at Kennedy International Airport.
The Lufthansa heist, as it was known, was billed as the biggest cash robbery in United States history, and it played a starring role in the 1990 Martin Scorsese movie "Goodfellas." It remained unsolved for four decades, perhaps because many of those who might have known something turned up dead.
But more than 35 years later, federal authorities on Thursday charged a 78-year-old man, Vincent Asaro, with playing a role in the robbery, saying they had four cooperating witnesses from organized crime families who linked Mr. Asaro, a reputed capo in the Bonanno crime family, to the robbery.
It is an unexpected turn in a famously unsolved case that had long been attributed to the Lucchese crime family. The indictment makes clear that the authorities now are convinced that the Bonanno family was also involved.
The man thought to be the mastermind, a Lucchese associate named James (Jimmy the Gent) Burke, died in 1996 in prison, where he was serving a life sentence in a different case.
The only person ever convicted in the robbery was a Lufthansa cargo agent, described as the "inside man" in the plot.
The indictment, alleging a racketeering conspiracy from 1968 to 2013, represents the first time an organized crime figure has been charged in the $6 million robbery -- the equivalent, adjusted for inflation, of $21.4 million today. But Mr. Asaro, a resident of Howard Beach, Queens, does not appear to have grown rich from the crime; as late as 2011, he was recorded complaining about his take, according to prosecutors.
"We never got our right money, what we were supposed to get," Mr. Asaro said to another mob figure, who is cooperating with the government.
"Jimmy kept everything," he added, apparently a reference to Mr. Burke, according to legal filings by prosecutors.
The indictment charges Mr. Asaro; Jerome Asaro, 55, his son; Jack Bonventre; Thomas DiFiore; and John Ragano with a conspiracy that plays like a Mafia highlights reel: robbery, extortion, murder and more.
Mr. Asaro, for example, was accused in the far-ranging indictment of muscling his way into the pornography business, and of robbing Federal Express of $1.25 million worth of gold salts, which are sometimes used in medicinal treatments. The indictment also accuses him of seeking to have his cousin murdered after the cousin testified in court about an insurance swindle.
"Those suspected of cooperating with law enforcement paid with their lives," said the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch, whose office is prosecuting the case.
Some of the crimes alleged in the indictment predated even the airport heist, including a homicide committed in 1969.
The federal investigation became public in June, when agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation descended on a home owned by Mr. Burke's daughter in the South Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens and began digging in the basement, soon finding human remains.
The remains, the indictment states, belonged to Paul Katz, who was identified in court papers as an associate of Mr. Burke's who had a warehouse used by Mr. Asaro and Mr. Burke to store stolen goods. After the warehouse was raided, Mr. Asaro began to suspect that Mr. Katz was an informant. He later told a government informant that he and Mr. Burke had killed Mr. Katz in 1969 with a dog chain and buried him under cement in a vacant house, according to a legal filing submitted by prosecutors.
Years later, according to a filing, after a police detective reopened the Katz murder case, Mr. Asaro directed his son and another man to dig up the remains, which were then buried under the home of Mr. Burke's daughter.
The five defendants, who investigators said were all linked to the Bonanno family, were arraigned in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where they were ordered held. Each stood with his hands behind his back. Vincent Asaro, who wore a black sweatsuit, running shoes and tinted eyeglasses, pleaded not guilty.
His lawyer, Gerald J. McMahon, said in an interview outside the courtroom, "Literally and truly this is the sequel to 'Goodfellas.' "
"Marty needs a screenplay; Loretta said she would help him out," Mr. McMahon said of Mr. Scorsese and Ms. Lynch, the prosecutor.
"We're confident," he said, noting, "Vincent Asaro said categorically, 'We're going to trial.' "
Prosecutors say that Mr. Asaro is currently a captain in the Bonanno crime family, but that his standing has varied over the years, and that at one point he was demoted for taking too much money from his underlings.
The legal filings by prosecutors do not say precisely what Mr. Asaro's role in the Lufthansa heist might have been, although he is charged with the robbery itself as well as with planning it.
"Asaro himself was in on one of the most notorious heists -- the Lufthansa robbery in 1978," the F.B.I. agent in charge of the New York field office, George Venizelos, said. "It may be decades later, but the F.B.I.'s determination to investigate and bring wiseguys to justice will never waver."
Prosecutors believe that Mr. Asaro gave some of the stolen jewelry to a superior in the Bonanno crime family. That superior later became an informer and is helping prosecutors with the current case, according to a legal filing. The cooperator is not named in court papers but appears to match the description of a former boss of the Bonanno family, Joseph C. Massino.
The F.B.I. agent who supervised the investigation decades ago, Steve Carbone, said in an interview that he had always suspected that Mr. Asaro was "in the mix as a player" who had connections at the airport. But Mr. Carbone, who retired in 1998, said it would be a surprise to him "if Asaro was physically involved in the heist" as one of the gunmen.
Investigators believe that about a half-dozen gunmen were involved in the robbery. Among the suspects, Mr. Carbone said, were Frank Burke, James Burke's son; Thomas DeSimone; Angelo Sepe; and Anthony Rodriguez. They all are dead or presumed dead.
Mr. Burke was eventually sent to prison on information provided by Henry Hill, the mobster-turned-informant of "Goodfellas" fame, who helped plan the Lufthansa heist. But the conviction was unrelated: It involved fixing college basketball games. While in prison, Mr. Burke was convicted in a murder.
The only person convicted of the Lufthansa robbery was the cargo agent, Louis Werner, who had gambling debts to pay off. Mr. Werner took the idea for the crime to his bookmaker, who introduced him to another bookmaker, a beautician from Long Island, who is believed to have passed along the tip to Mr. Burke's crew. Mr. Werner was indicted in March 1979, within four months of the robbery.
Only a tiny fraction of the money stolen at Kennedy Airport was ever recovered.
By 1980, when Mr. Hill began cooperating, several corpses of people connected to the robbery or to its participants had already been discovered.
Mr. Hill died in 2012, having had heart disease and other health problems. It is thought that Mr. Rodriguez might have died from a bite by one of the dozens of pet snakes he kept in his home, according to his lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg. But Mr. Carbone said that over the years, "I got to believe 15 people were killed solely because of this case."

Full text:   Just over a year ago, the Federal Reserve changed its guidance on how long it planned to keep interest rates very low.
The low rate, it said, would "be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent," assuming that inflation and expectations for inflation also remained low.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told a news conference at the time that this signaled no real change from the previous statement that the central bank expected to maintain superlow rates "at least through mid-2015." That was the case, he said on Dec. 12, 2012, because the Fed thought the unemployment rate, at 7.8 percent in the most recent report then available, would stay above 6.5 percent until at least mid-2015.
Next week, Mr. Bernanke's term ends and he will be succeeded by Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman. A week after that will come the January jobs report. With the December unemployment rate at 6.7 percent, it is at least possible that the 6.5 percent target will be reached then, or within a month or two after that. Inflation has remained low.
But do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates anytime soon.
Since the Fed set the 6.5 percent target, the unemployment rate has been the odd man out in terms of economic statistics. It has fallen faster than the Fed, or most private forecasters, expected. But economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, has lagged behind those forecasts. During the last year, as the Fed grew more optimistic about the unemployment rate, it grew less optimistic about overall economic growth.
Ms. Yellen has gone out of her way since then to point to a number of other labor market indicators, none of which have improved as much as the unemployment rate.
The indicators she cited included the number of workers unemployed for extended periods of time.
"We know that long-term unemployment is devastating to workers and their families," she said in a speech last February. "The toll is simply terrible on the mental and physical health of workers, on their marriages, and on their children." She added that "long-term unemployment can make any worker progressively less employable, even after the economy strengthens."
She pointed out that during the worst part of the severe recession of the early 1980s, the median time that unemployed people said they had been unemployed was 12 weeks. That figure peaked at 25 weeks -- nearly six months -- in 2010 and is at 17 weeks in the latest jobs report. Moreover, it has been rising since last summer as those out of work for brief periods found jobs while others did not.
Indeed, the short-term unemployment rate -- the proportion of the labor force out of work for less than 15 weeks -- has fallen to 3.1 percent. It was higher than that before the recession. The reason the overall unemployment rate remains well above prerecession levels is that the long-term unemployment rate is at 3.6 percent and declining only slowly.
Another indicator that Ms. Yellen pointed to reflects how well people with jobs are doing. That is labor's share of income in the nonfinancial corporate sector, a figure estimated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics each quarter.
For decades, from 1950 through the early 2000s, labor's share rarely exceeded 66 percent and almost never fell below 61 percent.
But it fell below 60 percent in 2005 and then plunged after the recession began. The last figure reported was 57.1 percent, barely above the 2011 low.
Ms. Yellen appears to bring to her new job both an economist's love of statistics and a liberal's concern over those who fall behind. That was also shown in her early academic work, which focused on the labor market.
"Bernanke was in place when thwarting depression dynamics was job No. 1," said Robert J. Barbera, the co-director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University. "Yellen takes over amid some challenging issues surrounding labor markets. Given their particular areas of expertise, you have to like the handoff at this juncture," he said. Mr. Bernanke had studied the Great Depression when he was a professor.
In a 1990 paper written with her husband, George A. Ackerlof, also a prominent economist, and Andrew K. Rose, Ms. Yellen pointed to data showing that people who took jobs during recessions tended to receive lower salaries than those of similar people who took jobs during expansions. That might seem obvious, but what was perhaps surprising was that those differences persisted in later years, long after the recession or recovery had ended, at least for people who did not change employers. Even when the job market improved, workers already on staff were not likely to receive raises to the levels that were needed to attract new employees.
Thus, they argued, it could be perfectly rational for a worker to prefer to hold out for a better job that might be available when the economy improved, just as owners of empty new office buildings may prefer to wait for the market to improve rather than accept the depressed rents available during a recession.
Some economists have pointed to the fact that some unemployed workers did not take whatever jobs were available as evidence that they preferred "leisure" over income and even concluded that such preferences argue against providing unemployment insurance because people are unemployed by choice.
"Our model offers an alternative rationale for a high elasticity of labor supply with respect to transitory wage movements," the 1990 paper said, using the kind of stilted language that economists seem to expect. "If the wage were rising more rapidly than the rate of time preference, a rational worker seeking long-term work would optimally wait for work, rather than commit to the best job currently available. This behavior occurs even if workers place no value at all on leisure."
Ms. Yellen and Mr. Ackerlof also advanced what they called the "fair wage-effort hypothesis," saying that workers who were paid what they regarded as less than a fair wage responded by doing a poorer job. That indicates that companies that hold wages down may suffer relative to those that offer better pay and working conditions. They pointed to, among other evidence, a 1987 article in The New York Times by Agis Salpukas that reported that some companies that had instituted dual-tier pay scales were dropping them, having found the system "produced a resentful class of workers who in some cases are taking their hostility out on customers."
At her confirmation hearing in November, Ms. Yellen was asked about the Fed's ability to increase jobs. She conceded there were "a multitude of things" that the Fed could not change, mentioning education and job training.
"But what we can do," she added, "is try to achieve, as we are, a robust recovery so that we create jobs, we have a stronger job market. And in a stronger job market, people who are having a lot of trouble getting jobs will be drawn into jobs. They'll get better jobs. There'll be more training. People will move up job ladders and opportunities will increase." Given her concerns about such issues as long-term unemployment, don't expect a 6.5 percent unemployment rate to foreshadow any meaningful change in Fed policy in the near future.

Full text:   When I asked readers for "neglected topics" that journalists should cover more in 2014, one of the suggestions was a delicate but vital topic: family breakdown and the rise of single-parent households.
This is an issue that, frustratingly, the right has hijacked and the left has been reluctant to confront. Yet it's intimately related to poverty in our country.
"It isn't politically correct to call attention to the effects of the increase in single women giving birth," wrote Colton, one reader who suggested the topic. "Three important effects are the greatly increased incidence of long-term poverty, poor development outcomes and poor educational achievement among the children."
"Our hesitancy to face the problem may result from fear of accusations of being moralists, racists, anti-woman, anti-freedom, supporting government decisions into personal decisions," Lucinda noted.
Conservatives are, I think, correct to highlight family stability as a fundamental issue that goes to the welfare of children as much as food stamps or anything else. Children raised by a single parent are more than three times as likely to live in poverty as those raised by two parents, according to census data.
After Daniel Patrick Moynihan raised the issue in 1965 in the context of black families, he was condemned in liberal circles as intolerant if not racist. Over time, though, there has been a growing appreciation that he was ahead of his time, and as the Urban Institute notes, the percentage of white babies born to unwed mothers is now the same as it was for black babies when he sounded his alarm.
Yet if the issue is critical, it often emerges as part of a narrative that hectors the poor for their poverty. Republicans focus on "personal irresponsibility" or suggest that there's nothing to be done about poverty until "those people" stop having kids outside of marriage.
As I see it, conservatives are right in their diagnosis that the issue is critical in addressing poverty, but they are wrong in their prescriptions, while liberals are often too politically correct to address the issue at all.
First, the backdrop. At last count in the United States, almost 36 percent of births were to unmarried women, according to census data. The birthrate for unmarried women is up 80 percent since 1980.
Furthermore, census data show that a majority of high school dropouts having babies are unmarried; only 9 percent of college graduates are. Two-thirds of black women giving birth are unmarried; just over a quarter of white women are.
Of course, what matters isn't whether the parents have a marriage certificate but whether they are partners who are both committed to raising children they want and love. An Australian study found gay parenting had better outcomes on average, apparently because gay couples don't have kids by accident.
Conservatives blame war-on-poverty welfare programs for undermining marriage. Academic studies indicate that this effect, while real, is small. The percentage of births to single mothers has been rising steadily in the United States (and other countries) since the 1940s.
Republicans tried "marriage promotion" initiatives during the administration of George W. Bush, and these are worth testing, but, so far, they have failed the litmus test. They didn't work. However, there are several steps that we could take:
â-  First is to expand family planning so that teenagers and young adults don't have babies they don't want and are ill-prepared to care for. Four out of five teenage pregnancies are unintended, according to the Guttmacher Institute. It's promising that a randomized trial found that the Carrera pregnancy prevention curriculum in low-income schools reduced teen births by half. Family-planning initiatives save taxpayer money now spent on health care and the safety net, yet, after inflation, America's investment in Title X family planning has fallen some 70 percent since 1980. That's crazy.
â-  Second is to end America's disastrous experiment in mass incarceration. We quintupled incarceration rates since the 1970s, according to the Pew Center on the States, and, thus condemned millions of men -- often men of color or with low incomes -- to life at the margins and made them much less attractive as husbands. If the family has broken down, we helped break it.
â-  Third is to back outreach efforts and job programs that give young people a lift and a stake in the future. Programs like Nurse-Family Partnership that work with low-income mothers have a proven track record of keeping families together. Likewise, an evaluation found that of young mothers in an Illinois outreach effort called Options for Youth, 97 percent delayed a subsequent pregnancy.
Talk about personal responsibility! It's irresponsible on our part to fail to take these steps.
So, readers, thanks for raising this issue. And let's address it not with platitudes but with proven policies that don't just hail the family but also strengthen it.

Full text:   The odds of moving up -- or down -- the income ladder in the United States have not changed appreciably in the last 20 years, according to a large new academic study that contradicts politicians in both parties who have claimed that income mobility is falling.
Both President Obama and leading Republicans, like Representative Paul Ryan, have argued recently that the odds of climbing the income ladder are lower today than in previous decades. The new study, based on tens of millions of anonymous tax records, finds that the mobility rate has held largely steady in recent decades, although it remains lower than in Canada and in much of Western Europe, where the odds of escaping poverty are higher.
Raj Chetty, a professor of economics at Harvard and one of the authors, said in an interview that he and his colleagues still believed that a lack of mobility was a significant problem in the United States. Despite less discrimination of various kinds and a larger safety net than in previous decades, the odds of escaping the station of one's birth are no higher today than they were decades ago.
The results suggested that other forces -- including sharply rising incomes at the top of the ladder, which allows well-off families to invest far more in their children -- were holding back talented people, the authors said.
"The level of opportunity is alarming, even though it's stable over time," said Emmanuel Saez, another author and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Mr. Saez and Mr. Chetty are both recent winners of an award for the top academic economist under the age of 40.
The study has the potential to alter the way Mr. Obama and other public figures talk about mobility trends.
"The facts themselves are pretty unassailable," said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has read the paper, which the authors will soon submit to an academic journal. "How you want to interpret them is the question."
The study found, for instance, that about 8 percent of children born in the early 1980s who grew up in families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution managed to reach the top fifth for their age group today. The rate was nearly identical for children born a decade earlier.
Among children born into the middle fifth of the income distribution, about 20 percent climbed into the top fifth as adults, also largely unchanged over the last decade.
To compare their results to those for earlier decades, the authors noted that a previous study of children born from 1952 to 1975 -- by Chul-In Lee and Gary Solon -- found broadly similar and steady levels of mobility. Taken together, the studies suggest that rates of intergenerational mobility appeared to have held roughly steady over the last half-century, Mr. Chetty said.
Another earlier study -- of the late 19th century, by Joseph P. Ferrie -- suggested that mobility was higher then in the United States than in England, Mr. Autor noted. Sometime after the 1920s, though, social mobility in the United States appeared to have declined, the Ferrie study found.
Today, the odds of escaping poverty appear to be only about half as high in the United States as in the most mobile countries like Denmark, Mr. Saez said.
The new study is based on a much larger data set than previous work. The earlier papers had to rely on surveys, while the latest paper examines the tax records, stripped of identifying details, of nearly every American born in a given year.
The subject of mobility has become politically popular, as Democrats make the case that the affluent are choking off opportunity from others, and Republicans contend that a large, intrusive government is the culprit.
In a December speech at the Center for American Progress, Mr. Obama said, "The problem is that alongside increased inequality, we've seen diminished levels of upward mobility in recent years." Mr. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and a Republican vice-presidential nominee, argued in a speech at the Brookings Institution last week that a smarter, smaller government would allow the country to "get back to those days of upward mobility." The new study focused on a measure known as relative mobility, which tracks where people end up in a national ranking of incomes compared with where they started. If a child ends up in roughly the same place in the income distribution as his or her parents, even if the country as a whole becomes richer, he is not considered to be especially mobile.
But even a second measure -- absolute mobility, which examines people's annual incomes relative to their parents' -- produces a mixed picture.
Absolute mobility has continued to improve in recent decades because incomes have risen; median family income is about 12 percent higher today than in 1980, adjusted for inflation. As a result, most adults today have more income at their disposal than their parents did at the same age.
Yet the growth rate of absolute mobility has slowed, as economic growth has slowed to a disappointing level over the last 15 years. The incomes of middle-class and poor families have slowed even more sharply, because a large share of recent economic gains have gone to a small slice of affluent workers -- often described in political shorthand as "the 1 percent."
Besides Mr. Chetty and Mr. Saez, the other authors of the study are Nathaniel Hendren of Harvard; Patrick Kline of Berkeley; and Nicholas Turner of the Office of Tax Analysis, at the Treasury Department.
As part of the same project, some of the same researchers released a study last summer showing that the odds of escaping poverty in some parts of the United States were much higher than in others.
In the most mobile metropolitan areas, such as Salt Lake City and San Francisco, mobility rates are similar to those in western Europe. In the least mobile areas, including Atlanta, Charlotte and much of the industrial Midwest, the odds are much lower.
The variation, Mr. Saez said, offers hope that researchers will be able to learn more about the factors that contribute to upward mobility.
For all the continuity over recent decades, the authors emphasized that parents appeared to cast a longer shadow over their children's lives, in some ways, than before. As inequality has risen, pushing the rungs on the income ladder further apart than they once were, the average economic penalty of being born poor has grown over time.
"It matters more who your parents are today than it did in the past," Mr. Chetty said.

Full text:   BEIJING -- Activity in China's manufacturing sector contracted in January for the first time in six months as new orders declined, a preliminary private survey showed on Thursday, confirming that a mild slowdown at the end of 2013 has continued into the new year.
The flash Markit/HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.6 in January from December's final reading of 50.5, dropping below the 50 mark that separates expansion of activity from contraction.
The data was this year's first indication of sentiment in the $9.4 trillion economy, the world's second largest after the United States.
"The marginal contraction of January's headline HSBC flash China manufacturing P.M.I. was mainly dragged by cooling domestic demand conditions," said Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC.
"This implies softening growth momentum for manufacturing sectors, which has already weighed on employment growth," he said. "As inflation is not a concern, the policy focus should tilt toward supporting growth to avoid repeating growth deceleration," which occurred in the first half of 2013.
The flash purchasing managers' index showed a faster rate of decrease in new export orders and employment in January. The new orders index came in at 49.8, the first contraction in six months.
Figures on Monday showed China's annual economic growth slowed to a six-month low of 7.7 percent in the October-December quarter.
Momentum has slowed because of a weakening in exports and the government's shift toward restructuring the economy.
While the economy narrowly missed expectations for full-year growth to fall to a 14-year low in 2013, some economists say a further slowdown appears inevitable this year as the Chinese government makes some difficult changes. These include reducing government intervention to allow financial markets to have a bigger say in allocating resources, and promoting domestic consumption at the expense of investment and exports.
Full-year growth in 2013 was 7.7 percent, steady from 2012 and just slightly above market expectations for a 7.6 percent expansion, which would have been the slowest since 1999.

Full text:   LONDON -- When Ireland recently made its first offering of new debt since leaving its bailout program, the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, was already focused on where the money would come from next.
He was in Doha, Qatar, where he and the country's prime minister, Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa al-Thani, smiled broadly as they posed together. The trip, earlier this month, also included a visit to Dubai, where Mr. Kenny and the head of state there, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, sat side by side on velvet and gold thronelike chairs.
Mr. Kenny next went to Riyadh, where he said he was "very much interested in finding out if the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency could resume purchasing Irish bonds as before."
Once again, foreign investors are piling into the government bonds of Ireland, Spain and Portugal -- countries that got into such debt trouble that they required bailouts. Now these countries are able to sell their bonds at lower interest rates than they have seen in years, renewing hope that Europe has turned a corner.
And yet, there are still few signs of relief from the deeper-rooted economic woes that have trapped much of the euro zone in a slump for more than five years -- and that continue to be a drag on the global economy. Despite the suddenly easier terms under which Ireland and other recovering euro zone countries can borrow, the fact remains: These countries are still mired in stagnation.
If investors, in their renewed appetite for euro bonds, are betting on Europe's recovery, it is hardly a no-risk gamble.
"Things are going better, but they are by no means good," said Jacob Kirkegaard, who tracks Europe at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The ratio of Ireland's debt to its economic output has nearly doubled -- to an estimated 124 percent last year, up from 64.4 percent in 2009. And although it technically emerged from its international rescue program in December, Ireland will still be paying off the 67.5 billion euros, or about $91 billion, in bailout money for years to come.
Claus Vistesen, the head of research at Variant Perception, a London-based economic research group, sees the ratio of debt to economic output as a continuing threat to a euro zone recovery.
"People think growth is coming back," Mr. Vistesen said, "but at the end of the day, debt is still going up."
A spokesman for the Irish finance ministry said the country's debt levels were expected to begin edging down this year. The ratings agency Moody's agreed, citing Ireland's improving finances and falling interest rates when it upgraded Irish debt from junk to investment grade last week.
For the euro zone at large, though, a step back often follows each step forward. France and Italy, the bloc's second- and third-largest economies, are increasingly seen as the latest sick men of the Continent. Even Germany, the bloc's powerhouse, grew only feebly last year, by 0.4 percent.
While unemployment, at a lofty 12.1 percent, appears to have stopped increasing, it is not showing signs of marked improvement, with countries like Spain and Greece still mired in Great Depression-era joblessness. Compared with Europe, the United States, despite a lingering unemployment rate of 6.7 percent, seems to be on a roll, growing at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the third quarter.
Economic demand in Europe remains so tepid that inflation rates have fallen to a level that is impeding recovery and threatening to lapse into outright deflation -- a chilling prospect that makes debts more expensive, puts pressure on wages and further discourages consumer spending.
"Europe is hardly roaring back to life," said Nicholas Spiro, the managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London. "Talk about a recovery -- the European Central Bank is still mulling measures to ward off the threat of deflation," he added. "That speaks volumes of the weakness of the euro zone economy, and yet investors are piling into euro zone debt."
Feargal Purcell, the press secretary for the Irish prime minister, said that since Mr. Kenny took office in 2011 he had focused on "rebuilding our reputation," which has included trips to the United States, China, Japan and, most recently, the swing through the Middle East.
"We've exited the bailout, we chose to do so without a precautionary credit line and I think the recent bond sale is an endorsement of that action," he added. "Sixteen hundred jobs a week were being lost before we took office; we're now in a position where 1,200 jobs a week are being created, and our consumer confidence numbers have been steadily growing."
At the same time, he acknowledged, "we still have work to do on the unemployment front, and conversations in Europe with respect to debt sustainability."
Portugal plans its own exit from its bailout program by the middle of the year. And in Spain, where banks required a [euro]41 billion international bailout in 2012, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, told business leaders in the United States this month that "recovery is taking hold, and the country's appeal as an investment target is being rekindled."
More restrained have been nonpoliticians like Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank. Asked at a recent news conference whether it would be premature to declare victory, he said, "I would be very cautious about saying that, very cautious indeed."
"Unemployment stands at over 12 percent," Mr. Draghi continued. "The only positive news is that this unacceptably high unemployment rate is stabilizing," he said.
"The recovery is there, but it is weak; it is modest," he added. "As I have said many times, it is also fragile, meaning that there are several risks -- from financial and economic risks, through geopolitical risks, to political risks."
Some attribute the fact that the bond offerings have been warmly received to institutional investors rotating out of emerging markets like India and Brazil. Money managers worry about the potential global ripple effects as the Federal Reserve begins to taper its economic stimulus program.
Such investors now view some of the European countries that were bailed out as a safer bet. In Ireland, more than 80 percent of the investment came from abroad, with banks and pension funds making up 37 percent of the offering and fund managers about half.
Mr. Kirkegaard cited "the hunt for yield." In this era of low interest rates -- the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury bond now trades at around 2.85 percent -- the higher premiums that countries like Ireland must pay to borrow are a lure to global investors.
"I think it was much more traditional asset managers, pension funds, insurance companies, etc., sitting there, and they probably own a lot of safe-haven assets," Mr. Kirkegaard said. "They are getting less than 2 percent for that, and they are probably thinking these countries are not a real credit risk anymore, so why not take 4 percent instead?"
This week, demand has been such that yields on 10-year Irish bonds fell closer to 3 percent.
Max Golts, a London-based senior investment strategist for Fidelity Investments, said "you could reasonably speculate that Europe is looking safer than emerging markets."
"It's also a matter of fashion and flavor of the month," he added, "and Europe just doesn't look scary at this moment."

American Starts a Luxury Resort to Share the Argentina He Loves

Full text:   VISTA FLORES, Argentina -- It is hard to find fault with lunch at Siete Fuegos, the restaurant at the new Vines Resort & Spa in the Mendoza province. The steak is grilled to medium-rare perfection. The sparkling torrontés wine nicely complements the homemade dulce de leche ice cream. The open-air dining room looks upon acres of vineyards set against the snow-capped Andes.
But Michael Evans, the American entrepreneur behind the Vines, wants to nitpick. As lunch comes to a close, a waiter delivers a cortado -- an espresso with warm milk -- and a plate of cookies to a guest. Mr. Evans quietly suggests to his team in Spanish that if one person at the table gets cookies, everyone should get cookies.
To Mr. Evans, the details matter.
Mr. Evans and his partners are plowing $16 million into the Vines Resort, on a 1,600-acre property aimed at giving guests an "experience" in the Argentine countryside, albeit a highly pampered one. Rooms go for $510 to nearly $2,000 a night, and Mr. Evans wants to make sure that the resort has all the amenities, activities and accouterments -- even the cookies -- to justify those prices.
"Our focus on everything is: What is this going to do for the customer?" Mr. Evans said. "I am much more a customer than a winemaker or a hotelier."
The team at the Vines is among a growing number of investors who are building or expanding high-end properties here, in the belief that Mendoza has the potential to be the next Napa Valley, Calif., or Bordeaux, France.
As demand outstripped supply at the nine-year-old Cavas Wine Lodge, the owners recently added three villas, bringing the total rooms to 18. José Manuel Ortega Gil-Fournier, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker who founded the O. Fournier boutique winery, is hoping to break ground on a 40-room hotel early this year. Youngwoo & Associates, the New York developer behind the redesign of Pier 57 in Manhattan, is working on a private vineyard project just south of Mendoza city, with plans to eventually open a luxury hotel.
"For the longest time, we have been interested in South America. It was really gaining a lifestyle that we hadn't really seen before on this continent," said Bryan Woo, the director of acquisitions for Youngwoo, who is leading the Mendoza project. "People are going to discover Mendoza. We're banking on that."
Mendoza is decades behind more established wine regions in the United States and Europe, so developers still have room to grow. Land prices are relatively low. And beyond the city center, there are few high-end hotels. Competition here is friendly, even supportive.
When Mr. Evans decided to open the Vines Resort, he sought the counsel of the established players like the founders of Cavas. "People talk about competition, but it is such a small pool at the high end," he said. Other hoteliers, he said, are willing to provide guidance. The more players, the thinking goes, the better it will be for Mendoza broadly.
But Argentina presents its own challenges. Inflation runs high. Official government figures put it at more than 10 percent, although economists estimate that it is more like 25 percent. In the United States, inflation is less than 2 percent.
In such an environment, labor costs and other expenses can jump substantially each year. But hotels cannot necessarily increase their rates in tandem. Cecilia Diaz Chuit, who founded Cavas with her husband, Martín Rigal, decided to expand last year to bolster revenue and help offset increased costs.
"We cannot raise our rates anymore. We have reached a limit," Ms. Diaz Chuit said. Rooms at Cavas cost roughly $700 a night in the high season. "So we have created different products at Cavas. That was our way to fight inflation."
In Argentina's hit-or-miss economy, investors have to be willing to ride out the ups and downs. Mr. Ortega Gil-Fournier, who set up his winery in 2000, planned to build a hotel in 2007. But then the global financial crisis hit, Argentina's economy swooned, and he mothballed the plan. While Argentina remains on shaky ground, Mr. Ortega Gil-Fournier said he was now willing to take the risk, citing the potential of the country.
"It's really challenging. You have to pay a lot more attention to the macroeconomic factors," Mr. Evans said. "You certainly wouldn't invest unless you think long term."
Mr. Evans, 48, first saw the promise of Mendoza a decade ago. After working on John Kerry's failed presidential campaign, Mr. Evans, a political consultant, took a vacation in Argentina to rest, relax and enjoy wine. He never left.
Enamored of Argentina, Mr. Evans and a friend decided to start a business selling vineyards. The company would do all the work -- planting, harvesting, blending and bottling -- for investors who want to create their bespoke wine. He initially bought 100 acres in the Uco Valley for about $500,000. The area, about two hours south of Mendoza city, was largely undeveloped. And the terroir -- the land, the soil and the altitude -- offered the potential for high-quality wines.
That business, the Vines of Mendoza, now has 135 vineyard owners and creates 225 wines, including its own brand, Recuerdo. An acre goes for $85,000. And the company has a tasting room and a wine bar in the city, where tourists can sample a variety of wines from the area. As the business evolved, a resort, Mr. Evans said, seemed like a natural extension of the business.
Like many developers in Argentina, Mr. Evans has largely relied on outside investors to help finance expansion. Mortgages are not common. And while investors can tap into government loans, the bureaucratic process can be tricky and time-consuming. In 2013, Mr. Evans raised nearly $8 million from angel investors, mainly friends, relatives and vineyard owners.
At Vines, Mr. Evans says he is trying to create a sense of place. In doing so, he is drawing on the landscape and history of Mendoza. A dusty running path winds through acres of malbec, cabernet sauvignon and other grape vines. The walls are built with stones dug from around the property. The top Argentine chef Francis Mallmann draws upon open-air cooking techniques for Siete Fuegos, which means seven fires in Spanish. Guests get their own personal "gaucho" -- a play off the traditional Argentine cowboy -- to set up winery excursions, horse rides, or even helicopter trips for backcountry skiing.
Wine serves as a centerpiece. Guests can spend a day with an agronomist planting malbec vines in the spring or helping with the harvest in the fall. At the on-site tasting room, they can learn to blend grapes or sample a 2013 torrontés directly from a stainless steel cask. Construction has started on a winemakers village. The village will bring together top winemakers like Santiago Achával, the founder of Achával-Ferrer Winery, which specializes in malbec.
As workers put the finishing touches on the resort late last year, Mr. Evans, with Maria Uco, his dog, at his side, talked animatedly about the next steps. He pointed to nearby vineyards, and laid out plans for a yoga platform. Off in the distance, he says, he wants to upgrade an old ramada, an outdoor pavilion that can be used for asados, Argentine barbecues. The soon-to-be-built gym will be elevated, giving treadmill-runners the sense that they are floating above the vineyards.
"It's about coming to Mendoza," Mr. Evans said. "I came here on vacation, fell in love with the place, and stayed. So how do I give people that?"

Abstract: Rafael Ramírez, the powerful president of the state oil company, who is also the energy minister and vice president in charge of the economy, said last month that the break-even cost of high-octane gasoline, which is what most people buy, would be the equivalent of $1.62 a gallon, far higher than what is charged now.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela has the world's cheapest gasoline, about 6 cents a gallon, a price so low that drivers often fill their tanks for less than a dollar and tip the gas station attendant more than the cost of the fuel pumped into their cars.
With their country holding the world's largest estimated oil reserves, many Venezuelans consider cheap gas almost an inalienable right of citizenship -- a coveted remnant of the boom days when Venezuela saw itself riding its oil riches to a first world dream of wealth and status.
But the illusion of inexhaustible wealth that every citizen can effortlessly tap into at the nearest gas station may finally crash into hard reality. President Nicolás Maduro has called for what was once unthinkable: It is time, he has said, to raise the price at the pump.
"I am in total agreement that they should raise it," said Luis Gelvis, 45, a warehouse worker, as he had stopped to fill his aging Chevrolet S.U.V. for 48 cents, less than half the price of a cup of coffee.
But when the gas station attendant pointed out that if the price rose, filling up might cost a couple of dollars, the smile quickly disappeared from Mr. Gelvis's face.
"No way! That's too much," he said. "If they raise it that much there will be strikes. We'll have people blocking roads."
Mr. Maduro has not said when or how much he will raise the price, which has been frozen for 15 years, but the urgency in this beleaguered economy is clear. By some estimates, the government is giving away $30 billion worth of gasoline, diesel and other fuels each year, a huge loss at a time when it is running a large deficit, forcing it to print money. The state oil company is borrowing millions of dollars from the central bank to keep running, the country endures chronic shortages of basic goods, and last year inflation hit 56 percent, one of the highest rates in the world.
But raising fuel prices can be politically risky, especially for a president like Mr. Maduro, who has struggled for acceptance during his first year in office, often viewed as a pale shadow of his charismatic predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez. He narrowly won an election to replace Mr. Chávez, who died last year, and many ardent Chávez supporters said they had voted for him only out of loyalty to their beloved leader.
Even Mr. Chávez, who led Venezuela for 14 years and was critical of the fuel subsidies, never ventured to raise gas prices. Part of the taboo here is a common association between a gasoline price increase in 1989 and days of rioting in which hundreds of people died.
"The fact that a government that has been so reluctant to do this is finally saying they need to do this tells you how bad things must be," Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College, said of the economic situation in Venezuela.
The balancing act is a common one for developing nations, particularly those rich in natural resources. In Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and other parts of Asia, protests have erupted in recent years when governments have cut fuel subsidies. In Indonesia, a 30 percent increase in fuel prices in 2008 led to bloody rioting. In oil-rich Nigeria, protesters paralyzed the nation in 2012 over a rollback in fuel subsidies. In Bolivia, protesters laid siege to the capital in 2010, forcing President Evo Morales, a close ally of Mr. Maduro, to quickly abandon a cut in gasoline subsidies.
Venezuelan officials have said the increase here will probably be gradual, with the goal of eventually charging enough to cover the costs of producing the gasoline.
"What is fair is to say that we have to charge for the hydrocarbons that we sell in the domestic market because we are paying for people to fill their tanks," Mr. Maduro said this month. He denied that the government needed the extra income to balance its books this year and called for a national dialogue on the issue. But he has insisted that an increase will happen.
"Will it go?" he said late last month. "It will go."
Rafael Ramírez, the powerful president of the state oil company, who is also the energy minister and vice president in charge of the economy, said last month that the break-even cost of high-octane gasoline, which is what most people buy, would be the equivalent of $1.62 a gallon, far higher than what is charged now.
Venezuelans use about 323,000 barrels of gasoline a day, Mr. Ramírez said last year. And despite having enormous oil reserves, Venezuela has imported tens of thousands of barrels of gasoline a day from the United States over the last two years, according to the Energy Information Administration in Washington, because of problems at refineries. So in effect, the Venezuelan government has been paying market prices -- which averaged about $2.70 a gallon last year -- to import gasoline that it gives away almost for free.
"This is a crazy subsidy," said Francisco J. Monaldi, a visiting professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government who studies national oil companies in Latin America.
He said the lost income from fuel subsidies was more than what the government spent on education and health care combined.
Despite the socialist orientation of Venezuela's government, the wealthy and middle class benefit greatly from the fuel subsidy because they are more likely to have a car, while the poor primarily benefit through the effect on mass transportation fares. Two researchers at the Harvard Kennedy School, José Ramón Morales and Douglas Barrios, calculated that the value of the gasoline subsidy for the top 10 percent of households in 2010 was about $3,755 a year, compared with $506 a year for the bottom 10 percent.
Mr. Monaldi said many poor Venezuelans understood that the gasoline price was unsustainable and that they received relatively little benefit from it. And yet they generally oppose raising the price, even if the government pledges to spend the money raised on social programs, because they do not trust politicians to deliver on promises.
That distrust goes to the heart of many Venezuelans' attitudes toward cheap gasoline -- in a country where roads are bad, crime is out of control, and schools and hospitals are often in poor shape, the low prices are citizens' most immediate link to the country's oil riches.
"They think this is the only way in which they will directly receive part of the oil wealth," Mr. Monaldi said.
Rubén García, 63, a dentist filling his tank at a gas station, said he was in favor of raising the gasoline price, with a caveat. "It depends what the government is going to do with the new income," he said. "If they're just going to line their pockets, it would be better to leave it like it is."
Mr. Maduro has floated the possibility of earmarking the revenue from domestic gasoline sales for social programs like housing or education.
Many oil-producing countries sell their citizens cheap gasoline, but Venezuela is an outlier even in such company. A 2012 survey commissioned by the German government found that Venezuelan fuel prices were the world's cheapest, far below those of other major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia, where gasoline costs the equivalent of about 60 cents a gallon, and Nigeria, where it costs $2.35.
The cheap gasoline means that old gas guzzlers clog the streets of Caracas and other large cities, since Venezuelans have little incentive to change.
"The problem is that Venezuelans feel that they have the right to free gasoline," said María Isabel Peña, the director of the Urban Studies Institute at the Central University of Venezuela. The end of cheap gasoline, she said, could be "the start of making people understand the reality of the situation."

Abstract: The reality of rising American inequality is stark. Since the late 1970s real wages for the bottom half of the work force have stagnated or fallen, while the incomes of the top 1 percent have nearly quadrupled (and the incomes of the top 0.1 percent have risen even more). The DiCaprio movie of that name, by the way, is wildly popular with finance types, who cheer on the title character -- another clue to the realities of our new Gilded Age.

Full text:   The reality of rising American inequality is stark. Since the late 1970s real wages for the bottom half of the work force have stagnated or fallen, while the incomes of the top 1 percent have nearly quadrupled (and the incomes of the top 0.1 percent have risen even more). While we can and should have a serious debate about what to do about this situation, the simple fact -- American capitalism as currently constituted is undermining the foundations of middle-class society -- shouldn't be up for argument.
But it is, of course. Partly this reflects Upton Sinclair's famous dictum: It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it. But it also, I think, reflects distaste for the implications of the numbers, which seem almost like an open invitation to class warfare -- or, if you prefer, a demonstration that class warfare is already underway, with the plutocrats on offense.
The result has been a determined campaign of statistical obfuscation. At its cruder end this campaign comes close to outright falsification; at its more sophisticated end it involves using fancy footwork to propagate what I think of as the myth of the deserving rich.
For an example of de facto falsification, one need look no further than a recent column by Bret Stephens of The Wall Street Journal, which first accused President Obama (wrongly) of making a factual error, then proceeded to assert that rising inequality was no big deal, because everyone has been making big gains. Why, incomes for the bottom fifth of the U.S. population have risen 186 percent since 1979!
If this sounds wrong to you, it should: that's a nominal number, not corrected for inflation. You can find the inflation-corrected number in the same Census Bureau table; it shows incomes for the bottom fifth actually falling. Oh, and for the record, at the time of writing this elementary error had not been corrected on The Journal's website.
O.K., that's what crude obfuscation looks like. What about the fancier version?
I've noted before that conservatives seem fixated on the notion that poverty is basically the result of character problems among the poor. This may once have had a grain of truth to it, but for the past three decades and more the main obstacle facing the poor has been the lack of jobs paying decent wages. But the myth of the undeserving poor persists, and so does a counterpart myth, that of the deserving rich.
The story goes like this: America's affluent are affluent because they made the right lifestyle choices. They got themselves good educations, they got and stayed married, and so on. Basically, affluence is a reward for adhering to the Victorian virtues.
What's wrong with this story? Even on its own terms, it postulates opportunities that don't exist. For example, how are children of the poor, or even the working class, supposed to get a good education in an era of declining support for and sharply rising tuition at public universities? Even social indicators like family stability are, to an important extent, economic phenomena: nothing takes a toll on family values like lack of employment opportunities.
But the main thing about this myth is that it misidentifies the winners from growing inequality. White-collar professionals, even if married to each other, are only doing O.K. The big winners are a much smaller group. The Occupy movement popularized the concept of the "1 percent," which is a good shorthand for the rising elite, but if anything includes too many people: most of the gains of the top 1 percent have in fact gone to an even tinier elite, the top 0.1 percent.
And who are these lucky few? Mainly they're executives of some kind, especially, although not only, in finance. You can argue about whether these people deserve to be paid so well, but one thing is clear: They didn't get where they are simply by being prudent, clean and sober.
So how can the myth of the deserving rich be sustained? Mainly through a strategy of distortion by dilution. You almost never see apologists for inequality willing to talk about the 1 percent, let alone the really big winners. Instead, they talk about the top 20 percent, or at best the top 5 percent. These may sound like innocent choices, but they're not, because they involve lumping in married lawyers with the wolves of Wall Street. The DiCaprio movie of that name, by the way, is wildly popular with finance types, who cheer on the title character -- another clue to the realities of our new Gilded Age.
Again, I know that these realities make some people, not all of them hired guns for the plutocracy, uncomfortable, and they'd prefer to paint a different picture. But even if the facts have a well-known populist bias, they're still the facts -- and they must be faced.

Full text:   CONWAY, Ark. -- Kim Little had not thought much about the tiny white spot on the side of her cheek until a physician's assistant at her dermatologist's office warned that it might be cancerous. He took a biopsy, returning 15 minutes later to confirm the diagnosis and schedule her for an outpatient procedure at the Arkansas Skin Cancer Center in Little Rock, 30 miles away.
That was the prelude to a daylong medical odyssey several weeks later, through different private offices on the manicured campus at the Baptist Health Medical Center that involved a dermatologist, an anesthesiologist and an ophthalmologist who practices plastic surgery. It generated bills of more than $25,000.
"I felt like I was a hostage," said Ms. Little, a professor of history at the University of Central Arkansas, who had been told beforehand that she would need just a couple of stitches. "I didn't have any clue how much they were going to bill. I had no idea it would be so much."
Ms. Little's seemingly minor medical problem -- she had the least dangerous form of skin cancer -- racked up big bills because it involved three doctors from specialties that are among the highest compensated in medicine, and it was done on the grounds of a hospital. Many specialists have become particularly adept at the business of medicine by becoming more entrepreneurial, protecting their turf through aggressive lobbying by their medical societies, and most of all, increasing revenues by offering new procedures -- or doing more of lucrative ones.
It does not matter if the procedure is big or small, learned in a decade of training or a weeklong course. In fact, minor procedures typically offer the best return on investment: A cardiac surgeon can perform only a couple of bypass operations a day, but other specialists can perform a dozen procedures in that time span.
That math explains why the incomes of dermatologists, gastroenterologists and oncologists rose 50 percent or more between 1995 and 2012, even when adjusted for inflation, while those for primary care physicians rose only 10 percent and lag far behind, since insurers pay far less for traditional doctoring tasks like listening for a heart murmur or prescribing the right antibiotic.
By 2012, dermatologists -- whose incomes were more or less on par with internists in 1985 -- had become the fourth-highest earners in American medicine in some surveys, bringing in an average of $471,555, according to the Medical Group Management Association, which tracks doctors' income, though their workload is one of the lightest.
In addition, salary figures often understate physician earning power since they often do not include revenue from business activities: fees for blood or pathology tests at a lab that the doctor owns or "facility" charges at an ambulatory surgery center where the physician is an investor, for example.
"The high earning in many fields relates mostly to how well they've managed to monetize treatment -- if you freeze off 18 lesions and bill separately for surgery for each, it can be very lucrative," said Dr. Steven Schroeder, a professor at the University of California and the chairman of the National Commission on Physician Payment Reform, an initiative funded in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
Doctors' charges -- and the incentives they reflect -- are a major factor in the nation's $2.7 trillion medical bill. Payments to doctors in the United States, who make far more than their counterparts in other developed countries, account for 20 percent of American health care expenses, second only to hospital costs.
Specialists earn an average of two and often four times as much as primary care physicians in the United States, a differential that far surpasses that in all other developed countries, according to Miriam Laugesen, a professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. That earnings gap has deleterious effects: Only an estimated 25 percent of new physicians end up in primary care, at the very time that health policy experts say front-line doctors are badly needed, according to Dr. Christine Sinsky, an Iowa internist who studies physician satisfaction. In fact, many pediatricians and general doctors in private practice say they are struggling to survive.
Studies show that more specialists mean more tests and more expensive care. "It may be better to wait and see, but waiting doesn't make you money," said Jean Mitchell, a professor of health economics at Georgetown University. "It's 'Let me do a little snip of tissue' and then they get professional, lab and facility fees. Each patient is like an ATM machine."
For example, the procedure performed on Ms. Little, called Mohs surgery, involves slicing off a skin cancer in layers under local anesthesia, with microscopic pathology performed between each "stage" until the growth has been removed. While it offers clear advantages in certain cases, it is more expensive than simply cutting or freezing off a lesion. (Hospitals seeking to hire a staff dermatologist for Mohs surgery had to offer an average of $586,083 in 2010, even more than for a cardiac surgeon, according to Becker's Hospital Review.)
Use of the surgery has skyrocketed in the United States -- over 400 percent in a little over a decade -- to the point that last summer Medicare put it at the top of its "potentially misvalued" list of overused or overpriced procedures. Even the American Academy of Dermatology agrees that the surgery is sometimes used inappropriately. Dr. Brett Coldiron, president-elect of the academy, defended skin doctors as "very cost-efficient" specialists who deal in thousands of diagnoses and called Mohs "a wonderful tool." He said that his specialty was being unfairly targeted by insurers because of general frustration with medical prices. "Health care reform is a subsidized buffet and if it's too expensive, you go to the kitchen and shoot one of the cooks," he said. "Now they're shooting dermatologists."
The specialists point to an epidemic, noting there are two million to four million skin cancers diagnosed in the United States each year, with a huge increase in basal cell carcinomas, the type Ms. Little had, which usually do not metastasize. (A small fraction of the cancers are melanomas, a far more serious condition.) But, said Dr. Cary Gross, a cancer epidemiologist at Yale University Medical School, "The real question is: Is there a true epidemic or is there an epidemic of biopsies and treatments that are not needed? I think the answer is both."
Patient Given No Choice
A fair-skinned redhead who teaches history at the University of Central Arkansas, Ms. Little had gone to a private dermatology practice in Heber Springs, Ark., to check some moles on her arms when the physician's assistant on duty noticed a whitish bump -- like a "tiny fragment of thread" -- on her face, she said. Her family practitioner had told her it was just a clogged pore.
A diligent medical consumer, Ms. Little had read up on the Mohs technique (invented by Dr. Frederic Mohs in 1938) before she and her husband arrived for her surgery in November 2012 in a doctors' office building at Baptist Health Medical Center here. Pressed for time as the end of the semester approached, she asked Dr. Randall Breau, the dermatologist, why the tiny growth needed the specialized surgery, as she had asked the physician's assistant earlier. They both answered that it was because it was on her eyelid, a delicate area where Mohs surgery is always required; she repeatedly insisted that it was on her cheekbone below her eye.
After the 30-minute removal, the dermatologist told her that she would have to go across the street to the Arkansas Center for Oculoplastic Surgery, another private doctors' office on the hospital's campus, to have the wound closed by a plastic surgeon with "a couple of stitches."
When Ms. Little protested that she did not want a plastic surgeon and did not care about having a tiny scar, the doctor told her she had no choice, she said. The vast majority of Mohs procedures are sewed up by the dermatologist or just bandaged and left to heal. Yet when Ms. Little arrived at the second practice, nurses took her clothes, put in an IV, and introduced her to an anesthesiologist who would sedate her in an operating room.
Sitting in her cozy office recently, Ms. Little, who has a faint scar under her eye on her right cheek, still fumes at the thought. "It was no bigger than many cuts that heal on their own, and it definitely could have been repaired by one doctor, but at that point what was I going to do?" she recalled. "I have an IV in my arm and a hole in my face that Dr. Breau refused to stitch. And the anesthesiologist is standing there with his mask on."
Her bills included $1,833 for the Mohs surgery, $14,407 for the plastic surgeon, $1,000 for the anesthesiologist, and $8,774 for the hospital charges.
Mohs surgery is preferable when the removal of a skin cancer is complicated or in a sensitive area, because it typically excises less tissue and leaves less of a scar than other treatments and allows dermatologists to see the borders of a growth and be confident that it is removed entirely. The surgery is generally not used for melanomas, which require more extensive cutting.
In an email, Dr. Breau declined to discuss Ms. Little's case, but noted, "When I make decisions concerning patient care, I have only the patient's best interests in mind." He said that he and one partner own the Arkansas Skin Cancer and Dermatology Center and receive no payments from the hospital or the doctors to whom they refer patients. In most cases, he said, he takes care of the wound left by Mohs surgery himself. The plastic surgeon did not respond to requests for comment.
It is often impossible in any one case to determine whether a course of treatment was necessary or cost-effective. Even among doctors there are differences of opinion about optimal treatments. That is partly because the guidelines for when to perform many procedures are often ill-defined or based on the specialists' experience rather than carefully controlled research.
"Though Mohs surgery is disseminating rapidly, there are very few comparative studies and the evidence is still evolving about when it's beneficial," said Dr. Gross, the Yale epidemiologist. "When people are trained to perform a procedure, and believe in it, and equip their offices to do it, they will do it. That's just human nature."
The same specialties tend to appear at the top of physician earners: orthopedics, cardiology, anesthesiology, radiology, dermatology, plastic surgery, urology, gastroenterology and ophthalmology. Physicians in those fields typically earn more than $350,000 annually, according to American Medical Group Association, a trade organization. In many specialties, income has risen more than 10 percent since 2011, according to Medscape, a Web company that follows the industry.
Physicians often complain that government and commercial insurance reimbursements for seeing patients are decreasing while their office expenses are going up to deal with mountains of paperwork and demands from insurers. Congress currently is considering a bill that would freeze doctors' Medicare fees for the next decade. Still, many doctors have found alternative income streams that do not show up on surveys.
Dr. Mitchell of Georgetown University estimates, for example, that many urologists make 50 percent of their income from dealing with patients and the rest from investing in the machines that deliver radiation for prostate cancer or to treat kidney stones. In 2012, urologists had an average income of $416,322, according to Medical Group Management Association data, which often does not include the investment income.
Oncologists benefit from the ability to mark up (and profit from) each dose of chemotherapy they administer in private offices, a practice increased dramatically in the late 1990s. The median compensation for oncologists nearly doubled from 1995 to 2004, to $350,000, according to the M.G.M.A. One study last year attributed 65 percent of the revenue in a typical oncology practice to such payments.
When policy makers reduce one type of payment, some specialists find another. Though orthopedists' reimbursement from Medicare for performing joint replacements has gone down in the last two decades, the Medscape survey on physician income showed that orthopedists' average compensation has risen 27 percent since 2011. They are still paid handsomely by many private payers for many minor procedures, and -- more important -- often own the surgery centers, scanners and physical therapy offices they use.
In a country where top hospital executives typically make more than a million dollars a year, American physicians may feel entitled to high fees, especially because they face costs that their European counterparts do not: Medical school is expensive and new doctors graduate with an average of about $150,000 in debt. Likewise, some specialists face malpractice premiums of over $100,000 a year.
Though medical societies tend to point to the long haul of medical training and the unpredictable hours to justify generous salaries, health economists point out there is often little correlation between compensation and that investment of time. Obstetricians, for example, arguably have the most rigorous schedules but are relatively modest earners. A number of high-income specialties -- radiology, ophthalmology, anesthesiology and dermatology -- are often called the "lifestyle specialties," because training is more compatible with a home life than some other disciplines and there are fewer emergencies in these fields. Eighty percent of dermatologists see patients 40 hours or fewer each week, according to a 2013 Medscape report, less than the average doctor.
Profitable Dermatology
In America's for-profit, fee-for-service medical system, dermatology has proved especially profitable because it offers doctors diverse revenue streams -- from cosmetic treatments that are fully paid by the patient to medical treatments that are covered by insurance.
Cosmetic dermatology is a big moneymaker in high-income markets like New York and Miami. Botox injections take 15 minutes and cost a minimum of $500; doctors pay about $100 for the amount of medicine needed for a typical session, according to dermatologists. Still, cosmetic work makes up less than 10 percent of all skin procedures, studies show, and their volume tends to fluctuate with the economy.
For medical treatment, many dermatologists have been able to compensate for cutbacks in insurance payments by offering new services and by increasing their patient volume through hiring "physician extenders" -- nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants -- to do basic tasks like biopsies and chemical peels. Whether the physician or the nurse wields the scalpel, the charge is generally the same.
The dermatology office where Ms. Little's initial biopsy was performed is one of six satellite offices operated by the Arkansas Skin Cancer and Dermatology Center. They are often staffed by physician assistants, who refer patients to the dermatologists in Little Rock for Mohs surgery. The dermatologists also do their own pathology, meaning that they can sometimes bill extra for that service. (That also means there is no independent confirmation of a cancer diagnosis.)
With such practices, even minor dermatology procedures can lead to big bills. When Ashley Lanning, 28, of Oregon was seen by a nurse practitioner for a mole removal, the tab came to $915.46 -- "way more than I'd anticipated," she said. The growth was scraped off with a scalpel and no stitches were required. In New York last year, Kyle Snow Schwartz, 26, went to a dermatologist at New York University Medical Center to have a wart removed from his foot. The visit took five minutes, including a chat about his plans to teach English in Vietnam and a squirt of liquid nitrogen on the growth. The invoice from the billing office: $500.
Both patients have insurance with high deductibles, so they faced large out-of-pocket payments.
In contrast, in Germany where private doctors' allowable charges are set by the government, dermatologists are paid $30 for a whole body skin check, $40 for a standard biopsy and $20 for a pathology exam, said Dr. Matthias Augustin, who studies the practice of dermatology at the University Medical Center of Hamburg-Eppendorf. There is far less use of Mohs surgery in Germany than in the United States, he said. Most patients with a possible skin cancer get a biopsy and come back a few days later for full removal if it is positive.
Harris Williams and Company, a consulting firm, estimates the $10.1 billion dermatology market in the United States will grow to over $13 billion by 2017, in part because of an aging population. The Affordable Care Act requires 100 percent coverage for preventive dermatology screening sessions for seniors, which will inevitably lead to more biopsies and treatment. With more doctors being trained in Mohs surgery -- generally an extra year of training, though it is not required -- it has become a go-to treatment. Dr. Coldiron, who is a past president of the American College of Mohs' Surgery, said it was "not generally overvalued," adding that the cure rate after a single treatment was somewhat higher than with other techniques, avoiding the need for a second procedure. He said that Mohs typically cost only 30 percent more than the standard procedure. But Healthcare Blue Book, which tracks pricing in the private market, found that payments by insurers for Mohs surgery were typically twice as high.
Dr. Coldiron acknowledged that Mohs was not appropriate for "every little bitty thing." Indeed, to stem the use of Mohs surgery where cheaper procedures would suffice, the American Academy of Dermatology in 2012 issued "appropriateness" guidelines about what kinds of cancers should be treated with the technique -- such as those on the eyelids or nose, or those that were large or deep.
At the annual meeting of the Pacific Dermatology Association this fall, Dr. Sumaira Aasi, a Stanford dermatologist, told her colleagues that Medicare would come after dermatologists if those guidelines were not heeded, noting: "We might be killing the goose that laid the golden egg ourselves."
The Medical Lobby
More than 750 lobbyists represent groups of health professionals in Washington, pushing back on any effort to limit their incomes. The biggest spenders on lobbying -- $80 million annually by health professionals -- closely align with the highest-paid specialties.
Medicare's valuation of physicians' services is based on a complex algorithm that is intended to take into account the time and skill required to perform a medical task, with an adjustment made for a specialty's malpractice rates. Many insurers follow Medicare's lead, often paying anywhere from 80 percent to 200 percent of the Medicare fee. But "time and skill" are easier to quantify for procedures than continuing patient management. And, experts say, Medicare has not reduced payments for many procedures that now take far less time than when they were invented, because of improvements in efficiency or technology.
But renegotiating payments involves a highly contentious process that plays out behind closed doors at the American Medical Association's Relative Value Scale Update Committee, which consists of doctors representing 26 medical disciplines who advise Medicare. In dermatology trade journals, Dr. Coldiron, who has served on the committee, describes it like this: "Everybody sits around a table and tries to strip money away from another specialty." It's like "26 sharks in a tank with nothing to eat but each other."
Primary care doctors -- who make up only 12 percent of physicians in practice -- say they have little clout, with at most five representatives on the panel. "That committee keeps the perverse incentives in place," said Brian Crownover, a family physician from Boise, Idaho.
Indeed, less than two years ago, Dr. Coldiron predicted that reimbursement for Mohs surgery could drop 20 percent. But that did not happen. When Medicare placed Mohs on its list of potentially misvalued procedures last summer, it was deluged with protests from dermatologists, and the A.M.A. Update Committee declared Mohs surgery worthwhile.
This year, Medicare reimbursement will drop only about 2 percent to about $1,000 for a typical procedure. (In recent years, the American Academy of Dermatology Association -- the dermatology academy's political action committee -- has also fought proposed Medicare requirements that dermatologists provide preoperative pictures of lesions they had treated with Mohs surgery, and it has pushed states to classify Botox injections as well as skin procedures using lasers as "the practice of medicine," to prevent spas from offering such services.)
Critics say the robust revenues from doing procedures has led to overuse -- colonoscopies by gastroenterologists, steroid injections by pain specialists and M.R.I. scans by orthopedists, to name a few. Dr. Thomas Balestreri, a recently retired anesthesiologist from Washington State, said in an interview that to increase revenue, some fellow specialists used an ultrasound to guide placement of a nerve block when it was not really needed.
But in some cases dollars from procedures keep practices afloat, because insurers pay so little for time with patients. Dr. Stephen Asher, a neurologist in Boise, Idaho, said his 50 to 60 hours a week seeing patients accounts for only about 10 percent of his income. To cover office expenses he relies on revenue from performing a few procedures -- Botox injections for eye movement disorders and muscle conduction studies -- as well as from an M.R.I. scanner that he co-owns with a group of orthopedists and neurologists.
Outrage at Charges
Ms. Little left Baptist Health Medical Center with a tiny skin flap and more than two dozen stitches. For five days she said she was "hung over" from the IV sedation that she had not wanted -- a problem because she drives 60 miles on rural Arkansas roads to her university each day.
She spent months arguing down her bills, which were finally reduced: About $1,400 for the Mohs surgeon, $765 for the anesthesiologist, $1,375 for the ophthalmological plastic surgeon, plus $1,050 in operating-room charges from the hospital.
For her follow-up, she refused to return to Baptist Health and went instead to the University of Arkansas Medical Center, where a dermatologist told her she likely had not needed such an extensive procedure. But that was hard to judge, since the records forwarded from Baptist did not include the photo that was taken of the initial lesion.
And she was outraged as she wrote checks for the nearly $3,000 she owed to the doctors under the terms of her insurance. "It was like, 'Take out your purse, we're robbing you,' " she said.

Full text:   To the Editor:
Re "The Inequality Problem," by David Brooks (column, Jan. 17):
Discussions about raising the minimum wage often focus on single motherhood, school dropouts and damaging youthful behavior to explain the lack of social mobility, but not inequality per se. The jobs at the bottom will remain even when individuals rise to better ones.
Mr. Brooks relies upon one negative study of the effect of raising the minimum wage, ignoring dozens that report the benefits of higher wages at the bottom. Instead of bouncing between warring studies, why not collect a decisive amount of data by raising the minimum wage and observing its consequences?
JOYCE APPLEBY Taos, N.M., Jan. 17, 2014
The writer is professor emerita of history at U.C.L.A.
To the Editor:
David Brooks offers a reasonable if only partial diagnosis of the problems of poverty. He properly notes the low social mobility of those in the lowest and highest socioeconomic strata. But he goes to great lengths to distance income inequality from poverty and related social problems.
He suggests that our attention on income inequality, "a secondary issue and a statistical byproduct," is misdirected. Better to focus on "the real concrete issues: bad schools, no jobs for young men, broken families, neighborhoods without mediating institutions."
Mr. Brooks minimizes the obvious important connection between the two. The focus he recommends requires substantial redirection of public and private resources. But most conservatives are adamantly opposed to any such redirection, arguing that such resources are not available and not necessary. They exhort the lower classes to struggle on.
A major point of the focus on income inequality is to demonstrate the falsity of the first part of that argument. A second major point is to suggest that inequality of outcomes may reflect inequality of opportunities, a possibility that most conservatives would have no one even think about, let alone rectify.
The focus on income inequality should continue.
THOMAS POTTER Washington, Jan. 17, 2014
To the Editor:
David Brooks points out some important problems with the income inequality debate, yet he doesn't mention the basic lack of historical perspective of those raising the alarm about increases in the concentration of wealth. It's well documented that income inequality in the United States has been rising since the 1970s. During the previous half-century, however, it had fallen considerably.
The middle decades of the 20th century represent a remarkable period of widely shared prosperity. Where the current debate may be going wrong is in treating this midcentury lull as the norm instead of as the exception.
We lack comparable data for periods before the early 20th century, but what if we are now looking back to a golden age? What if the postwar boom years are an extraordinary exception, and the present increase in income inequality merely represents a return to normal?
DAVID A. McM. WILSON Durham, N.C., Jan. 17, 2014
To the Editor:
The minimum wage is now 36 percent below the rate in 1968, adjusted for inflation. Even those working full time at today's minimum cannot make enough to support themselves, much less a family.
David Brooks suggests a debate about policy while our citizens are living without dignity. Meanwhile, chief executives are making salaries undreamed of in 1967, and those levels cannot be justified in terms of value because nobody could possibly be worth that much.
It's not just the drop in the lowest wages that shocks the conscience; it's the meteoric rise in the upper ranges for people who have no need of more and more. What kind of country are we that this can happen and that all we do is debate it?

Full text:   TEHRAN -- For critics of the interim nuclear agreement with Iran, Hossein Sheikholeslami might seem to embody their worst fears.
Mr. Sheikholeslami has been busy in recent weeks, since the deal was agreed to in principle, shuttling back and forth between the capital and the airport to welcome all the guests: parliamentary missions from old European trading partners like Germany, Italy and Finland, which are eager to renew contacts.
Excitement over the interim agreement, which will ease some provisions of the American-led sanctions on Iran but essentially leave all of them in place, has not extended to American companies. They remain extremely wary.
Nonetheless, critics of Iran in the United States Congress and elsewhere, who are pushing for even stiffer sanctions, have expressed dismay over the European trade missions. They see them as a signal that Iran is open for business, leading to an end of the Islamic republic's international isolation, which they say is what brought the Iranians to the negotiating table in the first place.
"As we have warned, and I say this with regret, the sanctions regime has started to weaken and very quickly," Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday in Italy. "If tangible steps are not taken soon, it is liable to collapse, and the efforts of years will vanish without anything in exchange."
But that is not the way it looks to Iran's business leaders, who say the deal has generated a great deal of interest but little else. Even when the easing begins, now set for Monday, it will continue to be nearly impossible to transfer money into and out of the country. "Most companies want to scope out the landscape," said Rouzbeh Pirouz, the chairman of a Tehran-based investment firm, Turquoise Partners. "But I don't think many of them will actually sign contracts and start putting money into this place very quickly."
That has not stopped a parade of people, mainly European politicians and business representatives, from visiting the Islamic republic, which, with 70 million people and a sizable middle class, is the world's last major isolated market.
In the first two weeks of the year, Iran welcomed more delegations from Europe than in all of 2013.
"The Europeans are waiting in line to come here," said Mr. Sheikholeslami, the international affairs adviser to the head of Iran's Parliament, Ali Larijani, who has been receiving many of the high-profile visitors. "They are coming to seek benefits and to get ahead of their international rivals."
Italy's foreign minister, Emma Bonino, has been here, as has a former British foreign minister, Jack Straw, in his capacity as the head of the Iran-Britain Friendship Committee.
The prime ministers of Italy and Poland have also scheduled visits. Trade delegations from Ireland, Italy and France are expected in coming weeks.
American companies have shown some interest, of course. In September the head of President Hassan Rouhani's office, the former director of the Iranian Chamber of Commerce, Mohammad Nahavandian, held a closed-door meeting with leading chief executives in New York. In March, an Iranian investment company is organizing a $15,000-a-ticket seminar in New York on business opportunities in Iran.
Where Mr. Netanyahu sees risk, Mr. Sheikholeslami -- who in 1979 was one of the students who held 52 American diplomats hostage, touching off the crisis that ruptured the countries' relations -- sees opportunity. "The sanction regime imposed on us is falling apart," he said. "The Americans wanted to impose their will on the world and isolate Iran, but big companies are seeking the potential of Iran."
Critics of Iran in the United States have also expressed anger at Russia -- which has always rejected the American-led sanctions strategy as arrogant -- over a reported Russian agreement under negotiation with Iran that could provide Iran with billions of dollars' worth of food and equipment in exchange for oil, which Russia would then sell.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was visiting Moscow on Thursday, was quoted by the Russian broadcaster Rossiya 24 as saying such a deal was not on his agenda for discussion. And Obama administration officials have suggested that if such a deal was in the works, it would be a sanctions violation.
Still, those frustrated with the administration's policy toward Iran say the reported Russia-Iran deal is a clear example of how the sanctions effort is about to collapse and relieve the pressures on Iran.
What is true, said Mr. Pirouz and his business partner, Ramin Rabii, is that the Iranian economy has picked up since Mr. Rouhani came to office. "But that is not happening solely in expectation of some sanctions being lifted," Mr. Rabii said. "It is because of his appointments of competent managers who are undoing some of the damaging economic and monetary policies designed by the previous administration."
Under Mr. Rouhani, who has been in office for nearly six months, Iran's economy has made some small strides. Inflation has come down to 35 percent from 42 percent in December, the Statistical Organization of Iran reported. Unemployment continues to be very high, though there are no reliable measures of the rate. The national currency has stabilized, and Iran's stock exchange has been setting records.
"What Iran's government really should do is leave the economy to the private sector," Mr. Pirouz said. "While an improvement over the previous situation, some of Mr. Rouhani's men are still in favor of a planned economy, so in my view certain problems will persist, even if some sanctions are lifted."
Many multinationals have long eyed what they view as the virgin Iranian market, where many highly educated consumers are thirsty for jobs and Western products. Iran's infrastructure, including that of its oil industry, needs a complete overhaul.
"We need over $200 billion investment in our oil and gas sector alone," said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to Mr. Rouhani's government. Iran needs multibillion-dollar injections in its heavy industries, its transportation sector and airlines, he said. "On top of that, we need to acquire new management skills and services. Basically, we need everything the other emerging nations needed a decade ago."
A senior United States official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said last week that sanctions would remain firmly in place, and that any company breaking them would be punished. "We tell everybody with interest in the Iranian market to be very careful not to break any sanctions, as they will face the consequences," the official said.
For the most part, local Iranian producers cannot understand what all the hubbub is about.
"Many politicians and well-connected businessmen might be excited," said Bahram Eshghi, the owner of a bus manufacturing company. In September he said he was basically doing nothing at work because even the Chinese were afraid to do business with Iran. The lifting of some sanctions or a more positive atmosphere has not changed that significantly, he said.
"Sure, we will be able to buy some spare parts, but I still can't make an international money transfer," he said. "Which big brand will be willing to come to Iran and work under such conditions? None."
Mr. Eshghi, a burly man with thick hair turning white, said that only one thing mattered to the multinationals. "They will come only when the U.S. allows banks to make money transfers," he said. "It is as simple as that."

Abstract: The long stretch of falling apparel prices was largely attributable to an era of cheap imports, as China emerged from economic isolation to become the world's largest exporter.

Full text:   FOR decades, declining prices have helped American consumers spend less on one critical part of every family's budget: clothing. But those days may be ending.
The government reported this week that consumer prices for apparel rose 0.6 percent in 2013. That is hardly rampant inflation, but it was the third consecutive year that apparel prices increased. Before 2011, those prices had risen in only two of the previous 13 years.
The long stretch of falling apparel prices was largely attributable to an era of cheap imports, as China emerged from economic isolation to become the world's largest exporter. That emergence damaged the apparel industries in all major industrial countries, but it was a boon to living standards for consumers, who were left with more money for other purchases.
In 1987, apparel accounted for 5.4 percent of all personal consumption spending in the United States. By 2009, that figure was down to 3.1 percent. In 2012, the year for which data is available, the figure had recovered a little, to 3.2 percent.
What may have marked the end of the era came in 2010, when unfavorable weather reduced cotton production in all three of the world's largest producers -- China, India and the United States. India briefly banned exports, and prices began to rise. In early 2011, the price of cotton briefly reached $2.19 a pound, compared with less than 70 cents at the beginning of 2010.
The price of cotton was back under $1 by the end of 2011, but that move helped to push American apparel inflation to 4.6 percent in 2011, the highest figure since 1990 and well above the overall inflation rate of 3 percent. It was the first time since 1991 that apparel prices had risen more than the overall inflation rate.
The apparel inflation rate fell to 1.8 percent in 2012, a small amount over the inflation rate, and to 0.6 percent in 2013, well below the overall 1.5 percent rate.
This week's report showed that apparel prices fell in December, as they always do during holiday sales. But the decline of 2.3 percent for the month was the smallest such dip in December in eight years -- perhaps an indication that clothing retailers were more successful at avoiding deep discounts than they were in previous years. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded, apparel prices were up 0.9 percent from November.
China remains a force for deflation in the world, but perhaps less than it was. With wages rising, it has lost some of its business in inexpensive apparel production to other countries, including Vietnam and Bangladesh. China provided a record 19.4 percent of American imports in the 12 months through November, but that figure is no longer rising at a rapid rate.
Over the last 27 years -- since the end of 1986 -- American apparel prices have risen only 17 percent. The weakest prices have been in children's clothing, an area where (parental) buyers may be particularly price-sensitive. The figures indicate that boys' clothing prices rose a scant 1 percent over the period, while girls' clothing prices declined 6 percent. Men's clothing prices rose more rapidly than women's, but shoes, up 29 percent over the period, rose more rapidly than any category of clothing.

Abstract: (Holland Cotter) * Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

Museums
* Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Tony Feher' (through Feb. 16) Almost anything can be beautiful if it's presented in the right way. That's where the sculptor Tony Feher comes in. His palette consists almost entirely of cheap manufactured objects, including glass and plastic bottles; metal and plastic bottle tops; marbles, coins, nuts and bolts, metal rings, plastic bags, broken pieces of glass, rope, plastic cord, shredded paper, cans and cardboard boxes. He organizes these and other things into simple but surprisingly exciting, often funny configurations with intriguing philosophical implications. This beautiful show surveys a 25-year career. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt' (through December 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, this show is for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum's renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
* Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'War/Photography: Images of Armed Conflict and Its Aftermath' (through Feb. 2) This flawed but intensely absorbing exhibition presents pictures by more than 280 photographers relating to conflicts from the Mexican-American War of 1846-49 to the Arab Spring revolution of 2010-11. Photographs from widely different times and places are grouped according to themes like "Recruitment and Embarkation" and "Homecoming," suggesting that all wars are somehow similar, which is debatable. The main problem, though, is the claustrophobic, overly busy installation, which is unfortunate because there is hardly a single picture that doesn't cry out to be seen and pondered by itself. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Jewish Museum: 'Chagall: Love, War, and Exile' (through Feb. 2) This exhibition of Marc Chagall's work from the 1930s and '40s hinges on a group of paintings and drawings of Jesus on the cross, most of them made during, or shortly before or after, World War II. In these dark and anguished works, Chagall unexpectedly adopts Jesus as a Jewish martyr, as a symbol of a persecuted people and of the refugee artist in particular. The show's final gallery, however, glosses over this difficult period with some of Chagall's more romantic and nostalgic postwar paintings. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The American West in Bronze, 1850-1925' (through April 13) This intriguing and spiritually troubling show presents 65 mostly pedestal-scale sculptures representing standard themes of the old American West: cowboys, Indians and wild animals. It includes famous practitioners of the genre like Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, as well as 26 others. Nearly all the sculptures are in a mode of three-dimensional illustrative realism and tend heavily to romantic idealization. There's the rub: The real history of the conquest of the West by white folks was much worse than what these artists imagined in their very popular works. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China' (through April 6) This museum's first survey of recent Chinese art uses the lens of the culture's ancient brush and ink tradition so basic to its landscape painting and calligraphy. It doesn't always work. The show endures a scattered installation, includes overly refined displays of empty skill and wanders off message in spots, especially with several sculptures that don't seem to belong here. But a few moments of visual life and many interesting questions about the weight of the old on the new make it worthwhile. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Jewels By JAR' (through March 9) Crowd-pleasers needn't represent lowered curatorial standards in terms of subject and execution, but this one does. It packs 400 efforts by the New York-born, Paris-based high-society jeweler, Joel Arthur Rosenthal (JAR), into a very dark gallery with insufficient labeling or historical backup. Large pave brooches, usually of flowers, abound; too many pieces date from 2010 or later. There are certainly redeeming works, but the show cries out for editing, scholarly support and better viewing conditions. Artist and audience are left hanging, with the museum's mercenary agenda in full view. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: William Kentridge: 'The Refusal of Time' (through May 11) Everything is on the move in this mini-theater-cum-power-plant of an installation. In wraparound videos, metronomes pound. Clock-faces spin, spewing trails of stars. Drawings draw and erase themselves. Maps of Africa appear and disappear. White-coated figures mix potions amid giant watch springs. At the center of the gallery a wooden contraption pumps away like an energy source. A collaboration between Mr. Kentridge, who is based in South Africa, and Peter L. Galison, a science historian at Harvard, the piece refers to the European colonial experiment, which strove to shape other cultures to its own concepts of reality, only to find that those cultures had different, resistant, assertive realities of their own. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Silla: Korea's Golden Kingdom' (through Feb. 23) This intriguing show presents more than 130 objects from Silla, a kingdom that dominated the Korean peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries. The first two of three sections includes gold jewelry, formally austere pottery, glassware and other objects excavated from mound shaped, earth-covered tombs in the city of Gyeongju. The third section displays sculpture made after Buddhism was adopted as the state religion around 530. Among the most captivating is a beautiful three-foot-high, gilt bronze sculpture of a young Bodhisattva, which, like a number of other works in the show, has been designated a Korean National Treasure. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Venetian Glass by Carlo Scarpa: The Venini Company, 1932-1947' (through March 2) Before he turned to architecture, Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) designed glass vessels, achieving a lifetime's worth of beauty and innovation in a short, remarkable burst of creativity. His achievement is honored with this sublime exhibition of nearly 300 of his splendidly sculptural, radiantly colored, ingeniously patterned vessels. They have an inspiring wholeness: process, form and decoration become a single thing; art, craft and science merge. And content of the non-narrative, experiential kind abounds. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
* MoMA PS1: 'Mike Kelley' (through Feb. 2) This retrospective of the Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley fills 40,000 feet of gallery space at PS1. And it's that very rare thing, a huge show that should be huge. Kelley earned this blowout; his work sustains one. In a three-decade career, cut off by his suicide, at 57, last year, he did it all genrewise: performance, painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, video, installation, sound art and writing. And he wove together -- twisted together -- all of that into what amounted to a single conceptual project based on recurrent themes: class politics, popular culture, black humor, anti-formalist rigor and a moral sense, unshakably skeptical, that ran through everything like a spine. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Leonardo da Vinci: Treasures from the Biblioteca Reale, Turin' (through Feb. 2) A mere handful of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci are in this exquisite show. But in the case of the great multidisciplinary experimentalist and technician, even a little is a lot. Leonardo the scientist is here in the drawn and annotated "Codex on the Flight of Birds" and the artist in the exquisite silverpoint image called "Head of a Young Woman." Both works are in New York for the first time. The show is fleshed out with work by some of the master's followers and by the Morgan's own "Codex Huygens," a late-16th-century manuscript that has faithful copies of now-lost Leonardo drawings. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Arts and Design: 'Out of Hand: Materializing the Postdigital' (through June 1) If you haven't quite wrapped your head around the concept of 3-D printing, or haven't yet had a digital scanner wrap itself around you, now you can do both in this survey of computer-assisted art, architecture and design. The show looks at art made since 2005 and fills nearly three floors, including many irresistible interactive projects. Its ideas may not be entirely new; the Museum of Modern Art's 2008 exhibition "Design and the Elastic Mind" covered much of the same territory, but there's something to be said for this more down-to-earth, production-focused exhibition. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'American Modern: Hopper to O'Keeffe' (through Jan. 26) An attempt to prove that the Museum of Modern Art did not neglect American art between the wars before the Abstract Expressionists arrived, this selection of 120 works in several mediums presents plenty to look at in a beautiful installation, but it is completely predictable in its choice of artists and its viewpoint. By making no effort to reimagine early American modernism, it is most notable as evidence of the Modern's current indifference to the field. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Designing Modern Women 1890-1990' (through Oct. 5) Shoehorned into half the museum's design department, this conversation-starting display of objects from MoMA's permanent collection features items designed by more than 60 women, many of whom worked with male partners. Some, like Marianne Brandt and Eileen Gray, are well known to design aficionados, but most will be unfamiliar to a general audience. Most objects were created for domestic consumption. The pièce de résistance is a kitchen designed by Charlotte Perriand for the apartments in Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation in Marseille, France. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Dorothea Rockburne: Drawing Which Makes Itself' (through Feb. 2) The main attraction in this mini-survey of Dorothea Rockburne is a group of works from her 1973 show at the Bykert Gallery in New York. There, the artist developed a rigorously mathematical and strenuously physical method of drawing; she folded and scored large sheets of carbon paper as she moved them around the gallery, leaving a succession of marks -- lines and thumbprints -- on the wall and floor. They are a brain tease, especially if you try to follow the diagrams Ms. Rockburne has provided, but they also have a kind of poetry of movement; they make you think of professors scrawling equations on chalkboards. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New' (through April 21) Ileana Sonnabend, who died in 2007 at 92, was one of the most foresighted art dealers of the late 20th century. This modest-size exhibition, made up of work she either owned or showed in her gallery, gives a sense of the range of her interests, from Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Modern Art: Isa Genzken: 'Retrospective' (through March 10) This prolific German sculptor -- for whom New York and its skyscrapers are a major source of inspiration -- receives her first comprehensive museum survey in this country. A grand, glamorous and sometimes grating 40-year overview, it traces her progress from idiosyncratic Minimalist monoliths to the distinctive, often architectonic, assemblages she began making in 1997 from cheesy materials and objects, concocting a raw, unapologetic beauty and a weirdly elliptical if literal-minded social commentary, often about the United States, power and war. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through March 9) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: "American Photographs," by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprise of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
National Academy Museum: 'See It Loud: Seven Post-War American Painters' (through Jan. 26) This uneven museumwide show presents 80 paintings by seven representational artists who came of age during the ascendancy of Abstract Expressionism and shortly thereafter. Three make the show worth viewing. Paul Georges's outsized landscapes, nudes, self-portraits and allegorical narratives have a terrific painterly flair. Neil Welliver's big pictures of wilderness places in Maine project a galvanizing tension between brusquely applied paint and acutely observed topography. And Stanley Lewis's views of scruffy, residential backyards involve improbable amounts of built-up paint and intensely detailed realism. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Johnson)
* Neue Galerie: 'Vasily Kandinsky: From Blaue Reiter to the Bauhaus, 1910-1925' (through Feb. 10) The Neue's first show on Kandinsky centers on a rich 15-year period, also the purview of the Museum of Modern Art's recent "Inventing Abstraction, 1910-1925." During this time Kandinsky shifted from the prismatic Expressionism of Der Blaue Reiter into pure abstraction and from easel paintings into set designs and murals. A reconstruction of one of those mural projects is on view, as are abundantly decorative wall panels made for a private collector in New York. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
* New-York Historical Society: 'The Armory Show at 100: Modern Art and Revolution' (through Feb. 23) The International Exhibition of Modern Art, otherwise known as the Armory Show, woke American art from its provincial slumbers a century ago. Was it a good thing or a bad thing, and is there any reason to care about it now? With more than 100 works from the original exhibition by American and European artists and a big, richly illuminating catalog, "The Armory Show at 100" offers an excellent opportunity to ponder such questions. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
* Noguchi Museum: 'Isamu Noguchi and Qi Baishi: Beijing 1930' (through Jan. 26) Isamu Noguchi worked with the Chinese ink painter Qi Baishi for just six months and could speak to him only through a translator. But this brief, mostly nonverbal tutelage had a lasting impact on Noguchi's art, as we see in this elegant and persuasive exhibition of ink paintings by both artists. Qi helped Noguchi to escape the long shadow of an intense two-year apprenticeship to Brancusi and to develop a new style of abstraction: one that was improvisational, urbane and broadly Asian-inspired. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Rosenberg)
Queens Museum of Art: Peter Schumann 'The Shatterer' (through March 30) A recent expansion has doubled the size of the Queens Museum. Of five celebratory new shows, the largest and most moving is the solo museum debut of Peter Schumann, the founder and director of Bread and Puppet Theater, which is 50 years old this year. The show demonstrates how thoroughly Bread and Puppet is his creation. Its down-value look and activist ethos are evident in everything, including the black house-paint mural he has brushed, single-handedly, across one of the museum's wall and the hand-printed, hand-bound books he has placed in the gallery he designates as chapel and library. Every inch of this room is covered with figures and words: angels and ogres, exhortations and condemnations, art for one and for all, straight from the hand, right to the moral core. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Rubin Museum of Art: 'Allegory and Illusion: Early Portrait Photography From South Asia' (through Feb. 10) "Allegory and Illusion" is a fascinating little piece of a very complicated puzzle. Ostensibly a focused, regional exhibition, it has much to say about the larger relationship between photography and colonialism. Included are many different forms of early photography, representing an array of markets and social classes: grand portraits of Nepalese royals and palm-size cartes de visite for the masses, ethnographic albums by British photographers and hand-painted photographs from Indian portrait studios. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Rosenberg)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Shadows Took Shape' (through March 9) Space is definitely the place in this lively group exhibition devoted to Afrofuturism, a contemporary art trend that takes the ultra-free-jazz musician Sun Ra as its patron saint and locates itself in a universe where racial and ethnic identities float free from stereotypes without losing track of the histories that created them. William Villalongo sets African sculpture and modernist painting soaring together among the stars; the Kenyan artist Wanuri Kahiu films ecological cataclysm and renewal in ages to come; William Cordova, who lives in New York and Lima, Peru, recreates the Falcon spaceship from George Lucas's "Star Wars," now equipped with a cultural studies library. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Rituals of Rented Island: Object Theater, Loft Performance, and the New Psychodrama -- Manhattan, 1970-1980' (through Feb. 2) Four decades ago, performance art was young, funky and clunky, beyond modernism, or maybe perversely beneath it, meant to reflect a world in which materials were transient, old models useless and values shifty. We get a vivid flashback to those beginnings in this show of photographs, videos and objects that breathes surprising life into archival matter and brings wonderful artists like Stuart Sherman, Jared Bark, Julia Heyward, Jill Kroesen and Ralston Farina back into view. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'T.J. Wilcox: In the Air' (through Feb. 9) A Romantic miniaturist best known for short, poetic films pieced together from found and made footage goes big in a dazzling 360-degree, 30-minute, day-to-night-to-day view of Lower Manhattan. Six brief collagelike films pop onto the panorama one at a time, zeroing on a specific event, person or experience, including Sept. 11. We see the city as a kaleidoscopic archive, alive with buildings, history, memories and people, and understand anew that the metropolis and the moving image were made for each other. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
'Eureka: William Wegman Photographs 1970-1975' (through Jan. 25) Mr. Wegman's hilarious, deadpan-profound photographs from the early 1970s are sampled here. They all revolve around visual gags involving contradictory realities. In "How They Are Toward Newspapers," Mr. Wegman sits on a couch reading a newspaper while his canine companion lies on the floor with a crumpled mess of newspaper between its forepaws.

Martina Bacigalupo: 'Gulu Real Art Studio' (through Feb. 8) In 2010 the Italian photojournalist Martina Bacigalupo spent time in the city of Gulu in northern Uganda, where she came across a curious form of portraiture. In a local shop called the Gulu Real Art Studio she found dozens of full-length pictures of sitters from which the heads had been neatly cut out. The shop's owner, Obal Denis, explained why. His machine for developing passport-size photos automatically produced four prints at a time, but most people coming for an ID picture needed only one. So it was easier, and cheaper, to shoot a regular full-length portrait, edit out a head shot and toss what was left. The pictures in this remarkable show are the result: studies in body language and clothing, accompanied by audio-taped interviews made with some of the sitters. The Walther Collection Project Space, 508-526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
Cyprien Gaillard: 'Today Diggers, Tomorrow Dickens' (through Feb. 1) The familiar convention of giant, slightly altered, out-of-context ready-mades arrayed in a pristine gallery is reiterated by an artist best known for brutal videos that document the dehumanizing scale and effect of immense Eastern-bloc apartment complexes. Here he adds luxurious rods of yellow onyx to scarred excavation heads from earth-moving machines. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street, (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Smith)
'Para-Real' (through Feb. 8) This philosophically catchy 14-artist show reflects a few forms in which reality, whatever that is, impinges. It includes a pile of scrub brushes by Robert Therrien; a self-portrait of Maurizio Cattelan as a real puppet; Hiroshi Sugimoto's photograph of stuffed golden eagles in a museum diorama; and Thomas Demand's "Ghost," a photograph of a colored paper and cardboard construction of a kitchen, wherein some culinary objects hover above the stove, as if tossed up by a poltergeist. 601Artspace, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 243-2735, 601artspace.org. (Johnson)
Richard Serra: 'New Sculpture' (through Feb. 8, and March 15) In this show running at two branches of the Gagosian Gallery, Richard Serra continues along the road that emerged from the hugely successful "Torqued Ellipses" of the 1990s, but also circles back to his earlier oeuvre. At 555 West 24th Street, you have the Serra of the '60s and '70s, revised and updated: heavy rectilinear plates and cubes fabricated in steel rather than lead, his signature material in the '60s. In the navelike space at 522 West 21st Street, you have the new-old Serra: an 80-foot-long curvilinear sculpture fabricated in weatherproof steel called "Inside Out" (2013). The difference between the installations in the two galleries might be described simply as austerity versus pleasure. Through Feb. 8 at 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717; through March 15 at 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111; gagosian.com. (Martha Schwendener)
Galleries: Other
'Danish Paintings From the Golden Age to the Modern Breakthrough: Selections From the Collection of Ambassador John L. Loeb Jr.' (through Jan. 25) Paintings dating from the late 1700s to the early 20th century play out a fascinating dialogue between Scandinavian restraint and imported (i.e., French) freedom and sensuality. Sunny French Impressionism evidently made an mark on Danish artists, but in the show's most compelling works -- funereal pictures of women in gray rooms by Vilhelm Hammershoi -- desire and repression fought to an agonized stalemate. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
* 'Devotion: Excavating Bob Mizer' (through Feb. 15) Bob Mizer is best known as a producer and publisher of beefcake photography for a gay market. This show makes a good case for him as an artist with interests and an imagination considerably more expansive than what his popular reputation suggests. The show's first picture is of a Siamese cat on a sofa. Further on are Arbus-like portraits of women and children; photographs of odd staged events like a magic show; and a picture of a cop writing a parking ticket for a group of teenage girls that could have been made into a painting by Norman Rockwell. A spirit of good-humored generosity prevails. 80WSE, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Johnson)
* Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (continuing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
* 'Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart: Collected by Julie Ault' (through Feb. 23) Julie Ault, an artist, writer and curator, was a founding member of the New York collaborative Group Material, which, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, used exhibitions and public events to investigate the overlap of art and politics. During decades of depression, inflation, multiculturalism, conservatism and AIDS, she and her colleagues lived improvised lives on the city's fringes. Within their world, art was currency for giving gifts, bartering, buying and selling among friends. This show, spread over two different locations, is a moving record of such transactions. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo; Artists Space: Books & Talks, 55 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)
Anke Weyer: 'Du' (through Jan. 26) German-born and living in Brooklyn, Anke Weyer has the benefit of multiple art histories to draw from, as well as an irreverence for keeping postwar vocabularies in separate boxes. In her canvases, the brush strokes are bold and strong, like the New York School's, and there are plenty of drips and pours. The colors are electric, like those of Cobra, the group formed by northern Europeans in the early 1950s; stains and washes suggest Tachisme or Post-Painterly Abstraction. But the mark-making feels wonderfully subversive, reminding you that Ms. Weyer also grew up looking at the vernacular cultures of graffiti and punk. Canada, 333 Broome Street, between Bowery and Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, www.canadanewyork.com. (Schwendener)
Out of Town
* Carnegie Museum of Art: 2013 Carnegie International (through March 16) A welcome shock to the system of one of the art world's more entrenched rituals, this lean, seemingly modest, thought-out exhibition takes the big global survey of contemporary art off steroids. It is mostly devoid of the looming, often expensive installations called "festival art," while evincing a gratifying affinity for color, form, beauty and pleasure, and a discernible lack of interest in finger-wagging didacticism. Object-making of all kinds seems healthy, as do artist-initiated activist projects (which sometimes overlap). Interventionist and artist-as-curator efforts? Not as impressive. 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, (412) 622-3131, carnegieinternational.org. (Smith)
National Gallery of Art: 'Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium From Greek Collections' (through March 2) With about 170 objects, this show takes a processional sweep through Byzantine art from its Greco-Roman beginnings to its multicultural late phase in the 15th century, with a specific emphasis on its development in Greece itself. The history is fascinating, and the objects couldn't be more beautiful, including a glinting 13th-century icon of the Virgin and Child pieced together from glass, silver, gold and glass; a 17-foot-long parchment scroll painted with chirping birds and secret prayers; and a heavenly silk embroidery, found stashed away in a Thessaloniki church, depicting the body of the dead Christ surrounded by fan-wielding seraphs and a stitched chant, "Holy, holy, holy." On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Last Chance
* Thomas Demand: 'Dailies' (closes on Saturday) Thomas Demand's photographs are always a little bit uncanny, but the more modest, quotidian works in his latest exhibition are his weirdest yet. Their sources are Mr. Demand's own cellphone photographs, and their subjects are so unassuming as to seem disposable: a bar of soap on a bathtub ledge, a paper cup wedged into a chain-link fence. These objects are all paper sculptures, like the ones in his earlier works, but they've been rendered extraordinarily vivid by the dye-transfer printing method, which Mr. Demand is using for the first time. It's as if he's channeling William Eggleston. Matthew Marks Gallery, 526 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Rosenberg)
Helmut Federle: 'The Ferner Paintings' (closes on Saturday) Helmut Federle's "The Ferner Paintings," circles drawn in vegetable oil on small raw-linen canvases, are in conversation with art history: Giotto, Japan's enso (circle) calligraphers, or Rembrandt's late self-portrait with two circles in the background. Austere but full of vibrating tension, Mr. Federle's circles are also like religious exercises. He has stressed that painting for him is spiritual, calling the art world a "world of religion without the church." And that pretty much describes what is seen here. Peter Blum, 20 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 244-6055, peterblumgallery.com. (Schwendener)
* Frick Collection: 'Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Hals: Masterpieces of Dutch Painting From the Mauritshuis' (closes on Sunday) Johannes Vermeer's much-loved "Girl With a Pearl Earring," not seen in New York for nearly 30 years, is one of 15 choice pictures in this traveling show of loans from the Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis in The Hague. She's joined by four Rembrandts, Jacob van Ruisdael's out-of-this-world "View of Haarlem With Bleaching Grounds" and -- maybe the star among stars -- Carel Fabritius's palpitating little "Goldfinch." 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org; admission is by timed tickets. (Cotter)
* Guggenheim Museum: 'Christopher Wool' (closes on Wednesday) This show, one of the most beautiful exhibitions to unwind up the Guggenheim's spiral ramp in some time, surveys the 25-year accomplishment of an "endgame" painter who brought the medium to the brink of extinction and then fruitfully worked his way back from the edge. It starts with his laconic, implacable black-and-white word paintings and then shows him layering various deadpan handmade and printed motifs, ending up with an innovative combination of visual transparency and pictorial force. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
* International Center of Photography: 'Lewis Hine' and 'Future of America: Lewis Hine's New Deal Photographs' (closes on Sunday) These inspiring exhibitions survey the career of the pioneering documentary photographer Lewis Hine (1874-1940), whose subjects included immigrants just arriving at Ellis Island; children working in factories and coal mines; families living in Lower East Side tenements; black Americans; and men building skyscrapers. Hine was an inquiring, generously humane sociologist. He had a romantic belief in the possibilities of America, epitomized by his heroic images of construction workers near the top of the nearly complete Empire State Building. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

Abstract: The People's Bank of China has been creating money to a considerable extent by issuing more renminbi to bankroll its purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars a year in currency markets to minimize the appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar and keep Chinese exports inexpensive in foreign markets; the central bank disclosed on Wednesday that the country's foreign reserves, mostly dollars, soared $508.4 billion last year, a record increase. [...]the rapidly expanding money supply reflects a flood of loans from the banking system and the so-called shadow banking system that have kept afloat many inefficient state-owned enterprises and bankrolled the construction of huge overcapacity in the manufacturing sector.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- Move over, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Step aside, Mario Draghi and Haruhiko Kuroda. When it comes to monetary stimulus, Zhou Xiaochuan, the longtime governor of the People's Bank of China, has no rivals.
The latest data released by China on Wednesday show that the country's rapid growth in money supply has continued. Mr. Zhou and his colleagues at the Chinese central bank have only begun the difficult and dangerous task of reining it in.
The amount of money sloshing around China's economy, according to a broad measure that is closely watched here, has now tripled since the end of 2006. China's tidal wave of money has powered the economy to new heights, but it has also helped drive asset prices through the roof. Housing prices have soared, feeding fears of a bubble while leaving many ordinary Chinese feeling poor and left out.
There are big differences, of course, between China and the major Western industrial powers. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are trying to prevent deflation and help their economies recover from the lingering consequences of the financial crisis and the Great Recession. They have little reason to fear inflation.
The mechanics of China's monetary policy stimulus are also different from the Fed's quantitative easing. The Fed has been effectively creating money by buying bonds and other securities. The People's Bank of China has been creating money to a considerable extent by issuing more renminbi to bankroll its purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars a year in currency markets to minimize the appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar and keep Chinese exports inexpensive in foreign markets; the central bank disclosed on Wednesday that the country's foreign reserves, mostly dollars, soared $508.4 billion last year, a record increase.
Moreover, the rapidly expanding money supply reflects a flood of loans from the banking system and the so-called shadow banking system that have kept afloat many inefficient state-owned enterprises and bankrolled the construction of huge overcapacity in the manufacturing sector.
Cao Maolan, a real estate broker in Nanjing in east-central China, helped a young woman buy her first apartment seven years ago, a 650-square-foot unit for which she paid the equivalent of $60,000. The young woman sold it in less than two years for a 50 percent profit, Ms. Cao said, and has traded up to a bigger apartment every year since then, now living in a 2,150-square-foot apartment for which she paid $985,000, mostly in cash with the profits from previous deals.
"Everyone who bought property has done really well," Ms. Cao said.
But young college graduates, whose numbers have quintupled in the last decade as China's universities expand rapidly, worry that they may never be able to afford to buy a new home.
Zheng Yilong, a 22-year-old college graduate in Wuhan, an industrial hub of 10 million people in central China, is paid $575 a month in a low-level banking job with limited opportunities for raises. But he has found that even a 540-square-foot apartment on the outer edge of the metropolitan area, with a long commute, costs $98,400, or 14 years' pay.
"I cannot even begin to imagine how I can earn and save enough to buy even a small unit here in Wuhan, so I don't think about it -- there is no solution," he said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
The money supply and credit data released Wednesday morning show that the central bank has begun to tackle the problem, but only slowly. The broad measure of money supply, known as M2, grew 13.6 percent last year, barely less than its increase of 13.8 percent a year earlier, the Chinese central bank said in a news release.
This means the money supply is still charging well ahead of inflation-adjusted economic growth, which has been about 7.6 percent; the exact figure for the fourth quarter of last year is scheduled for release on Monday.
Growth in M2 almost reached 30 percent at the end of 2009, when China was using monetary policy to offset the effects of the global financial crisis. China has reduced the pace of money supply growth since then, but kept it well above the pace of economic growth throughout, which means it has done little to sop up the extra cash issued during the crisis.
The question now is whether the central bank can further slow the growth of credit and the money supply without causing a slump in housing prices or a sharp slowdown in the credit-dependent corporate sector. Even the very modest slowdown in money supply growth so far has already contributed to two sharp, but short-lived, increases in interbank interest rates in June and December, which roiled markets in China and around the world.
China's central bank "is in a very difficult situation; it needs to tighten, but the whole system is not used to tightening, they are used to money printing," said Shen Jianguang, a China monetary economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities, a Japanese investment bank.
M2 encompasses money in circulation, checking accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. It is the main money supply indicator watched by the People's Bank of China in trying to balance the need for economic growth with the dangers of inflation.
M2 has grown so fast in China not just because the central bank has been issuing a lot of renminbi, but also because the state-owned banking system has lent and relent those renminbi with encouragement from the government, creating a multiplier effect.
China has also undergone a financial liberalization in the past five years that has accelerated the pace of lending. An extensive and loosely regulated shadow banking system has emerged, partly because of the willingness of regulators to allow banks to classify loans to new financing companies not as corporate loans but as interbank loans, for which little capital needs to be reserved.
The Federal Reserve pays little attention to money supply measures, since they do not provide much guidance to setting monetary policy. While the Fed's ultra-low interest rates and extra monetary stimulus have helped revive the housing market and lifted the stock market, the broadly measured money supply has increased more slowly in the United States because American banks have been much more cautious about lending money.
Consumer inflation has not yet become a big problem in China: Falling commodity prices and widespread manufacturing overcapacity held down consumer inflation to 2.6 percent last year.
But asset price inflation, notably the country's soaring real estate prices and corresponding decline in housing affordability, has been a constant worry for the authorities.

Abstract: Birgir Gudjonsson, a 37-year-old policeman in Reykjavik, said that the banks had been too interested in rebuilding their businesses and their balance sheets, and not helpful enough to homeowners like him who bought their first homes just before the crisis. Because many Icelandic loans are linked to inflation, Mr. Gudjonsson owes more than he initially borrowed.

Full text:   An angular glass building on the waterfront here used to be the headquarters of a banking giant with operations in Europe, North America and the Middle East.
Now, it houses a shadow of that behemoth -- a small bank doing business only in Iceland and lacking both the trading culture and ambitions of its failed predecessor.
The metamorphosis is a result of one of the biggest bank crashes any country has ever had. The risk in Iceland's financial system has dissipated, but the basic businesses of banking have shrunk as well. Lending to consumers and businesses has slowed to a fraction of what it was before the crisis.
"We moved from a situation where the one that took the biggest risk was the employee of the month, to a situation where the one that took the least risk became the employee of the month," said Bjarni Benediktsson, the Icelandic finance minister. "I think we need to find a balance in between."
Iceland is a living experiment in what can happen when a country forces its financial firms to go under, rather than bailing them out, as much of the rest of the world did during the global financial crisis.
In October 2008, all three of Iceland's major banks collapsed. None failed more spectacularly than Kaupthing, the bank whose glass headquarters were on the waterfront. At one point, it had a balance sheet four times as large as the annual economic output of the entire country. Last month, four former Kaupthing executives were sentenced to multiple-year prison terms.
Emerging from the crisis are three new ventures, including Arion Bank, the successor to Kaupthing, that hold only the local assets of the old firms. They also have a different mind-set from the brash tenacity that prevails elsewhere in the financial industry.
"The mandate was to build a new bank on the foundations of the old collapsed bank," said Hoskuldur Olafsson, the chief executive of Arion Bank, sitting in his sparsely decorated office overlooking the water. "It didn't look good. It had no direction whatsoever. What we needed to do in the beginning was find some sort of a direction for where we would go with this bank."
Iceland's unusual path has been held up as a successful model of what can happen when a country opts to let its financial firms go under. The result in Iceland is that new banks are missing the big bonuses and risky trading desks that have fed populist anger elsewhere.
"We are a new bank with new business ethics and a new way of doing things," said Steinthor Palsson, the chief executive who was brought on to run Landsbankinn, the largest of Iceland's new banks. Revenue from trading operations at Landsbankinn is down to 10 percent of what it was in 2006.
But a transformation of the financial system can accomplish only so much in a country that faces such a long road to recovery.
Many companies and households in Iceland are still deeply indebted. Birgir Gudjonsson, a 37-year-old policeman in Reykjavik, said that the banks had been too interested in rebuilding their businesses and their balance sheets, and not helpful enough to homeowners like him who bought their first homes just before the crisis. Because many Icelandic loans are linked to inflation, Mr. Gudjonsson owes more than he initially borrowed.
"We've been hearing, almost weekly, 'Oh look at this, everything is great,' " he said in the two-bedroom apartment where he lives with his wife and two daughters. "We just have to look in our wallet to see the reality."
Companies and homeowners that want to borrow more are also having difficulty given the conservatism of the banks and a lack of access to foreign investors. In the first nine months of last year, for instance, Landsbankinn's net new lending to corporations and individuals was 0.8 percent of what in was in all of 2006.
"There is no easy way out of a deep crisis," said Mr. Benediktsson, the Icelandic finance minister, who recently came into office after an election that hinged on economic discontent.
Iceland's leaders did not see bailouts as an alternative when they took control of the banks in October 2008. The three major banks were 10 times as large as the country's gross domestic product, in contrast to the United States, where bank assets were about the same size as the annual G.D.P. Even if it wanted to, Iceland did not have the resources to save its banks.
Instead, the government took the banks and separated off all the loans and financial products that were outside Iceland -- the majority of the assets -- and stuffed them into a so-called bad bank with no government backing. The government also made it illegal to move money out of the country, halting a run on the local currency, the krona.
Even with these steps, the economy shrank 16 percent over the next year, and the unemployment rate rose to nearly 10 percent, from around 2 percent.
In Iceland, blame for the crisis fell almost entirely on the country's financiers. While banks in other parts of the world were tangled up in bad bets on the American mortgage market, banks in Iceland had taken on mountains of debt to bet on speculative assets, and had spun a web of self-serving loans. Almost all the top executives were fired and many are now facing criminal prosecution.
Initially, the government was in charge of the banks, running them on an emergency basis. Soon, though, new companies were set up to oversee the mortgages and corporate loans in the country, with ownership split between the government and the creditors of the old banks.
To run the new companies, the government looked for people who were not tainted by involvement with the banks in the boom years. Mr. Palsson had been working outside Iceland, at a pharmaceutical company, when he was chosen to run Landsbankinn. Mr. Olafsson came to Arion Bank from the local subsidiary of Visa.
When these men arrived, they said, they faced entirely demoralized work forces, and a public that saw all bankers as villains. In a country where policemen do not carry guns, some bank executives were assigned guards to protect them at home.
"If the United States on the Richter scale was a three, Iceland was a nine," said M.J. Bryant, a professor at the Ivey Business School in Canada who has written case studies on Iceland. "You have to place this all against the background of a complete betrayal of trust."
After Mr. Palsson assumed the helm at Landsbankinn, he fired all eight executives directly beneath him and put advertisements for their jobs in a local newspaper. A new law required that his executive team be at least 40 percent women.
Mr. Palsson said he realized the first thing he had to do was improve the mood among the bank's staff of 1,300 -- down from 5,000 before the crash. He called all of the bank's employees to Reykjavik's main cinema, where he gave a pep talk with his new strategy.
He then moved to address the public's anger, holding a series of public meetings around the country, where he sat on the stage with his other executives. Many of the meetings were filled with people berating Mr. Palsson's team for the bank's sins.
"Some people thought we were crazy doing this because people were very angry," Mr. Palsson said. "But it was really a good therapy for many people who were angry."
The banks' first task was restructuring the loans of companies and households that could no longer pay them. The government passed a law mandating that loans had to be reduced to no more than 110 percent of the underlying property -- helping homeowners who had ended up underwater, though it did not eliminate the inflation-linked loans that people like Mr. Gudjonsson have.
Landsbankinn went further and began a campaign to reduce the debt of any company or household that was unable to pay off its loans. This pressured the other banks to make similar efforts.
Another law made it illegal for banks to pay bonuses more than 25 percent of base salaries, and until recently none of the banks paid any bonuses at all.
But this has been one of the areas where the banks have realized the limits of reform. After some employees were poached by banks elsewhere in Scandinavia, where there were no bonus limits, Arion Bank and Islandsbank recently began offering bonuses for select executives.
The restructuring of the financial sector -- and the government steps to protect the currency -- have allowed unemployment to fall to 5.6 percent, and economic growth to begin.
Many economists, though, say that the banks are too focused on the past, and not doing enough to make new loans and build a business for the future. The banks have also been conservative about continuing to shrink their work force, which has left costs high.
"They are sort of in a standstill," said Fridrik Mar Baldursson, a specialist in finance at Reykjavik University. "There is so much inertia in the system."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDLast Friday at the Food Bank for New York on 116th Street, I caught a glimpse of the many shapes of need.
With a few hundred dollars, 25-year-old Ayesha Depay could afford the lessons she needs to pass her road test and get a driver's license, an indispensable tool for the job she craves leading recreation programs for children.
Nadine Robinson, 43, a former receptionist at Sony Music Studios who has been working for $9 an hour as a home health aide, could use the money to get a step ahead of the relentless stream of bills, pay down debts and rebuild her credit.
A 53-year-old security guard I talked to declined to provide his name, embarrassed perhaps that he was sleeping on friends' couches, working barely enough hours to "keep my head above water." He had so many potential uses for extra cash he couldn't pin any one down.
For all their differences, these men and women shared one crucial thing. Despite incomes low enough that if they had been parents they would probably have qualified for substantial government cash assistance, they received little if any support. What drew them here was the chance to participate in an antipoverty experiment started by the city's Center for Economic Opportunity to test what would happen if the government were to help adults without children.
To perform the investigation, proposed by the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and supported by his successor, Bill de Blasio, New York City contracted with MDRC, a nonprofit social policy research organization, to track 6,000 low-income single adults who do not have direct responsibility over children -- from never-married childless women to divorced fathers who don't have custody of their children but are obligated to pay child support.
Half of them will receive a bonus payment every year intended to replicate the main features of the earned-income tax credit. The other half will serve as a control group.
The hope is that the tax break will do for singles what it has achieved most successfully for single mothers: shoring up workers who suffer a drop in earnings and encouraging work by subsidizing the meager wages that have become the hallmark of the American service economy.
The test is one of the first concrete acknowledgments that the longstanding American economic belief that the job market alone can provide for the needs of nearly all workers may no longer be valid.
Needy children are innocent, worthy recipients of assistance. And for all practical purposes, that means aiding the parents, often single mothers, who care for them. But childless adults have been historically barred from most government support, from Medicaid to welfare.
From the 1930s well into the 1970s, most mothers were eligible for aid to families with dependent children only when the man was out of the home. "People from the welfare office came around looking for evidence of a man," said MDRC's president, Gordon L. Berlin. Today, low-income noncustodial fathers who can't afford to pay child support are still not considered deserving of assistance. And they can go to jail for not paying up.
But the labor market is not doing its job the way it once did. Earnings of male high school graduates fell by nearly a fifth from 1979 to 2012, after inflation. For men without a high school diploma they declined by almost a third. Women's wages have held up somewhat better, but are also declining for the least educated. Partly as a result, poverty among workers has increased faster over recent years than for working-age Americans without a job.
The future is not promising. According to projections from the Department of Labor, nine of the 10 occupations that will grow fastest over the next decade pay less than the median wage. Six pay less than is needed to keep a family of four out of poverty.
If the taboo against helping the able-bodied made sense in an era when a job guaranteed something approaching a reasonable living, its case is far weaker today.
The earned-income tax credit is the largest cash-transfer program in the United States, costing some $61 billion in 2010. It provides up to $3,305 a year to low-income working families with one child and up to $6,143 for those with three or more.
Combined with the much smaller child tax credit, it lifted one of every 15 children out of poverty in 2012, according to an analysis by Kathleen Short from the Census Bureau. Without it, the nation's overall poverty rate would be 19 percent instead of 16 percent, under the Census Bureau's comprehensive Supplemental Poverty Measure.
And it has encouraged single mothers to work. After the big expansions of the earned-income tax credit in 1990 and 1993, the labor supply of single mothers grew by 16 percentage points, reaching roughly 87 percent in 1999.
Like raising the minimum wage, broadening the tax credit could help workers earn their way out of poverty. "This is a promising thing to test," said Lawrence F. Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard who has been collaborating with MDRC on the design and evaluation of the experiment. "It is a pro-employment sort of way to make work pay."
Proposing more government aid in these bruising political times might seem like a waste of time. The New York program will bump the maximum annual benefit for singles to $2,000 for three years -- from a maximum under the federal earned-income tax credit of $496. And it will phase out much more slowly.
Extending New York's credit to some 13 million singles without qualifying children across the country would cost roughly $15 billion a year, according to a calculation by Cynthia Miller, who is head of the project for MDRC. Chances are that wouldn't sit well among congressional Republicans, who have called for cuts to food assistance and are opposed to reinstating the extension of emergency jobless benefits.
Still, the earned-income credit has proved enormously popular on the left and the right. President Ronald Reagan called it "the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress."
N. Gregory Mankiw, the former chief economic adviser to President George W. Bush, recently recommended the earned-income tax credit over a higher minimum wage as the better tool to increase the earnings of the working poor.
Some criticize the credit, however, saying it subsidizes employers by allowing beneficiaries to accept a lower wage. As a consequence, they argue, the tax break ends up hurting low-wage workers who do not qualify for it.
This argument, which could bolster the case for a higher minimum wage, could also strengthen the case for spreading the tax credit's benefits more broadly. And a broader credit could serve another rare bipartisan cause: improving compliance with child support laws.
"We have a robust child support enforcement system," said Maria Cancian, a professor of public affairs and social work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "What we've been less successful at is enabling low-income fathers to earn enough to support themselves and afford child support obligations."
Another potential benefit, said Kathryn Edin, a professor of public policy and management at Harvard University's Kennedy School, would be to encourage young disadvantaged men into jobs and away from crime, making them more desirable as marriage partners and reducing the number of children born to teenage single mothers.
"Family structure is both a consequence and a cause of poverty," Professor Edin told me.
The fundamental reason to support wages goes beyond children, however. In a nutshell, for the American market economy to remain viable, being employed must, one way or another, provide for workers' needs.
Correction: January 17, 2014, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about a program aimed at helping poor people without children, misstated part of the name of the food bank on 116th Street in Manhattan in some copies. It is the Food Bank for New York, not the Food Bank of New York.

World Bank Is Expecting Widespread (if Still Possibly Turbulent) Growth for 2014

Abstract: "The performance of advanced economies is gaining momentum, and this should support stronger growth in developing countries," Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, said in a statement.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- After years of recession, financial crisis, fiscal wars and a patchwork recovery, there are relatively few dark clouds on the horizon for the global economy.
That is the conclusion of the World Bank's latest global growth forecast, released on Tuesday. The bank's economists expect growth over all to increase from 2.4 percent last year to 3.2 percent in 2014, and to maintain that level for the next two years.
"The performance of advanced economies is gaining momentum, and this should support stronger growth in developing countries," Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank, said in a statement.
Indeed, in the latest sign that even battered Europe is on the mend, Eurostat reported on Tuesday that factories in the euro zone ramped up output in November after two months of decline. Industrial production rose 1.8 percent from October, which itself was revised upward to show a smaller monthly drop.
Still, it is not necessarily all clear sailing ahead. The Federal Reserve's slow retrenchment of its economic stimulus campaign -- which served to push down interest rates the world over -- poses one of the most significant risks for the global economy this year, the bank said.
Some lower-income economies may suffer from reduced inflows of investment if interest rates rise, the bank warned, as it has for months. That could lead to defaults and economic turbulence. Even so, the bank's economists do not see the Fed's so-called tapering as pushing global growth off its path.
"Whatever negative effect the taper might have, that's going to be offset by the stronger growth in high-income countries," Andrew Burns, the lead author of the report, said in an interview. "It's not a doom-and-gloom scenario."
He noted that markets responded calmly when the Fed announced its decision late last year to begin cutting its asset purchases, by an increment of $10 billion, from $85 billion a month.
The bank expects that developing economies will grow in 2014 by what would be a relatively moderate pace for them of 5.3 percent. That would be significantly slower than in the boom years that preceded the global recession. But the bank's economists said they believed that slower growth might be healthier and more stable, driven by improving economic fundamentals rather than cheap money and financial bubbles.
The emerging-market giants China and India should see stronger growth this year, the bank said. But concerns remain: India has struggled with inflation and currency depreciation, and China with a vulnerable banking sector and overinvestment. "It is important to avoid policy stasis so that the green shoots don't turn into brown stubble," said Kaushik Basu, the bank's chief economist.
This year, global momentum should benefit from a growing United States, a bottomed-out Europe and a revitalized Japan, the report said.
The beleaguered euro area seems to have turned a corner, the report said, and policy and financial uncertainty in the region has significantly eased. Ireland, Portugal and Spain have started growing again, and the pace of contraction seems to have slowed in Greece and Italy.
The monthly Eurostat report showed that Ireland, which has just exited its bailout program, led all European Union nations, with a sharp 11.7 percent gain in industrial production in November, bouncing back from a 6.3 decline in the previous month. Germany, the largest European economy, reported a rise of 2.4 percent, while France managed a gain of 1.4 percent.
The entire European Union, which includes 11 countries beyond the 17 nations that shared the euro last year, reported a 1.5 percent increase in industrial output in November, putting it 3 percent ahead of the same month a year earlier.
In the United States, federal budget cuts should have a smaller effect on growth in the future, the bank said. And uncertainty stemming from Washington, capped last fall when the federal government shut down over a budget impasse, should pose less of a problem, too.
The bank expects growth in the United States of about 2.8 percent in 2014, up from 1.8 percent last year.
And even Japan has been jolted out of its long slump by aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus in Japan -- often called "Abenomics," after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- that is helping bring more balance to the global economy.
"The high-income countries are growing," Mr. Burns said. "For the first time in five years, we have two engines at the head of the train of global growth."

Lobbying Picks Up Over Bill to Toughen Antinuclear Sanctions Against Iran

Abstract: The bill, co-sponsored by Senator Mark S. Kirk, an Illinois Republican, and Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, has acquired added significance in recent days because of a temporary agreement in the nuclear negotiations that will freeze parts of Iran's nuclear activities for six months in return for a partial easing of economic sanctions that have been imposed by the United States and the European Union.

Full text:   Partisans in the debate over a Senate bill that would threaten onerous new antinuclear sanctions on Iran escalated their lobbying on Tuesday, with critics submitting a letter to lawmakers signed by 62 multifaith organizations urging a delay and supporters pointing to what they called Iran's insincerity.
President Obama has said the bill, which already has strong bipartisan backing in the Senate, could sabotage the administration's efforts to negotiate a comprehensive agreement with Iran that would ensure its nuclear activities are peaceful, resolving a prolonged dispute that has raised the possibility of another armed conflict in the Middle East.
Mr. Obama has threatened a veto, but the bill may already have enough support to potentially override that, and it is unclear how long the administration can delay a vote.
The bill, co-sponsored by Senator Mark S. Kirk, an Illinois Republican, and Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, has acquired added significance in recent days because of a temporary agreement in the nuclear negotiations that will freeze parts of Iran's nuclear activities for six months in return for a partial easing of economic sanctions that have been imposed by the United States and the European Union.
The temporary pact, which takes effect on Monday, is meant to give negotiations for a comprehensive agreement more time. Although the Kirk-Menendez legislation's provisions would not take effect unless those negotiations fail, critics contend it violates the temporary pact and already is threatening to sabotage the diplomacy.
"By foreclosing diplomatic prospects, new sanctions would set us on a path to war," read a letter sent Tuesday to senators as part of an effort led by the National Iranian American Council, a Washington group that opposes sanctions. "The American people have made it clear that they do not want another war in the Middle East and strongly support pursuing diplomatic prospects until they are exhausted."
The letter was signed by 61 other groups drawn from a range of religious antiwar backgrounds, including the Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America, Evangelicals for Social Action, the Islamic Society of North America, Jewish Voice for Peace and Veterans for Peace.
Supporters of the Kirk-Menendez legislation, known as the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013, contend that its threats will pressure the Iranians to negotiate in good faith or face economic disaster, reflecting a view that Iran would not have agreed to any talks without the sanctions already imposed. Those measures have halved Iran's oil exports, basically severed it from the global banking system, and caused inflation, joblessness and shortages in the country.
Provisions in the Kirk-Menendez bill would go much further, with steps that could drive Iran's oil exports to near zero and make any relief contingent on a complete dismantlement of Iran's nuclear infrastructure -- something the Iranians have already rejected.
Escalating an effort to portray Iran's leaders as duplicitous, supporters of the Kirk-Menendez bill argue that the country already is feeling less pressure to negotiate. Some have taken aim at Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, an American-educated diplomat who led the successful negotiations on the temporary pact, which was finalized on Sunday between Iran and the so-called P5-plus-1 countries, the five permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany.
The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that supports tough sanctions, criticized Mr. Zarif on Tuesday for paying respects on Monday in Beirut, Lebanon, at the grave of Imad Mughniyeh, an assassinated commander in the military wing of Hezbollah, the Shiite political organization allied with Iran. The United States and Israel consider Hezbollah a terrorist group, and the European Union has classified its military wing as a terrorist operation.
Mr. Mughniyeh, killed in a 2008 car bombing that Hezbollah said was carried out by Israel, was regarded by the United States as having planned numerous attacks, including the 1983 truck bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241 American service members.
"Celebrating a mass-murdering terrorist is a bad choice for any foreign minister, but the decision by Tehran's top diplomat to so brazenly honor a terrorist like Mughniyeh, who killed hundreds of Americans, within hours of inking an agreement with the U.S. and members of the P5-plus-1 sends a very negative and unmistakable signal about Iran's true intentions," Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said in an email. He said Mr. Zarif's gesture should be "met with a firm Obama administration response such as new terrorism sanctions against Iran."
Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council, also condemned Mr. Zarif's visit. "The decision to commemorate an individual who has participated in such vicious acts, and whose organization continues to actively support terrorism worldwide, sends the wrong message and will only exacerbate tensions in the region," Ms. Hayden said in a statement.

Full text:   The last time Congress approved a series of spending bills to pay for the government -- its most basic job -- was in 2011. Since then, Republican lawmakers, determined to thwart the Obama administration at every step, have forced the government to subsist on stopgap measures that simply carry over or cut previous spending, with no accounting for growth, inflation or changing priorities.
That's about to change this week, in one of the few pieces of good news to emerge from the current Congress. Assuming hard-right members of the House don't manage to block it, a $1 trillion appropriations bill is about to be approved by both chambers for the rest of the 2014 fiscal year, through the end of September. That means some of the most important domestic programs, starved for cash by budget caps and the sequester, will finally get much of the money they need.
Republican moderates, politically burned by the government shutdown last fall, joined Democrats in fending off almost all of the Tea Party's demands. Right-wing Republicans failed to prevent any money from being spent on implementing the health care law, or enforcing power-plant regulations, or reforming financial practices under the Dodd-Frank law.
While the bill still reflects many Republican priorities, most of the worst proposals are gone. So are the deepest cuts of the sequester, following the budget agreement reached last month. Head Start would get $612 million more than last year, enough to restore the 57,000 slots that were cut by the sequester. The bill creates a new $250 million grant program that would encourage states to build or expand high-quality preschool classes for poor families. There would also be significant increases for health agencies whose research budgets had been cut: $1 billion more for the National Institutes of Health, $567 million more for the Centers for Disease Control, and $91 million for the Food and Drug Administration. NASA gets a boost over last year's amount, and the administration's transportation grant program for the states, intended to create jobs and rebuild infrastructure, won $600 million, more than the White House requested.
Republicans did win some victories. The financial regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, received far less money than they need to do their jobs rigorously, and there was an unnecessary cut to a fund for disease prevention and public health. There will not be enough money for the United States to fulfill its pledges to the International Monetary Fund. One terrible environmental rider was included, a gift to the coal industry that allows continued dumping of toxic coal-mining waste in streams. Also included is the ridiculous provision that prevents enforcement of new light-bulb standards, a triumph for those who consider incandescent lights a symbol of freedom.
The right-wing's larger victory is in the overall spending amount, which is far less than it should be to revive the economy. In 2008, discretionary spending under President George W. Bush was $1.176 trillion. That amount should have gone up in the following six years to reflect growth and inflation, paid for with new tax revenues. Instead it has fallen sharply to $1.012 trillion. The spending bill is better than a stopgap measure, but it is nowhere near sufficient to pay for the necessary investments in education and infrastructure that the country needs.

Abstract: Treasury issues were subdued for much of the year by the threat -- and then the fact -- that the Federal Reserve would start to wind down quantitative easing, its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. The new year may be far less profitable than 2013, they warn, for three reasons: the reduction in Fed bond-buying makes higher interest rates more likely; earnings growth is likely to remain sluggish; and the market's spectacular run, amid those smaller earnings gains, has left stocks expensive.

Full text:   THE stock market ended 2013 at record highs and with indicators of investor optimism near best-ever levels. The enthusiasm is understandable after a year that was the strongest for stocks in well over a decade -- but whether it is wise is another matter.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 29.6 percent, to 1,848.36, capped by an especially strong fourth-quarter gain of 9.9 percent. The full-year increase was the biggest since 1997, and stock fund managers made the most of the fertile environment, achieving their best results since 1991.
The average domestic equity fund in Morningstar's database rose 8.3 percent in the fourth quarter and 30.4 percent for all of 2013. The average large-capitalization blend fund, the sort that would use the S.&P. 500 as a benchmark, was up 31.9 percent for the year. That beat the price appreciation of the index but lagged the 33.2 percent total return, which includes dividends, of the SPDR S.&P. 500, a large exchange-traded fund that tracks it. Exchange-traded funds continued to grow in popularity, to their largest year-end proportion ever. They accounted for 13.2 percent of fund assets as of November, according to Morningstar, compared with 12.7 percent at the end of 2012.
It was a difficult quarter for the bond market. A sharp rise in 10-year Treasury yields last year, to 3.03 percent from 1.76 percent, sent prices lower on longer-dated issues, although instruments of lower quality and with shorter maturities fared better.
Treasury issues were subdued for much of the year by the threat -- and then the fact -- that the Federal Reserve would start to wind down quantitative easing, its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage securities. The Fed announced in December that it intended to reduce purchases by $10 billion a month from a starting rate of $85 billion if suitable economic progress continued.
Quantitative easing gave investors a reason to buy stocks all year, and the Fed's plan for a slow reduction of the program, with its promise to keep interest rates low for a long time, gave them a reason to keep buying. Although the impending announcement had been a source of dread, the market had one of its best sessions all year when it occurred on Dec. 18, and the ebullient mood lingered until year-end.
As 2013 came to a close, the weekly Investors Intelligence survey of investment newsletters recorded the most lopsided ratio of bulls to bears -- more than four to one -- since 1987. Similarly, the weekly poll of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers, released on Jan. 2, showed one of the most bullish readings since the survey began in 2006.
But while investors cheered, economists and corporate executives had less to celebrate. Inflation-adjusted economic growth reported by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis reached an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the third quarter, the most since 2011. Yet much of the strength resulted from inventory buildup -- things made but not sold -- and from greater consumption by necessity, not choice. Higher spending on health care and energy accounted for most of an upward revision in third-quarter growth reported in December.
An increase in profits was tepid and similarly suspect. The research service FactSet estimates that net earnings for S.&P. 500 companies increased 6.3 percent last year, barely one-fifth of the index's gain, and much of the profit growth was attributable to the very low interest expense engineered by the Fed.
THAT so-so backdrop didn't hinder the desire to own stocks. But with prices seeming to outrun reality, some strategists and portfolio managers have urged investors to rein in their enthusiasm. The new year may be far less profitable than 2013, they warn, for three reasons: the reduction in Fed bond-buying makes higher interest rates more likely; earnings growth is likely to remain sluggish; and the market's spectacular run, amid those smaller earnings gains, has left stocks expensive. Now that the Fed has made its intentions clear, investors may focus more on fundamentals, and they may not like what they see.
"I don't deny that there have been a number of sentimental, emotional developments that have helped the stock market," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman Wealth Management. "The concern I have is that the Fed has been a sideshow. The real show is what's going on with corporate earnings, margins and valuations. Earnings have been bouncing along roughly in line with nominal G.D.P. growth."
That figure comprises real gross domestic product -- what the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports -- and the inflation rate. Neither has been expanding all that fast consistently, Mr. Clemons noted. Beyond the economic backdrop, he says he believes that companies' ability to bolster profits without significantly increasing sales, through cost-cutting and very low interest rates, has run its course.
That inauspicious combination led him to forecast profit growth at a mid-single-digit rate this year. He has continued to look for value, he said, but with stocks starting 2014 trading at roughly 18 times earnings, "it's harder to find."
Joseph R. Huber, manager of the Huber Capital Equity Income and Huber Capital Small Cap Value funds, has been frustrated in his search, too. "It's difficult to find stocks in this market, even on a relative basis," he said. He has looked for value, and said it was especially hard to find among smaller companies.
If there are precious few cheap stocks in this market, how about in others? Funds that specialize in foreign stocks gained 5 percent, on average, in the fourth quarter and 15.9 percent for the full year -- strong by the standards of most years but barely half as great as domestic funds' performance. Europe was the best overseas region, with portfolios there rising by an average of 28.9 percent in 2013; funds invested in emerging markets were noticeably weak, up just 0.7 percent.
It took Europe longer to start working its way out of the 2008-9 financial crisis than the United States, so European companies and stocks are widely seen as being in an earlier stage of recovery. Although raw economic numbers look worse in Europe, the improvement from the depths of the crisis is heartening investors.
"You have to be careful not to judge the recovery by U.S. standards," advised Simon Webber, lead manager of the Schroder International Alpha fund.
Even amid lackluster growth, corporate profits in Europe could improve substantially, he predicted, because they are coming off a low base. "European earnings are significantly below their peak" of the mid-2000s, Mr. Webber said, "and the U.S. is back to its previous peak, so there's scope for significant recovery, which I expect to come through in the next 12 months."
He still counsels selectivity, with an emphasis on industries like banking, insurance and staffing. As for countries, he prefers some with strong economies, such as Germany, but also those that may be bouncing back. Spain, for instance, "has made big gains in competitiveness and has the bones of an export-led recovery," he said.
Mr. Webber also encourages careful choices in China. He suggests that investors concentrate on segments of the economy that stand to benefit from an emphasis on an improving quality of life, a mix that includes retailers and businesses that help bring efficient and cleaner energy use.
SELECTIVITY by bond investors last year did little good, unless investors selected high-yield or junk bonds. Those junk-bond funds, on average, rose 7.2 percent for the year, aided by a gain of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter.
The average taxable bond fund returned 1 percent in the quarter and 0.9 percent for the year, dragged down by funds that focus on long-term issues. They were hit especially hard by the climb in interest rates and fell 6.1 percent for the year. An indication of poor 2013 performance in long-term government bonds was the negative 14.4 percent total return of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond, a frequently traded exchange-traded fund.
William H. Gross, manager of Pimco Total Return, the largest bond fund with nearly $250 billion in assets, does not expect the environment for bond investors to be any more benign in 2014 as the Fed's assistance to them continues to wane.
"It would be better for the bond market for the Fed to write a trillion dollars' worth of checks a year than not," Mr. Gross said. With the checks set to be smaller, "it's just a question of where to seek shelter."
He said he expected the Fed to keep its target for the federal funds rate, at which banks make overnight loans to one another, at 0.25 percent for at least two more years. That would lead him to stick to instruments toward the shorter end of the yield curve, coming due in two to four years.
Modest economic growth "opens the door for credit, but not necessarily junk bonds," he added. That would encompass corporate issues of moderate to high creditworthiness. He also recommends some foreign bonds, particularly from Mexico, and closed-end municipal bond funds trading at large discounts to their intrinsic asset values. Muni mutual funds had a poor 2013, losing 3.4 percent, on average.
When it comes to bonds, Mr. Clemons at Brown Brothers Harriman prefers even shorter maturities than Mr. Gross, eight months or less. As for stocks, Mr. Clemons likes stable, financially strong sectors like consumer staples as well as beaten-down niches like emerging markets. Such exceptions aside, he and his colleagues have been selling into the rally, and he advises extreme caution.
"I don't know if a bear market is on the way," he said, "but I know that the combination of low earnings growth, high margins, high valuations and investor complacency gives you no margin for safety."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- PRESIDENT OBAMA has assured American workers that he won't let Congress keep him from lending a hand during these tough economic times. "I will not allow gridlock, inaction or willful indifference to get in our way," he said in a speech last year. "Whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I'll use it."
The problem is that most presidential actions that could help significant numbers of middle-class workers do require congressional participation. But here's one that doesn't: raising the salary threshold for the exemption to the overtime rules of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
The act establishes that most workers, after 40 hours of weekly work, are entitled to be paid 1.5 times their regular wage -- a.k.a., overtime. Hourly paid workers fall into this class, as do salaried workers who make less than a specified "threshold" amount. The idea is that employees in higher-status positions (executives, administrators, professionals) ought to be exempt from receiving the overtime premium.
But as with the minimum wage, which is not automatically adjusted for inflation and tends to lose real value unless it is raised, the overtime exemption threshold generally languishes. That means that many people who once would have been paid 1.5 times their wage when working overtime are not, violating the spirit of the law.
For decades, the Department of Labor periodically updated the overtime salary threshold. But today's threshold, at $455 a week, is far below historical levels in real terms. And at just $2 a week more than a poverty-level income for a family of four, it is indefensibly low. I propose that President Obama raise the threshold to $970, equal in today's dollars to the 1975 level of $250.
In keeping with the original purpose of the overtime rules, this increase would make overtime pay more expensive, creating an incentive for employers to spread work among other workers (an important goal in today's low-job-creation environment). It would also more fairly compensate those who do work more than 40 hours.
Why do I suggest an updated 1975 value of $970? Because it would restore the proper relationship between the overtime salary threshold and today's median wage. When the Ford administration raised the threshold in 1975, it was 1.6 times the median wage. Today's median wage for 40 hours of work is about $670. Were we to update that value by the same 1.6 ratio that prevailed in the mid-1970s, we'd end up with a threshold above $1,000, suggesting that $970 is, if anything, on the low side.
At the same time, an updated 1975 value would still leave higher-status positions exempt from the overtime protection. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings for manager-supervisors in various occupations range from $1,520 to $3,995, well above my proposed threshold.
You might worry that raising the overtime salary threshold would dampen hiring by creating higher labor costs. But there are good reasons not to expect this outcome. Research suggests that employers have a rough idea of how much overtime they will need from a given hire and adjust the base wage down accordingly. This means that at least some part of the burden of an increased overtime premium falls on the worker. But more important, if employers want to avoid paying overtime, they have an easy way to do so: Hire new workers to do the extra work at the standard wage. (This, again, was one of the objectives of the original law.)
The overtime provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act is still a vital contributor to the well-being of millions of American workers, but it needs updating to live up to its potential. At the same time, for President Obama to carry out his pledge to help working people with or without Congress's participation, he needs policy reforms that make a difference but don't require legislative approval. Raising the overtime salary threshold would be a simple solution to both problems.

Full text:   HAS Japan turned the economic corner?
Nearly a quarter-century after the Japanese stock market bubble burst at the end of 1989, the stock market leapt by more than 50 percent in 2013, as the era of deflation appeared to be finally ending. Final figures are not in, but it appears the economy grew faster in 2013 than in any year since 1996.
As the accompanying charts show, however, much of the stimulus for the economy has come from the government, rather than the private sector, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office just over a year ago, moved aggressively to apply fiscal stimulus and the central bank, the Bank of Japan, began a program of large purchases of Japanese government bonds.
The government's policies, known as "Abenomics," are also supposed to include what the prime minister called a "third arrow" of economic reforms, but they have progressed much more slowly than the first two arrows of fiscal and monetary stimulus. In addition, it is unclear how much of the recent economic growth came from an acceleration of consumer spending in anticipation of an increase in the consumption tax scheduled for April.
As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the Nikkei 225 stock index gained 57 percent in 2013. That was a faster annual gain than during any single "bubble" year of the 1980s, and was the largest increase since 1972.
Still, the index remains 58 percent below its level at the end of 1989, when the bubble burst.
After adjusting for the 18 percent drop in the value of the yen, the Nikkei was still up nearly 30 percent for the year, about the same as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the United States. The yen had not declined as rapidly as it did in 2013 in any year since 1979. Even with that fall, however, the yen is valued higher than it was at the end of 2007, when the United States recession began. But the recent decline has provoked protests from American auto manufacturers, who say it is giving Japanese manufacturers an unfair advantage.
For years, some foreign economists, among them Ben Bernanke, who is completing his term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, have been calling on Japan to stimulate inflation by, in effect, printing money. Buying government bonds is a way to accomplish that, and there are signs that deflation is ending. The core Consumer Price Index -- excluding food and energy -- climbed 0.6 percent through November, and is expected to show an annual gain for the first time since 1997. Moreover, Mr. Abe has been pushing Japanese companies to increase wages.
The nominal gross domestic product, before adjusting for inflation or deflation, grew 1.9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2012 through the third quarter of 2013. In most other countries, such a figure would be viewed as disappointing, at best. But in Japan, there has not been an annual increase that large since 1996. Even with it, however, the Japanese economy is 7 percent smaller than it was at the peak in 2007.
Much of that growth, however, reflects government spending. Public fixed investment in such things as schools and highways was up 16.1 percent over the last three quarters. That is greater than any annual increase since the government began reporting the figure in 1990. But private fixed investment rose just 2 percent over the same period.
In its effort to end deflation, and push inflation as high as 2 percent, the Bank of Japan has been buying government bonds faster than the government can issue them. In 2013, the central bank's assets were up 42 percent, more than in the previous five years combined.
The International Monetary Fund has praised the first year of Abenomics. In a speech in Tokyo at the end of October, Anoop Singh, the director of the fund's Asia and Pacific department, said the new policies provided "a unique opportunity for Japan to end decades-long deflation and sluggish growth, and reverse the rise of public debt." But, he cautioned, "In the near term, the challenge will be to achieve a successful transition to the next phase of Abenomics, which should be characterized by self-sustained, private-demand-led growth, and by a steady increase in inflation."
It is hard to imagine the I.M.F. calling for "a steady increase in inflation" in any other major country. But no other country has suffered from deflation as much as Japan has over the last 15 years.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama plans to nominate three people to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, including Stanley Fischer, former head of the Bank of Israel, as the Fed's next vice chairman, the White House said on Friday.
Mr. Obama also plans to nominate Lael Brainard, a former Treasury Department official, to an open seat on the seven-member board, and to nominate the Republican financier Jerome H. Powell, on the board since 2012, to a new term.
"These three distinguished individuals have the proven experience, judgment and deep knowledge of the financial system to serve at the Federal Reserve during this important time for our economy," Mr. Obama said in a statement.
The recent move by Senate Democrats to prevent filibusters of presidential nominees clears the way for a relatively quick confirmation process.
The nominations would replenish the Fed's board with officials who are seen as generally supportive of the Fed's incoming chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and of the Fed's continuing campaign to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment.
The Fed must decide in the coming months how quickly to retreat from that stimulus campaign, a process it began in December. The economy remains weak -- unemployment is high, inflation is low -- but officials increasingly are concerned about the harmful side effects of their long-running effort to address those problems by suppressing borrowing costs and encouraging financial risk taking.
Mr. Fischer, 70, would succeed Ms. Yellen in her current role. The Senate confirmed Ms. Yellen as the Fed's new chairwoman this week. She will take over from the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, in February.
Mr. Fischer has had an influential career as an academic and a policy maker. As a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he mentored many of the current crop of economic policy makers, including Mr. Bernanke and Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank. As the head of the Bank of Israel during the financial crisis, he drew praise for his success in sheltering the Israeli economy from the worst effects of the global recession that followed the crisis.
He also worked as a senior Citigroup executive from 2002 to 2005.
In recent public comments, Mr. Fischer has described the Fed's stimulus campaign as necessary but risky. He has also questioned the value of a crucial element of the Fed's strategy, known as "forward guidance." The Fed has sought to hold down interest rates by telling investors that it expects rates to remain low. Mr. Fischer has said that investors are right to regard such predictions with skepticism because circumstances could require a central bank to abandon its intentions.
Mr. Fischer, born in present-day Zambia, holds American and Israeli citizenship.
He said in a statement that he was "deeply honored" by the nomination.
Another nominee, Ms. Brainard, 51, joined the Obama administration in 2010 as Treasury under secretary for international affairs -- in effect a senior diplomat for the nation's financial interests. She stepped down in November. That expertise could prove valuable to the Fed as it navigates the global impact of its actions and seeks to foster international coordination on issues of monetary and regulatory policy.
Mr. Obama praised her as "one of my top and most trusted international economic advisers during a challenging time not just at home, but for our global economy."
And Mr. Powell, 60, joined the Fed's board in 2012 to serve out an uncompleted term. An expert on fiscal policy, he was a Treasury under secretary during the administration of President George H. W. Bush. He later worked for a decade as a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. He would remain the member of the Fed's board with the greatest practical experience of financial markets.
Mr. Obama still needs to appoint a successor to the Fed governor Sarah Bloom Raskin, who is awaiting confirmation as deputy Treasury secretary. And another member of the board, Jeremy C. Stein, must return to Harvard this year if he wants to retain his status as a tenured professor of economics.

Abstract: According to an analysis by Shigeru Fujita, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the aging of the American population accounts for about two-thirds of the decline in labor force participation since 2000.

Full text:   People keep leaving the labor force. The share of Americans either working or looking for work sank to 62.8 percent in December, tying October for the lowest level since 1977 -- an era when women were much less likely to work.
One explanation is that baby boomers are shuffling into retirement. The trend is demographic rather than economic. People are not working because they are old.
Another explanation is that people have abandoned hope of finding jobs.
Both explanations are true for some people. What we don't know are the proportions. We don't know how many of the people who have stopped looking for work might want to return to the ranks of working adults as the economy rebounds.
Economic forecasts from before the recession are a potentially valuable source of insight. The demographic trends, after all, were relatively easy to predict. The number of baby boomers is stable -- or at any rate, it does not increase.
It is therefore striking that in 2005, when the labor force participation rate stood at 66 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted that the rate would fall only a bit to 65.6 percent by 2014 -- far above the current rate of 62.8 percent.
Recent studies, including a much-discussed paper by a pair of Federal Reserve economists working at the International Monetary Fund, have similarly concluded that the recession is the primary cause of the decline in the labor force.
As is often the case in economics, however, the truth has proven elusive.
Some economists did predict that demographics would produce a decline like the one we have seen. Notably, a 2006 paper by a different group of Fed economists predicted that labor force participation would fall to 62.9 percent in 2014.
And a competing set of recent studies has found validation for these predictions in the latest data. According to an analysis by Shigeru Fujita, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the aging of the American population accounts for about two-thirds of the decline in labor force participation since 2000.
Why are answers so hard to find? In part because the data is subject to multiple interpretations. Those who say they've retired may mean that they never want to work again, or they may be taking shelter in the dignity of retirement because they can't find work -- and they might be willing, even eager, to reconsider.
The Fed, in theory, could determine the answer by stimulating the economy until the participation rate stops rising. But the Fed is not going to do that, because officials believe that pushing unemployment below a certain level, known as the "natural rate," will cause inflation to increase. Instead, they will set policy based on a best guess about the share of people who might return to the work force.
It is quite likely the argument will therefore be resolved by default.
A sobering piece of economic modeling by the St. Louis firm Macroeconomic Advisers, published last summer, concluded that the participation rate was not likely to rebound because the damage done by the recession would not be reversed quickly enough to keep ahead of the long-term demographic trends.
Decisions made for economic reasons have a way of hardening into demographic facts. Those who announce that they are retired are less likely to return to the labor force. People who qualify for disability benefits rarely return to work. And baby boomers keep getting older. As time goes by, many of those people who might have returned to the work force will become people who never did.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: (Holland Cotter) * Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

Museums
* Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Tony Feher' (through Feb. 16) Almost anything can be beautiful if it's presented in the right way. That's where the sculptor Tony Feher comes in. His palette consists almost entirely of cheap manufactured objects, including glass and plastic bottles; metal and plastic bottle tops; marbles, coins, nuts and bolts, metal rings, plastic bags, broken pieces of glass, rope, plastic cord, shredded paper, cans and cardboard boxes. He organizes these and other things into simple but surprisingly exciting, often funny configurations with intriguing philosophical implications. This beautiful show surveys a 25-year career. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt' (through December 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, this show is for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum's renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
* Brooklyn Museum: 'Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey' (through March 9) For the past decade and a half, Wangechi Mutu, born in Kenya and based in New York, has been producing large-scale figurative collages as politically nuanced as they are ravishing. Since she first started to show them in the late 1990s, they have grown more complex and detailed, and we're seeing them at what has to be some kind of peak moment in this pithy traveling survey. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'War/Photography: Images of Armed Conflict and Its Aftermath' (through Feb. 2) This flawed but intensely absorbing exhibition presents pictures by more than 280 photographers relating to conflicts from the Mexican-American War of 1846-49 to the Arab Spring revolution of 2010-11. Photographs from widely different times and places are grouped according to themes like "Recruitment and Embarkation" and "Homecoming," suggesting that all wars are somehow similar, which is debatable. The main problem, though, is the claustrophobic, overly busy installation, which is unfortunate because there is hardly a single picture that doesn't cry out to be seen and pondered by itself. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Frick Collection: 'Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Hals: Masterpieces of Dutch Painting From the Mauritshuis' (through Jan. 19) Johannes Vermeer's much-loved "Girl With a Pearl Earring," not seen in New York for nearly 30 years, is one of 15 choice pictures in this traveling show of loans from the Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis in The Hague. She's joined by four Rembrandts, Jacob van Ruisdael's out-of-this-world "View of Haarlem With Bleaching Grounds" and -- maybe the star among stars -- Carel Fabritius's palpitating little "Goldfinch." 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org; admission is by timed tickets. (Cotter)
* Guggenheim Museum: 'Christopher Wool' (through Jan. 22) This show, one of the most beautiful exhibitions to unwind up the Guggenheim's spiral ramp in some time, surveys the 25-year accomplishment of an "endgame" painter who brought the medium to the brink of extinction and then fruitfully worked his way back from the edge. It starts with his laconic, implacable black-and-white word paintings and then shows him layering various deadpan handmade and printed motifs, ending up with an innovative combination of visual transparency and pictorial force. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
* International Center of Photography: 'Lewis Hine' and 'Future of America: Lewis Hine's New Deal Photographs' (through Jan. 19) These inspiring exhibitions survey the career of the pioneering documentary photographer Lewis Hine (1874-1940), whose subjects included immigrants just arriving at Ellis Island; children working in factories and coal mines; families living in Lower East Side tenements; black Americans; and men building skyscrapers. Hine was an inquiring, generously humane sociologist. He had a romantic belief in the possibilities of America, epitomized by his heroic images of construction workers near the top of the nearly complete Empire State Building. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
* Jewish Museum: 'Chagall: Love, War, and Exile' (through Feb. 2) This exhibition of Marc Chagall's work from the 1930s and '40s hinges on a group of paintings and drawings of Jesus on the cross, most of them made during, or shortly before or after, World War II. In these dark and anguished works, Chagall unexpectedly adopts Jesus as a Jewish martyr, as a symbol of a persecuted people and of the refugee artist in particular. The show's final gallery, however, glosses over this difficult period with some of Chagall's more romantic and nostalgic postwar paintings. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The American West in Bronze, 1850-1925' (through April 13) This intriguing and spiritually troubling show presents 65 mostly pedestal-scale sculptures representing standard themes of the old American West: cowboys, Indians and wild animals. It includes famous practitioners of the genre like Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell, as well as 26 others. Nearly all the sculptures are in a mode of three-dimensional illustrative realism and tend heavily to romantic idealization. There's the rub: The real history of the conquest of the West by white folks was much worse than what these artists imagined in their very popular works. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China' (through April 6) This museum's first survey of recent Chinese art uses the lens of the culture's ancient brush and ink tradition so basic to its landscape painting and calligraphy. It doesn't always work. The show endures a scattered installation, includes overly refined displays of empty skill and wanders off message in spots, especially with several sculptures that don't seem to belong here. But a few moments of visual life and many interesting questions about the weight of the old on the new make it worthwhile. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Jewels By JAR' (through March 9) Crowd-pleasers needn't represent lowered curatorial standards in terms of subject and execution, but this one does. It packs 400 efforts by the New York-born, Paris-based high-society jeweler, Joel Arthur Rosenthal (JAR), into a very dark gallery with insufficient labeling or historical backup. Large pave brooches, usually of flowers, abound; too many pieces date from 2010 or later. There are certainly redeeming works, but the show cries out for editing, scholarly support and better viewing conditions. Artist and audience are left hanging, with the museum's mercenary agenda in full view. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: William Kentridge: 'The Refusal of Time' (through May 11) Everything is on the move in this mini-theater-cum-power-plant of an installation. In wraparound videos, metronomes pound. Clock-faces spin, spewing trails of stars. Drawings draw and erase themselves. Maps of Africa appear and disappear. White-coated figures mix potions amid giant watch springs. At the center of the gallery a wooden contraption pumps away like an energy source. A collaboration between Mr. Kentridge, who is based in South Africa, and Peter L. Galison, a science historian at Harvard, the piece refers to the European colonial experiment, which strove to shape other cultures to its own concepts of reality, only to find that those cultures had different, resistant, assertive realities of their own. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Silla: Korea's Golden Kingdom' (through Feb. 23) This intriguing show presents more than 130 objects from Silla, a kingdom that dominated the Korean peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries. The first two of three sections includes gold jewelry, formally austere pottery, glassware and other objects excavated from mound shaped, earth-covered tombs in the city of Gyeongju. The third section displays sculpture made after Buddhism was adopted as the state religion around 530. Among the most captivating is a beautiful three-foot-high, gilt bronze sculpture of a young Bodhisattva, which, like a number of other works in the show, has been designated a Korean National Treasure. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Venetian Glass by Carlo Scarpa: The Venini Company, 1932-1947' (through March 2) Before he turned to architecture, Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) designed glass vessels, achieving a lifetime's worth of beauty and innovation in a short, remarkable burst of creativity. His achievement is honored with this sublime exhibition of nearly 300 of his splendidly sculptural, radiantly colored, ingeniously patterned vessels. They have an inspiring wholeness: process, form and decoration become a single thing; art, craft and science merge. And content of the non-narrative, experiential kind abounds. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
* MoMA PS1: 'Mike Kelley' (through Feb. 2) This retrospective of the Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley fills 40,000 feet of gallery space at PS1. And it's that very rare thing, a huge show that should be huge. Kelley earned this blowout; his work sustains one. In a three-decade career, cut off by his suicide, at 57, last year, he did it all genrewise: performance, painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, video, installation, sound art and writing. And he wove together -- twisted together -- all of that into what amounted to a single conceptual project based on recurrent themes: class politics, popular culture, black humor, anti-formalist rigor and a moral sense, unshakably skeptical, that ran through everything like a spine. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Leonardo da Vinci: Treasures from the Biblioteca Reale, Turin' (through Feb. 2) A mere handful of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci are in this exquisite show. But in the case of the great multidisciplinary experimentalist and technician, even a little is a lot. Leonardo the scientist is here in the drawn and annotated "Codex on the Flight of Birds" and the artist in the exquisite silverpoint image called "Head of a Young Woman." Both works are in New York for the first time. The show is fleshed out with work by some of the master's followers and by the Morgan's own "Codex Huygens," a late-16th-century manuscript that has faithful copies of now-lost Leonardo drawings. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Arts and Design: 'Out of Hand: Materializing the Postdigital' (through June 1) If you haven't quite wrapped your head around the concept of 3-D printing, or haven't yet had a digital scanner wrap itself around you, now you can do both in this survey of computer-assisted art, architecture and design. The show looks at art made since 2005 and fills nearly three floors, including many irresistible interactive projects. Its ideas may not be entirely new; the Museum of Modern Art's 2008 exhibition "Design and the Elastic Mind" covered much of the same territory, but there's something to be said for this more down-to-earth, production-focused exhibition. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'American Modern: Hopper to O'Keeffe' (through Jan. 26) An attempt to prove that the Museum of Modern Art did not neglect American art between the wars before the Abstract Expressionists arrived, this selection of 120 works in several mediums presents plenty to look at in a beautiful installation, but it is completely predictable in its choice of artists and its viewpoint. By making no effort to reimagine early American modernism, it is most notable as evidence of the Modern's current indifference to the field. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Designing Modern Women 1890-1990' (through Oct. 5) Shoehorned into half the museum's design department, this conversation-starting display of objects from MoMA's permanent collection features items designed by more than 60 women, many of whom worked with male partners. Some, like Marianne Brandt and Eileen Gray, are well known to design aficionados, but most will be unfamiliar to a general audience. Most objects were created for domestic consumption. The pièce de résistance is a kitchen designed by Charlotte Perriand for the apartments in Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation in Marseille, France. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Dorothea Rockburne: Drawing Which Makes Itself' (through Feb. 2) The main attraction in this mini-survey of Dorothea Rockburne is a group of works from her 1973 show at the Bykert Gallery in New York. There, the artist developed a rigorously mathematical and strenuously physical method of drawing; she folded and scored large sheets of carbon paper as she moved them around the gallery, leaving a succession of marks -- lines and thumbprints -- on the wall and floor. They are a brain tease, especially if you try to follow the diagrams Ms. Rockburne has provided, but they also have a kind of poetry of movement; they make you think of professors scrawling equations on chalkboards. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Ileana Sonnabend: Ambassador for the New' (through April 21) Ileana Sonnabend, who died in 2007 at 92, was one of the most foresighted art dealers of the late 20th century. This modest-size exhibition, made up of work she either owned or showed in her gallery, gives a sense of the range of her interests, from Jasper Johns to Jeff Koons. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
* Museum of Modern Art: Isa Genzken: 'Retrospective' (through March 10) This prolific German sculptor -- for whom New York and its skyscrapers are a major source of inspiration -- receives her first comprehensive museum survey in this country. A grand, glamorous and sometimes grating 40-year overview, it traces her progress from idiosyncratic Minimalist monoliths to the distinctive, often architectonic, assemblages she began making in 1997 from cheesy materials and objects, concocting a raw, unapologetic beauty and a weirdly elliptical if literal-minded social commentary, often about the United States, power and war. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
* Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through March 9) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: "American Photographs," by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprise of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
National Academy Museum: 'See It Loud: Seven Post-War American Painters' (through Jan. 26) This uneven museumwide show presents 80 paintings by seven representational artists who came of age during the ascendancy of Abstract Expressionism and shortly thereafter. Three make the show worth viewing. Paul Georges's outsized landscapes, nudes, self-portraits and allegorical narratives have a terrific painterly flair. Neil Welliver's big pictures of wilderness places in Maine project a galvanizing tension between brusquely applied paint and acutely observed topography. And Stanley Lewis's views of scruffy, residential backyards involve improbable amounts of built-up paint and intensely detailed realism. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Johnson)
* Neue Galerie: 'Vasily Kandinsky: From Blaue Reiter to the Bauhaus, 1910-1925' (through Feb. 10) The Neue's first show on Kandinsky centers on a rich 15-year period, also the purview of the Museum of Modern Art's recent "Inventing Abstraction, 1910-1925." During this time Kandinsky shifted from the prismatic Expressionism of Der Blaue Reiter into pure abstraction and from easel paintings into set designs and murals. A reconstruction of one of those mural projects is on view, as are abundantly decorative wall panels made for a private collector in New York. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
* New-York Historical Society: 'The Armory Show at 100: Modern Art and Revolution' (through Feb. 23) The International Exhibition of Modern Art, otherwise known as the Armory Show, woke American art from its provincial slumbers a century ago. Was it a good thing or a bad thing, and is there any reason to care about it now? With more than 100 works from the original exhibition by American and European artists and a big, richly illuminating catalog, "The Armory Show at 100" offers an excellent opportunity to ponder such questions. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
* Noguchi Museum: 'Isamu Noguchi and Qi Baishi: Beijing 1930' (through Jan. 26) Isamu Noguchi worked with the Chinese ink painter Qi Baishi for just six months and could speak to him only through a translator. But this brief, mostly nonverbal tutelage had a lasting impact on Noguchi's art, as we see in this elegant and persuasive exhibition of ink paintings by both artists. Qi helped Noguchi to escape the long shadow of an intense two-year apprenticeship to Brancusi and to develop a new style of abstraction: one that was improvisational, urbane and broadly Asian-inspired. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Rosenberg)
Queens Museum of Art: Peter Schumann 'The Shatterer' (through March 30) A recent expansion has doubled the size of the Queens Museum. Of five celebratory new shows, the largest and most moving is the solo museum debut of Peter Schumann, the founder and director of Bread and Puppet Theater, which is 50 years old this year. The show demonstrates how thoroughly Bread and Puppet is his creation. Its down-value look and activist ethos are evident in everything, including the black house-paint mural he has brushed, single-handedly, across one of the museum's wall and the hand-printed, hand-bound books he has placed in the gallery he designates as chapel and library. Every inch of this room is covered with figures and words: angels and ogres, exhortations and condemnations, art for one and for all, straight from the hand, right to the moral core. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
* Rubin Museum of Art: 'Allegory and Illusion: Early Portrait Photography From South Asia' (through Feb. 10) "Allegory and Illusion" is a fascinating little piece of a very complicated puzzle. Ostensibly a focused, regional exhibition, it has much to say about the larger relationship between photography and colonialism. Included are many different forms of early photography, representing an array of markets and social classes: grand portraits of Nepalese royals and palm-size cartes de visite for the masses, ethnographic albums by British photographers and hand-painted photographs from Indian portrait studios. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Rosenberg)
* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'The Shadows Took Shape' (through March 9) Space is definitely the place in this lively group exhibition devoted to Afrofuturism, a contemporary art trend that takes the ultra-free-jazz musician Sun Ra as its patron saint and locates itself in a universe where racial and ethnic identities float free from stereotypes without losing track of the histories that created them. William Villalongo sets African sculpture and modernist painting soaring together among the stars; the Kenyan artist Wanuri Kahiu films ecological cataclysm and renewal in ages to come; William Cordova, who lives in New York and Lima, Peru, recreates the Falcon spaceship from George Lucas's "Star Wars," now equipped with a cultural studies library. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Rituals of Rented Island: Object Theater, Loft Performance, and the New Psychodrama -- Manhattan, 1970-1980' (through Feb. 2) Four decades ago, performance art was young, funky and clunky, beyond modernism, or maybe perversely beneath it, meant to reflect a world in which materials were transient, old models useless and values shifty. We get a vivid flashback to those beginnings in this show of photographs, videos and objects that breathes surprising life into archival matter and brings wonderful artists like Stuart Sherman, Jared Bark, Julia Heyward, Jill Kroesen and Ralston Farina back into view. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'T.J. Wilcox: In the Air' (through Feb. 9) A Romantic miniaturist best known for short, poetic films pieced together from found and made footage goes big in a dazzling 360-degree, 30-minute, day-to-night-to-day view of Lower Manhattan. Six brief collagelike films pop onto the panorama one at a time, zeroing on a specific event, person or experience, including Sept. 11. We see the city as a kaleidoscopic archive, alive with buildings, history, memories and people, and understand anew that the metropolis and the moving image were made for each other. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Uptown
'Eureka: William Wegman Photographs 1970-1975' (through Jan. 25) Mr. Wegman's hilarious, deadpan-profound photographs from the early 1970s are sampled here. They all revolve around visual gags involving contradictory realities. In "How They Are Toward Newspapers," Mr. Wegman sits on a couch reading a newspaper while his canine companion lies on the floor with a crumpled mess of newspaper between its forepaws. Who's to say which response to the reality of the paper is ultimately correct, man's or dog's? Craig F. Starr Gallery, 5 East 73rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 570-1739, starr-art.com. (Johnson)

Martina Bacigalupo: 'Gulu Real Art Studio' (through Feb. 8) In 2010 the Italian photojournalist Martina Bacigalupo spent time in the city of Gulu in northern Uganda, where she came across a curious form of portraiture. In a local shop called the Gulu Real Art Studio she found dozens of full-length pictures of sitters from which the heads had been neatly cut out. The shop's owner, Obal Denis, explained why. His machine for developing passport-size photos automatically produced four prints at a time, but most people coming for an ID picture needed only one. So it was easier, and cheaper, to shoot a regular full-length portrait, edit out a head shot and toss what was left. The pictures in this remarkable show are the result: studies in body language and clothing, accompanied by audio-taped interviews made with some of the sitters. The Walther Collection Project Space, 508-526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
* Thomas Demand: 'Dailies' (through Jan. 18) Thomas Demand's photographs are always a little bit uncanny, but the more modest, quotidian works in his latest exhibition are his weirdest yet. Their sources are Mr. Demand's own cellphone photographs, and their subjects are so unassuming as to seem disposable: a bar of soap on a bathtub ledge, a paper cup wedged into a chain-link fence. These objects are all paper sculptures, like the ones in his earlier works, but they've been rendered extraordinarily vivid by the dye-transfer printing method, which Mr. Demand is using for the first time. It's as if he's channeling William Eggleston. Matthew Marks Gallery, 526 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Rosenberg)
Cyprien Gaillard: 'Today Diggers, Tomorrow Dickens' (through Jan. 30) The familiar convention of giant, slightly altered, out-of-context ready-mades arrayed in a pristine gallery is reiterated by an artist best known for brutal videos that document the dehumanizing scale and effect of immense Eastern-bloc apartment complexes. Here he adds luxurious rods of yellow onyx to scarred excavation heads from earth-moving machines. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street, (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Smith)
Galleries: Other
'Danish Paintings From the Golden Age to the Modern Breakthrough: Selections From the Collection of Ambassador John L. Loeb Jr.' (through Jan. 25) Paintings dating from the late 1700s to the early 20th century play out a fascinating dialogue between Scandinavian restraint and imported (i.e., French) freedom and sensuality. Sunny French Impressionism evidently made an mark on Danish artists, but in the show's most compelling works -- funereal pictures of women in gray rooms by Vilhelm Hammershoi -- desire and repression fought to an agonized stalemate. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 779-3587, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
* Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (continuing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
* 'Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart: Collected by Julie Ault' (through Feb. 23) Julie Ault, an artist, writer and curator, was a founding member of the New York collaborative Group Material, which, from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, used exhibitions and public events to investigate the overlap of art and politics. During decades of depression, inflation, multiculturalism, conservatism and AIDS, she and her colleagues lived improvised lives on the city's fringes. Within their world, art was currency for giving gifts, bartering, buying and selling among friends. This show, spread over two different locations, is a moving record of such transactions. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo; Artists Space: Books & Talks, 55 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)
Out of Town
* Carnegie Museum of Art: 2013 Carnegie International (through March 16) A welcome shock to the system of one of the art world's more entrenched rituals, this lean, seemingly modest, thought-out exhibition takes the big global survey of contemporary art off steroids. It is mostly devoid of the looming, often expensive installations called "festival art," while evincing a gratifying affinity for color, form, beauty and pleasure, and a discernible lack of interest in finger-wagging didacticism. Object-making of all kinds seems healthy, as do artist-initiated activist projects (which sometimes overlap). Interventionist and artist-as-curator efforts? Not as impressive. 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, (412) 622-3131, carnegieinternational.org. (Smith)
National Gallery of Art: 'Heaven and Earth: Art of Byzantium From Greek Collections' (through March 2) With about 170 objects, this show takes a processional sweep through Byzantine art from its Greco-Roman beginnings to its multicultural late phase in the 15th century, with a specific emphasis on its development in Greece itself. The history is fascinating, and the objects couldn't be more beautiful, including a glinting 13th-century icon of the Virgin and Child pieced together from glass, silver, gold and glass; a 17-foot-long parchment scroll painted with chirping birds and secret prayers; and a heavenly silk embroidery, found stashed away in a Thessaloniki church, depicting the body of the dead Christ surrounded by fan-wielding seraphs and a stitched chant, "Holy, holy, holy." On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Last Chance
* 'Arman the Collector: The Artist's Collection of African Art' (closes on Saturday) This stunning show presents 21 African sculptures, mostly masks, collected by the artist known for accumulating many similar objects into absurdist sculptures. Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Johnson)
* Brooklyn Museum: 'Behind Closed Doors: Art in the Spanish American Home, 1492-1898' (closes on Sunday) As its voyeuristic title suggests, the show follows the layout of a typical house belonging to an elite member of New World society. Drawn largely from the museum's sizable collection of Spanish colonial art, it overflows with sumptuous textiles, family portraits bearing coats of arms, fine silver and porcelain and gilded everything -- and leaves you in the strange position of marveling at the opulence of domestic life in the Spanish colonies while pondering some of the ugliest social repercussions of colonialism. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
* Drawing Center: 'Drawing Time, Reading Time' and 'Dickinson/Walser: Pencil Sketches' (both close on Sunday) Works by nine artists in "Drawing Time, Reading Time" highlight by variously inventive means what letters, words, sentences, texts and books look like more or less apart from what they mean. Included are concrete poems typed by Carl Andre; a 451-page memoir handwritten by Sean Landers; and pencil-drawn copies of photocopies from books about conceptual art by Molly Springfield. The equally interesting "Dickinson/Walser: Pencil Sketches" presents original manuscripts of poems by Emily Dickinson and stories by the Swiss writer Robert Walser, both of whom wrote their first drafts in remarkably idiosyncratic ways. 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Johnson)
Roni Horn: 'Everything was sleeping as if the universe were a mistake' (closes on Saturday) Beautiful but vacuous, Roni Horn's exhibition teeters between high-minded art and high-end design. It's in three sections: two expansive spaces each are occupied by 10 squat, cylindrical objects of solid, cast glass, each the size of a TV room hassock. They are lovely luxury objects. Part three is a narrow gallery separating the glass installations and displaying large, puzzling abstract drawings that seemed designed to support Ms. Horn's conceptualist cred. Hauser & Wirth, 511 West 18th Street, (212) 790-3900, hauserwirth.com. (Johnson)
* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Balthus: Cats and Girls -- Paintings and Provocations' (closes on Sunday) This tightly focused show charts the first 25 years (1934-59) of this French artist's enigmatic paintings of nubile adolescents and girls, sometimes paired with cats that heighten the erotic undercurrent. He is best early, in the chiseled, psychologically complex portraits of Thérèse Blanchard from the late 1930s, and even earlier, in an astoundingly precocious suite of 40 small ink drawings about his beloved cat Mitsou. They were made when he was 11 and have never before been exhibited. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush Writing in the Arts of Japan' (closes on Sunday) This elegant collection-based show is the perfect place to mourn the lost art of handwriting. Here, among the medieval Zen monks, the 11th-century literati and the courtesans of the Edo-era "floating world," it's impossible to separate language from gesture and composition from performance. Objects on view are not limited to examples of calligraphy; they include Chinese-influenced ink paintings, decorative objects, large screens and woodblock prints. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926-1938' (closes on Sunday) There's no mystery about why Magritte is popular. His illustrational mode reads loud and clear from across a room (a good thing, as MoMA's galleries are sure to be jammed). And he had some ideas. He was a sophisticated trickster, a bourgeois gentilhomme with a geek inside, hacking into everyday life and planting little weirdness bugs: legs sprouting from shirt collars, a choo-choo coming out of a chimney, words having lives of their own. We're unlikely ever to see him look better than he does in this show, which focuses on the single fresh and interesting decade in his long career. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
* New Museum: 'Chris Burden: Extreme Measures' (closes on Sunday) This superb survey rebalances the career of an artist best known for his incendiary early 1970s performance art. It gives his subsequent sculptures pride of place and emphasizes his consistent drive to show how things work, whether socially, psychologically or mechanically. Veering from startling found objects (a huge flywheel, a meteor) to obsessively hand-built bridges, the show is especially simpatico with the museum's cellblock décor. In fact, the place has never looked better. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
'Rebirth: Recent Work by Mariko Mori' (closes on Sunday) In Mariko Mori's first New York solo museum show in a decade, the futuristic fashion plate of Ms. Mori's earlier photographs and videos -- the artist herself, in Manga-inspired get-ups -- seems to have vanished, and so has her contemporary Japanese landscape of malls, airports and business districts. In their place are meditative, abstract sculptures and installations, strongly influenced by Buddhism, theoretical physics and prehistoric cultures. They make up an ambitious but disappointing show, which summons big ideas and primal energies only to give them trite, New Agey forms. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Rosenberg)
Raqib Shaw: 'Paradise Lost' (closes on Saturday) That fin-de-siècle decadence is already rife in the 21st century is proved by the pointlessly bejeweled paintings and histrionic sculptures of this India-born, London-based artist, now hyperventilating in all three Pace Gallery spaces on West 25th Street. The works depict a cross-cultural fantasy world of intra-species animals -- almost always suffused with violence -- as well as a surfeit of bling, overheated color, tightly wound realism, historical recycling and murderous melodrama that reeks of kitsch. Knock yourself out. Pace Gallery, 508, 510 and 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-4258, pacegallery.com/newyork. (Smith)
* David Smith: 'The Forgings' (closes on Saturday) A stunning exhibition of 10 of the 11 Forgings -- narrow steel totems from 1955 -- show the American sculptor presaging both Minimal and Process Art in his least known, most serene series. Each about eight feet high and no more than a few inches across, with edges crimped and surfaces worked over in different ways, they concentrate an unusually expressive amount of sculptural activity in forms that achieve a delicate yet commanding presence. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, near 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Smith)

Full text:   HONG KONG -- Cheng Chunmeng, the general manager of a manufacturer of colorful children's chairs in east-central China, gave his workers a 30 percent raise last year to keep them from leaving. His labor costs are rising even faster in dollar terms, as the Chinese currency slowly climbs against the United States dollar.
Yet Mr. Cheng, like many Chinese exporters, enjoys growing sales to the United States. "I saw a remarkable increase in orders from the United States starting in March, and getting better and better since then," Mr. Cheng said. "I feel 2014 will be an even better year."
Export gains like Mr. Cheng's suggest that despite years of predictions of trouble for China's export juggernaut, it has not yet been derailed by fast-rising costs for blue-collar labor, by an appreciating Chinese currency or by foreign investment shifts toward other, lower-wage Asian countries.
China announced on Friday morning its largest annual trade surplus in dollar terms since 2008, as the surplus widened another 12.8 percent compared with 2012, reaching $259.75 billion.
China has kept its export machine running even while wages rise. Blue-collar pay has soared between fivefold and ninefold in dollar terms in the last decade, wrecking China's reputation as a low-wage place for export-oriented manufacturing. Rocketing wages and benefits reflect an acute shortage of manufacturing labor, as a younger generation goes to college instead of heading for factories and as rural China has mostly run out of young adults to send to the cities.
China's exports, while growing more slowly than a few years ago, are still far from stalling despite the disappearance of its advantage in labor costs. Chinese exporters say they have been able to keep prices low and retain overseas customers because factories are becoming more productive. Much of the manufacturing has stayed in China because the highly developed supply chains leading to and from the factories remain among the best in the world.
"We haven't started thinking of moving to another country," said Xiang Wenwei, the sales director of the China Mybaby Group, a 3,000-employee manufacturer of baby strollers in Ningbo that makes and assembles all of its major components. It relies on a dense web of suppliers near the factory for everything from raw materials to factory equipment maintenance.
The trade gains for China are magnified because over the last several years many companies have shifted the production of components from high-wage Asian countries like Japan and South Korea to China itself. So China is producing more of the value in each product, and not just doing the final assembly of products produced elsewhere.
China has begun to account for more than half the American trade deficit in some months, including last November, partly because of rising production of shale gas and shale oil that has reduced America's need to import energy. China was only a quarter to a third of the American deficit before the global financial crisis began in 2008. As the American economy continues to improve, economists predict that Americans will import even more from China.
"The pickup in China's trade surpluses could lead to rising trade tensions if they are perceived as holding back job growth in the U.S. and dampening the economic recovery," said Eswar Prasad, a Brookings Institution economist specializing in China.
The gradual recovery in demand in the United States and Europe is being partly absorbed by Chinese exporters instead of stimulating longer hours and further investment at factories closer to home. The unexpected strength in China's export sector has weakened the West's economic recovery and retarded job creation in the United States and Europe.
Asked this week for their view on China's trade surpluses, United States Treasury officials reiterated their opinion that the renminbi, China's currency, remains significantly undervalued, which China denies, and said that rebalancing the Chinese economy remained incomplete.
The composition of the American trade deficit with China is also shifting in ways that could affect employment in the United States, according to the latest American data, released on Tuesday. The American deficit is increasingly in goods classified by the United States Commerce Department as advanced technology products, notably consumer electronics, while starting to shrink in categories of lower value like shoes.
Chinese leaders and some economists have contended for years that a decline in China's export competitiveness is imminent, but their country has continued to post trade surpluses. They have used their predictions of slowing exports to justify resistance to pressure from Washington for faster appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar. The renminbi rose only 3.1 percent against the dollar last year, and weakened 1.2 percent against the euro.
The question is how much longer China can remain the dominant exporter. Many economists still predict trouble ahead for Chinese exporters. "Even if there is an increase in the trade surplus, this is temporary," said Diana Choyleva, a China specialist who is the head of macroeconomic research at Lombard Street Research in London.
She noted that when calculated in renminbi and adjusted for inflation, China's exports actually fell in some months last summer, although they have strengthened considerably since last October. China's trade surplus is also less than half as large as a share of national economic output compared with five years ago when the surplus was slightly larger in dollar terms. The Chinese economy has grown nearly 80 percent in nominal renminbi terms since then and doubled in dollar terms.
Export figures for China were exaggerated by a few percentage points early last year as exporters overstated their shipments to circumvent Chinese controls on moving money into the country to speculate on further appreciation of the renminbi. But while some overstating of shipments may still take place, the strength in exports in recent months appears more genuine, particularly compared to an artificially high base of exports a year ago, said Louis Kuijs, a China economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
"I have much more faith in the veracity of the numbers now," he said.
In separate interviews this week with nearly a dozen Chinese exporters, at Hong Kong trade fairs or by telephone, all said that their biggest problem lay in labor: finding enough blue-collar workers and paying for their soaring wages.
Mr. Cheng said that a decade ago he paid about $75 a month for entry-level industrial workers and provided virtually no benefits. Now, he said, his 200-worker business, the Hangzhou Luyi Arts & Crafts Company, pays $570 a month plus $100 a month in government-mandated benefits.
That works out to compensation roughly three times as high as in Indonesia, four times as high as in Vietnam, five times as high as in Cambodia, and as much as 10 times as high as in Bangladesh. But all of those countries have other problems, such as overburdened, unreliable electricity grids, which force companies to install costly generators and buy expensive diesel instead.
Like many companies in China, Hangzhou Luyi has responded to surging wages with increased investments in automation. "This machine takes the place of five workers," Mr. Cheng said, sitting in a booth at a Hong Kong trade fair this week and pointing at a poster on his wall of a computer-controlled, die-cutting machine for producing chair components.
Similar investments at factories across China mean that fewer hours of labor typically go into each product. So labor costs per unit do not rise nearly as quickly as wages.
Extremely heavy investment in new factories and new equipment, as the state-owned banking system continues to pump out credit at a remarkable pace, has also created considerable overcapacity. Exporters are unable to raise prices without losing overseas markets to nearby rivals. This prompts managers like Chen Yaping, executive director of the Zhejiang Daseng Stationery Company, a toymaker in Yiwu City, to focus increasingly on research and developing their own brands.
Foreign investment in China has stagnated while surging in Southeast Asian rivals like Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam, setting off hand-wringing in Chinese media. But China still invests heavily in China. Domestic investment dwarfs foreign investment elsewhere in the region, leaving Chinese entrepreneurs and state-owned enterprises with more than enough cash to keep buying machinery.
A result of rising productivity and manufacturing overcapacity is that average prices for American imports from China have actually dropped 0.9 percent in the last year even as the renminbi has risen and Chinese wages have soared, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington. That decline in prices has kept the pressure on Western competitors -- and kept Chinese exports buoyant.

Full text:   Record exports and the smallest trade deficit in four years. Healthier consumer spending, including the strongest annual increase in automobile sales since 2007, spurred by a booming stock market and an improving housing sector. And a slow but steady pickup in job creation that has pushed unemployment to its lowest level since 2008.
The confluence of all these forces in recent weeks has prompted economists to sharply revise their expectations for growth in late 2013 and early 2014, and prompted hopes that a more sustained economic expansion has finally arrived.
Plenty of caution is in order. It is a refrain that has been heard several times since the end of the Great Recession, and frustrated job seekers and income-stretched workers have plenty of reasons to be dubious about the upbeat forecasts.
Still, a series of arrows from disparate parts of the economy in both the United States and elsewhere around the world are finally pointing in the right direction, experts and policy makers say.
"False dawns notwithstanding, it seems like a number of headwinds are fading," said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "We're growing more optimistic, and the risks are now more to the upside than the downside. It's the first time in a long time that we could say that."
The newfound optimism will face its first test on Friday, when the Labor Department reports the latest data on unemployment and job creation in December. Joblessness sank to its lowest level in five years in November, and another month of strong gains would cement the view that the labor market is finally showing signs of life.
Economists estimate the economy created just under 200,000 jobs in December, in line with the pace earlier in the fall. That is an improvement from the summer of 2013, and the turnaround has already been strong enough to persuade Federal Reserve policy makers to slowly begin easing their economic stimulus efforts.
Estimates for the government's reading on job creation in December were lifted after Automatic Data Processing, a private payroll tracker, reported on Wednesday that private firms added 238,000 positions last month, well above the 200,000 level experts had anticipated.
And on Thursday, the government reported that initial unemployment claims last week fell to 330,000, a drop of 15,000 claims, which was a bit more than economists expected. The four-week moving average also declined, falling 9,750 from the previous four-week average of 358,750.
While the Fed's expectations for future growth have repeatedly proved too rosy in recent years, the incoming chairwoman of the central bank, Janet L. Yellen, suggested in an interview with Time magazine that she, along with many of her colleagues at the Fed, were more confident this time that the upturn was real. She suggested that real growth, adjusted for inflation, could reach 3 percent or more this year.
Just a few weeks ago, there were fears that 2013 would end on a sour note in terms of economic growth, weighed down by the government shutdown in October and the standoff over the debt ceiling in Washington, as well as the lingering effects of tax increases and cuts in federal spending earlier in the year. But better-than-expected trade data on Tuesday, as well as an increase in consumer activity in October and November, prompted many economists to revise their estimates of growth in the fourth quarter sharply higher this week.
Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays, now says he believes the economy expanded at an annualized pace of 3 percent in October, November and December, double his previous estimate. In addition, he now estimates consumer spending increased at a 3.8 percent rate in the same period, the fastest in three years.
Mr. Maki attributes more than half of the gain in consumer spending to the surging stock market in 2013 and the steady recovery in real estate prices, the so-called wealth effect that has left shoppers feeling more confident. Wall Street turned in its best performance in 16 years in 2013; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 30 percent.
"The stock market is pushing spending up, and the fading tax increases are no longer pushing spending down," Mr. Maki said.
Rising domestic oil and gas production, he said, helped trim the need for imported energy supplies, contributing to a significantly smaller trade deficit in November, while the emergence of much of Europe from the grips of a deep recession has benefited exporters in the American manufacturing sector.
If Mr. Maki is right, and the American economy grew at a 3 percent rate in the fourth quarter, after the 4.1 percent gain in the third quarter, it would be the best back-to-back quarterly performance in two years. It would add up to a gain for the year of about 2.7 percent, the best since 2007. It could also signal the kind of sustained gains in 2014 that have proved so elusive since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009, a period in which the occasionally robust quarter has been quickly followed by a near stall, providing few gains to most American workers or much relief to the long-term unemployed.
"Everything seems to be flashing green," said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J. "The dynamics have changed and we are going to break out of the pattern we've seen in the last couple of years."
While agreeing that many of the headline numbers are headed in the right direction, Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research, pointed out that it would take more time for that improvement to translate into significantly lower unemployment or better wage gains for most workers. Employers still have the upper hand, with unemployment at 7 percent, so there is little pressure to increase wages or enrich benefits for workers relieved just to have a job.
"The dichotomy is that the data does look increasingly normal for the overall economy, but we're still not back to where the trends were before the recession," Mr. Blitz said. "We've got a long way to go."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank is ready to take decisive action to keep Europe's tentative recovery afloat, the bank's president, Mario Draghi, said on Thursday after the bank left interest rates unchanged at a record low.
After the rates announcement, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference here that the central bank was "ready to consider all available instruments" to address either further weakness in consumer prices or increases in short-term money market rates that could put stress on banks. He did not, however, specify what tools he would use.
The central bank's Governing Council, which sets monetary policy for the 18-nation euro zone, surprised the market in November by cutting its benchmark rate to 0.25 percent, a record low, from 0.5 percent.
Economists had not expected any further action on Thursday, but they said there was a significant chance the central bank would act again in the coming months to guard against an outright decline in prices. The fear is that low inflation could turn into deflation, a widespread and sustained fall in prices that can be economically debilitating and difficult to reverse.
The allusion to money markets referred to the ready availability of cheap, short-term loans to and between banks. Interest rates on such money spiked last month but have since fallen back.
Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank in Brussels, said the central bank wanted to be certain that lenders did not face short-term funding pressures over the course of this year, when they will undergo tests of their financial soundness as part of the central bank's new supervisory role over the euro zone's biggest banks. The central bank will be balancing those concerns against various signals that the zone's financial and economic crisis may finally be ending.
On Thursday, the optimists' case was reinforced by news of a rebound in German industrial production in November and a report from the European Commission showing that businesses and consumers were more confident in December.
There were also more promising signs in the bond market, where Spain tapped investors for the first time this year, meeting with solid demand and selling about $7.2 billion of debt at favorable rates. Spain's 10-year yields fell to 3.75 percent, the lowest level in four years.
Investors also showed strong interest in an offering of Portuguese debt, as an improved economic outlook makes buyers willing to accept somewhat lower -- though still attractive -- interest rates on bonds from euro zone countries they had been leery of in recent years. Earlier this week, Ireland, which required a bailout in 2010, also carried out a successful bond auction.
But Mr. Draghi, when asked on Thursday if the euro crisis was over, was guarded in his reply. "The recovery is there, but it's fragile," he said. The best that can be said about the job market, for example, is that unemployment does not seem to be growing worse.
"We want to see confidence staying for a relatively long time before we declare victory," Mr. Draghi said.
In Britain, the Bank of England left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009, as the British economy continued its own slow recovery.
Also this week, Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, reported that the euro zone inflation rate fell to 0.8 percent in December. That is far below the central bank's target of just under 2 percent. And it is low enough to raise fears that Europe could be on the verge of deflation.
Mr. Draghi has recently warned about the danger of an inflation rate that becomes entrenched below 1 percent, creating the sort of situation that caused Japan's "lost decade" of poor growth and economic pain.
At his news conference Thursday, he played down the significance of the most recent inflation number, saying the unexpectedly low figure was partly due to a "quirk" in the way the German portion of the data was calculated. He said the January numbers would give a better indication of price trends.
Mr. Draghi said that even the negative price trends in some euro zone countries -- like Cyprus -- were in some cases not really the broad-based "self-fulfilling, self-feeding" deflation that stalked Japan in the 1990s, but were rather "part of a necessary rebalancing."
Mr. Brzeski, the ING economist, said it appeared that Mr. Draghi was now trying decouple extremely low inflation and more E.C.B. action.
"It's verbal intervention right now, pretending you're strong and flexing your muscles," Mr. Brzeski said. But it may be that within the Governing Council, "there is no consensus on what to do or even what the main problem is," he added.
With the region's unemployment rate stuck at 12.1 percent since last April, the pressure may rise on the central bank to take action sooner or later. Mr. Draghi acknowledged on Thursday that a further slowing of inflation or higher money-market rates could be triggers for further moves by the central bank.
"The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside," he said.
With interest rates, the traditional lever of monetary policy, already effectively at zero, the E.C.B. might have to find other means of stimulating the economy. The euro zone emerged from recession in the second quarter of 2013, and the central bank expects anemic economic growth of 1.1 percent this year.
The meeting Thursday was notable for being the first at which Latvia was formally seated on the Governing Council. Ilmars Rimsevics, the governor of the Bank of Latvia, represented his country, which on Jan. 1 became the 18th nation to join the single currency.
Despite the cheap money on offer to banks, including in the form of low-interest, long-term loans from the E.C.B., credit is not getting through to companies and households. The central bank said last week that lending to businesses in the euro zone shrank 3.9 percent in November from a year earlier, the biggest decline it has ever recorded.
The E.C.B. could offer more cheap loans on the condition that banks lend to businesses. Another option would be to penalize financial institutions for depositing funds at the E.C.B. by offering negative deposit rates, spurring them to put more money into the economy. It could also buy the debt of small and midsize businesses in hopes of jump-starting the flow of credit.
Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, predicted that the questions of deflation and the divergence within the euro zone, in which businesses in weaker member states must pay more for credit, would dominate the central bank's thinking in the next few months.
There is "a risk that the euro zone as a whole slides into a protracted period of falling prices," Ms. Diron wrote in a research note. "While we do not think that the euro zone will fall into deflation, this risk calls for strong pre-emptive action by the E.C.B."
The United States Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, who made rapid stops in Paris, Berlin and Lisbon on a two-day trip this week, urged European leaders -- particularly in Germany -- to focus on domestic demand. American officials say they believe it is essential that Europe act to pick up slack in the world economy as the Federal Reserve begins reducing its monthly purchases of bonds this month.
Asked about Mr. Lew's call for measures to bolster demand, Mr. Draghi quoted Abraham Lincoln as having said, "You cannot make the weak stronger by making the strong weaker." Such criticism is misplaced, he added, because "all of the euro members benefit from Germany's strength."
