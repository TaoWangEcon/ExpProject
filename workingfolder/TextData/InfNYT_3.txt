Full text: The stock market reached yet another new high on Wednesday, the latest development to make a mockery of what savvy economic commentators thought they knew about the world. Consider how things looked one year ago. The world economy seemed hopelessly trapped in a cycle of low growth and inflation. Markets recoiled at the mere possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. Populist political insurgencies seemed to threaten yet more financial market chaos.
Now, interest rates and inflation forecasts have risen substantially from last winter's lows; financial markets are shrugging off -- or even rallying at the possibility of -- imminent Fed rate increases; and it is all taking place during Donald J. Trump's presidency.
An economy that seemed locked in some form of "secular stagnation" or "new normal" is at long last showing some signs of being in something closer to an "old normal." The United States manufacturing sector is showing strength, and the broader mix of market and economic data from around the world in the last few months also points to a world where a vicious economic cycle isn't looking quite as scary and may even be ending.
There can be no assurance that this pattern will continue, and there are some things to worry about on the horizon, not least that the Trump administration could follow through on some of its threats to disrupt global trade and diplomatic relations. Long-term interest rates remain low by historical standards across most of the world, suggesting that global bond investors aren't fully buying into a return to stronger, more consistent growth.
But the pivot since Election Day is huge. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 12 percent since Nov. 8, the London FTSE 100 index reached a new high Wednesday, and other global markets have grown nicely in that span. Ten-year Treasury bonds now yield 2.45 percent, up from 1.85 percent on Election Day, suggesting investors believe higher growth and inflation are more probable than had seemed likely just four months ago.
Much of the buoyant optimism on Wall Street is driven by investors' expectations of corporate tax cuts and deregulation under the Trump administration. But there is also some real improvement in the economic data underneath the shifts, reflecting economic forces that have been underway for years. And this resetting of expectations is evident in market data beyond the always erratic stock market.
On Wednesday, that took the form of a new survey of manufacturing supply managers that showed the factory sector is expanding at a breakneck pace. As recently as August, that same index from the Institute for Supply Management was contracting. Those numbers followed positive readings on retail sales, industrial production and the job market.
For years, a theory that the major world economies were stuck in a pit of "secular stagnation" had gained hold -- the idea that low economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates and weak productivity growth were all reinforcing one another in a vicious cycle.
There's hardly enough evidence to toss that theory aside, but there are many reasons to think things are now looking up.
For example, bond market prices now suggest that investors foresee consumer price inflation in the United States at 2.03 percent a year over the coming decade -- consistent with the 2 percent inflation the Fed aims for. It only recently reached that level, however, after being as low as 1.2 percent in February 2016. And it's not just the United States. Similar measures of inflation expectations have risen in Germany, Britain and other advanced economies.
For a window into the changing mind-set of investors, consider some news around the Fed this week. Tuesday afternoon, William C. Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said in an interview that it would be fair to assume that the central bank would raise interest rates sooner rather than later, given the improving economy.
"There's no question that animal spirits have been unleashed a bit post the election," Mr. Dudley told CNN.
Fed watchers interpreted that to mean that an interest-rate increase could be on the way in mid-March, just three months after the last increase in December. Yet that did nothing to slow the 1.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 on Wednesday, and may even have contributed to it, as a sign of the Fed's confidence in the economy.
A year ago, hints that the Fed would move quickly with rates would have sent markets into a tailspin. As 2016 began, Fed leaders were expecting to raise rates four times in that year, plans that helped send the stock market plummeting and measures of economic pessimism soaring. Then they backed off and only raised rates once.
Since a stock market rally began on Election Day, there has been plenty of discussion about a Trump effect. And no doubt a big part of the improvement has resulted from expectations that the new president's policies will help corporate bottom lines (and that some of the risks of his trade agenda won't materialize).
But it's worth keeping in mind that a so-called Trump bump arrives as the economy is closing in on its full productive capacity. It is getting to the point where a cycle of rising wages and higher inflation necessitates higher interest rates. That, in turn, reflects policies from the Obama administration and the Fed that long predate Mr. Trump's election.
Conventional economic theory predicts that if a government tries to increase deficits at a time of full employment, the results will be some mix of higher inflation and higher interest rates, crowding out investment.
So if tax cuts, more military spending and other Trumpian policies add to deficits at a time the economy is already running at full blast, rising prices and rising rates are exactly what we would expect to see.

Full text: Â  It was a confounding year in global financial markets. Not because it was a disaster for most investors; American stocks and bonds both rose in value. It was confounding because of some major moves that defied expert consensus this time a year ago -- not only what was predicted, but what was even thought plausible.
But by understanding what the biggest market moves were, you can also understand the forces that will shape the global economy in 2015.
There was an epic collapse in oil prices.
It's not that the price of oil has never moved as far and as fast as it did in 2014. It's just that usually when that happens, it occurs against the backdrop of much more global volatility, like in a worldwide recession at the end of 2008 and early 2009.
What's remarkable about the roughly 50 percent decline in the price of oil in the second half of the year is that it occurred amid such stability; nothing radical changed in that time about either the global economic outlook or even the supply and demand picture for oil itself.
Rather, years of effort to increase drilling in the United States, paired with a continued tepid world economy and with decisions by Saudi Arabia and other oil producers not to pull back on production to defend high prices, created a stunning sell-off.
We've already started to see some of the geopolitical consequences of this shift, including the collapse in value of the ruble and new pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. But that is probably only the beginning. The budgets of major oil producers, from Venezuela to Indonesia to Texas, will be stretched. Meanwhile, there will be a nice tailwind to growth around the world as cheaper fuel means higher real incomes for consumers.
This was the year when oil prices plunged, but 2015 is the year when we will truly start to understand the consequences.
Long-term interest rates kept falling.
If there was one thing Wall Street forecasters could agree upon at the end of 2013, it was that 2014 would be a year of rising long-term interest rates in the United States. The economy was finally gaining momentum, after all, the Federal Reserve was winding down its program of buying bonds, and the day of interest rate increases was coming nearer.
That narrative was exactly right when it came to the economy and policy. The job market has strengthened, and the Fed has moved to end its interventions in the economy as planned. But the result for bond markets has been the opposite of the conventional wisdom.
The yield on United States Treasury bonds fell significantly over the course of the year; the government can borrow money for 30 years for a mere 2.8 percent, down from 4 percent at the end of 2013. These lower costs have translated into cheaper home mortgages and lower borrowing costs for businesses, and higher bond prices (but lower future returns) for investors.
As for 2015 implications, the remarkably low long-term interest rates would seem to signal a return to a predicament facing the American economy in the middle of the last decade. Alan Greenspan called it a "conundrum" -- that the Fed's power to influence longer-term interest rates was weak, perhaps because of very strong global demand for safe securities like United States Treasury bonds.
Regardless of the cause, it raises the prospect that even as the economy continues to strengthen and the Fed raises rates in 2015, cheap longer-term rates will be here to stay.
The U.S. stock market kept cruising.
The stock market had a remarkable rally in 2013, and some were skeptical that it could continue the run in 2014.
It did. But only in the United States.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 11.4 percent in 2014, not quite the 30 percent return of 2013 but not shabby by any measure. But while 2013 featured a broad rise among all the major global stock markets, the United States was a major outperformer in 2014.
The core reason is that the American economy has performed better than its counterparts in much of the rest of the world, with Europe and Japan facing stagnant growth and emerging markets slowing their once-gangbuster pace. A related factor is that the dollar has appreciated compared with other currencies, so the dollars that American companies make are becoming relatively more valuable.
Yet another year of stock prices that rise faster than corporate earnings certainly increases the risk of a sharp correction or a period of subpar returns. But in the meantime, Americans can take comfort in the fact that the referendum of global financial markets is that the United States will continue to be the driver of global economic recovery.
The dollar soared.
The same fundamentals that helped American stocks log another year of impressive returns drove up the dollar versus virtually all other major currencies -- but a solid year for United States economic growth wasn't the entirety of the story.
A schism has opened up between the Federal Reserve and its counterparts overseas. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are trying to stimulate growth and fight deflation in their countries (the B.O.J. has already expanded its easing programs, and the E.C.B. appears on the verge of undertaking a form of bond-buying of its own). But the Fed has been signaling higher rates and tighter money.
That has made the dollar more attractive, as has the sense that it is a beacon of economic strength in a troubled world economy. Those factors explain the 12 percent drop in the euro against the dollar and the 14 percent drop in the Japanese yen.
But the strengthening dollar has implications for 2015 far beyond the finances of Americans thinking of visiting Paris this spring.
The dollar is sufficiently enmeshed in the infrastructure of the global economy that a stronger dollar means, in effect, a tightening of global financial conditions, as Hyun Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements has argued.
If you are a company doing business in Mexico or South Korea, for example, and borrow money in dollars, a rising dollar makes repaying your debts more onerous and has the same effect as a hike in interest rates, potentially squeezing your cash flows or even leading to bankruptcy. Look for those ripple effects of a strong dollar across the globe in 2015.
The outlook for inflation fell.
Global investors are betting on very, very low inflation, for many years to come. That is the implication, anyway, of the relative prices of inflation-adjusted bonds and regular bonds in the United States and almost every other major economy.
Part of this is easy to explain. The decline in oil and other commodity prices will put downward pressure on prices in 2015. But a broader shift in sentiment happened in recent months. Investors seem to think that very low inflation will persist even after the oil price declines of the last few months fully spread through other consumer prices. Bond prices currently imply that inflation from 2019 to 2024 will be 2.14 percent a year, down from 2.65 percent a year ago.
Investor expectations suggest that the Fed may have more leeway than it had seemed a few months ago to keep interest rates low, especially if they see continued weakness in the economy.
And given that similar trends are visible across the advanced world, it implies that one of the foremost challenges for policy is finding a way to get the world's major economies humming enough that deflation is no longer a concern.

Abstract: In November 2010, a large group of conservative economists and investors, including Michael J. Boskin, who was chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers under George H. W. Bush, warned in a letter to the Fed that "the planned asset purchases risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed's objective of promoting employment."

Full text: Â  DEFLATION has become a reality in many European countries, at least in terms of the prices of goods, as opposed to services.
In the United States, prices for goods are still rising, but at a slow rate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this week that prices of goods were 0.4 percent higher in September than they were a year earlier, but that increase was largely due to a surprising increase in food prices -- something that seems unlikely to continue in the face of declines in prices for many agricultural commodities.
Over all, the Consumer Price Index in the United States rose 1.7 percent over the last 12 months. That is hardly a high number, and is below the 2 percent target rate used by the Federal Reserve. But as the accompanying charts show, the rate is higher than that of any of the 15 largest countries in the European Union.
Of those 15 European countries, prices of goods in 11 were lower in September than a year earlier. Only Germany, Britain, Austria and Finland experienced goods price inflation, and none of those rates were higher than half a percentage point.
The reasons for declining prices include weak economies -- some European economies appear to have fallen into new recessions -- and declining import prices brought on in part by weak demand. Over all, the United States reported that import prices for goods were nearly 1 percent lower in September than they had been a year earlier. Imports from China, the largest exporter into the American market, were just a tenth of 1 percent higher.
Deflation is less likely in prices for services, in part because it is difficult to reduce nominal wages and in part because overseas competition may be less of a factor. Those prices rose at a rate of 2.5 percent over the last year in the United States and they have shown smaller gains in most European countries, although there were declines in Spain and Greece. Inflation in service prices has offset deflation in the prices of goods, keeping overall inflation above zero in most of the European countries.
The charts also show rates of growth in gross domestic product since the third quarter of 2010, just before the United States Federal Reserve embarked on its program of asset purchases that became known as QE2, for quantitative easing.
In November 2010, a large group of conservative economists and investors, including Michael J. Boskin, who was chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers under George H. W. Bush, warned in a letter to the Fed that "the planned asset purchases risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed's objective of promoting employment."
Since then, inflation has been greater in the United States, and economic growth higher, than in much of Europe, but there has been no currency debasement -- the strong dollar has helped to hold down import prices -- and the unemployment rate has fallen by more than 3 percentage points.
Over all, the only one of the 15 European countries where G.D.P. grew more than in the United States was Poland. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank resolutely refused to follow the Fed's lead until after Jean-Claude Trichet retired as president in 2011, and growth has been weak. It appears that the Fed's quantitative easing did stimulate growth to at least some extent but did not increase inflation.
Of the 15 European countries, shown in the charts, only four -- Britain, Denmark and Sweden, as well as Poland -- remained out of the eurozone and thus in control of their own monetary policy. Three of those countries -- Denmark being the exception -- have grown more rapidly than any of the major countries in the eurozone. Five of the eurozone countries -- Finland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- now have smaller economies than they did in 2010.
Chart In Much of Europe, Goods Prices Are Falling: Physical Things -- As Opposed to Services -- Are Getting Cheaper in Most European Countries, and Are Rising at a Slow Rate in the United States. Overall Inflation Remains Positive in Many Countries, Because Service Prices Are Rising, but in None of the Countries Shown Is Inflation As High As 2 Percent. The Charts Show Inflation Rates in the 12 Months Through September for the United States, the Eurozone and the 15 Largest Countries in the European Union, As Well As the Average Annual Change in Gross Domestic Product Since the Third Quarter of 2010, When the Federal Reserve Board in the United States Began Its Program of Securities Purchases That Became Known As Qe2.

Full text: Â  The N.H.L.'s conference finals will begin on Saturday, and fans in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh can still dream of a Stanley Cup championship. But this year is an unhappy anniversary for America's northerly neighbor. It is 20 years since the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Los Angeles Kings to win the 1993 Stanley Cup; no Canadian team has won the championship since.
Just how unlikely has Canada's Stanley Cup drought been? And is there anything in the league's economics that might help to explain it?
The answer isn't simple, so let me give you the executive summary before we parse the details.
First, bad luck is a major component. Even after accounting for the fact that Canadian teams have rarely been among the league's best in recent years, you would still have expected Canada to pick up at least a couple of Stanley Cups at some point.
Second, the N.H.L.'s economic structure changed at an unfavorable time for Canada. During the first half of the 20-year drought, the league allowed teams to spend freely, but Canadian teams were hampered by the weak Canadian dollar. Since 2005, the Canadian dollar has recovered substantially, and Canadian teams are now turning large profits. But they are limited in their capacity to invest those profits in superior players because the league has instituted a hard salary cap.
Third, there is almost certainly a shortage of N.H.L. teams in Canada relative to the demand for hockey there and the revenues that Canada contributes to the league. Teams in nontraditional hockey markets like Raleigh, N.C., Tampa, Fla., and Anaheim, Calif., have won Stanley Cups since 1993, but without doing especially well financially. So have the Colorado Avalanche, who relocated from Quebec City in 1995-96. Had the distribution of N.H.L. teams more closely matched fan interest in the sport across the United States and Canada, Canada would have more teams in the league and -- very probably -- at least one Stanley Cup championship.
Finally, and related to the excess demand for hockey in Canada, Canadian teams routinely sell out their arenas at high ticket prices -- whether or not they are any good. This may reduce their incentive to compete.
The simplest way to conceive of the situation is to assume that each N.H.L. team begins with an equal chance of winning the championship and to estimate the odds of a Canadian team winning the Stanley Cup as a function of the number of Canadian teams in the league.
Eight of the 26 N.H.L. teams, or 31 percent, were from Canada in the 1993-94 season. The percentage fell to 20 (6 of 30 teams) by 2000-1, before increasing to 23 percent after the Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg in 2011.
If a champion were randomly chosen from all N.H.L. teams active each season, the odds that a Canadian team would have won at least one Stanley Cup since 1993-94 are 99.2 percent. (This period comprises 19 seasons, excluding 2004-5 when the N.H.L. canceled its season because of a labor dispute.) That means the chance of Canada failing to have won a Stanley Cup is just 0.8 percent, yielding odds of about 125-to-1 against.
But it is naÃ¯ve, of course, to assume that the Stanley Cup champion is chosen randomly. Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals, for example, aren't merely unlucky to have failed to reach the playoffs in 28 years: they have usually stunk. Perhaps the Canadian N.H.L. teams just haven't been very good either.
At first glance, the difference in competitiveness seems minor. Canadian teams have averaged 35.3 wins and 81.5 points per regular season over this period, compared with 36.7 wins and 84.4 points for the American teams. Canadian teams made the playoffs 54 percent of the time, compared with 56 percent for the United States-based clubs.
However, the Stanley Cup is not normally won by an average team that just sneaks into the playoffs -- instead, it usually goes to one of the best teams in the league. Eleven of the 18 Stanley Cup champions since 1993-94 have been seeded No. 1 or No. 2 in their conference. And there has been a lack of elite Canadian teams; only 14 percent of the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds since 1993-94 have been from Canada.
A more exacting way to evaluate the odds is by estimating each team's chance of winning the Stanley Cup as a function of its playoff seed and its regular-season power rating. (Power ratings, in this case, are taken from hockey-reference.com's Simple Ratings System, which accounts for each team's goal differential and strength of schedule during the regular season.) We can accomplish this by means of a logistic regression analysis. The probabilities for each season are recalibrated such that the 16 teams that make the playoffs have exactly a 100 percent chance of winning the Stanley Cup, in total.
In the 1996-97 season, for instance, I estimate that the Canadian teams had just a 2.1 percent chance of winning the Stanley Cup on the basis of their regular-season performance. Three of the six Canadian teams made the playoffs that year -- but all as No. 7 or No. 8 seeds, and none of them were much good.
In 15 of the past 19 N.H.L. seasons, in fact, the probability of a Canadian team winning the Stanley Cup, as calculated by this method, was lower than you would get if you drew from among all N.H.L. teams at random. Only twice -- the Ottawa Senators in 2005-6, and the Vancouver Canucks in 2010-11 -- did a Canadian team enter the playoffs as the best bet to win the Stanley Cup on the basis of regular-season performance.
You would still have expected a Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup sooner or later. The chance that at least one would do so was 97.5 percent, according to this method. Nonetheless, the lack of dominant Canadian teams has helped to make the 0-for-19 drought merely unlikely rather than almost impossible -- raising the chance of the Canadian shutout to 2.5 percent from 0.8 percent. So it is worth asking why Canadian teams have rarely been among the N.H.L.'s elite.
Perhaps Canadian teams are competing on an unlevel playing field? Among the seven current Canadian N.H.L. teams, the median television market is 1.7 million people. By contrast, the median American team competes in a television market with 5.4 million people.
Professional hockey, however, has an extremely regional following: it is extraordinarily popular in almost all of Canada, reasonably popular in parts of the northeastern and midwestern United States, and quite obscure elsewhere in the United States. These differences more than make up for the smaller size of Canadian markets. In fact, the typical Canadian team has considerably more N.H.L. fans in its market than the typical United States team does.
In 2011, I estimated the number of fans for each N.C.A.A. football team by comparing Google search traffic for the term "college football" in different media markets. We can do the same thing for hockey by evaluating the number of people who searched for the term "N.H.L."
On a per-capita basis, searches for the term "N.H.L." were more than seven times as common in Canada as in the United States. Although the United States population is about nine times larger than Canada's, this makes up for a lot of the difference.
How many N.H.L. fans are there in each country? A 2010 YouGov poll estimated that 11 percent of American adults were serious N.H.L. fans; a 2007 Scarborough Research study, using a stricter definition that was limited to the most avid fans, put the total at just 4 percent. Using the midpoint of those two surveys yields an estimate that 7.5 percent of Americans are N.H.L. fanatics, or about 23.5 million Americans among a population of 314 million.
The frequency of Google searches in Canada for "N.H.L." implies that about 54 percent of Canadians are serious N.H.L. fans, or about 18.5 million people in a country of 34.5 million.
In other words, the two countries are reasonably close in their number of N.H.L. fans, despite the United States' vastly larger population. I estimate that Canada accounts for something like 45 percent of the N.H.L. interest between the two countries. (The N.H.L., incidentally, makes about 40 percent of its national television licensing fees from Canadian networks -- and the percentage is likely to increase after the league negotiates new Canadian TV contracts.)
If N.H.L. teams were distributed between the countries in proportion to fan interest, Canada would have something like 12 to 14 teams out of a 30-team N.H.L. Instead, Canada has seven teams. This undersupply means that the Canadian N.H.L. teams have larger numbers of fans, on average.
In the chart below, I have used the Google search data to estimate the proportion of people in various United States and Canadian media markets who are serious N.H.L. fans. (The method uses Google search data at the metro-area level for the United States and at the provincial level for Canada as metro-level data is unavailable for Canada.)
The results demonstrate how much difference hockey avidity can make. Compare the cities of Los Angeles, Boston and Calgary. There are about 17 million people in the Los Angeles media market, 6.2 million in Boston's and 1.6 million in Calgary's. Based on their Google search traffic, however, I estimate that only 6 percent of the population in Los Angeles are serious N.H.L. fans, compared with 17 percent in Boston (high by United States standards) and 67 percent in Calgary (high even by Canadian standards). As a result, the three markets are roughly equivalent on hockey terms: each has about 1.1 million serious N.H.L. fans.
Another astonishing result can be obtained by comparing Houston and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan -- two markets that are occasionally mentioned as possible sites for N.H.L. expansion teams. Houston's media market has about six million people, compared with not quite 340,000 for Saskatoon. However, I estimate that only 2 percent of Houston residents are serious N.H.L. fans, versus 46 percent of the population in Saskatoon. Thus, they are roughly equal at about 150,000 N.H.L. fans each.
Accounting for the far greater propensity of Canadians to follow hockey, the median Canadian team plays in a market with about 1.1 million N.H.L. fans, while the median United States team plays in a market with about 530,000 fans.
The American cities that have had their hockey teams for a long time generally place well above the United States median, however. Of the United States-based markets that had an N.H.L. team continually since 1990, all but St. Louis have at least 500,000 fans.
So a couple of decades ago, there was a nice balance in the N.H.L. between American cities with large populations but moderate hockey interest, and Canadian cities with moderate populations but intense hockey interest. There were a few outlying cases -- Los Angeles has very low hockey interest but a very large population, while Buffalo has a modest population but levels of hockey affinity that approach Canadian levels. These teams functioned well enough, and no team was dragging down the average that much. The American markets that the N.H.L. has ventured into since 1990 have only about 250,000 hockey fans on average, however.
These differences in hockey interest have a profound effect on each team's bottom line. In the chart below, I have compared the number of hockey fans in each market against their estimated operating profit or loss in 2011-12, according to Forbes magazine. (For the markets with multiple hockey teams, I have divided the fans as follows: in New York, 55 percent of the market to the Rangers, 25 percent to the New Jersey Devils and 20 percent to the Islanders; and in Los Angeles, two-thirds to the Kings and one-third to the Anaheim Ducks. These estimates are derived by evaluating the number of Google searches for the team names among the residents in each metropolitan area.)
This measure of hockey fans does a very good job of predicting each team's profitability. The 13 teams with 700,000 or more N.H.L. fans in their markets all made money and totaled $357 million in operating profits. The six teams in markets with fewer than 300,000 fans all lost money, totaling $77 million in operating losses. The teams between 300,000 and 700,000 fans had varied results but roughly broke even, on average. (This is the range in which a quality of a team's management matters, along with other factors like per-capita income in the region and a team's appeal outside its immediate metropolitan area.)
Six of the seven Canadian teams are above the 700,000-fan threshold (and therefore made money). So did Winnipeg, with roughly 560,000 fans. In total, Canadian teams brought in $219 million in operating profits in 2011-12 -- whereas the American teams made a net of just $31 million. (Outside of the highly profitable Rangers, in fact, the United States-based teams lost money that year.)
So why have the Canadian teams struggled to win Stanley Cups?
Part of it stems from the same reason that operating profits are so closely tied to the number of N.H.L. fans in each team's media market. N.H.L. teams vary greatly in how many fans they have available to them. But under the league's current collective bargaining agreement, there is relatively little revenue sharing. There is a hard salary cap, however, along with a high salary floor, so each team's player expenditures are about the same.
The good news for the Canadian teams is that, with nothing else to spend them on, those extra revenues flow through straight through to the bottom line. The bad news is that they could not spend them by investing in better player talent, even if they wanted to.
Before the lost season of 2004-5, the N.H.L.'s economics were different: there was no salary cap. But something else was different as well: the Canadian dollar had been historically weak against the American dollar. Thus, the Canadian teams could not take full advantage of the excess demand for hockey in the country.
In the next chart, I have estimated per-game ticket revenues for American and Canadian N.H.L. teams since 1995. Ticket revenues are calculated as per-game attendance during the regular season, multiplied by average ticket prices as reported by Team Marketing Report. (Since 2003, Team Marketing Report has designated a portion of tickets in each arena as premium seats; I assume that 20 percent of ticket sales are priced at premium levels.) All figures are denominated in current (inflation-adjusted) United States dollars. The chart also shows how much revenue the Canadian teams would have brought in had the American and Canadian dollars been trading roughly at parity throughout the period, as they have been recently.
Per-game ticket revenues for the Canadian teams lagged somewhat behind the United States teams from 1995 through 1999. This was mostly because of the weak Canadian dollar; the Canadian teams would have run even with or slightly ahead of the American teams otherwise. From 2000 through 2003, the American and Canadian teams made about the same amount of money from a typical game despite a still fairly weak Canadian dollar. Since then, the Canadian dollar has strengthened, and Canadian teams have moved considerably ahead of the American teams: the average Canadian team now makes about 50 percent more than the average American team on a per-game basis. However, it is during this period that the N.H.L.'s salary cap has been in place.
But even if the Canadian teams cannot spend their extra revenues on better player talent, this does not fully explain why they have been underachieving in the Stanley Cup and not at least winning their fair share of championships.
Much of the reason, I must emphasize again, boils down to bad luck. Canadian teams have reached the Stanley Cup finals five times in the 19 seasons since 1992-93 but have come up short on each occasion, including in four cases where the series went to the seven-game maximum.
One other factor, however, may be that there is so much excess demand for hockey in Canada that the Canadian franchises do not have to field especially strong teams to sell out their stadiums or to make a considerable profit. In the next chart, I have compared the per-game ticket revenues for each team in the 2012-13 season against the number of points they tallied between this season and the last one.
For the United States teams, there is an imperfect but reasonably clear and statistically significant relationship between on-ice success and ticket revenues. There are lots of fair-weather American hockey fans, and they may not turn out unless their team is pretty good. In Canada, there is less competition from other sports, and there are many die-hard hockey fans who attend games almost no matter what. Consider, for instance, that the Toronto Maple Leafs increased their average ticket prices from about $75 (in inflation-adjusted United States dollars) in 2005-6 to $140 this season (or from about $85 to $140 in inflation-adjusted Canadian dollars) -- despite never qualifying for the playoffs in the interim. They have almost always sold out their stadium anyway.
These results can be generalized across other seasons. I ran a regression analysis that estimates per-game ticket revenues as a function of the number of hockey fans in a given media market, the number of points that a team averaged between the current season and the previous one, and a time trend. (Point totals are adjusted relative to the league-average number of points to correct for seasons shortened by labor disputes and changes to N.H.L. rules; the number of fans is expressed as a natural logarithm.)
For American teams, an additional regular-season win (worth 2 points in the standings) yields about $10,600 in extra ticket revenues per game, or roughly $430,000 over a full regular season. For Canadian teams, the marginal value of an additional regular-season win is about $1,400 per game (or $60,000 per season), which is not statistically or practically significant.
So the Canadian N.H.L. teams may suffer from a version of the problem that the Chicago Cubs faced during the "bleacher bum" years. Their fans are so loyal -- happy enough to turn out for the spectacle and the beer even if the team stinks -- that the franchises don't have all that much incentive to put out a competitive product.
Whether this has actually translated into complacency or mismanagement is harder to demonstrate. Even if N.H.L. teams are constrained in how much they can spend directly on player salaries, they could make other expenditures that should eventually translate into on-ice success -- for example, by investing more in scouting and development. The Toronto Maple Leafs, the Montreal Canadiens and the Vancouver Canucks each employ 20 or more scouts, according to their Web sites -- well above the N.H.L. average of about 15. So there is some evidence that they are making a good-faith effort to produce a quality team. (I wouldn't want to slander any professional sports franchise by comparing it with the Chicago Cubs.)
Nevertheless, a strong case can be made that these teams could stand some additional competition from N.H.L. franchises in their media markets and elsewhere in Canada.
I estimate, for instance, that there are five million N.H.L. fans in the greater Toronto region (which I define fairly liberally to include the outskirts of the Golden Horseshoe): about twice as many as in the New York metropolitan area, which has three N.H.L. teams. And Montreal and Vancouver are not far from New York in their number of N.H.L. fans.
Even acknowledging that additional N.H.L. teams in Toronto would not expect to draw as well as the Maple Leafs -- just as the Islanders and the Devils do not have nearly as many fans as the Rangers -- adding a second team in the Toronto area seems all but certain to produce another profitable N.H.L. franchise in a league where many teams are unable to break even. The new team would need to capture only about 14 percent of the Toronto market to reach the 700,000-fan threshold that seems to guarantee profitability in the N.H.L. A good case could also be made for a third Toronto-area team, along with second teams in Montreal and Vancouver.
At the other end of the fan-interest scale, it seems very difficult for N.H.L. teams with fewer than about 300,000 hockey fans in their media markets to turn a long-run profit under the league's current economic system. One might hold out hope that the newer hockey markets in the United States will grow to provide more revenue for their teams, but the evidence has not supported this conjecture so far. Per-game ticket revenues for United States teams in nontraditional media markets have grown at a rate of just 1.4 percent per year (inflation-adjusted) over the past 18 seasons, compared with 2.6 percent annually for traditional United States hockey markets and 4.2 percent annually for Canadian teams. These struggling United States teams hurt the Canadian teams both directly by diluting the share of Canadian teams in the league, and indirectly by compelling a salary cap structure that is meant to protect the struggling American teams (but which has yet to make most of them profitable).
My best guess is that the economically optimal distribution of N.H.L. franchises would look something like the schema in the chart below. This would include two new teams in the greater Toronto area, one new team in Montreal and one new team in Quebec City. In lieu of a second team in Vancouver, Seattle -- a marginal hockey market but probably better than several United States cities that already have N.H.L. teams -- would get a franchise in the hope that support might spill over into British Columbia and other parts of the Pacific Northwest. New York would retain its three N.H.L. teams as the Islanders sought to find success in Brooklyn, while Los Angeles (which has no more N.H.L. fans than Philadelphia or Boston and fewer than Vancouver or Montreal) would be shaved to one. The six United States markets with fewer than 300,000 N.H.L. fans would lose their teams.
This would yield a league with 11 Canadian franchises out of 28 -- just shy of 40 percent -- a level that comes much closer to the share of N.H.L. interest and revenues between among the two countries. And it would all but ensure that Canada's Stanley Cup drought ends sooner rather than later.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Â  HONG KONG -- Is China a currency manipulator?
Some of the more complicated exchanges during the presidential debate on Tuesday involved how to deal with China's efforts to increase its exports by keeping its currency at artificially low levels, an issue that has had considerable effects over the years on competitiveness, trade deficits and, some economists contend, American jobs.
Both candidates on Wednesday repeated the arguments they had voiced on the campaign trail. Mitt Romney criticized President Obama for not doing more to persuade China to stop intervening in currency markets. Mr. Obama said he was tougher toward Beijing than Mr. Romney would be if he were in the White House.
The two arguments obscure a more nuanced reality: adjusted for inflation, China's currency has strengthened considerably through much of Mr. Obama's tenure.
Some economists who used to be critical of China for undervaluing its currency, the renminbi, are now much less so. "Romney's vow to label China a currency manipulator is a position that is not supported by recent economic data," said Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell professor who specializes in Chinese currency and trade policies.
But for all the improvement, those gains have recently stopped or started to erode. At the same time, Chinese exports to the United States are strengthening again, rising 5.5 percent in September from a year ago. That partly reflects increased demand as the American economy begins to show signs of recovery.
Mr. Romney was caustic in accusing China of unfair policies.
"One of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency," he said. "Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low -- and that makes them advantageous in the marketplace."
Mr. Romney promised that if elected he would immediately name China a "currency manipulator," a designation that would mandate further negotiations with Beijing. It could lead to American retaliation if Congress passes legislation authorizing special tariffs for countries deemed to manipulate.
Mr. Romney was cautious, though, in threatening to actually impose tariffs on Chinese shipments to the United States, saying he would do so "if necessary."
"On Day 1, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers," he said.
Mr. Obama responded that the renminbi had strengthened 11 percent during his term of office. The value of one renminbi has actually risen 8.5 percent, to 15.9 cents, since he was sworn in.
But administration officials have tended to follow the practice of many economists in adjusting exchange rates based on the differences in inflation at the consumer level in two countries. Consumer prices have risen a little more than two percentage points more in China than in the United States since January 2009, according to official data, so the inflation-adjusted appreciation has totaled about 11 percent. Most of that took place in late 2010 and last year.
Economists say official data understates inflation in China much more than in the United States. The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing has acknowledged that there are shortcomings in the way it calculates inflation and said it had begun to fix them. So the actual inflation-adjusted appreciation of the renminbi may have been even greater over the last several years.
That trend appears to be changing. As China's economy has slowed over the last year, partly in response to its stronger currency, the pressure on prices has begun to ease. Exporters interviewed at the Canton Fair on Monday in Guangzhou, China, were unconcerned about inflation for the first time in years.
"Raw material prices are flat," said Bob Wang, the sales manager at the Kralle Tools Company, a manufacturer in Wenzhou, in eastern China, that makes circular saw blades for lumber mills.
Through 2009 and the first half of 2010, China spent heavily to block the renminbi from rising against the dollar. China seemed to have the world's healthiest economy during the global financial crisis that erupted in 2008. Its currency would have surged had it not intervened.
As it was, the central bank's foreign exchange reserves swelled by $540 billion in just 18 months. The central bank paid for those huge purchases, mostly of dollars, partly by issuing more renminbi and partly by forcing the country's state-controlled commercial banks to hand over a fifth of their renminbi deposits at near-zero interest rates.
The central bank compensated the commercial banks by ordering all of them to pay very low interest rates -- only half the rate of inflation -- to their depositors.
Obama administration officials warned at the time that China was risking inflation by issuing so much more money. China's broadly measured money supply ended up growing 55 percent in 2009 and 2010, much more than that of the United States.
Inflation in consumer prices soon accelerated to reach 6.5 percent in July last year -- nearly twice the American level, even before allowing for of China's tendency to understate inflation. Partly to brake inflation, by making imports cheaper, the Chinese authorities allowed the renminbi to start rising in the summer of 2010 after a two-year hiatus.
The combination of higher prices and a strengthening currency erased much of the undervaluation that institutions like the International Monetary Fund perceived early in the global financial crisis. The I.M.F. responded three months ago by reclassifying the renminbi to "moderately undervalued" from "substantially undervalued."
Chinese inflation has now largely disappeared because of strict controls on bank lending and a slump in the real estate market. Consumer prices are now rising at about the same pace in China as in the United States, while wholesale prices are dropping much faster in China than in the United States.
The daily fixing of the renminbi's value by the Chinese central bank is now almost exactly where it started the year, as the Chinese government has tolerated only small movements up and down this year. But there is little evidence the central bank is intervening on a large scale to suppress the value of the renminbi. It might even be acting to prevent it from going lower to avoid a political reaction in the United States.
Foreign reserves are essentially unchanged this year. The renminbi has been under downward pressure because Chinese businesses and households have been moving more money out of the country to diversify their investments and hedge against the possibility of political change at home; this has offset the tide of dollars still sweeping in from the persistent trade surpluses.
Chinese exporters have taken heart as the currency has stabilized and inflation has rapidly disappeared -- although wages are still rising at a double-digit percentage pace. Vicky Leung, the sales director at the Xiangli Home Appliance Manufacturing Company, which makes electric fans in Shunde, in southeastern China, is one who is relieved.
"The dollar is good for us," she said.

Abstract: In an era of global capital flows, so much excess money is now flowing through world markets that no single country can fight the international problem of inflation effectively by tightening its own monetary policy, Boediono said.

Full text: While prices have been rising in the United States and Europe, the biggest increases are being felt in Asia, and countries like India and Vietnam are already having to deal with double-digit inflation.
Sharp rises in global food and oil prices are now spilling over into wages and broader measures of inflation across Asia, as the Asian Development Bank noted in a report released Tuesday.
Workers are demanding higher wages to cover their rising living costs, and companies are imposing higher prices for a wide range of goods to cover accelerating production costs.
"The epicenter of the inflationary storm is really in Asia," said Cyd Tuano-Amador, the managing director of monetary policy at the Philippines Central Bank.
Higher inflation in Asia is also starting to contribute to higher prices in the United States. According to the Labor Department, prices for imports from Pacific Rim countries -- mostly Asian goods -- rose 2.7 percent in the 12 months through June, after falling 1.4 percent in the preceding 12 months.
Asia's central bankers, who are preparing for their annual gathering July 28 in Shanghai, have been unable to develop a united response to deal with the worst inflation threat in at least a decade.
In an interview Tuesday, Boediono, the governor of the Bank of Indonesia, called for a coordinated international move toward tighter monetary policy, including higher interest rates by the United States, so as to slow inflation.
In an era of global capital flows, so much excess money is now flowing through world markets that no single country can fight the international problem of inflation effectively by tightening its own monetary policy, Boediono said. (Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.)
"I don't think any one country, even as big as China or even the United States, would be able to stomach the adjustment" of raising interest rates far enough to slow global inflation, he said.
World oil prices could fall by 30 percent if countries took coordinated action to reduce liquidity, he said. He attributed much of the recent rise in global commodity prices to excess money in circulation.
But Boediono said he was not recommending that Asian central banks sell any of their dollar reserves to put pressure on the United States to raise interest rates. Asian purchases of dollar-denominated securities, led by China's $1.8 trillion in foreign reserves, have played a central role in financing the American trade and government budget deficits and in holding down interest rates on mortgages during the recent American housing market decline.
Most central banks in Asia have been reluctant to give up any of their economic independence or challenge the United States by coordinating their monetary and currency policies, even as they fret about rising prices.
"There is a legitimate concern about the recent developments on the inflation front," said Y. Venugopal Reddy, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in a speech late last month. "Oil price increase is now a global problem, making inflation a problem for all countries, both developed and developing. Hence, our solutions to the problem will also be similar, but tailored to suit our conditions."
Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said this month during a visit to Switzerland that an interest rate increase might be needed in China to combat inflation. While the rise in consumer prices slowed slightly in China last month, to 7.1 percent from 7.7 percent in May, inflation accelerated at the producer level, to 8.8 percent in June from 8.2 percent in May.
Ms. Tuano-Amador said the meeting in Shanghai was unlikely to produce any consensus on monetary policy coordination. "I don't think that it's on the table right now," she said."
As the Asian Development Bank said in its report issued Tuesday in Singapore, inflation has risen across the region. "The external economic outlook for emerging East Asia has dimmed amid prospects for slower growth, tighter credit conditions and higher inflation," the bank said.
The report also mentioned that "heightened inflationary pressures will require more decisive tightening of monetary policies across much of emerging East Asia."
The initial reaction of many governments and private sector economists across Asia over the winter was to see price increases as largely confined to food and energy -- and therefore not requiring monetary policy responses like interest rate increases. But broader inflation trends are now starting to become apparent.
The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, accelerated in Indonesia to 8.7 percent in May from 6.3 percent in December. During the same period, the core rates rose in May in the Philippines and Singapore to 6.2 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, from 2.6 percent and 3.5 percent.
Strong demand for Indonesia's many commodities, from coal to palm oil, have insulated it somewhat from slowing growth elsewhere. But rising prices are starting to take a toll, particularly on the poor.
Halimah, a teacher, echoed the unhappiness of many Indonesians as she bought milk on Sunday at a street market in Karawang, a town in west-central Java. "It has been very difficult for us, especially on kerosene, cooking oil and eggs -- they have been rising in price dramatically," she said.
Central banks in the region have been struggling for months to respond to the Federal Reserve's low interest rates. Low American interest rates are making it harder for the region's central banks to raise their rates; doing so would make them more attractive for international investors and could produce rapid appreciation in their currencies.
Stronger currencies would lower the cost in local currency terms of importing oil and other goods. But stronger currencies would also reduce the competitiveness of exports at a time when demand for Asian goods is weakening in the United States.
Boediono said he saw some room for the Indonesian rupiah to rise against the dollar, but that the timing could not be forced on his country. "Some orderly appreciation," he said, "would be helpful for us."
Boediono said that the Federal Reserve should raise short-term interest rates, and that his experience during the Asian financial crisis made him believe that the Fed could act without causing excessive damage to the American banking system.
"I don't think a move of 25 or 50 basis points," or 0.25 or 0.5 percentage points, "would collapse it," he said.
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate Banking Committee in testimony on July 15 that the United States economy faces risks of a further slowdown and higher inflation. Analysts interpreted his comments as meaning it was unlikely that the Fed would either raise or lower interest rates soon. The target for the overnight borrowing rate among banks, or federal funds rate, stands at 2 percent.
Boediono spoke in an interview in his elegant, wood-paneled offices, where the international decor and even the styling of the paneling bear a striking resemblance to the governors' suites at the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington.

Abstract: ''Undoubtedly, the state of inflation expectations greatly influences actual inflation and thus the central bank's ability to achieve price stability,'' he said yesterday. ''There's a tendency for people to settle into a range of inflation that they expect, and it's very hard to change their minds about it,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''If I expect 2 percent inflation, I'll raise my prices 2 percent a year. It's like everybody is matching what they think everybody else is doing.'' ''This Fed much more so than prior Feds puts a very heavy emphasis on the role of inflationary expectations,'' he said. ''They believe, and research shows, that inflation expectations and the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility has a large impact on private sector wage- and price-setting behavior.''

Full text: The Federal Reserve is not satisfied with the current rate of inflation. And it is apparently not satisfied with the public's expectations about inflation either.
In a speech yesterday, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that Americans had less erratic expectations about inflation than they used to but were still likely to let short-term events shape their long-term perceptions about price increases.


His remarks were taken as yet another sign that the Fed was not likely to lower interest rates anytime soon.
''Although inflation expectations seem much better anchored today than they were a few decades ago, they appear to remain imperfectly anchored,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to an economics conference in Cambridge, Mass.
The notion that the public's expectation about future inflation helps determine prices is an important one for the Fed and Mr. Bernanke. He and other Fed officials have said that to achieve a slower rate of inflation, Americans need to be reassured about the stability of prices in the future.
''Undoubtedly, the state of inflation expectations greatly influences actual inflation and thus the central bank's ability to achieve price stability,'' he said yesterday.
By repeating the message that inflation is still too high, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials hope that Americans will not accept the current trend of price increases as the norm. That would help foster lower inflation expectations -- and thus lower inflation -- in the future.
''There's a tendency for people to settle into a range of inflation that they expect, and it's very hard to change their minds about it,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''If I expect 2 percent inflation, I'll raise my prices 2 percent a year. It's like everybody is matching what they think everybody else is doing.''
The stock market tumbled after Mr. Bernanke's remarks, but investors seemed more focused on other financial news, including a warning from Standard & Poor's that it could lower its rating of more than $12 billion in mortgage-related debt. Mr. Bernanke's remarks said almost nothing about the current level of inflation or economic growth -- the type of information that would typically get a rise from Wall Street.
For the last year, the Fed has left its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged even as many economists and investors had bet that slower economic growth would force it to cut rates by this point. But when it issued its most recent decision in late June, the Fed signaled that a rate cut was still some time away.
In its statement accompanying the decision, the Fed said that while inflation had improved modestly, ''a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.''
Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist for Bank of America, said that anchoring inflation expectations was an issue that cut directly to the credibility of the Fed: if it can firmly set inflation expectations low, it can better control inflation in the future.
''This Fed much more so than prior Feds puts a very heavy emphasis on the role of inflationary expectations,'' he said. ''They believe, and research shows, that inflation expectations and the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility has a large impact on private sector wage- and price-setting behavior.''

Abstract: Last week, the president tried to contain the crisis by allowing more corn imports from the United States and ordering an investigation into whether corn distributors were colluding to manipulate prices. But the public outcry continued, and the central bank warned that the rise in corn prices would push the price of other staples up and feed inflation. There is a continuing debate here about what caused the price of tortillas to shoot up so quickly. Some economists blame the increased demand for corn from ethanol plants in the United States, and it is true corn prices in the States last week reached their highest point in a decade, the United States Agriculture Department said. At the same time, the cost of white corn has risen about 13 percent here over the past year, Mexican government figures show. On Thursday morning, President [Felipe Calderon] extracted promises from several large companies to freeze prices. Wal-Mart and other large retailers promised to keep their tortilla price at 27 cents a pound, while Grupo Maseca, also known as Gruma, agreed to lock in corn flour prices at 21 cents a pound and sell tortillas at no more than 35 cents a pound.

Full text: Facing public outrage over the soaring price of tortillas, President Felipe Calderon abandoned his free-trade principles on Thursday and forced producers to sign an agreement fixing prices for corn products.
Skyrocketing prices for corn on the world market have pushed up the price of the humble tortilla, the mainstay of the Mexican diet, by nearly a third in the past three weeks, to 35 cents a pound in Mexico City and even higher in other parts of the country.
Half of the country's 107 million people live on $4 a day or less, and many of them survive largely on tortillas and beans. The price increases have riled the public to such an extent that it has created a political storm that threatens to swamp Mr. Calderon's fresh presidency.
This month, the president, who took office in December, was booed and heckled at events around the country over food prices. Mexican lawmakers called on him to impose price controls, while leftist opposition leaders suggested that he was protecting giant corn companies. One editorial cartoonist depicted him falling from a tower as tortillas flew upward like birds.
Even members of Mr. Calderon's own conservative party in Congress called on him this week to do something quickly.
Last week, the president tried to contain the crisis by allowing more corn imports from the United States and ordering an investigation into whether corn distributors were colluding to manipulate prices. But the public outcry continued, and the central bank warned that the rise in corn prices would push the price of other staples up and feed inflation.
On Thursday morning, Mr. Calderon, a fierce advocate of free trade in last year's campaign, let the hammer fall. He announced that he had reached an agreement with the major businesses involved in corn products to stabilize the price of tortillas at a maximum of about 35 cents a pound.
He also fixed the price of cornmeal sold to mom-and-pop tortilla shops at 14 cents a pound and announced that government-owned shops in rural areas would sell tortillas at the same price, far below the market rate.
''We will not tolerate speculators and monopolists,'' he said. ''We are going to apply the law firmly and punish anyone who tries to take advantage of the needs of people.''
There is a continuing debate here about what caused the price of tortillas to shoot up so quickly. Some economists blame the increased demand for corn from ethanol plants in the United States, and it is true corn prices in the States last week reached their highest point in a decade, the United States Agriculture Department said. At the same time, the cost of white corn has risen about 13 percent here over the past year, Mexican government figures show.
But Mexican lawmakers and other officials have suggested that giant tortilla companies and corn flour distributors -- among them Grupo Maseca S.A. and Maiz Industrializado S.A., often known as Minsa -- have taken advantage of the situation, hoarding supplies to drive prices up even more.
The central bank governor, Guillermo Ortiz, said last week that the steep rise in tortilla prices could not be justified when inflation over the past year had been about 4 percent. ''We clearly have a problem of speculation,'' he said.
On Thursday morning, President Calderon extracted promises from several large companies to freeze prices. Wal-Mart and other large retailers promised to keep their tortilla price at 27 cents a pound, while Grupo Maseca, also known as Gruma, agreed to lock in corn flour prices at 21 cents a pound and sell tortillas at no more than 35 cents a pound.
The spike in corn prices has hurt small storefront tortilla makers, a hallmark of the Mexican street. Jose Solano, a 27-year-old tortilla maker in Mexico City, said he had lost about 40 percent of his business since early January, when he was forced to start raising his prices.
''People are still buying tortillas, but many of them buy less,'' he said. ''Look, we can't give our product away because we need a profit, and if they raise the cost of corn, there's no other way.''
The crisis has hit hardest for the poorest Mexicans, who may spend more than a quarter of their daily salaries on tortillas.
''This really affects my budget, the expenses of my family, because I cannot tell my kids to eat less,'' said Ruth Soria, a 37-year-old housewife, who was buying four pounds of tortillas for her six children on Thursday. ''This is something that they must control well. The tortilla is something basic for us. What the government did today is the least they could do.''

Growth Slackened In Summer

Abstract: The government report, which showed growth slowing from a 5.6 percent pace in the first quarter and 2.6 percent in the second, appeared to validate the expectation of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the economy is settling softly into a pace consistent with what he considers an acceptably low level of inflation. ''Ben Bernanke's forecast was that past Fed tightening would slow demand,'' Mr. [Richard B. Hoey] said. ''The forecast is tracking as far as I can see.'' Inflation, meanwhile, has started to abate -- at least for now. The measure of inflation preferred by the Fed, which measures the prices of goods and services, excluding food and energy, that consumers buy, rose 2.3 percent in the third quarter. This is down from the 2.7 percent rate of the second quarter, bringing inflation closer to the 1-to-2 percent range Mr. Bernanke considers acceptable.

Full text: Chilled by a summer slowdown in the housing market, the economy was held to a growth rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, the lowest since early 2003, the government reported yesterday.
But evidence of a decline in inflation coupled with vigorous consumer spending left most economists saying that the overall economy is unlikely to be dragged into a recession even as the housing market continues to falter.
''We are in a housing recession, but we are not in a broader economic recession,'' said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist of Mellon Financial.
The government report, which showed growth slowing from a 5.6 percent pace in the first quarter and 2.6 percent in the second, appeared to validate the expectation of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the economy is settling softly into a pace consistent with what he considers an acceptably low level of inflation.
''Ben Bernanke's forecast was that past Fed tightening would slow demand,'' Mr. Hoey said. ''The forecast is tracking as far as I can see.''
Stocks fell and bond prices rose as investors factored in the weaker-than-expected growth this summer, concluding that the Fed was less likely to raise interest rates next year.
With the midterm elections little more than a week away, the Bush administration sought to persuade voters that the economy, while beating at a slower pace, remains healthy.
''We have a very strong, large resilient economy that can absorb a housing correction,'' said Carlos M. Gutierrez, the commerce secretary. ''If you isolate the impact of the housing correction and look at all the rest, those are solid numbers.''
But Democrats seized on the report to criticize the administration's economic management.
''Economic growth has slowed even before most ordinary Americans have benefited from this recovery,'' Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement. ''It's clear that we need a new direction in policy to create an economy that works for all Americans.''
The economic deceleration in the third quarter was almost single-handedly brought about by the steep contraction in home building.
Residential investment plummeted 17.4 percent in the quarter, its biggest decline in more than 15 years. This alone reduced economic growth in the third quarter by over 1.1 percentage points.
The building of factories, warehouses and commercial structures picked up some of the slack. Business investment, including structures and machinery, added nearly 0.9 percentage point to gross domestic product in the quarter.
But what is most remarkable is that the pricking of the housing bubble has barely spilled over into consumer spending, which is still chugging along. The government reported that consumer spending grew 3.1 percent in the third quarter -- nearly twice as fast as overall economic growth.
''We have the most reckless and relentless consumers in the world,'' said David Kelly, economic adviser at Putnam Investments in Boston. ''It's wonderful.''
The housing freeze had long been expected to put a chill on consumers' appetites. Sales of existing homes have declined almost 14 percent over the last year. The median price of new homes has fallen by almost 10 percent in the last 12 months and existing-home prices have started to decline nationwide.
Many economists assumed that just as consumers had leveraged their buying power by borrowing against the value of their homes when house prices were rising, now that house prices are falling they would start saving some money.
That, however, has not happened. Rather, increasing employment and falling gas prices seem to be providing consumers with new reasons to spend. The personal savings rate remained negative, at minus 0.5 percent of total disposable income.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence recorded its eighth-largest monthly gain in October, vaulting to its highest level since June 2005. Optimism was driven by falling gas prices as well as expectations of faster economic growth, larger wage gains and low unemployment.
Richard Curtin, who runs the university's surveys of consumers, noted that consumers remain reluctant to buy a home, keenly aware of the decline in house prices. Still, their overall appetite to spend remains as brisk as ever.
Inflation, meanwhile, has started to abate -- at least for now. The measure of inflation preferred by the Fed, which measures the prices of goods and services, excluding food and energy, that consumers buy, rose 2.3 percent in the third quarter. This is down from the 2.7 percent rate of the second quarter, bringing inflation closer to the 1-to-2 percent range Mr. Bernanke considers acceptable.
The growth rate reported by the government is only a preliminary approximation. Historical experience suggests that subsequent revisions could change it substantially, for better or worse.
But whatever the ultimate verdict on the summer period, several economists argue that growth in the fourth quarter is likely to be higher, as consumers spend the extra money in their wallets from lower gasoline prices on other items.
''So far the quarter is going swimmingly,'' said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research.
The outlook for next year will depend on whether the continuing weakness in the housing market affects spending.
Orawin Velz, director of economic forecasting at the Mortgage Bankers' Association, estimated that the fall in residential investment would continue to drag on the economy through the middle of next year, but that its impact would decline over time. ''We think the third quarter will be the peak of the damage,'' Ms. Velz said.
While many economists foresee a longer period of housing weakness, she said that supply and demand should come into balance by mid-2007 and that home construction would start rising next summer.
Still, if the weak housing market starts cutting into consumption, the drag on overall growth could be more intense.
While it is not yet evident in the official numbers, builders are starting to shed workers as older projects are completed and there are fewer new ones to take up the slack. This will probably cut into workers' income and spending, slowing growth.
In contrast to many business economists, Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington, argued that a consumer reaction to the weak housing market would pull the economy into a recession next year.
''Homeowners had been pulling equity out of their homes at more than a $700 billion annual rate,'' Mr. Baker wrote yesterday. ''This borrowing will slow sharply in the quarters ahead.''
But others insisted that consumer appetites should not be underestimated. ''Consumer spending hasn't stopped growing in 59 straight quarters, and some pretty awful things have happened in those 59 quarters,'' Mr. Yamarone said. ''We all keep forgetting that the consumer is resilient.''

Lower Energy Prices Help Consumer Price Index Decline 0.5%

Abstract: While overall consumer prices fell last month by 0.5 percent, the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.2 percent. It was the third consecutive month that the core index grew by 0.2 percent and an indication to many economists that underlying inflation may be peaking. ''The fundamentals for inflation still look mildly unfriendly,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''When people talk about inflation turning, they're forgetting about the lags. Inflation doesn't turn with the economy. It usually takes a couple of quarters.'' As the economy continues to slow, the Federal Reserve's forecast is that inflation will slow as well. The central bank has said that slower growth, led by a decline in the housing market, will help pull inflation back down to tolerable levels.

Full text: Rapidly falling energy prices helped push consumer prices down sharply last month, the government reported yesterday.
But the decline did not entirely dispel inflation worries because the measure of retail prices that excludes volatile food and energy costs held steady at a level above the Federal Reserve's comfort zone.
Wall Street -- already energized by stronger-than-expected profits from I.B.M. and Intel and construction data that showed a steep drop in building permits -- saw the latest evidence as an encouraging sign that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged for now. The central bank's policy setting committee will meet next week to review short-term lending rates, currently at 5.25 percent.
Stocks surged at the start of trading yesterday and the Dow Jones industrial average leapt past 12,000 for the first time. The exuberance was short-lived, however. The blue-chip index retreated later in the morning, ending the day up 42.66 points, at 11,992.68.
The federal government also announced that Social Security payments, which are based on changes in the Consumer Price Index over the previous 12 months, will increase 3.3 percent in 2007.
For the 53 million Americans that receive Social Security checks, that will raise the average monthly payment by $33, the Social Security Administration said.
While overall consumer prices fell last month by 0.5 percent, the core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.2 percent. It was the third consecutive month that the core index grew by 0.2 percent and an indication to many economists that underlying inflation may be peaking.
With core prices up 2.9 percent compared with last September, well above the 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent level that central bankers consider ideal, the economists cautioned that it is still not clear whether the Fed will have more tightening to do next year.
''The fundamentals for inflation still look mildly unfriendly,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''When people talk about inflation turning, they're forgetting about the lags. Inflation doesn't turn with the economy. It usually takes a couple of quarters.''
As the economy continues to slow, the Federal Reserve's forecast is that inflation will slow as well. The central bank has said that slower growth, led by a decline in the housing market, will help pull inflation back down to tolerable levels.
Indeed, a report from the Commerce Department showed yesterday that building permits fell by 6.3 percent in September, to the lowest rate since October 2001.
The number of housing starts last month increased 5.9 percent.
The rise in new home construction did surprise economists, but it is not likely to foreshadow any immediate bounce-back in residential construction. Construction activity is often volatile for a number of reasons, particularly the weather.
Building permits, therefore, are considered to be a better barometer of the strength of the housing industry because they measure how much demand builders are expecting.
''Even a cursory glance at the awful permits numbers should disabuse all but the most incurable optimists'' of the notion that the new housing market will improve soon, Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist with High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research report.
In another sign that investors do not believe the Fed will raise rates any further, interest rates on long-term bonds fell yesterday for the third consecutive day. And that view was echoed by several Wall Street analysts.
''The surge in core inflation is abating,'' a team of economists from Goldman Sachs wrote in a research report.
As long as future inflation readings do not look any worse than yesterday's report, and economic growth continues to slow at a moderate pace, the Fed can afford to wait for the effects of two years of interest rate increases to take hold.
Most economists believe that when the Fed gathers next week, it will leave interest rates untouched for the third time in a row.
''From the Fed's point of view, slower growth opens up a little bit of a gap,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial.
The Labor Department report showed that on a seasonally adjusted basis, consumer prices rose at slower rates in September on a number of goods and services like clothing, food and household furnishings.
The price of transportation, including gasoline and vehicle purchases, was the only major category of the price index that actually declined in September.
High rental costs kept the core price index elevated in September. Compared with September a year ago, housing prices, which are tied to a measure of rents rather than what homes are actually selling for, rose 4.1 percent, faster than any other component of the index except medical care.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the average weekly earnings for ordinary workers, adjusted for inflation, rose by 1 percent in September. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent.

Abstract: A fashionable view among prognosticators these days is that commodity price increases are not seeping into the broader economy as they have in previous periods, making them -- so the argument goes -- less reliable leading indicators of inflation. But Mr. [James W. Paulsen] demurs. Rising commodity prices do show up in the Consumer Price Index but just not immediately, he said. For instance, he said that we are in the midst of the second broad commodity price climb since 2003. When the first spike began that year, it did not have an impact on the C.P.I. until 2004, causing the index to move from a 1 percent rate to more than 2 percent. ''That move had very little impact on people,'' Mr. Paulsen said, ''because the inflation rate was still so low.'' Core inflation of 3 percent will not similarly damage stocks, Mr. Paulsen said. In fact, the Dow Jones industrial average may reach new highs, in part because companies will be able to dodge inflationary pressures by passing along some price increases to consumers. Forecasters expect the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to earn $85 a share in 2006; that would put the current price-to-earnings multiple in the overall market at less than 15, not an enormous premium. Could inflation get out of control? It's a risk, but one that Mr. Paulsen said was significantly blunted by emerging-market economies like China and India. ''I think we're still very much in a disinflationary globe,'' he said. ''One big offset to all the dollar liquidity and massive fiscal stimulus out there is the inclusion of all these other economies and their resources. It's hard to see where you get runaway inflation with that going on.''

Full text: THE stock markets got spooked last week, falling around 2 percent on fears that inflation might spoil all the fun that equity investors have been having of late. Is the bull market that began just over a year ago a goner, or is it simply taking a breather?
James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, is a good go-to guy for such a question because he has been spot-on recently about both the economy and the financial markets. In 2002, for instance, he was among the first to make the case that the economic recovery would be stronger than many people thought and that consumer spending would continue to roar along.
Regarding the stock swoon last week, Mr. Paulsen said that while he predicts an increase in consumer prices -- and interest rates -- in coming months, he thinks that stocks may climb as well. Even if core inflation rose to around 3 percent, as he expects, he said that stocks could shake it off. The bond market, however, is another matter.
''I am very sensitive to the fact that this is the first move since the October run that showed a notable change in leadership in the market -- away from small-cap stocks to large, away from stocks to bonds, and emerging markets taking their first hit,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''But while I think stocks are priced for 3 percent core inflation, the bond market is not and that's why it's struggling.''
A fashionable view among prognosticators these days is that commodity price increases are not seeping into the broader economy as they have in previous periods, making them -- so the argument goes -- less reliable leading indicators of inflation. But Mr. Paulsen demurs. Rising commodity prices do show up in the Consumer Price Index but just not immediately, he said. For instance, he said that we are in the midst of the second broad commodity price climb since 2003. When the first spike began that year, it did not have an impact on the C.P.I. until 2004, causing the index to move from a 1 percent rate to more than 2 percent. ''That move had very little impact on people,'' Mr. Paulsen said, ''because the inflation rate was still so low.''
Commodity prices rose for about a year after 2003 before they flattened out. The second pop in commodities, which began last fall, is what the markets are digesting now. ''It's not new; it's just that people are noticing this time,'' he said. ''Not only because it's going from 2 to 3, but also, you have a new Fed chairman that says 2 is what he's comfortable with at the high end.''
This, of course, has the bond market rattled. Treasury yields are well into 5 percent territory, their highest in five years. And because he expects consumer price inflation to rise to 3 percent and maybe a bit higher in the next 12 to 18 months, Mr. Paulsen suspects that bond yields will reach 6 percent in coming months.
Core inflation of 3 percent will not similarly damage stocks, Mr. Paulsen said. In fact, the Dow Jones industrial average may reach new highs, in part because companies will be able to dodge inflationary pressures by passing along some price increases to consumers. Forecasters expect the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to earn $85 a share in 2006; that would put the current price-to-earnings multiple in the overall market at less than 15, not an enormous premium.
''Top-line growth in this cycle has been stronger than it ever was in the 90's, and a big reason is pricing has been better,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''If companies could pass on a little bit of these price increases, profits could outpace what people think. We forget that's one way companies made money for a good part of the postwar era.''
Could inflation get out of control? It's a risk, but one that Mr. Paulsen said was significantly blunted by emerging-market economies like China and India. ''I think we're still very much in a disinflationary globe,'' he said. ''One big offset to all the dollar liquidity and massive fiscal stimulus out there is the inclusion of all these other economies and their resources. It's hard to see where you get runaway inflation with that going on.''
Instead, Mr. Paulsen says that we are likely to encounter cyclical inflation, not secular inflation, as occurred in the 1970's.
And what of the overleveraged consumer and his reliance on a buoyant housing market to keep spending? Rising interest rates surely won't help there.
''I share the same fears that everybody else has about how vulnerable the consumer is if at some point they hit the wall,'' he said. ''I just think that's not the most likely outcome.''
Here's how he explains it: In the early part of this decade, jobs were few but consumers survived on mortgage equity withdrawals. Now the home equity cash machine is gone, but jobs are more plentiful. ''The reckoning for the consumer will come after rates have gone up, mortgage equity withdrawal is gone and jobs roll over, too,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''I don't think that's a this-year event.''
It certainly is remarkable, not to mention disconcerting, how the final reckoning for the excesses of the 90's is still being pushed down the road. The stock market bubble was so quickly followed by the housing market boom that it seems the bill will never be paid. In the real world, of course, the bill is always paid -- it's just a question of when.
But if Mr. Paulsen is correct, and he has been plenty perspicacious of late, then the United States economy -- and the nation's stock market -- may continue to confound the skeptics. That would give consumers another, much-needed opportunity to get their balance sheets in order. A good thing, to be sure.

Will a Fed Pause on Rates End at the Water's Edge?

Abstract: The result would be a mirror image of the ''conundrum'' that perplexed Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, all last year. The conundrum was that long-term interest rates remained low and overall credit conditions relatively easy even as the Fed raised short-term rates. That could pose a challenge for Ben S. Bernanke, who took over as Fed chairman in February. Mr. Bernanke has argued that the combination of low interest rates and the United States' expanding trade deficit stemmed in part from a ''global savings glut'' -- a vast pool of idle money in Asia and other parts of the world that found its way back into the United States. The view of Fed officials that they are near the end of their rate-raising efforts is predicated on the expectation that the nation's growth will slow from an annual pace of 4.8 percent in the first quarter to about 3 percent in the second half of 2006. But even if the Fed is sanguine about inflation, global forces could push up borrowing costs.

Full text: If the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates later this year, will the rest of the world go along?
When Fed policy makers meet on Wednesday to set overnight interest rates, they will almost certainly increase them by another quarter-point, to 5 percent. And investors will search for any clues about a pause in further rate increases.
But a growing number of economists are looking at a different possibility: that changes in the global economy could keep pushing up long-term interest rates long after the Fed stops raising its benchmark rate.
The result would be a mirror image of the ''conundrum'' that perplexed Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, all last year. The conundrum was that long-term interest rates remained low and overall credit conditions relatively easy even as the Fed raised short-term rates.
Now, even as Fed bankers indicate that they may be near the end of their increases, the long-term interest rates that determine home mortgage rates and companies' borrowing costs have crept higher.
Increased anxiety about future inflation has been partly to blame, analysts say. But long-term rates have edged up around the world, suggesting that global forces are at work.
Japan, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, is growing faster than it has in more than a decade, and the nation's central bank, which has kept interest rates negligible, is expected to start raising them again. European growth, though rising more slowly than in the United States, is accelerating, and the European Central Bank, after pausing in April, is expected by many to resume increases. Its benchmark short-term rate, at 2.5 percent, has been raised twice since December.
Meantime, China's economy surged by nearly 10 percent last year, and Chinese leaders promise to spur the kind of domestic demand that would keep more money at home.
Higher growth leads to more competition for investment capital, which tends to drive up interest rates. And as rates rise in foreign countries, there is less incentive to seek higher returns in the United States.
That could pose a challenge for Ben S. Bernanke, who took over as Fed chairman in February. Mr. Bernanke has argued that the combination of low interest rates and the United States' expanding trade deficit stemmed in part from a ''global savings glut'' -- a vast pool of idle money in Asia and other parts of the world that found its way back into the United States.
As Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, sees matters: ''It looks increasingly obvious that there is a boom on the globe today; it's just not happening here. That in turn would suggest that the moderating activity here in the United States may not elicit lower interest rates. What was a conundrum for Greenspan then becomes a problem for Bernanke.''
Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup, said that speculation about the changing global demand for money had helped feed a run-up in long-term rates.
''I think people are speculating about this, speculating that growth rates may converge, that savings will come more into balance and that there is going to be a draw on capital that's going to suck money out of the United States,'' Mr. DiClemente said.
To be sure, part of the recent rise in long-term interest rates reflects worries about inflation.
One proxy for inflation worries is the gap between yields on conventional Treasury debt and the yields on inflation-adjusted Treasury securities, or TIPS.
That gap widened last month to 2.8 percentage points, from 2.7 points, and much of the widening occurred after Mr. Bernanke told lawmakers that the Fed might temporarily stop its rate increases.
Recent economic data about inflation has been mixed. Overall consumer prices have climbed markedly, largely because of oil prices; the Fed's preferred gauge of core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, is up about 2 percent over the last 12 months.
That is about the upper limit of what Mr. Bernanke has described as his comfort zone for inflation. Meanwhile, growth in the United States was much faster in the first quarter than most economists had expected. And while job creation slowed to 138,000 in April, unemployment was only 4.7 percent and hourly wages climbed 3.8 percent over the last year -- the biggest jump in five years.
But many analysts say the inflation outlook remains fairly tame. Nonfarm productivity, the amount of output for each hour of work, rose at an annual pace of 3.2 percent in the first three months of 2006.
Higher energy prices seem to have had little impact on other consumer prices, and corporate profits are so high that many companies can absorb higher wages without raising prices.
The view of Fed officials that they are near the end of their rate-raising efforts is predicated on the expectation that the nation's growth will slow from an annual pace of 4.8 percent in the first quarter to about 3 percent in the second half of 2006. But even if the Fed is sanguine about inflation, global forces could push up borrowing costs.
An increase in global interest rates would not necessarily be bad news for Mr. Bernanke. Higher long-term rates would help cool down American economic growth, and the housing market in particular, without requiring the Fed to take more action on its own.
But higher global rates could also slow the United States economy enough to increase unemployment.
Either way, analysts said, the economy is more dependent on global forces than was true a decade ago.
''It is more exposed because of the fact that it needs massive amounts of cash from the rest of the world,'' said Nigel Gault, senior economist at Global Insight, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. ''In a strange way, the world is riskier for the United States if everyone else is doing better.''

Abstract: He is perhaps best known for his relatively brief service, less than three years, in the [Jimmy Carter] administration. In an era of stagflation -- a stagnant economy and rising inflation -- Mr. Miller was the man in the box, using the puppeteer levers of interest rates and monetary policy in search of the delicate balance of dampering inflation without throwing the national economy into a catastrophic tailspin. During his tenure, Mr. Miller also pushed through an accord with labor on wage-price guidelines that had been stalemated for months and negotiated $1.5 billion in loan guarantees that rescued the Chrysler Corporation from near bankruptcy and saved thousands of jobs. He also arranged the freezing -- and later the unfreezing -- of Iranian assets in United States custody during the Iranian hostage crisis, when 52 Americans at the United States Embassy in Tehran were held captive for 444 days. Mr. Miller never ran for political office, but he was enlisted by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as by Mr. Carter, to lead efforts to attack unemployment, assist minorities and veterans, and fight inflation and a flagging economy. From 1963 to 1965, he was chairman of an advisory council to the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity.

Full text: G. William Miller, a businessman and investment banker who was chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and treasury secretary under President Jimmy Carter, died Friday night at his home in Washington. He was 81.
The cause was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a relatively rare hardening and deterioration of the lungs, said Carol Juarer, his secretary at G. William Miller & Company in Washington. She said Mr. Miller was a nonsmoker who had been in good health all his life until the lung disease was diagnosed in June 2004.
A small, hard-driving Oklahoman with boundless energy, Mr. Miller was a Coast Guard officer, a lawyer and a corporate executive with a dazzling resume in business, government service, and the arts and humanities.
He was also a persistent advocate of equal employment opportunities for minorities. A recurrent theme of his speeches and conversations, colleagues said, was a warning against business profits at the expense of the environment and what he called human values.
Early in his career, Mr. Miller helped build a moderate-size textile manufacturer into the giant aerospace conglomerate Textron, diversifying its reach from consumer goods to industrial equipment and aircraft, including Bell UH-1 helicopters, or Hueys, which were the workhorses of the Vietnam War.
But he is perhaps best known for his relatively brief service, less than three years, in the Carter administration. In an era of stagflation -- a stagnant economy and rising inflation -- Mr. Miller was the man in the box, using the puppeteer levers of interest rates and monetary policy in search of the delicate balance of dampering inflation without throwing the national economy into a catastrophic tailspin.
As chairman of the Federal Reserve from March 1978 to August 1979, Mr. Miller pushed interest rates, though not enough to satisfy many of his critics. He also called for a national policy to reduce consumption of foreign oil, recommended cuts in government spending and taxation, and urged labor and management to moderate wage demands and price increases.
Unlike his predecessor, Arthur F. Burns, who had tried to limit economic expansion in the belief that inflation was the far greater peril, Mr. Miller insisted that inflation and unemployment could be fought simultaneously.
But the economy remained sluggish and inflation was not subdued, and Wall Street drubbed Mr. Miller as overly cautious, especially in slowing the growth of the nation's money supply. (His successor at the Fed, Paul A. Volcker, brought inflation under control by raising interest rates astronomically.)
Mr. Miller retained the president's confidence, however, and in a cabinet shakeup on Aug. 6, 1979, he was named treasury secretary to succeed W. Michael Blumenthal. Over the next 17 months, until Ronald Reagan became president, Mr. Miller was credited by many administration supporters and detractors with bringing order to an economic policy that had been prone to aimlessness and disarray.
During his tenure, Mr. Miller also pushed through an accord with labor on wage-price guidelines that had been stalemated for months and negotiated $1.5 billion in loan guarantees that rescued the Chrysler Corporation from near bankruptcy and saved thousands of jobs. He also arranged the freezing -- and later the unfreezing -- of Iranian assets in United States custody during the Iranian hostage crisis, when 52 Americans at the United States Embassy in Tehran were held captive for 444 days.
''Bill Miller had great skills in getting disparate parties together on the same page,'' said Steven L. Skancke, a former treasury official and a partner in G. William Miller & Company, the discreet, Swiss-style merchant bank in Washington that had been the focus of Mr. Miller's business interests since 1981.
George William Miller was born on March 9, 1925, in Sapulpa, Okla., but grew up in Borger, Tex., where his parents hoped in vain to cash in on the discovery of oil in the Texas Panhandle.
He graduated from the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., in 1945, and spent the next four years as a line officer in the Pacific, mostly in Okinawa and Shanghai, where he met and married Ariadna Rogojarsky, a Russian emigre. The couple had no children.
After graduating at the top of his law school class at the University of California, Berkeley, he joined the Wall Street firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore in 1952. But in 1956, he joined Textron, based in Providence, R.I., as an assistant secretary.
Within four years he was president of the company, and over the next 18 years he turned it into a global enterprise with arms in aerospace, consumer goods and industrial equipment.
Mr. Miller never ran for political office, but he was enlisted by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as by Mr. Carter, to lead efforts to attack unemployment, assist minorities and veterans, and fight inflation and a flagging economy. From 1963 to 1965, he was chairman of an advisory council to the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity.
In 1968, he was chairman of a national business group's campaign for the Democratic ticket, Hubert H. Humphrey and Edmund S. Muskie. He was chairman and chief executive of Federated Stores from 1990 to 1992.
He was also a director of many corporations and the Washington National Opera, a treasurer of the American Red Cross and a member of the National Council on the Humanities.
Besides his wife, Mr. Miller is survived by three sisters: Catherine Spiller and Myra Fowler, of Amarillo, Tex., and Mabel Wade, of Bedford, Va.; and two brothers, Othneil and Dee, both of Amarillo.

Abstract: He is perhaps best known for his relatively brief service, less than three years, in the [Jimmy Carter] administration. In an era of stagflation -- a stagnant economy and rising inflation -- Mr. Miller was the man in the box, using the puppeteer levers of interest rates and monetary policy in search of the delicate balance of dampering inflation without throwing the national economy into a catastrophic tailspin. During his tenure, Mr. Miller also pushed through an accord with labor on wage-price guidelines that had been stalemated for months and negotiated $1.5 billion in loan guarantees that rescued the Chrysler Corporation from near bankruptcy and saved thousands of jobs. He also arranged the freezing -- and later the unfreezing -- of Iranian assets in United States custody during the Iranian hostage crisis, when 52 Americans at the United States Embassy in Tehran were held captive for 444 days. Mr. Miller never ran for political office, but he was enlisted by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as by Mr. Carter, to lead efforts to attack unemployment, assist minorities and veterans, and fight inflation and a flagging economy.

Full text: G. William Miller, a businessman and investment banker who was chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and treasury secretary under President Jimmy Carter, died Friday night at his home in Washington. He was 81.
The cause was idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a relatively rare hardening and deterioration of the lungs, said Carol Juarer, his secretary at G. William Miller & Company in Washington. She said Mr. Miller was a nonsmoker who had been in good health all his life until the lung disease was diagnosed in June 2004.
A small, hard-driving Oklahoman with boundless energy, Mr. Miller was a Coast Guard officer, a lawyer and a corporate executive with a dazzling resume in business, government service, and the arts and humanities.
He was also a persistent advocate of equal employment opportunities for minorities. A recurrent theme of his speeches and conversations, colleagues said, was a warning against business profits at the expense of the environment and what he called human values.
Early in his career, Mr. Miller helped build a moderate-size textile manufacturer into the giant aerospace conglomerate Textron, diversifying its reach from consumer goods to industrial equipment and aircraft, including Bell UH-1 helicopters, or Hueys, which were the workhorses of the Vietnam War.
But he is perhaps best known for his relatively brief service, less than three years, in the Carter administration. In an era of stagflation -- a stagnant economy and rising inflation -- Mr. Miller was the man in the box, using the puppeteer levers of interest rates and monetary policy in search of the delicate balance of dampering inflation without throwing the national economy into a catastrophic tailspin.
As chairman of the Federal Reserve from March 1978 to August 1979, Mr. Miller pushed interest rates, though not enough to satisfy many of his critics. He also called for a national policy to reduce consumption of foreign oil, recommended cuts in government spending and taxation, and urged labor and management to moderate wage demands and price increases.
Unlike his predecessor, Arthur F. Burns, who had tried to limit economic expansion in the belief that inflation was the far greater peril, Mr. Miller insisted that inflation and unemployment could be fought simultaneously.
But the economy remained sluggish and inflation was not subdued, and Wall Street drubbed Mr. Miller as overly cautious, especially in slowing the growth of the nation's money supply. (His successor at the Fed, Paul A. Volcker, brought inflation under control by raising interest rates astronomically.)
Mr. Miller retained the president's confidence, however, and in a cabinet shakeup on Aug. 6, 1979, he was named treasury secretary to succeed W. Michael Blumenthal. Over the next 17 months, until Ronald Reagan became president, Mr. Miller was credited by many administration supporters and detractors with bringing order to an economic policy that had been prone to aimlessness and disarray.
During his tenure, Mr. Miller also pushed through an accord with labor on wage-price guidelines that had been stalemated for months and negotiated $1.5 billion in loan guarantees that rescued the Chrysler Corporation from near bankruptcy and saved thousands of jobs. He also arranged the freezing -- and later the unfreezing -- of Iranian assets in United States custody during the Iranian hostage crisis, when 52 Americans at the United States Embassy in Tehran were held captive for 444 days.
''Bill Miller had great skills in getting disparate parties together on the same page,'' said Steven L. Skancke, a former treasury official and a partner in G. William Miller & Company, the discreet, Swiss-style merchant bank in Washington that had been the focus of Mr. Miller's business interests since 1981.
George William Miller was born on March 9, 1925, in Sapulpa, Okla., but grew up in Borger, Tex., where his parents hoped in vain to cash in on the discovery of oil in the Texas Panhandle.
He graduated from the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., in 1945, and spent the next four years as a line officer in the Pacific, mostly in Okinawa and Shanghai, where he met and married Ariadna Rogojarsky, a Russian emigre. The couple had no children.
After graduating at the top of his law school class at the University of California, Berkeley, he joined the Wall Street firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore in 1952. But in 1956, he joined Textron, based in Providence, R.I., as an assistant secretary.
Within four years he was president of the company, and over the next 18 years he turned it into a global enterprise with arms in aerospace, consumer goods and industrial equipment.
Mr. Miller never ran for political office, but he was enlisted by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as by Mr. Carter, to lead efforts to attack unemployment, assist minorities and veterans, and fight inflation and a flagging economy. From 1963 to 1965, he was chairman of an advisory council to the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity.

He was also a director of many corporations and the Washington National Opera, a treasurer of the American Red Cross and a member of the National Council on the Humanities.
Besides his wife, Mr. Miller is survived by three sisters: Catherine Spiller and Myra Fowler, of Amarillo, Tex., and Mabel Wade, of Bedford, Va.; and two brothers, Othneil and Dee, both of Amarillo.

Abstract: Still, several economists said they detected a note of caution in today's Bank of Canada statement. Edward Carmichael, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Chase Bank Canada, said in a note to clients that the downturn in industrial activity in the United States and the impact of the respiratory disease known as SARS, which has significantly damaged Canada's travel and tourism market, could dampen economic growth over the next two to three months. Before today's announcement, economists had been divided on whether Bank of Canada policy makers would emphasize holding down inflation over spurring growth, given recent signs of weakness in the domestic economy especially in businesses, like the automotive industry, that depend heavily on exports to the United States. Canada's inflation rate, measured by the consumer price index, climbed 4.6 percent in the year to February. The central bank's core rate, which excludes volatile items like food, fuel and mortgage interest, rose 3.1 percent, compared with the bank's 2 percent target. The average increase in 2002 was 2.3 percent.

Full text: Â  The Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate for the fifth time in the last 13 months, citing prospects for a renewed burst of economic growth later this year and concerns about inflation.
The move stands in sharp contrast with monetary policy in the United States and other industrial countries, where central banks have held off on raising interest rates or even cut rates to stimulate sluggish economies. Canada is the only country in the Group of Seven to increase rates in the last two years. The quarter point increase by the Bank of Canada puts its benchmark overnight rate at 3.25 percent, 2 points higher than the benchmark in United States, Canada's biggest trading partner.
Indeed, Canada has been different: its economy was the strongest performer among major industrial countries last year, with gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, growing by 3.3 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in the United States. The growth rate in the year to January 2003 was 3.4 percent.
''The domestic economy still has a lot of tail wind behind it,'' said Aron Gampel, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.
Still, several economists said they detected a note of caution in today's Bank of Canada statement. Edward Carmichael, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Chase Bank Canada, said in a note to clients that the downturn in industrial activity in the United States and the impact of the respiratory disease known as SARS, which has significantly damaged Canada's travel and tourism market, could dampen economic growth over the next two to three months.
Before today's announcement, economists had been divided on whether Bank of Canada policy makers would emphasize holding down inflation over spurring growth, given recent signs of weakness in the domestic economy especially in businesses, like the automotive industry, that depend heavily on exports to the United States.
Announcing the increase in interest rates, the central bank said that with the end of the war in Iraq and the recent fall in oil prices, ''the risks confronting the global economy are now better balanced'' than at the time of its last interest-rate announcement, in early March. The overnight rate stood at 2 percent in March 2002.
Canada's inflation rate, measured by the consumer price index, climbed 4.6 percent in the year to February. The central bank's core rate, which excludes volatile items like food, fuel and mortgage interest, rose 3.1 percent, compared with the bank's 2 percent target. The average increase in 2002 was 2.3 percent.
Yet with the United States accounting for 85 percent of Canada's exports, a prolonged slowdown south of the border is sure to ripple through to the Canadian economy. Canada reported statistics last week that the trade surplus slipped to 4.6 billion Canadian dollars in February, from 5.2 billion Canadian dollars in January, because of a 1.6 percent fall in exports.
The Canadian dollar rose to 69.07 United States cents -- its highest level in three years -- after the announcement of the rate increase. It ended at 69 United States cents.

Abstract: The possibility that the United States would walk away from Turkey was suddenly a nightmare to consider. ''I think relations between the U.S and Turkey have been harmed tremendously,'' said Mehmet Kutman, the chairman of Global Securities, one of Turkey's larger brokerage houses. ''People have lost their confidence, and unless some new money comes in, Turkey could well announce a moratorium on its domestic debt.'' That verdict has been a harsh one. With the erosion of the ''strategic premium'' on Turkish financial assets, the spread between Turkish bonds and United States Treasury bonds has widened to 10 percentage points, and Turkish domestic interest rates have soared. Since an aid-for-access deal between the United States and Turkey failed to win approval in the Turkish Parliament, investors have sold Turkish stocks and bonds heavily.

Full text: Â  When Turkey and the United States failed to finalize a deal last week to send ground forces through Turkey into Iraq, American war planners were inconvenienced, but the Turkish financial markets were devastated.
The Istanbul Stock Exchange has fallen by a quarter from its February high and is approaching an all-time low. The country's benchmark eurobonds are trading at 87.82 cents on the dollar, down 19 percent in a week. Rumors are swirling that the government is nearing default on its domestic debt.
Investing in Turkey has always been a roller coaster ride. The realities of high inflation rates, yawning budget deficits and impenetrable politics have been mitigated, at times, by rapid economic growth and a roster of globally competitive companies.
Seasoned emerging-market investors have generally been willing to stomach the ride because of a belief that no matter how bad things became, Turkey would never be allowed to fail: the United States would always come to the rescue of so important a strategic ally.
But when the Turkish Parliament rejected the proposal by the ruling Justice and Development Party to accept American ground troops in return for $30 billion in guaranteed credits, that faith was deeply dented.
The possibility that the United States would walk away from Turkey was suddenly a nightmare to consider. ''I think relations between the U.S and Turkey have been harmed tremendously,'' said Mehmet Kutman, the chairman of Global Securities, one of Turkey's larger brokerage houses. ''People have lost their confidence, and unless some new money comes in, Turkey could well announce a moratorium on its domestic debt.''
During a three-week span in November, foreign investors injected over $2 billion into the Turkish markets on the assumption that the newly elected Justice and Development Party would be in a strong position to negotiate aid from the United States as part of a deal on Iraq.
The Istanbul Stock Exchange shot up on the prospect of billions of dollars in cheap foreign credits being made available to Turkey and the expectation that more private money would follow. Underpinning the optimism was the sense that Turkey's status as America's chief strategic partner in the region would attract even more bounty in the future, like fresh credits from the International Monetary Fund and perhaps even entry into the European Union.
Yes, many investors reasoned, there were short-term risks, including economic harm from the war, but the long-term benefits would be great.
This enthusiasm overlooked what proved to be a crucial factor: Turkey's new government had the largest parliamentary majority in years, but the ruling party itself was something of a paper tiger, a recently assembled collection of conservative Islamist politicians that had never governed in Turkey and had virtually no experience on the world stage.
It did not even start with a genuine prime minister. Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the party, had been barred from holding public office, a ban that has since been lifted.
As a result, the new government proved unable to push the deal with the United States through the fractious Turkish Parliament, and was left looking ineffectual both domestically and internationally.
Mr. Erdogan is now the prime minister, but with hostilities underway in Iraq, and Turkey mainly on the sidelines, he heads a government in disarray. It has infuriated two powerful constituencies, the Bush administration and the ultimate arbiter of Turkish politics, the country's powerful military.
After the 1991 Gulf war, the Turkish economy fell immediately into a recession, but it kept the good will of the United States because of the unflinching support that Turgut Ozal, Turkey's prime minister at the time, showed for the campaign to oust Iraqi invaders from Kuwait.
Now, at least for the moment, that good will has evaporated. And with the Turkish military eager to send its troops into northern Iraq, Turkish and United States interests are now more at odds than converging.
''The basis of the Turkish-American relationship was always strategic, not geographic or cultural,'' said Bulent Aliriza, a Turkey analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''That was fine and dandy during the cold war. Now, if you take strategy out of the relationship, there is nothing left except the verdict of the market.''
That verdict has been a harsh one. With the erosion of the ''strategic premium'' on Turkish financial assets, the spread between Turkish bonds and United States Treasury bonds has widened to 10 percentage points, and Turkish domestic interest rates have soared.
With no new flood of aid from the United States and with the international debt markets unfriendly as well, Turkey has no way to finance its budget deficit -- largely created by interest costs on borrowings -- other than to try to borrow again from the tapped-out domestic debt market. Foreign investors have pulled out of this market, Turkish brokers say.
''Due to inflation-adjusted interest rates of 35 percent, the debt-to-gross domestic-product ratio will increase,'' said Berna Bayazitoglu, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Istanbul. ''If rates continue at these levels, the ratings agencies might downgrade Turkish debt.''
The combination of a domestic default and a possible run on the currency could lead to a broader financial collapse, analysts say.
The Turkish government is in talks with the International Monetary Fund for an infusion of cash that it badly needs. To get the money, the government must meet certain fiscal goals. Analysts in Turkey expect them to be met this year, but big questions loom, especially taking into account the cost of stepped up military operations on the Iraq border and, perhaps, beyond it.
Meanwhile, Turkey is down to the last $3.5 billion in credits under the existing agreement with the monetary fund, making it look vulnerable to a speculative run unless a new deal is struck.
As the largest investor in the fund, the United States has historically been a supportive voice for Turkey. How enthusiastic the Bush administration will be now remains a question mark, analysts say.
If the Turkish financial markets were to implode, other emerging and developed markets would be only minimally affected, investors say. Unlike Mexico in 1994, Thailand in 1997, or Russia in 1998, Turkey now has relatively little exposure to foreign investors.
More important are the geopolitical consequences. While there are few signs yet in Turkey of Argentina-style social upheaval, analysts do not discount the possibility of social tensions boiling over in the coming months.
''If winning the war in Iraq sends Turkey into a spiral, that is a huge price to pay for overthrowing the regime in Baghdad,'' said Philip Gordon, a Turkey expert and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Europeans Intervene, but Markets Don't Listen

Abstract: The solo intervention also seemed to be interpreted by many traders as a sign of weakness. The United States had been on the sidelines Friday, the first day of the European Central Bank's intervention, and stayed there yesterday. All the United States did, in a statement on Friday from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, was to say that it shared Europe's concern ''about the implications of the broad movements in the euro for the world economy.'' Washington still favors a strong dollar, Mr. Summers added. David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn., said yesterday's intervention did not scare traders into buying the euro. Instead, they sold as the European Central Bank bought, taking easy profits. James McCormick, a currency strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, said that on the basis of client trading flows, ''no one was short the euro this time around, so no one got hurt.'' Being short means selling the euro in anticipation that it will decline and then buying it back at a profit at the lower price. More disturbing for the euro's outlook is that the forces that have weakened the currency are still in place. Chief among these are the strong capital flows into the United States from Europe, as portfolio investments or as part of mergers and acquisitions. Mr. McCormick said that as of the end of last week, there was a pipeline of $49 billion in proposed mergers and acquisitions outside Europe -- up from $40 billion on Sept. 22, when the Europeans were joined by the United States, Britain and Japan in currency intervention.

Full text: Is Wim Duisenberg, leader of the European Central Bank, tilting at windmills? That was the question batted about yesterday after the European Central Bank bought euros for the second consecutive trading session in an effort to support the common currency.
With the Europeans intervening alone, the answer was yes. Without support from the United States and other industrial economies, something the European Central Bank had in September in the first effort to prop up the euro, this intervention is not expected to have much effect.
More important, the forces behind the euro's weakness -- and the dollar's strength -- do not appear to be turning in the currency's favor. And unless that happens, several analysts said, there is no significant rally for the euro in the offing.
The intervention ''doesn't preclude another spike down nor does it mean we are looking for a major euro rally any time soon,'' said Anne Mills, senior foreign economist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
The first troubling result yesterday was that the intervention helped increase the euro's value only briefly. At the time of intervention, the currency was trading around 86 cents. It jumped as high as 87.27 cents, then fell for the rest of the session in Europe and tumbled further in New York trading, bouncing back slightly to settle at 86.07 cents, down from 86.68 cents late Friday.
The solo intervention also seemed to be interpreted by many traders as a sign of weakness. The United States had been on the sidelines Friday, the first day of the European Central Bank's intervention, and stayed there yesterday. All the United States did, in a statement on Friday from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, was to say that it shared Europe's concern ''about the implications of the broad movements in the euro for the world economy.'' Washington still favors a strong dollar, Mr. Summers added.
David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn., said yesterday's intervention did not scare traders into buying the euro. Instead, they sold as the European Central Bank bought, taking easy profits. James McCormick, a currency strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, said that on the basis of client trading flows, ''no one was short the euro this time around, so no one got hurt.'' Being short means selling the euro in anticipation that it will decline and then buying it back at a profit at the lower price.
In a note to clients, Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Securities, said, ''One does not get many points for persistence in the game of intervention.'' She said the European bank was running a risk in saying it intervened alone because it assumed the United States would not join in just ahead of the presidential election. ''If Washington does not join in later this week,'' she wrote, ''the markets may be disappointed and sell the euro.''
What effect the election results will have on the dollar is unclear. A victory by Gov. George W. Bush with a Republican Congress could give the dollar a lift, especially because Mr. Bush's principal economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, has opposed American intervention in the currency markets. But the Clinton administration, which has supported a strong dollar, will be calling the shots on intervention until Jan. 20.
More disturbing for the euro's outlook is that the forces that have weakened the currency are still in place. Chief among these are the strong capital flows into the United States from Europe, as portfolio investments or as part of mergers and acquisitions. Mr. McCormick said that as of the end of last week, there was a pipeline of $49 billion in proposed mergers and acquisitions outside Europe -- up from $40 billion on Sept. 22, when the Europeans were joined by the United States, Britain and Japan in currency intervention.
In addition, much of the recent euro gain has come since the United States reported on Sept. 27 that the economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate, adjusted for inflation. That was much slower than expected and added to data indicating that the economy was slowing. Such a slowdown would be positive for the euro if it made American investment less attractive to foreigners.
But there are signs that the European economy is also slowing, which would offset the benefit of an American slowdown. Another sign of that came yesterday when Germany reported that manufacturing orders dropped 4.6 percent in September. The decline, in both domestic and foreign orders, wiped out much of the increase recorded since March.

Abstract: The success of today's intervention will depend on whether the euro climbs further or resumes its decline, and that may not be clear for weeks or even months. But the banks as a group have much more money at their disposal to buy euros, and the action today raised the prospect they could swoop in again if they decide the euro is too weak. Denmark is to hold a national referendum on adopting the euro on Thursday, and the currency's weakness has seriously eroded popular support. In Britain, which has not adopted the euro, opposition to possible future participation has intensified. Numerous European officials have said that the euro's weakness threatens to undermine the trend toward economic integration and a more politically unified Europe. Italian, Spanish and German officials have asserted in recent days that a weak euro was not necessarily bad because it helped promote exports and stimulate growth. ''The weak euro makes our enterprises very happy,'' said Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister.

Full text: Shaken by the relentless decline of Europe's unified currency, the euro, the European, American and Japanese central banks undertook a surprise rescue attempt today to fight what they called a threat to the world economy.
Their move, announced as financial ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations arrived here in advance of a meeting Saturday, was the first time in two years that central banks had staged a coordinated currency intervention -- and the first time ever that they had done so in support of a European currency.
The action also represented a shift by the United States Treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, who had consistently opposed calls for intervention and as recently as Thursday had reiterated support for a strong dollar. His comments were widely interpreted at the time as ruling out United States participation in any attempt to strengthen the euro against the dollar.
The banks bought billions of euros with dollars, yen and British pounds in the intervention, pushing the euro's value up to 90 cents from 85 cents. The euro later slipped back to settle at 87.87 cents.
The currency had fallen below 85 cents from its initial price of $1.18 in January 1999, a decline of almost 30 percent that disheartened euro supporters, who had seen the new currency as a symbol of their broader ambitions for European unity.
The intervention underlined fears that Europe faces a potential economic shock from the combination of a sinking common currency and soaring oil prices. Because oil is bought and sold in dollars, the recent rise in the price of oil has hurt European consumers much more than those in the United States.
This has heightened inflation pressure across Europe and could force the European Central Bank to raise interest rates enough to slow the European economy. Robust European growth, in turn, has helped extend the record-long American expansion, so any slowdown in Europe could directly hurt the United States.
Explaining United States participation in the currency action today, Mr. Summers cited risks to the global economy.
''The United States and Japan joined with the European Central Bank in concerted intervention in exchange markets because of their shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy,'' he said in a statement.
The European Central Bank released an almost identical statement to explain its action.
None of the central banks disclosed how much they spent to buy euros, but some currency market analysts speculated the total was as much as $10 billion.
The success of today's intervention will depend on whether the euro climbs further or resumes its decline, and that may not be clear for weeks or even months. But the banks as a group have much more money at their disposal to buy euros, and the action today raised the prospect they could swoop in again if they decide the euro is too weak.
''We didn't have a particular level in mind,'' said Otmar Issing, the European Central Bank's chief economist. ''That wasn't the goal.''
Moreover, the United States decision to come to the aid of the Europeans made the joint action far more likely to restore some luster to the tarnished euro, several traders and analysts said.
The United States so rarely seeks to interfere in currency markets that it carries considerable influence when it does. The global action also represents the first time that central banks of Japan, Canada and Britain joined the new European Central Bank in defending the euro, a vote of support as the European bank faces the toughest test of its short existence.
The move is risky for the Clinton administration. The strong dollar has been an important ingredient of the record-breaking United States economic expansion by helping keep imports relatively inexpensive and inflation low.
If today's market action were to help restore the euro to what many economists consider its value based on economic fundamentals, that would mean an increase of at least 15 percent, making a euro roughly equivalent to $1.
Any sharp decline in the dollar would raise the cost of imports in the United States, add to the already enormous trade deficit, and possibly force the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates faster or higher than it otherwise would.
One reason international financial officials had considered active American support for the euro unlikely is that the Clinton administration has generally avoided taking actions that might prove detrimental to Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign, which depends in part on the continued robustness of the American economy.
Speaking to reporters in Washington today, Mr. Summers sought to navigate an apparent contradiction between his oft-repeated stance in favor of a strong dollar and the decision to sell dollars and buy euros on the global market. He said there had been no change in policy.
''As I have said many times, a strong dollar is in the national interest of the United States,'' he said.
Currency market analysts generally viewed the intervention as a good thing.
C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute of International Economics in Washington, said he expected at least a modest rebound in the euro but did not foresee a serious threat to the dollar's long-term strength.
''To say that you want a stronger euro is not to say that you want a weak dollar,'' he said, noting the prolonged rise of the dollar versus the currencies of all of America's major trading partners.
The decline of the euro, which has been adopted by 11 European countries and will soon replace national currencies like the German mark and French franc, had political as well as economic repercussions.
Denmark is to hold a national referendum on adopting the euro on Thursday, and the currency's weakness has seriously eroded popular support. In Britain, which has not adopted the euro, opposition to possible future participation has intensified. Numerous European officials have said that the euro's weakness threatens to undermine the trend toward economic integration and a more politically unified Europe.
''It doesn't take a Ph.D. in political sciences to figure out that populist parties all across Europe will jump on the anti-euro bandwagon,'' said Joachim Fels, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. He said the euro project had become engulfed in a ''confidence crisis.''
The last time central banks cooperated to intervene in currency markets was in 1998, when the United States and Japan rescued the tumbling Japanese yen.
At the time, financial panic had spread around Asia, and American officials were worried that any further deterioration in the yen could force China to devalue its currency. That was seen as likely to set off a fresh round of turmoil across the region, where the International Monetary Fund had just committed about $100 billion in emergency financing to shore up South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.
The intervention worked. The yen regained about 30 percent against the dollar. Giant investment funds and banks that had been betting on a further deterioration of the Japanese currency were caught off guard, and many were forced to abandon their positions with heavy losses.
But the United States has not always had success influencing the price of the dollar.
In 1985, the United States, Japan and European banks agreed, in what became known as the Plaza Accord, to jointly intervene and reverse a sustained dollar surge. The dollar traded then at more than 3 German marks, a record.
The intervention pushed the dollar down -- but by far more than the authorities had anticipated. They subsequently sealed a second pact, known as the Louvre Accord, this time to buy dollars.
That intervention fell short of its goal, bankers said. It took many years, until the sharp rise in the United States economy in the mid-1990's, for the dollar to regain its footing fully.
In part because of that mixed record, Mr. Summers has often expressed a reluctance to intervene. His reputation was so well known that most currency traders and analysts had considered it highly unlikely that the United States would join any effort to strengthen the euro even if European nations and Japan tried to do so on their own.
The intervention also caught the market off guard because even European officials appeared almost hopelessly disunited about whether there was a need for intervention.
Italian, Spanish and German officials have asserted in recent days that a weak euro was not necessarily bad because it helped promote exports and stimulate growth. ''The weak euro makes our enterprises very happy,'' said Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister.
Yet the European Central Bank had clearly been trying to shore up the euro. The bank raised interest rates six times in the last year, moves the market interpreted as currency support by making bank deposits and other assets denominated in euros more valuable. And the bank last week bought a modest amount of euros with some of its own foreign exchange reserves.
None of those actions did much to support the currency, however, until today's joint intervention, which traders said had a profound effect for its sheer shock value.
''I am astonished,'' said Axel Siedenberg, head of economic research at Deutsche Bank. ''We always had the impression that there was no awareness of the problem on the other side of the Atlantic.''
The involvement of the United States won praise from numerous bankers, many of whom had gathered in Prague for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as well as Saturday's meeting of Group of 7 finance ministers.
''It is a very good thing, and it is good because it was a coordinated intervention,'' said Martin Kohlhaussen, president of Commerzbank of Germany. ''I hope it is enough to give the euro the necessary push that it needs.''
Banks Explain Their Reasons
Following is the text of the statement of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt as it announced the joint action with other central banks yesterday:
On the initiative of the European Central Bank, the monetary authorities of the United States and Japan joined with the European Central Bank in concerted intervention in exchange markets because of their shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro exchange rate for the world economy.

Chart ''A History of Market Interventions''
Since the Bretton-Woods agreement, which fixed foreign exchange rates, was dissolved in 1971, the world's leading economies have sometimes worked together to try and insure that no major currency becomes too weak or too strong. Usually this has meant intervening in foreign exchange markets as happened yesterday. Here are some of the more important interventions.
FEB. 1973 After the United States fails to act to stem panic from a rapid decline in value of the dollar and soaring gold prices, West Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland begin buying dollars.
NOV. 1978 United States creates a $30 billion fund to use to intervene in foreign exchange markets. It uses the fund to prop up the dollar, which has been weakened by rising oil prices, increasing inflation and a deteriorating United States balance of payments.
SEPT. 1985 The United States, Britain, France, West Germany and Japan agree to coordinate a series of interventions to weaken the dollar. The agreement is called the Plaza Accord after the Plaza Hotel in New York City, where the delegates meet.
FEB. 1987 The Louvre Accord. The members of the Plaza Accord and Italy agree to shore up the dollar, which has been weakened by the growing United States trade deficit.
1988-90 With the agreement of its industrialized partners, the United States intervenes to stem the growing strength of the dollar.
1991-92 Gulf War plunges United States into recession. U.S. and European central banks intervene repeatedly to prop up weakened dollar.
APRIL 1994-AUG. 1995 Dollar reaches post World War II lows against the mark and the yen. United States, Japan and European central banks intervene repeatedly.
APRIL-JUNE 1998 Japan, with United States assistance, steps in to help the sagging yen.
JAN. 1999-APRIL 2000 Concerned that its currency is too strong and could pose a threat to its nascent economic recovery, Japan, with the help of the United States and European central banks, tries unsuccessfully to weaken the yen.

Abstract: The euro, the most audacious gamble in the history of currency, has become a reality. What will this crucial step toward unity mean for Europe, the United States and the world? The Op-Ed page asked several experts in economics and observers of European culture to offer their insights. A more dynamic European economy would strengthen European demand for American goods and services and provide more attractive opportunities for American investors. Greater prosperity would enhance Europe's willingness to cooperate with the United States to further liberalize trade with emerging markets and to strengthen multilateral institutions to combat turbulence in global financial markets. More efficient European producers would mean tougher competition and hence better performance by American companies over time. But there are more serious risks. The euro's adoption makes it impossible for member nations to use currency adjustments as a way to offset inflation. The new European Central Bank will set a common monetary policy, but its effects will differ from country to country.

Full text: The euro, the most audacious gamble in the history of currency, has become a reality. What will this crucial step toward unity mean for Europe, the United States and the world? The Op-Ed page asked several experts in economics and observers of European culture to offer their insights.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the first Clinton Administration.
The euro is good news for the American economy if it fosters political stability and economic growth in Europe. But this benign outcome is by no means certain.
A more dynamic European economy would strengthen European demand for American goods and services and provide more attractive opportunities for American investors. Greater prosperity would enhance Europe's willingness to cooperate with the United States to further liberalize trade with emerging markets and to strengthen multilateral institutions to combat turbulence in global financial markets. More efficient European producers would mean tougher competition and hence better performance by American companies over time.
These gains would far outweigh the expected small rise in United States interest rates as the euro emerges as an alternative reserve currency to the dollar.
But there are more serious risks. The euro's adoption makes it impossible for member nations to use currency adjustments as a way to offset inflation. The new European Central Bank will set a common monetary policy, but its effects will differ from country to country.
Moreover, with a charter providing insulation from national political leaders and specifying inflation as its sole target, the bank has neither the mandate nor the inclination to stimulate growth or moderate cyclical downturns.
In short, the member countries have unilaterally disarmed themselves of important weapons to fight unemployment and recession. This is why many economists like myself remain skeptical about the euro's success while fervently hoping that such skepticism proves unwarranted.
Muriel Spark is the author, most recently, of ''Reality and Dreams,'' a novel. She lives in Italy.
In Italy, where I live, the people are remarkably indifferent to the advent of the euro. They don't really care about united Europe, but rather, cynically, sense a rip-off. It is true that any price changes here never take notice of fractions; they are always rounded up to the next zero.
Far more excited about the euro are the people of Britain, where I come from, even though they have not yet joined the system. They know that international trade will be affected but are waiting to see the extent.
Some years ago, in Chamonix, France, I was waiting in line to change my lire to francs at a bank. The currency prices of all European countries were visible on a big board, changing continually according to the central exchange to which it had a link-up. I got to talking to a man in the line. He said he spent the best part of his day buying and selling currencies from bank to bank.
I got so far as to ask him what his job was.
''Just this,'' he said, ''changing my money.''
I inquired if he made a good living. ''Excellent,'' he said, ''and you don't pay tax.''
I wonder what he will do for a living now?
Everyone is agreed that the euro will be a great convenience for the traveler in Europe. One always needs actual cash. But investment advisers are saying, ''Stick to dollars.''
The aim of the euro is to further unite Europe. I suppose it will. Europe has for the past 55 years been united for the first time, due to the nuclear deterrent. No commercial advantages, however, could unite different peoples so effectively as language, as in the case of the United States of America and Britain.
Robert B. Reich was Secretary of Labor in the first Clinton Administration.
Left-of-center politicians now lead every major Western nation, including most of Europe. So what? Real power is shifting to global businesses, which are merging at a record pace, and to central banks, rapidly consolidating their authority. The euro accelerates both trends.
Jurgen Stark, vice president of the Bundesbank, says the euro presents a ''great opportunity for Europe to combine sound monetary and fiscal policy with more flexibility.'' These are code words.
''Sound monetary policy'' means that the new European Central Bank (freed from democratic oversight) will fight inflation, not unemployment.
''Sound fiscal policy'' means that public spending, already slashed as the price of admission to the euro club, will stay that way.
''More flexibility'' means that a common currency will push employers to cut costs, especially payrolls.
Europeans are willing to go along because these sorts of policies appear to have paid off for the United States. President Clinton's 72 percent popularity rating, impeachment notwithstanding, exactly matches the record percentage of Americans who think our economy is good. It is no coincidence.
What Europeans don't know is that America's economic ebullience rests on a house of cards. It's not ''sound'' macroeconomics and a ''flexible'' labor market that have put us in such a good mood. It's a stock market that has soared into the stratosphere, combined with plummeting world commodity prices that have made oil and raw-material imports so cheap that even the Fed has briefly stopped battling inflation.
The Dow Jones could come back to earth with a thud when the frenzy abates. Our ballooning trade imbalance will pop at some point.
Meanwhile, we aren't saving a dime. And when the going gets rough again, we will notice that the gap between rich and poor has widened into a chasm, nobody has job security, and there is no safety net. Even in these frothy times, more of our children are impoverished than before the expansion started, and fewer Americans ever see a doctor.
The euro will surely make Europe more efficient, speeding capital to where it can get the highest return. But the real lesson from America is that people don't move nearly as fast as capital.
Left-of-center governments, here and abroad, used to provide a buffer between the two. Now, capital is running the show everywhere.
Michael Portillo is a former British Defense Minister.
European economic and monetary union isn't about economics, but politics: the steady shift of power away from nation-states to an emerging government of Europe. Americans should be concerned because what's likely to result is a Europe that's both less democratic and more anti-American.
At least since biblical times, when Christ held aloft a coin bearing the image of Caesar, it's been understood that whoever controls the currency holds political power. Europe cannot have a single currency and centralized monetary policy without merging all its economic decision-making, including control over government spending and taxation.
The choices that most affect citizens' lives -- the balance among interest rates, growth and unemployment -- will be made by the European Central Bank, which is completely unaccountable. Voters will elect national governments that have given up the power to govern.
European economic policy self-consciously represents an alternative to American laissez-faire. European governments spend and tax heavily, overregulate their labor markets and maintain excessively costly social programs.
Those policies have produced high unemployment, but the architects of the new Europe see them as a humane ''third way'' between old-style socialism and the supposed divisive social consequences of the American way. By creating a new economic bloc more populous than the United States, the European visionaries hope to protect European inefficiency and bureaucracy against attrition from global competition.
That's not all. Europe is planning to have its own defense and foreign policy too, decided by majority voting among the member states. The United States didn't need the latest Iraq crisis to tell it that a European policy based on consensus isn't going to be pro-American.
Martin Feldstein was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan Administration.
European monetary union is likely to put Europe on a path to higher inflation, reversing 20 years of progress. Before the start of the monetary union, good monetary policy in the major European countries reduced inflation to less than 2 percent because of the dominant leadership of Germany's independent and fiercely anti-inflationary central bank. With the euro, Germany's dominance will end and central-bank independence may be dead.
Even when other countries had double-digit inflation back in the 1980's, public sentiment in Germany supported the tough monetary policies needed to keep inflation low. Under the rules adopted then, other European countries had to follow Germany's lead or accept the destabilizing consequences and political embarrassment of currency devaluations.
But in the new order, the making of monetary policy and therefore the determination of inflation passes from individual national central banks to the new European Central Bank where each country has equal weight. Without the tough standard-setting by the German central bank, the process is likely to drift to higher inflation rates. Indeed, some non-German politicians favored monetary union as a way to end Germany's dominance of European monetary policy, in the mistaken hope that an easier monetary policy would have favorable long-term effects on employment and growth.
Leading European politicians are now also calling for political controls over monetary policy, a clear violation of the Maastricht treaty that established the union and an equally clear recipe for higher inflation. Although the new left-of-center Government in Germany supports this move, the higher inflation that results will be very unpopular in a country in which the majority of voters doubted the advisability of abandoning the German mark for the untried euro.
How Germany responds to the conflict caused by rising inflation will be a critical issue in Europe's political future.
Diane Johnson is the author, most recently, of ''Le Divorce,'' a novel. She lives in Paris.
You might suppose that the average European, faced on Jan. 1 with a disconcerting shift to the euro from his local franc or Deutschemark, would be filled with some emotion of elation, exasperation or dread. Just as we've been thinking in dollars since we were born, or in Swiss francs if we were farsighted, a Frenchman's familiar francs and centimes are very central to his consciousness -- plenty of people still think in old francs, the currency before the revaluation in 1960.
Europeans have been warned for some time that life is going to change, that soon enough now (mid-2002) their pockets will be filled with new, unfamiliar, bland-looking Monopoly money. They might be expected to resist this, but instead they seem to be ignoring it. With the Jan. 1 change-over affecting governments and banks, the private citizen, in Paris at least, is paying no attention whatever.
Yes, there's a little kiosk in the bank designed interactively to help you work out your euro situation. No one ever goes near it. Yes, some price tags are now expressed in the two currencies -- the euro price, symbolized by an enigmatic little double-crossed E, is tucked in small print under the ''real'' price.
But you ignore the euro price because it doesn't mean anything except, deceptively, if you've misread it and think for an instant that you are getting a bargain.
Who can convert centigrade to Fahrenheit? The conversion of francs to euros is not a friendly or easy one either: roughly 6.5 to 1. That is, you thought you had 6,500 francs, but now you only have 1,000 euros.
No one has ever seen a euro, and people have a couple of years before they have to start dealing with the new bills and coins; so they'll think about that problem tomorrow.
Remember the metric system in America, and how they gave people 10 years to get ready for it, optimistically putting up road signs in both miles and kilometers? As Americans did with centiliters, milligrams and meters, Europeans seem to be hoping the euro will just go away.
Some currencies, after all, don't make it. Whatever happened to the E.C.U.?
Franco Modigliani won the Nobel prize in economics in 1985 and is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The introduction of the euro is a crucial step in Europe's courageous march toward political union, which may end forever the deleterious nationalism that has ravaged the Continent for centuries.
Is the union going to last or will it be pulled apart by centrifugal forces? Legally, the treaty does not contemplate secession, but in the end durability will depend in large measure not on the legal binds but on economic performance.
Conventional wisdom holds that success will be measured by the extent to which the euro replaces the dollar as a reserve currency. This is a superficial and even dangerous view. The economic advantages of being a reserve currency are questionable; the danger is that pursuing prestige could result in escalating interest rates, which would prove very damaging for Europe.
The relevant test of economic performance will be the ability to cure the plague of unemployment, currently averaging 10 percent and higher in member countries. There is no developed country outside the euro group with unemployment close to two digits.
There are many causes, but the recent ''Economists' Manifesto on Unemployment in the European Union,'' supported by many leading economists, holds that much of the problem can be traced to misguided and inept economic policies, especially in the monetary area. These missteps resulted in a collapse of investment.
The prospects for improved policies, which had looked rather dismal, have taken a turn for the better with the election of new governments in France and Germany over the last year and a half. At the same time, the European Central Bank has arranged a concerted reduction in interest rates, with its president expressing the hope that the move might help ''stimulate investment.''
If these recent events are any sign of things to come, we can look with some new hope to a successful and lasting euro.

Abstract: Most investors are quick to dismiss the very notion of deflation, an economic environment defined by widespread declines in the prices of goods and services. Accustomed to the inflation of the last half-century or so, they expect ever higher prices for their cars, their homes and -- perhaps most importantly -- their stocks. They simply cannot imagine a world where most items they buy behave the way computers do now, getting cheaper year after year. Like many other people who discuss it, Mr. (Byron R.) Wien does not think deflation is likely to take hold. So why all the buzz? Because there are just enough signs of deflation -- like the flood of cheap steel into this country or the briefly negative yield on six-month Treasury bills in Japan -- to make people pause. Even Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has mentioned the subject, and his willingness to cut interest rates again last week suggests that he is more concerned about the economy contracting than about inflation. If the average prognosticator is wrong, and the American economy does slide into deflation, investors are likely to have a hard time adjusting. For all the turns of the business cycle, deflation has been essentially nonexistent in the United States since the 1930's, and few investors have spent much time considering the impact of even a mild decline in prices -- an average of just a percentage point or two a year.

Full text: DEFLATION? Don't be ridiculous.
Most investors are quick to dismiss the very notion of deflation, an economic environment defined by widespread declines in the prices of goods and services. Accustomed to the inflation of the last half-century or so, they expect ever higher prices for their cars, their homes and -- perhaps most importantly -- their stocks. They simply cannot imagine a world where most items they buy behave the way computers do now, getting cheaper year after year.
But the truth is that a lot of smart people are thinking about the possibility -- and not just the Cassandras of the stock market who insist that a crash is coming. After a period in which the United States economy could seemingly do no wrong, with inflation low and corporate profits percolating nicely, there is now talk among economists, money managers and strategists about the odds of deflation washing up on these shores.
''We went from the New Paradigm to deflation, from June to August,'' said Byron R. Wien, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Even with the recent rally in stocks, he said, ''the word 'deflation' is still on everybody's lips.''
Like many other people who discuss it, Mr. Wien does not think deflation is likely to take hold. So why all the buzz? Because there are just enough signs of deflation -- like the flood of cheap steel into this country or the briefly negative yield on six-month Treasury bills in Japan -- to make people pause. Even Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has mentioned the subject, and his willingness to cut interest rates again last week suggests that he is more concerned about the economy contracting than about inflation.
If the average prognosticator is wrong, and the American economy does slide into deflation, investors are likely to have a hard time adjusting. For all the turns of the business cycle, deflation has been essentially nonexistent in the United States since the 1930's, and few investors have spent much time considering the impact of even a mild decline in prices -- an average of just a percentage point or two a year.
Few money managers are old enough to have had firsthand experience with deflation. ''The problem is that nobody, with few exceptions, has ever seen a real deflationary environment,'' said Timothy Morris, the chief investment officer for the Bessemer Trust Company in New York. ''We are not sure what it means.''
Like inflation, deflation does not come in a single flavor. Economists are careful to distinguish, for example, between the deflation that wreaked havoc during the Great Depression and the more benign variety seen during the late 1800's.
The former type took a firm hold when demand fell everywhere, driving down prices and putting millions of people out of work. The latter coincided with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution in the United States: Prices fell because both production and productivity soared, and both workers and business could afford to keep demand strong. Some analysts see parallels between that period and today, given the advances occurring in technology.
But no one is sure. ''This could be the deflationary abyss that everyone is talking about,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment officer of Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis. Or, he said, ''this could be the deflationary boom.''
Already, portfolio managers are rethinking the kinds of stocks they own as they confront a changing environment: Many companies are finding that they cannot easily raise prices and are facing the deflationary effects of economic turmoil in regions like Southeast Asia.
The debate also provides a chance for investors to examine their own economic assumptions -- and those inherent in the choices made by their money managers.
There is no need to swoon. As noted by Richard B. Hoey, the chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation, investment mistakes tend to be made whenever people work with ''giant investment scenarios'' -- often in response to scattered current events that they extrapolate into overarching trends. Mr. Hoey remembers when people pontificated about triple-digit inflation in the early 1980's -- just as inflation was peaking.
Still, if something new is going on here, it makes sense to think about the implications.
Dangerous Deflation: 'Crash' Is the Word
What distinguishes the kind of deflation that destroys nearly everything in its path from the good deflation that marks a productive economy? Demand. As long as falling prices encourage people to keep buying in greater volumes, the overall economy can continue to hum along. When people stop buying, because they start losing their jobs or want to put off their purchases, deflation can spiral into depression.
Such potentially demand-destroying events are unfolding in countries like Indonesia. For now, the country is experiencing high inflation, because it devalued its currency, the rupiah. But Indonesia is awash in people who can no longer afford to consume -- unemployment is rising, with roughly a fifth of workers now unemployed -- and its economy is expected to contract by at least 15 percent this year. High rates of inflation like those in Indonesia, a result of higher prices for imports, can foreshadow deflation as countries sink into depression.
Japan also continues to wrestle with deflation. Wholesale prices have been flat or have fallen there for more than a year as the Government has struggled to re-ignite the economy. Last week, yet another recovery package was announced -- a plan to inject nearly $200 billion in tax cuts and Government spending into the economy.
The United States last saw devastating deflation during the Depression, when unemployment soared and many of those lucky enough to have jobs saw their wages fall faster than prices. But only the most alarmist thinkers paint a picture in which 1930's-style deflation would be unleashed on America today, when stocks and real estate are not nearly as overvalued as they were in the 1920's, the banking system is healthier and the Federal Reserve is likely to act more decisively.
''Monetary policy can prevent depressions,'' said Charles Calomiris, an economics and finance professor at Columbia University, ''and we have a Fed that is extremely attuned to those kinds of threats.''
One has to hope so. In a vicious deflation, assets like real estate and stocks go into free fall. Very little is spared, and the wreckage is magnified by the borrowing that companies and individuals undertook to buy those assets, as collateral collapses in value and margin calls on stocks mount.
''If it's ugly deflation, you'll want to get out of stocks,'' said David W. Tice, who runs his own money management firm in Dallas. He sees the United States facing sharp deflation -- a result of the popping of a credit-induced bubble -- that could wipe out about half the current value of the stock market, sending share prices to levels last seen in 1995. Among the biggest losers, he said, would be shares of credit-card companies and home-equity lenders, because people would be unable to pay their bills.
Investors seeking an escape from the carnage would have little recourse other than to squirrel away cash or invest in Treasury bonds. As the world witnessed earlier this year, when investors embrace quality, they hug Treasuries the hardest. ''This is an asset class that would go up in price -- and up substantially,'' said William H. Gross, a managing director at the Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif.
Other types of bonds, like corporates and municipals, would be riskier during steep deflation, Mr. Gross said. Though those, too, would benefit as interest rates fell, there would be more defaults as struggling companies or small municipalities could no longer make their interest payments. Less liquid than Treasuries, and without the backing of the Federal Government, these bonds might be shunned by investors.
Friendly Deflation: Time of Opportunity
Fortunately, bad deflation is less common than good, according to A. Gary Shilling, an economist and investment strategist in Springfield, N.J., who recently wrote a book on the subject, ''Deflation'' (Lakeview Publishing, 1998).
The United States has not seen benevolent deflation since the 1920's, when the country was roaring as automobiles became commonplace and many homes and factories received electrical service for the first time. But there are modern examples like Switzerland, where the stock market has posted average annual gains of 19 percent over the last five years despite a bout with falling prices prompted by the strength of the national currency.
This sort of deflation, like that seen during the Industrial Revolution, is marked by strong demand. Even when wages fall in such an environment, prices fall faster. From 1870 to 1894, for example, the real pay for nonfarm workers increased 29 percent, Mr. Shilling said, though in dollars not adjusted for deflation, pay fell 14 percent.
Like the rise of modern manufacturing in the last century, the technological gains of today show signs of bringing the kind of rapid increases in productivity that can lead to good deflation. Advances in computing, telecommunications, biotechnology and other fields have led to lower costs and improved productivity. And there are productivity gains in other sectors, too, Mr. Shilling said, pointing to the efficiencies of mass-market retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot. These companies have harnessed technology to cut prices -- thereby exerting pressure on competitors to lower their prices as well.
Like Mr. Shilling, Mr. Paulsen of Norwest describes a world where more and more products are like computers, steadily falling in price, and where every business is forced to compete in the way technology companies already do. Technology -- which Mr. Paulsen describes as this country's leading industry -- ''was birthed under and lives under massive deflation every year,'' he said.
Mr. Shilling said companies like Microsoft, Intel and Cisco Systems have learned to thrive by figuring out how to drive demand, making rapid improvements to their technology and developing new markets.
And just as companies were forced to innovate during the late 1800's, any innovator of today, like Pfizer in pharmaceuticals, would be likely to prosper in deflationary times, according to Mr. Gross of Pacific Investment Management. He says companies that dominate their industries, like Microsoft in computer operating systems, would also have an advantage.
Can Stocks Move Up If Other Prices Fall?
The effects on investors from even mild deflation are the subject of sharp disagreement. While strategists and economists agree that a sudden swing from today's low inflation rates to deflation -- a move of several percentage points -- would rattle everyone, they are divided over how painful any transition would be.
Many strategists believe that stocks would suffer as corporate profits weakened, at least initially, in a recession inspired by incipient deflation. Even now, Southeast Asia's economic collapse is hurting American companies that must compete with a flood of inexpensive imports.
But if the United States skirted a recession, stocks of corporations that were trimmed to fighting form by the restructuring of the last two decades might escape essentially unscathed.
''The companies in the U.S. have been training for deflation for almost 20 years,'' Mr. Paulsen said.
One thing looks certain in this picture: As interest rates make their way lower, Treasury bonds will be attractive. They may also benefit from investor uncertainty.
Jonathan H. Francis, the head of global strategy for Putnam Investments, said that if deflation became an issue, ''for better or worse there will be a reflexive move into fixed-income, until investors work through the calculus.''
Depending on the severity of the deflation, and how calmly investors reacted, other types of bonds might also be worth considering.
Anyone worried about taxes would think about owning high-quality municipal bonds. High-quality corporates would also benefit from lower interest rates.
But for stocks and relatively risky bonds, like high-yield and most corporate issues, there could be casualties even during relatively mild deflation. The pain would be most notable among companies that are used to being able to raise prices to cover their mistakes, like taking on too much debt or holding too much inventory. ''Inflation covers a multitude of sins,'' Mr. Shilling said.
Investors who want to prepare for deflation might want to avoid companies with high labor or capital costs -- which become more burdensome if there is pressure to reduce prices -- or companies that have loaded up on debt.
To protect profits in deflationary times, companies must either cut costs or generate more sales. The primary goal for the majority of businesses confronting deflation would be to gain market share, whether by wresting it away from competitors or by acquiring weaker companies. ''Top-line growth will be a huge issue,'' Mr. Paulsen said.
The high-stress environment of deflation could favor large companies, he added. Big companies have more leeway than small ones to reduce their costs, he said, because they can invest in technology to increase their productivity and can take better advantage of economies of scale. Small companies have fared better in times of inflation, he said.
Moreover, some pockets of the economy are likely to remain somewhat immune to deflation.
Investors who think deflation may be coming, whether devastating or benevolent, should focus on industries ''where demand is very stable and not terribly price-sensitive,'' said George W. Jacobsen Jr., chief investment officer at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen, a money management firm in New York.
He pointed to areas that investors have traditionally considered safe from economic upheaval, like certain food and entertainment businesses. Even so, he said, companies that depend on the strength of their brands to let them charge higher prices than the competition could be vulnerable. For example, the Kellogg Company is already seeing its profits hurt because rivals are luring away customers with lower-cost breakfast foods.
Other areas that might withstand deflation include utilities, though deregulation is making them face more competition; military suppliers, which build profits into their contracts with the Government, and small companies that concentrate on narrow niches where competition is limited, according to Diego Espinosa, a portfolio manager at Scudder Kemper Investments.
The outlook for real estate, which has traditionally been crushed by deflation, would be mixed if the United States fell into a mild deflation sometime soon. Prices for commercial real estate do not look as high now as in past economic upswings, according to managers and strategists. Shopping malls and hotels could be hurt if people felt more like saving their money than sprucing up their wardrobes or going on vacations, but rental apartments could be in greater demand if falling values made houses no longer look like good investments, Mr. Shilling said.
Economic History Isn't Always a Guide
Mild deflationary breezes, at least, are already wafting across the American economy, and some portfolio managers have their fingers to the wind. At Bessemer Trust, for example, managers have shifted money toward companies whose main market is the United States, because they believe that consumers here will keep buying no matter what. They have trimmed holdings in companies that sell many goods or services in Southeast Asia, where the drought in demand is likely to drag on.
Money managers have also distinguished between companies that benefit from cheaper raw materials, like apparel makers, and those, including oil companies and steel makers, that continue to be hurt by a fall in commodity prices and could be damaged further by a potential rush of imports from foreign producers. And despite another interest-rate cut last week, intended to loosen credit and keep the economy jumping, some professional investors are pondering the prospect of an economic slowdown, whether prompted by deflation or by increases in labor costs.
But a lot of thinking -- including the thinking about just how serious a threat deflation is -- remains to be done. The past, of course, is not necessarily prologue: What was seen in the United States more than a century ago -- or in Japan or Switzerland today -- may bear very little resemblance to what happens here in the future. Confronting the unknown, acknowledged Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley, money managers ''really don't know what to buy.''
Chart ''Doomsday Scenarios''
A growing chorus of economists and market strategists warns that deflation poses the biggest threat to Americans' prosperity. But deflation scenarios differ in their likely significance for investors. Here are three:
DEVASTATING DEFLATION
This kind of deflation, reminiscent of the Great Depression, is marked by prices that fall because there is too little demand from consumers and companies. There are precious few places for investors to hide.
Stocks
No winners here, as stocks of nearly every description become mired in the deflationary morass. The outlook remains grim until the economy can be re-started.
Bonds
Treasury bonds are big winners as interest rates fall and investors rush to quality. Investors in high tax brackets can also consider the highest quality municipal bonds, although they may be very volatile.
Other investments
Only the safest investments can withstand the downward spiral. Cash looks mighty attractive since a dollar buys more tomorrow than it does today. But real estate is a losing proposition.
DEFLATIONARY BOOM
This is the kind of deflation experienced by the United States during the Industrial Revolution. As the accompanying charts show, the manufacturing economy expanded dramatically while prices fell steeply. Consumers and businesses kept buying, so the economy grew. Some analysts say technology industries are already in such a phrase.
Stocks
Stocks manage nice gains, although the environment becomes riskier for also-rans. The companies that prosper are likely to be those that push innovation and can benefit from improved productivity. Again, think technoology.
Bonds
Bonds generally do well, and investors may be able to widen their horizons to include high-quality corporate and municipal bonds.
Other investments
Real estate prices will decline somewhat, but there should be no debacle.
LIVING WITH DEFLATION
Even mild deflation can create havoc as companies, consumers and investors adapt to new expectations. But if the economy is managed well through the transition, the adjustment need not be too painful.
Stocks
Companies that can increase revenues by developing new markets or taking business away from competitors can do well. Look for low-cost producers or companies in industries that tend not to feel much pricing pressure. Stay away from companies with high costs and lots of debt.
Bonds
Once interest rates have fallen, bonds should remain attractive, but limiting risk still makes sense.
Other investments
The outlook for real estate is mixed: While today's valuations do not seem too high, owners who have borrowed excessively may be in trouble, and any weakening of demand will immediately hurt prices. REED ABELSON (pg. 9)
Chart ''Investing in Deflationary Times''
A. Gary Shilling, an economist who has studied deflation, says it is becoming the essential characteristic of the global economy. In the United States, which has experienced a half- century of inflation, a deflationary economy would initially cause stock prices to tumble, he says, and then create new winners and losers among investments.

Abstract: It was only months ago that economists had difficulty seeing any credible threats to an expansion that began in 1991 and begat a stock market that recognized no ceiling. So heady was the ride that economists and fiscal policy makers from Alan Greenspan down were pondering whether the United States had entered a golden era -- one in which business investments in technology were driving a resurgence in productivity and gains in productivity were making strong growth and low unemployment possible without inflation. Well, inflation is still dormant, and the unemployment rate, while inching up, is still near a quarter-century low. But growth is suddenly looking fragile, so much so that economists began talking seriously last week about whether a recession was in the cards for the United States. But even if the outlook has changed abruptly for the worse, there is still something undeniably new and uncharted in this economy. After all, most periods of economic expansion end when the Federal Reserve is forced to raise interest rates to squelch inflation. But this expansion is at risk because of an altogether more elusive phenomenon: rapidly changing investor psychology.

Full text: SO, whatever happened to the new economy?
It was only months ago that economists had difficulty seeing any credible threats to an expansion that began in 1991 and begat a stock market that recognized no ceiling. So heady was the ride that economists and fiscal policy makers from Alan Greenspan down were pondering whether the United States had entered a golden era -- one in which business investments in technology were driving a resurgence in productivity and gains in productivity were making strong growth and low unemployment possible without inflation.
Well, inflation is still dormant, and the unemployment rate, while inching up, is still near a quarter-century low. But growth is suddenly looking fragile, so much so that economists began talking seriously last week about whether a recession was in the cards for the United States.
But even if the outlook has changed abruptly for the worse, there is still something undeniably new and uncharted in this economy. After all, most periods of economic expansion end when the Federal Reserve is forced to raise interest rates to squelch inflation. But this expansion is at risk because of an altogether more elusive phenomenon: rapidly changing investor psychology.
WHAT Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, labeled ''irrational exuberance'' less than two years ago has given way to fear and pessimism of equally dubious rationality.
''I had argued, in fact quite extensively over the last two or three years, that the markets were becoming too complacent about risk,'' Mr. Greenspan said last week.
''Well, that has changed,'' he said to a wave of laughter from his audience of economists. ''If there was a dime to turn on, it did. And it has been a fairly dramatic, broad and as yet seemingly incomplete adjustment.''
The effects have been well documented. Since Russia in effect defaulted on its debt in mid-August, investors have been diving for the foxholes. Money has been pouring into United States Treasury securities, and credit has become more expensive and difficult to get, not just for developing nations but for corporate borrowers as well.
The squeeze has hardly stopped the economy dead in its tracks. The United States also continues to benefit from what Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson in Chicago, called a ''tremendous productivity performance'' that is providing ''a good foundation'' for an eventual rebound.
Still, a true credit crunch would quickly spill over into the real economy, which is why Mr. Greenspan is clearly so concerned. Should investors and lenders become even more nervous, the problem could force businesses to cut back their plans for expansion and modernization, undercutting a primary force behind the economy's strength.
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan is worried that the downturn in the stock market could scare consumers into cutting back on spending. And if both consumers and businesses feel compelled to retrench, the economy could lose steam quickly.
What the economy faces is, as much as anything, a crisis of confidence.
PSYCHOLOGY -- in the markets, among consumers, in politics -- is a perilous subject for economists and policy makers. It lacks any certain predictability, and there is no model or playbook for dealing with it.
Indeed, William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs, says the most obvious tool available to policy makers -- cuts in interest rates -- may not be of much help at this point. The sectors of the economy that are sensitive to interest rates, particularly housing, are already robust. And the rates that are set by the markets already reflect expectations of further rate cuts by the Fed, and so are unlikely to fall much more from their already low levels.
''This is the most bizarre business cycle we've ever had,'' Mr. Dudley said. ''The Fed doesn't have a good template for this.''
And the Clinton Administration has, in effect, taken fiscal policy off the table as a means of stimulating the economy. President Clinton's demand that the Federal budget surplus be left untouched until Social Security's financing problems are addressed succeeded in stymieing Republican plans for a big tax cut this year. But it also forced fiscal policy to remain contractionary at a time when the economy appears to be slowing.
Mr. Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin have been heaped with praise over the last few years for their steady economic stewardship. Their credibility with the financial markets is unmatched, and they have proved deft at balancing political and policy pressures from at home and abroad to keep the American economy on an even keel.
But both are probably approaching the final chapters in their careers in public service. Their legacies are likely to rest not only on how they handled the good times the country enjoyed for most of this decade, but also on their success in using their clout and credibility to keep the current expansion going. And given the nature of the threat, that may prove a daunting task even for the likes of them.

The nation's monthly trade deficit surged to $13 billion in March, the deepest since the Commerce Department adopted its current measurement system in 1992 and considerably more than economists had expected. The deficit in February was $12.2 billion. The new figures provided clear evidence of the impact on the United States -- both good and bad -- of Asia's mounting economic woes. Growth in the American economy, which had been threatening to overheat, was restrained. But at the same time, United States exports remained weak, hurting many manufacturers and farmers, and imports surged, a trend that does not bode well for the long term.

INTEREST RATESNo Increase, for Now
The Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Market Committee declined once again to increase short-term interest rates, apparently viewing the threat of inflation as remote and believing that any American rate increase could worsen the economic situation in Asia. Underlying the benign view of inflation are a number of recent indicators, including a 2.3 percent decline in new housing starts last month, to an annual rate of 1.538 million units. Many analysts had expected a small gain. Minutes of the Fed's March 31 meeting show that it saw a risk of inflation but decided to hold rates steady because of Asia's malaise.

MARKETSCommodity Index Skids
The Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities skidded to its lowest level in more than four years, dropping to 219.27 on Tuesday and ending the week at 219.18. Futures prices for copper, silver, oil, nickel, wheat and other commodities have been in a long-term decline that has been aggravated in recent days by Indonesia's political turmoil and -- see a pattern here? -- the Asian economic collapse. Stock and bond markets were little changed for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 9,144.44, up 48.44. But technology stocks were battered, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 41.77, to close at 1,805, its weakest level in more than six weeks.

TOBACCOA Pipe Dream?
Anti-smoking legislation hit a potentially serious snag in the Senate, and further action was postponed until next month, sending President Clinton; Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other Senate leaders who want to deter teen-agers' smoking back to the drafting table. Just as it appeared a consensus was forming to increase the Federal tax on cigarettes by $1.10 a pack while giving tobacco companies some protection against lawsuits, an unusual coalition of senators formed. Some want to kill the legislation, while others advocate the toughest possible anti-smoking measure. ''We are making a deal with the Devil,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who opposes any limit on the companies' legal liability.

SOCIAL SECURITYA Market-Based Proposal
The National Commission on Retirement Policy, which includes members of Congress from both parties, proposed a sweeping overhaul of the Social Security system, calling for the establishment of personal investment accounts and a gradual increase in the retirement age, to 70, to make up for a cash shortfall expected when 77 million baby boomers become eligible for Social Security benefits. ''The goal of this is to have people more involved in their own savings,'' said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, a leader of the group, which includes lawmakers, economists, pension-system experts and business executives. The report says the changes would keep Social Security solvent for at least 75 years without raising taxes. Some liberals, however, oppose any plan that does not offer guaranteed benefits.

DEALSA Merger Epidemic
What would once have been a big deal seems today to be business as usual. Seagram, accelerating its shift from beverages and spirits into an entertainment powerhouse, agreed to buy Polygram, one of the world's largest music companies, for $10.6 billion in cash and stock; to raise money for the acquisition, Seagram is shedding its Tropicana juice business. . . . Pearson, Britain's largest publisher, and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, a Dallas investment firm, agreed to buy most of Simon & Schuster's operations from Viacom for $4.6 billion in cash. . . . Office Depot said it would acquire Viking Office Products in a $3 billion stock swap. . . . Dillard's said it would acquire Mercantile Stores, a Midwest retailer, for $2.9 billion in cash. . . . Fortis, a Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group, agreed to acquire Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest, for $11.1 billion. . . . Francois Pinault, the French investor who bought 29.1 percent of Christie's earlier this month, said he would buy the rest in a deal that values the international auction house at $1.2 billion. . . . Royal Ahold extended its reach into the American supermarket business with a $2.6 billion deal for Giant Food Inc.

VIAGRAWorldwide Demand
Viagra, intended to help impotent men, has yet to pass clinical tests in Taiwan, but it is already selling for $59 on the black market there. In Taipei, a nurse displayed a bag of the medication. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration reported on Friday that Pfizer Inc. had said that six patients taking the drug had died, although it was unknown if Viagra played any role in the deaths. A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said the agency was investigating but continued to believe the drug was safe and effective and had asked Pfizer to provide more information to patients on the proper use of the drug. Pfizer's stock fell $3.69, to $105.44.

Abstract: Expectations of lower inflation lifted stocks yesterday for a third consecutive session, propelling the Standard & Poor's 500 index to a new closing high. The market's exuberance was fueled by comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who told the Senate Budget Committee that slower United States economic growth as a result of the financial crisis in Asia would have a positive effect, helping to ward off inflation. His words were also taken as a sign that interest rates would not be increased anytime soon. In addition, oil, gas and other energy stocks were broadly higher as expectations of a United States military attack on Iraq raised oil prices and dampened expectations of excessive supply.

Full text: Expectations of lower inflation lifted stocks yesterday for a third consecutive session, propelling the Standard & Poor's 500 index to a new closing high.
The market's exuberance was fueled by comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who told the Senate Budget Committee that slower United States economic growth as a result of the financial crisis in Asia would have a positive effect, helping to ward off inflation. His words were also taken as a sign that interest rates would not be increased anytime soon.
His comments lifted the bond market and reversed an early selloff caused by concern about earnings.
The rally in stocks was helped by gains among technology and telecommunications shares and by cyclical stocks, which tend to benefit from low interest rates. Makers of consumer staples benefited, too.
In addition, oil, gas and other energy stocks were broadly higher as expectations of a United States military attack on Iraq raised oil prices and dampened expectations of excessive supply.
Mr. Greenspan's comments followed strong earnings reports earlier this week from a number of companies, including Disney, Coca-Cola and United Airlines.
''This is a feel-better rally,'' said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
''Investors had time to sort through the month of January, earnings are better and the Far East isn't getting any worse. And Greenspan sounded reassuring that growth was still solid without any problems with inflation.''
The S.& P. 500 closed at 985.49, up 8.03 points, just eclipsing its previous closing high of 983.79 on Dec. 5. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 57.55 points, to 7,973.02. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite jumped 8.67 points, to 1,619.49.
While investors took heart from the recent flow of positive earnings reports, in reality, corporate earnings are in line with expectations, said Chuck Hill, director of research at the First Call Corporation.
So far 308 companies in the S.& P. 500, or about 62 percent, have reported their most recent quarter's results. Of those, 50 percent have come in above analysts' expectations, 23 percent have been in line with forecasts and 27 percent have been below estimates. Those figures are in line with quarterly averages going back to 1994 and suggest that on average fourth-quarter earnings will be about 2.2 percent above expectations over all, which is in line with previous years, he said.
In fact, Mr. Hill said that companies' reports were being compared with expectations that analysts had earlier reduced. He added that analysts were cutting their forecasts for the first quarter.
And while the S.& P. reached a new high yesterday, the Dow has failed to maintain a break through 8,000, a ceiling it has been struggling with since its record high of 8,259.31 on Aug. 6. The last time the Dow closed above 8,000 was Dec. 9.
''I don't like to see the averages get out of gear,'' said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''I'd like to see if the Dow can catch up. It's a little bit of a divergence, but I don't think it's a major problem now.''
The S.& P. was able to reach a new high because it has a high concentration of companies that make consumer staples, pharmaceuticals and beverages. These are attractive when investors fear slower earnings growth and greater market volatility over all, as was the case as the year began, Mr. McCabe said.
The stock of the Keebler Foods Company, the cookie and cracker company, gained 2 13/16, to 26 13/16, on its first day of trading. The company sold 11.6 million shares at $24 in its initial public offering.

Abstract: Case 2: Asia's economic woes continue. Manufacturers in countries like Thailand and South Korea flood the market with goods made cheap by their devalued currencies. Jolted by competition from abroad, United States manufacturers cut prices. Financial markets tumble, and the economy grinds to a halt. Soon the big threat is from a decline in the general price level -- deflation -- a phenomenon the United States has not experienced since the 1930's. What's a Federal Reserve chairman to do? Faced with such divergent possibilities, Alan Greenspan, who has led the Fed for more than 10 years, has chosen to sit tight for now, keeping interest rates steady through the turmoil of the last several months. And while Mr. Greenspan generally has been extremely vigilant about the possibility of inflation, lately he has been talking more about the possibility of deflation.

Full text: Case 1: The economy continues to expand briskly this year. The unemployment rate remains low, and employers have to raise wages to attract the workers they need to keep up with demand. To maintain profit margins, companies start pushing prices higher, and before long inflation again becomes a threat to destabilize a business expansion that is nearly seven years old.
Case 2: Asia's economic woes continue. Manufacturers in countries like Thailand and South Korea flood the market with goods made cheap by their devalued currencies. Jolted by competition from abroad, United States manufacturers cut prices. Financial markets tumble, and the economy grinds to a halt. Soon the big threat is from a decline in the general price level -- deflation -- a phenomenon the United States has not experienced since the 1930's.
What's a Federal Reserve chairman to do? Faced with such divergent possibilities, Alan Greenspan, who has led the Fed for more than 10 years, has chosen to sit tight for now, keeping interest rates steady through the turmoil of the last several months. And while Mr. Greenspan generally has been extremely vigilant about the possibility of inflation, lately he has been talking more about the possibility of deflation.
The complexity of the situation has made predicting Fed policy even more treacherous than usual. Economists are increasingly divided over whether the next move in interest rates should be up, to choke off inflation, or down, to head off a slowdown in growth and avert any risk of deflation.
''Expect Fed thinking to evolve further in coming months,'' said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, who has been sounding an alarm about deflation. ''If U.S. growth slows in early 1998 and further signs of deflation emerge, as we expect, we believe that the Fed will eventually decide to ease monetary policy.''
But others think Asia's problems will not dampen economic activity here enough to eliminate the inflation threat.
''The U.S. economy has significant momentum, and its labor markets are very tight,'' Goldman, Sachs & Company told its clients in a recent report. ''Thus, both short- and long-term rates still appear poised to head higher, even though the magnitude of the rise in 1998 is likely to be more muted than we previously had anticipated.''
Mr. Greenspan proved willing in 1997 to keep the Fed on the sidelines -- its only change in interest rates came in March, a quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate -- despite a sharp drop in unemployment and robust economic growth rates. Indeed, Mr. Greenspan all but repudiated the traditional framework economists use to judge the risks of inflation, acknowledging the argument that the economy is changing so rapidly that policy makers can no longer rely on some of the old rules.
The Fed's new pragmatic approach is likely to be on full display this year. Mr. Greenspan continues to dominate policy-setting sessions and has been challenged only occasionally by the hard-line inflation fighters within the Fed system.
Even those who continue to believe that low unemployment combined with strong growth will inexorably lead to inflationary pressures -- Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, is foremost among them -- have been content to wait for more early warning signs of inflation. And pressure from outside the Fed not to raise rates has grown steadily, with politicians, manufacturers and many economists saying the central bank should give the economy freer rein to grow.

Full text: STOCKSThe stock market roared once again in 1997 - the third consecutive year of blockbuster gains - despite fears that the rapidly spreading turmoil in Asia would kill the great bull market of the 1990's.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 23 percent, ending the year at 7,908.25 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose even more. The Nasdaq composite index, with a concentration of technology stocks and smaller issues, rose nearly 22 percent, to 1,570.35 points.
Analyst said that despite jitters about higher inflation, shrinking profit margins and a looming economic and currency crisis in Southeast Asia, investors continued to funnel money into the stock market in the belief that the American economy was nicely balanced, with little inflation. It wasn't just the United States that saw big gains. Except for Asia, many parts of the world register stellar increases, particularly in Europe.BONDS
Bonds got off to a shaky start in 1997 but made a comeback as a healthy demand arose for United States Treasuries.

In a brief stumble, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rose as high as 7.17 percent after the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates in late March to try to stave off inflationary threats. But even thought the economy revved and labor shortages crept up, the inflation threat never materialized, and that helped drop the yield on the 30-year bond below 6 percent in December for the first time since early 1996.
The rally was aided by a ''flight to quality'' as investors, concerned that the crisis in Asia would spread to other parts of the globe, parked their money in Treasuries. If an investor had bought a 30-year Treasury at the beginning of the year, by Dec. 31 the return, including price appreciation and interest, would have been more than 14 percent.THE DOLLAR
The dollar rose sharply against mot currencies last year, though the ascent was not without interruptions. The United States and its allies tried to put the brakes on the dollar early in February, as Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin switched from supporting a strong dollar to saying the dollar was strong enough.

At the time, however, Mr. Rubin and his counterparts from Europe, Canada and Japan also acknowledged that exchange rates are determined by economic fundamentals. Those factors continued to favor the dollar through the end of the year as foreign investors were attracted to the United States stock and bond markets as Asian economies tumbled.
So while the dollar dipped agains the Japanese yen in May, it rallied smartly afterward, touching five-and-a-half-year highs last month amid the financial turmoil in Asia. Agains the German mark, the dollar rose nearly 17 percent for the year.GOLD
United States Treasuries and dollars seemed to replace gold as the world's safest haven for nervous investors in 1997, partly because the world's central banks have been threatening to dump their gold reserves.

Gold has also lost osme of its luster as a hedge against price increases, particularly with inflation - at least in the United States - apparently dead, or at least in deep hibernation.
The price of gold, which had soared as high as $850 an ounce in the 1980's, fell below $300 an ounce last autumn for the first time since 1985.
The loss of gold's appeal as an inflation hedge reflects a greater faith in the ability of central banks to keep prices under control. That makes paper assets like bonds more attractive.
And gold, once considered the safest investment, continues to sink; some analysts think it could go as low as $250 an ounce in 1998.

Dollar Up Against the Mark, But It Falters in Yen Trading

Abstract: The dollar turned in a mixed performance yesterday, helped by a rebounding United States stock market and hurt by a sharp widening in the American trade deficit. The Government reported that the United States trade deficit widened to $10.4 billion in August, a bigger gap than expected. But while the flow of dollars out of the United States to buy foreign goods held down the dollar, rising stocks made dollars attractive to international investors. The Dow Jones industrial average, up 74 points on Monday, added 139 yesterday to regain the ground lost at the end of last week.

Full text: The dollar turned in a mixed performance yesterday, helped by a rebounding United States stock market and hurt by a sharp widening in the American trade deficit.
The announcement of an economic recovery plan for Japan and a reduced outlook for higher interest rates in Germany also created cross-currents for currency traders.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7896 German marks, up from 1.7725 on Monday. But the dollar slipped to 120.82 Japanese yen from 121.16. The British pound also rose against the dollar, climbing to $1.6353 from $1.6340.
The Government reported that the United States trade deficit widened to $10.4 billion in August, a bigger gap than expected. But while the flow of dollars out of the United States to buy foreign goods held down the dollar, rising stocks made dollars attractive to international investors.

The dollar was also helped by a slowdown of the growth in Germany's money supply in September. The currency markets took this to mean that the German central bank, under an anti-inflation policy of holding down growth of the money supply, would be less inclined to raise its interest rates again.
The dollar rose after the release of these data despite another report, from Germany's Ifo economic institute, that business confidence rose by more than expected in September. That report would appear to bolster the view that further increases in rates, which could support the mark against the dollar, might be needed.
The dollar fell against the yen after Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party presented proposals aimed at lifting Japan's flagging economy. Though the plan did not lay out any specific measures for fiscal stimulus, it did emphasize deregulating the economy and reforming taxes. A bigger factor in the yen's gain may have been the rise in the United States trade deficit, however.
Claude LaMedica, foreign exchange trader at Republic National Bank in New York, said that he expected the dollar to rise against the yen over time in reaction to severe economic problems across the developing economies of the Far East.

Abstract: IN testimony before Congress two weeks ago, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, discussed his worries about the danger of wage inflation. Specifically, Mr. Greenspan is concerned that shortages of qualified people for job openings may lead to excessive wage offers to fill those jobs. Some people take this uneasiness to suggest that a rise in interest rates may be in the offing -- if not at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting starting on Tuesday, then sometime later this year. While German economists like myself are supposedly born with a penchant to worry themselves sick about even the slightest signs of inflation, I cannot quite share Mr. Greenspan's concerns. From my perspective, the most important dimension in evaluating future wage pressures in the United States is regularly overlooked: the increased global outsourcing of services like data processing and computer programming. Computers let American companies tap into a labor pool without national borders -- thus shattering old-school assumptions about tightness in domestic labor markets. If the labor market becomes tight at home, a company can look abroad. In this sense, the United States is again the trailblazer. In the 1970's, big American manufacturers scoured the world to find cheap sources of offshore labor to control production costs. Undoubtedly, the decision to move production abroad not only helped American companies' bottom lines, it was also a crucial factor in keeping the nation's inflation rate in check. Other nations, like Germany and Japan, jumped on the bandwagon only much later.

Full text: AuthorAffiliation Norbert Walter is the chief economist of Deutsche Bank.
IN testimony before Congress two weeks ago, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, discussed his worries about the danger of wage inflation. Specifically, Mr. Greenspan is concerned that shortages of qualified people for job openings may lead to excessive wage offers to fill those jobs. Some people take this uneasiness to suggest that a rise in interest rates may be in the offing -- if not at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting starting on Tuesday, then sometime later this year.
While German economists like myself are supposedly born with a penchant to worry themselves sick about even the slightest signs of inflation, I cannot quite share Mr. Greenspan's concerns. From my perspective, the most important dimension in evaluating future wage pressures in the United States is regularly overlooked: the increased global outsourcing of services like data processing and computer programming. Computers let American companies tap into a labor pool without national borders -- thus shattering old-school assumptions about tightness in domestic labor markets. If the labor market becomes tight at home, a company can look abroad.
In this sense, the United States is again the trailblazer. In the 1970's, big American manufacturers scoured the world to find cheap sources of offshore labor to control production costs. Undoubtedly, the decision to move production abroad not only helped American companies' bottom lines, it was also a crucial factor in keeping the nation's inflation rate in check. Other nations, like Germany and Japan, jumped on the bandwagon only much later.
United States companies are now repeating this process in the services sector. The global services labor pool, after all, is just a phone call or an E-mail message away. Accordingly, credit card providers, insurance firms, phone companies and technology service concerns are placing crucial business functions all over the world. Even important value-added skills, like software design, are being moved offshore.
This ability to tap into the global labor pool without headaches may well be a special advantage for American corporations. Because English is the second, if not first, language of many people, American companies can readily depend on service providers who speak the same language as headquarters does. Compare that with the problems of, say, a German or Japanese insurance company trying to start a billing department in Barbados or Sri Lanka.
While the effect of global telecommunications and computer networks is increasingly understood, little thought has been given to what it means for the labor-shortage debate in the United States -- specifically, whether inflationary pressures will result.
If the United States economy is supposed to grow faster, signs of inflation from a tight labor market would not be welcome because they would probably lead to higher interest rates. Economists typically refer at this point to a concept called Nairu -- the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or the lowest level of unemployment the economy can sustain without setting off inflationary pressures. But we have seen little to no inflation even though the American unemployment rate has fallen below 5.5 percent -- generally seen now as the point at which the labor market supposedly becomes tight enough to become inflationary. Basically, policy makers and analysts have tried to cope with their failure to capture the correlation between unemployment and inflation by lowering the Nairu.
In my view, though, the issue ought to be cast in somewhat starker terms. I wonder whether, instead of fidgeting with numbers, it would not be more appropriate to assume that the Nairu concept may have been destroyed by the creation of global labor pools -- like the one in India generated by Jawaharlal Nehru himself, who, as India's first Prime Minister and a determined modernizer of Indian society, created a work force that is solving many of America's Nairu-related worries from afar.
Such skill pools around the world demonstrate the limitations of any economic model, like Nairu, that does not look beyond national borders. After all, for Nairu to remain a meaningful economic concept, the labor pool must be rather clearly defined on a national, or at least regional, basis. The globalization of services throws this requirement overboard. As a result, it is hard to draw reliable conclusions about slight pickups in wage levels in regions of the United States.
Labor supply is much more elastic today than in the past -- and not only because of old-fashioned (and much debated) immigration. These new forms of ''labor sharing'' provide great flexibility. This not only benefits American companies in their focus on the bottom line, but it also helps the American economy as a whole -- with its overblown inflation worries. And it helps other parts of the world to link into a better division of labor.

Fixing the Falling Greenback

Abstract: A. I think the Fed should raise interest rates after they make a commitment to gradually reduce inflation in the U.S. I'm talking about a recommitment on the part of the Fed to get inflation down so low that it won't make a difference. If holders of savings believe that the central bank is truly committed to lowering inflation, they don't need as much of an interest rate inducement to make them lend their money. Here's what I'd recommend Chairman Greenspan and the committee do. We know that inflation is going to be rising through 1995. The Fed needs to make a commitment that 1996's inflation rate will not be higher than 1995's, and that 1997's inflation rate will be lower than 1995's. This will help us get back on course to gradual disinflation. I have never been one to argue for dramatic reduction in inflation rates. I've always argued for gradualism. It's not likely that Japan's discount rate move from 1.75 to 1.0 percent will be followed by a big enough drop in interest rates to do the job. If all the interest rates, including the postal savings rate, moved down a full 100 basis points, it would be a very good first step. What's really needed is a follow-up move, which ideally should be a coordinated move between the U.S. and Japan. I'm not sure, but they might need to take the discount rate on down to zero. If the U.S. and Japan both altered rates in opposite directions at the same time, it would make currency markets believe that the two countries are serious.

Full text: "YET another postwar low." Even casual followers of finance know this phrase refers to the dollar's continuing fall against the yen. But last Monday's new low was startling even in these days. For a few hours, the dollar hit 80.15 yen -- it was 99.58 in December -- with the one-day fall at one point exceeding 4 percent. The dizzy drop led to sniping among the superpowers. Here are the opinions of Wayne D. Angell, the chief economist at Bear, Stearns and a former Federal Reserve governor. SYLVIA NASAR
Q. Why has the dollar been so weak?
A. The dollar can only weaken against gold, other currencies and commodities when the Fed creates more dollar reserves than the world wishes to hold. The Fed does that if it guesses too low about where the Fed funds rate should be. Then, it is forced to buy T-bills, creating more dollar reserves.
Q. So you see the dollar's weakness as a sign the Fed has been too easy?
A. The strong yen is due 60 percent to overly restrictive monetary policy in Japan and 40 percent to overly accommodative policy in the United States.
It's really kind of sad hearing Treasury Secretary Rubin say that a strong dollar is in the national interest and see him be so unsuccessful.
Q. You don't think that the weak dollar causes inflation, but rather that it is an indication of too much monetary ease. Does a weak dollar pose any danger in and of itself?
A. The danger of continued dollar weakness is that it's a beggar-thy-neighbor policy. It means all major industrial plants get located in the United States as the rate of return on capital in the United States goes up and the rate of return on capital in Europe and Japan goes down.
Q. Has the dollar hit bottom?
A. We don't know that for sure. It did look like something close to a blowout when the dollar got down to only 80 yen in the hours before trading began Monday morning in Tokyo. But it's still a question whether there can be much firming without any action by the Bank of Japan or the Federal Reserve.
Q. Do you expect the Fed to raise rates if the dollar continues to slip?
A. The Fed doesn't want to lose its independence in monetary policy by saying that it is acting primarily on the exchange rate. But the exchange rate is a lot more important to the Fed than they want it to appear.
Q. So you're saying that the Fed should push up rates even though it has raised rates seven times in the past 14 months and even though inflation seems low and the economy is growing more slowly?
A. I think the Fed should raise interest rates after they make a commitment to gradually reduce inflation in the U.S. I'm talking about a recommitment on the part of the Fed to get inflation down so low that it won't make a difference. If holders of savings believe that the central bank is truly committed to lowering inflation, they don't need as much of an interest rate inducement to make them lend their money.
By and large, from 1988 to 1991, the public utterances of individual members of the Fed and statements by the chairman emphasized that commitment. As a result, we ended up two years later with an inflation rate of 2.3 percent, down from 5.5 percent. And the price of gold fell to $330 and yields on two-year Treasuries went down to 3.73 percent.
In other words, the results of this pledge were better inflation performance and lower interest rates. The dollar stayed amazingly strong given that the economy was slowing and rates were falling. But, after the last election, the question asked by capital managers around the world is whether today's Fed has shifted its priorities away from reducing the rate of inflation. Now, the world's perception is that all the Fed cares about is jobs, jobs, jobs.
Here's what I'd recommend Chairman Greenspan and the committee do. We know that inflation is going to be rising through 1995. The Fed needs to make a commitment that 1996's inflation rate will not be higher than 1995's, and that 1997's inflation rate will be lower than 1995's. This will help us get back on course to gradual disinflation. I have never been one to argue for dramatic reduction in inflation rates. I've always argued for gradualism.
Q. Do inflation fears undermine the dollar? Is inflation really picking up?
A. In terms of the dollar, the worst of all worlds is for the Federal Reserve to appear to be complacent as the inflation rate keeps moving up. It has already moved up from a 2.3 percent annual rate last year to a 2.9 percent rate in in the past 12 months.
We're not in the worst situation. So far the acceleration of inflation has not seemed to bother anyone in the U.S. But it has clearly bottomed out. Core inflation -- the Consumer Price Index minus food and energy -- came in at another 0.3 percent in March, which means that the rate over the past three months has been running at 4.1 percent.
The problem is that inflation clearly is going to be higher in 1995. So what happens in 1996?
Q. What about Treasury policy?
A. When President Reagan was elected, he placed a high priority on getting inflation down. That resulted in a stronger dollar. Treasury Under Secretary Beryl Sprinkle criticized the Fed for being too easy, saying the money supply was growing too fast and the dollar was too weak. The way to make the dollar appreciate is to do exactly what Ronald Reagan did. We had tight monetary policy and bigger deficits, and we ended up with the same result as Japan is now seeing because that caused the demand for our currency to increase.
Larry Summers at the Treasury should be calling Paul Volcker on the phone and saying: "Paul, we know the dollar was in weak condition when you became Fed chairman in August 1979. How did you fix this dollar weakness so quickly?" If Bob Rubin says he can't do it, it is a pretty lame explanation for a Secretary of the Treasury to say he wants a strong dollar but doesn't know what to do.
Q. What should United States policy be toward Japan?
A. Japan is on the borderline of zero-growth depression and a bank crisis. Japan's tight money means that the yield on capital in Japan is close to zero, and the private sector can't invest if there's no return.
It's not likely that Japan's discount rate move from 1.75 to 1.0 percent will be followed by a big enough drop in interest rates to do the job. If all the interest rates, including the postal savings rate, moved down a full 100 basis points, it would be a very good first step. What's really needed is a follow-up move, which ideally should be a coordinated move between the U.S. and Japan. I'm not sure, but they might need to take the discount rate on down to zero. If the U.S. and Japan both altered rates in opposite directions at the same time, it would make currency markets believe that the two countries are serious.

Abstract: Michelle Laughlin, chief economist at Sanwa Securities, said that through the first quarter of this year the inflation rate was running at 4.1 percent on an annualized basis, compared with a 2.6 percent inflation rate for all of 1994. "Last year in the first three months, the inflation rate was 2.9 percent annualized," she said. "This is a confirmation that higher input cost or raw materials gains are coming through to the consumer level." "I do think that the inflation news this week will keep the Fed in play for a tightening on May 23," she said. "The odds are low but not zero. The market has priced in a 30 percent chance of a rate increase, which I think is about appropriate."

Full text: Prices of Treasury securities rose for a second consecutive day yesterday, helped by a gain in the Consumer Price Index of only two-tenths of a percent.
Some market participants noted, however, that the market has now seen three good sets of figures -- last Friday's jobs data, Tuesday's Producer Price Index and yesterday's Consumer Price Index -- and has not really taken off. Part of the reason may be that small investors are staying away; another may be that expectations of a slowing economy with little inflation have already been priced into the market.
The 30-year bond rose 8/32 , to 10310/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, dropped to 7.35 percent yesterday from 7.37 percent on Tuesday.
Dealers and traders were generally cautious ahead of the short trading week going into the Easter weekend. Reports on industrial production and capacity utilization are scheduled tomorrow -- Good Friday -- when United States markets will be closed.
In another report issued yesterday, the Atlanta Fed said its monthly survey of business activity showed a slower pace of growth in March compared with the previous month. However, market reaction to the report was muted, traders said.
Today investors will get a look at March's retail sales, but trading will be shortened as the Public Securities Association, the main trade group for the public debt industry, has recommended that the Government securities market close at 2 P.M. in observance of Holy Thursday. The recommendation includes money-market and mortgage-backed securities trading.
Yesterday's report on the consumer prices for March showed a gain of two-tenths of a percent, lower than the average forecast of three-tenths of a percent; while the core rate, excluding the more volatile food and energy components, was up three-tenths of a percent, as expected. But some analysts feel that inflation is not as low as it should be.
Michelle Laughlin, chief economist at Sanwa Securities, said that through the first quarter of this year the inflation rate was running at 4.1 percent on an annualized basis, compared with a 2.6 percent inflation rate for all of 1994. "Last year in the first three months, the inflation rate was 2.9 percent annualized," she said. "This is a confirmation that higher input cost or raw materials gains are coming through to the consumer level."
Ms. Laughlin said the market might have been helped later in the morning when a CNW Research and Marketing report on car sales for the first 10 days of April showed considerable weakness. In fact, she said, the report noted that this was the slowest 10-day sales in autos in at least three years.
"I do think that the inflation news this week will keep the Fed in play for a tightening on May 23," she said. "The odds are low but not zero. The market has priced in a 30 percent chance of a rate increase, which I think is about appropriate."
In the municipal bond market, prices were little changed. Some investors were concerned that some housing bond issues could be hurt by proposed government revisions, including last month's plan to reorganize the Department of Housing and Urban Development to consolidate 60 major programs and result in three performance-based funds.
The fear is that many of the tax-exempt securities sold to fund subsidy programs could face potential ratings changes or early redemptions. The restructuring could even even raise the default rate on some housing bonds backed by rental aggreements if there are changes to the rent subsidy programs.
Housing bonds are popular with many investors because they offer higher yields than other tax-exempt securities. Other investors avoid them because they are often redeemed early and tend to lag when interest rates fall. Investors can get as much as 50 basis points more by buying housing bonds instead of similarly rated double-A revenue bonds.

Abstract: "Inflation in May was not a problem, but inflation is something to be concerned about," Mr. [Raymond A. Worseck] said. "It is on the mind of the Fed, on the minds of people investing in foreign bonds and on the minds of people watching commodity prices." "Many in the market still live with the memories of 1974, when commodity prices double and tripled," Mr. Worseck said. "But as long as the Fed holds the line, they're making a monetary accommodation that would allow temporary commodity events to spread into general inflation." Inflation fears in the market were heightened after comments by John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor. In an interview with the Market News Service, Mr. LaWare said that although the rate of capacity utilization in American industry fell slightly in May, it had reached potentially inflationary levels.

Full text: Prospects for a rally in the bond market on raised expectations of a slowing economy quickly faded yesterday. A sharp rise in commodity prices, a weak dollar and comments by a Federal Reserve official all helped revive investors' concerns about inflation.
Bond prices initially rose on industrial production and business inventory data that suggested a slowdown in the economy, traders said.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 30/32 , to 8613/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.39 percent, from 7.30 percent on Tuesday, but still well within the trading range of the last few months. Since April, the yield on the long bond has been as low as 7.10 percent, on April 26, and as high as 7.60 percent, on May 11.
Raymond A. Worseck, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons of St. Louis, said that yesterday's reports were in the range of most economists' expectations. They showed the economy was growing, but at a slower pace, he said. Concern on Inflation
"Inflation in May was not a problem, but inflation is something to be concerned about," Mr. Worseck said. "It is on the mind of the Fed, on the minds of people investing in foreign bonds and on the minds of people watching commodity prices."
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities, a closely watched gauge of inflation, surged 3.31 points yesterday, to 238.61, near a three-and-a-half-year high of 239.20 reached on May 24. The price of oil moved above $19 a barrel yesterday, with the July contract for light crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange settling at $19.86 a barrel.
The gain in the commodities index was led by grains and hogs. Mr. Worseck noted that of the three commodity categories, industrial, agricultural and precious metals, the focus has been on agriculture, where one crop failure can cause turmoil in the market.
"Many in the market still live with the memories of 1974, when commodity prices double and tripled," Mr. Worseck said. "But as long as the Fed holds the line, they're making a monetary accommodation that would allow temporary commodity events to spread into general inflation."
Inflation fears in the market were heightened after comments by John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor. In an interview with the Market News Service, Mr. LaWare said that although the rate of capacity utilization in American industry fell slightly in May, it had reached potentially inflationary levels. 'Straining the System'
The Market News Service reported that Mr. LaWare was more concerned about the relatively high level of capacity utilization. "The estimates are that if you get capacity utilization at 85 percent that you are really kind of straining the system," Mr. LaWare was quoted saying.
Another Fed governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, told the Market News Service on Tuesday that monetary policy was now "within the neutral range" but that mere neutrality could become inappropriate at some point.
But Mr. LaWare's comments bothered the market more, even though he had made similar comments in the past.
The market was helped by yesterday's report showing the decline in capacity utilization. There is much debate, however, whether industries are at or near the point were they will begin to raise prices.
Industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in May, slightly stronger than expected. Capacity utilization slipped to 83.5 percent, from 83.6 percent, with the market trading up on the decline in capacity usage.
Elsewhere in the market, the Treasury announced that next week it would sell $17 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday and $11 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday. In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year was being offered at a price to yield 5.92 percent, and the five-year at a price to yield 6.69 percent. Massachusetts Issue
In the municipal market, underwriters, led by Paine Webber Inc., of Massachusetts' $300 million of special-obligation revenue bonds , announced the deal's final pricing. The maximum yield for a bond due in 2014 is 5.90 percent, with shorter-maturity serial bonds priced to yield from 3.40 percent in 1995 to 5.85 percent in 2012.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
John Crow, whose Draconian anti-inflation policies have made him a political target in a period of double-digit Canadian unemployment, is stepping down as the governor of Canada's central bank, the Government announced today.
But he is to be replaced by his deputy, Gordon Thiessen, a longtime Bank of Canada employee, who is expected to keep the same emphasis on price stability.
The announcement by Finance Minister Paul Martin ended one of the biggest guessing games here since the election of the Liberal Government nearly two months ago.
Mr. Crow's policies had been attacked by many Liberals, including the new Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, whose campaign slogan was "jobs, jobs, jobs." But until now the Government had ducked the issue of whether he would be reappointed when his seven-year term expired next month. Policy Called 'Misguided'
Bankers had argued that Mr. Crow was essential to maintain the country's financial credibility abroad and prevent a collapse of the Canadian dollar. Yet many on the left wanted to dump him. A recently formed "Crow To Go" coalition called the policy of fighting inflation with high interest rates "misguided and destructive."
Jeff Rubin, the chief economist at Wood Gundy Inc., a leading brokerage firm, said Mr. Crow "became a sacrificial lamb."
The change in the guard did not fluster the markets. The Canadian dollar, after touching a six-year low, rebounded immediately after the announcement and closed against the American dollar at 74.82 cents, up 0.43 cent.
"The market is taking it as a very positive sign that the new governor is someone so closely identified with the present policies," said Katherine Beattie, an economist at MMS International, a financial information service.
Edward Neufeld, executive vice president and chief economist at the Royal Bank, said he expected a "smooth transition" and little political trouble for Mr. Thiessen. Inflation Less Than 2 Percent
"The new governor is in the fortunate position of not having to drive the inflation rate down any further," he said.
At less than 2 percent, Canada's inflation is about a point lower than that of the United States. But its unemployment, at more than 11 percent, is almost double that of the United States.
Mr. Crow's tenure recalled a period of the early 1980's when the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A. Volcker, throttled inflation in the United States. Yet Mr. Volcker's efforts did not rouse the same political passions as Mr. Crow's did in Canada, possibly because the austerity in the United States was followed by a strong expanson that created millions of jobs. Canada's growth has not made a dent in the jobless rate.
Like the man he is succeeding, Mr. Thiessen started at the Bank of Canada on the research staff. Although the two men are roughly the same age -- Mr. Thiessen is 55, and Mr. Crow, 56 -- Mr. Thiessen joined the bank 10 years earler, in 1963. In the 60's Mr. Crow held senior staff positions with the International Monetary Fund in Washington.
Mr. Thiessen, whose appointment is effective Feb. 1, becomes the sixth governor and will earn an initial salary of $224,000 Canadian ($168,000).

Abstract: Andrew Pyle, chief economist for MMS International, said that Canada's leading banks could follow sometime this week with a cut in prime lending rates from 6 percent to their lowest levels since the mid-1960's. Unlike the United States, where interest rates have bottomed, Canada's sluggish recovery and negligible inflation give interest rates further room to ease, economists said. The recession hit Canada twice as hard as the United States, they added.

Full text: Reuters
Canada's official interest rate fell today to a 20-year low, paving the way for prime lending rates to dip below those of the United States for the first time since 1984.
The Bank of Canada rate, which sets the trend for short-term interest rates, dropped to 4.88 percent from 4.94 percent at its weekly setting.
Andrew Pyle, chief economist for MMS International, said that Canada's leading banks could follow sometime this week with a cut in prime lending rates from 6 percent to their lowest levels since the mid-1960's.
United States prime rates are currently at 6 percent as well.
But unlike the United States, where interest rates have bottomed, Canada's sluggish recovery and negligible inflation give interest rates further room to ease, economists said. The recession hit Canada twice as hard as the United States, they added.
Inflation is practically nonexistent in Canada. The country's consumer price index fell by two-tenths of 1 percent in May after rising by the same rate in April.
Mr. Pyle said the Bank of Canada rate could fall another 25 to 50 basis points, or a quarter to half a percentage point, during the summer.
The central bank's anti-inflation policy, worldwide deflationary pressures and the recession have caused the Bank of Canada rate and prime rates to fall sharply from the spring of 1990.
The Bank of Canada has exceeded its tough inflation targets of 3 percent at the end of 1992 and 2.5 percent by mid-1994.

Abstract: The new world order made it to South Africa last week when the white minority electorate gave President F. W. de Klerk an overwhelming mandate to end its monopoly on political power. Mr. de Klerk's ruling National Party has been negotiating with other groups, including the African National Congress, headed by Nelson Mandela, to write a new constitution. After a period of transition "it is a foregone conclusion that Mandela will be South Africa's president," said Prakash Sethi, an adviser to a black South African business group. "The transition is likely to be peaceful," he said. South Africa's economy is in shambles from years of sanctions. Though the United States lifted sanctions last year, many states and cities have kept them in place. "The British and Germans who stayed have a large economic base and will increase investment faster than the Americans can get back in," Mr. Sethi said. Japan's Gesture The offer looked generous enough. Japan, which exports cars to the United States under the 1981 Voluntary Restraint Agreement, said last week it would limit the number of cars going to the United States to 1.65 million, down from 2.3 million, the current limit. That gesture, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said, would help Detroit's Big Three recover from last year's combined losses of $4.5 billion. But Detroit was skeptical. Since Japan only exported 1.7 million vehicles to the United States last year, its proposal would simply keep the "same volume their auto makers imported into the United States from Japan in 1991," said Harold A. Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company. "So, where is the reduction?" he asked. No Compromise on Israel When President Bush rejected Israel's request for loan guarantees last week, he said it was because Israel had refused to stop building settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Israel wants guarantees so it can borrow $10 billion in the world's capital markets at more favorable rates to build housing for immigrants from the ex-Soviet Union. That is a different matter from settling the West Bank and Gaza, it says. To move beyond the impasse, Congress proposed a compromise. Grant Israel an immediate $1 billion in guarantees, said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, but keep the remaining $9 billion in reserve, subject to Mr. Bush's approval. Mr. Bush said no. A New Export Champ The figures were cheery last week. The trade deficit narrowed to $5.77 billion, a drop of 3.9 percent, the Commerce Department said. But those numbers may actually signal the end of a trend. It takes two years, economists say, for changes in the value of the dollar to affect the balance of trade. Two years ago the dollar started turning up. "From here on out, exports should be petering out," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. Losing Money on Herman's Back in 1989, Isosceles P.L.C., the big British buyout firm, snatched up Herman's Sporting Goods when it bought the Gateway Supermarket chain. It made the purchase just in time to see sales drop during the recession. Herman's, which had about $600 million in sales last year, had hefty losses.

It made the purchase just in time to see sales drop during the recession. Herman's, which had about $600 million in sales last year, had hefty losses. Last week, Isosceles said it was putting Herman's on the block. "In today's market, I can't imagine they would get $200 million for it," said John Horan, the publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a newsletter based in Glen Mills, Pa. That's half of what Herman's was valued at when Gateway was sold. Exhausted Honda Executive For the Honda Motor Company it was a big loss. Shoichiro Irimajiri, one of its most important executives, resigned last week. The timing could not have been worse. Honda is in the midst of reorganizing its operations. Mr. Irimajiri, who brought Honda's manufacturing prowess to Marysville, Ohio, and gave its once-stodgy cars a jazzier look "is in a state of such physical and mental exhaustion that he is unable to continue his work," said Shin Tanaka, a company spokesman. "The whole headquarters is in shock," the company said. What's Slow for Japan . . . Japan is used to loping along at growth rates of 5 percent or more. But last week the Bank of Japan said growth turned negative in the fourth quarter of 1991 -- but barely. Japan's gross national product contracted by 0.2 percent. Over all, growth for the year was still 3.2 percent, slow for the Japanese but a rate the United States still aspires to. "The data indicates growth of just 1 to 2 percent this year," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm. COMPANIES
Macy's Holiday Letdown R.H. Macy & Company slashed prices during last year's holiday season, hoping to raise enough money to keep creditors at bay. The strategy did not work. Sales tumbled and Macy filed in February for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Last week, citing those holiday season write-offs, Macy reported a loss of $671.6 million in its second quarter. In the same period the year before, Macy earned $78 million. About $606 million of the losses resulted from one-time charges. "I think they will have further restructuring charges and, at least in this quarter, their results are likely to be similar to the second quarter," said Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant. Retail analysts expect to see Macy close more stores. Dow Gives Up Implants Last week the Dow Corning Corporation said it would no longer make silicone-gel breast implants, but would set up a $10 million fund to pay for research and help some women pay to have implants removed. Though it had 30 percent of the market -- 1 percent of its business -- that 1 percent brought most of its recent headaches. The implants have been implicated in a number of health problems. Making a $2 Million Point How much is an idea for a movie that made $350 million worth? Only $150,000, according to judge Harvey A. Schneider of the Los Angeles Superior Court. That is how much he awarded Art Buchwald for an idea that led to Paramount Pictures' "Coming to America," starring Eddie Murphy. "We won the legal case," said Zazi Pope, Mr. Buchwald's lawyer. The victory was not cheap: legal fees were $2.25 million. Bigger Than a 747 The McDonnell Douglas Corporation is rethinking its next commercial plane. Instead of producing the 375-seat MD-12 tri-jet, McDonnell said last week it is looking into a much larger craft. What it has in mind is a 600-seat, four-engine plane that would compete directly with the Boeing 747. "We have said we are looking at alternatives and we have talked to potential airline customers," said John Thom, a spokesman for the company. Trump's Shrinking Debt In his heyday, Donald Trump bought a lot of snazzy real estate at inflated prices. He paid $409 million for the Plaza Hotel -- all of it borrowed -- which his creditors valued at $260 million. His empire began unraveling two years ago. Last week he agreed to give up 49 percent of the Plaza to a group of banks headed by Citibank; the banks will cancel $125 million of his personally guaranteed debt, plus accrued interest. The deal also offers more favorable terms on the $300 million left on the Plaza's mortgage. In 1990, Mr. Trump was personally liable for $900 million. If this deal goes through, he will owe a mere $115 million. Colt's in Chapter 11 The Colt's Manufacturing Company, whose .45 caliber six-shooter left an indelible impression on the lore of the West, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Colt's, based in Hartford, received a $10 million line of credit from the Connecticut Development Authority and a bank. Colt's lost markets to competitors with more advanced products. Even the Hartford police use Smith & Wesson pistols. ECONOMY
Prices Are Under Control With growth still struggling to get above zero, inflation, at least at the consumer level, remains contained. The Consumer Price Index increased three-tenths of 1 percent in February, the Labor Department said. Which Comes First? It's a case of chicken-and-egg economics. To sustain a recovery, consumers must spend. But before they will, they must have jobs. And companies don't hire until the consumers spend. Too little spending and too little job growth derailed last year's recovery, economists say. Has that changed? "I can't tell you that anyone is suggesting to us that they are in a strong rehiring mode at this moment," said Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. "They are hopeful, but they are also cautious." An End To Tsongas Economics When Paul E. Tsongas withdrew from the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination last week, he took his lower-capital-gains, no-tax-cuts-for-the-middle-class strategy with him. What's left for the Democrats to debate is far more populist. Gov. Bill Clinton said he would raise taxes on the rich -- those who earn more than $200,000 a year -- and reduce taxes on the middle class. Former Gov. Jerry Brown -- borrowing an idea once espoused by Ronald Reagan -- said he wants to scrap the system in favor of a 13 percent flat tax. But few give Mr. Brown a chance of capturing the nomination.

Abstract: The Blue Chip consensus of 50 economists, compiled by Robert Eggert in Sedona, Ariz., which has been trimming its price forecast for a few months, sees 3.7 percent inflation in 1992. That, incidentally, is just about where the American public feels comfortable. According to a recent report by the Federal Reserve bank of San Francisco analyzing public attitudes toward inflation, Americans are intolerant of inflation when it exceeds 4 percent. New Zealanders, in contrast, grew disturbed when the rate reached 30 percent. A drop in inflation in the first year or so of a recovery, it turns out, is the rule, not the exception. Even after the relatively short and shallow recession of 1969-70, which the recent downturn probably resembles most closely, inflation declined by about 1 percentage point during the recovery. Indeed, lower inflation, which reduces costs and lifts business profits and consumers' purchasing power, is one of the forces that help the economy to recover. Besides, if investors gradually come to believe that the Fed really means what it has been saying about near-zero inflation, even that spread, which reflects the risk that inflation might be higher than expected, could narrow slowly.

Full text: In fretful economic times, people often talk as if the only thing standing between the United States economy and permanent stagnation is the Federal Reserve's next move to trim short-term interest rates. But now, some economists contend, declines in inflation and long-term interest rates may be even more powerful stimulants for growth.
Lower long-term rates reduce the debt burdens of businesses and consumers, making it easier for families to buy homes and allowing companies to invest more in new technology.
"Nothing would be more helpful to the sub-par economic recovery than a sizable reduction in long rates," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns, the New York investment firm. And nothing, he might have added, would make a reduction in long-term rates more likely than solid prospects for lower inflation. Expectations a Key
Unlike short-term rates, over which the Fed exercises some control, long-term rates rise and fall with investors' expectations of future inflation and future demand for credit.
True, long-term rates can follow short-term rates lower when the Fed eases credit, if only because investors in short-term securities seek higher yields in longer-term maturities. But the extent to which long-term rates actually decline greatly depends on the confidence of savers in the soundness of their money. If people expect inflation to remain low, they are more likely to invest for the long term, helping to push down long-term rates.
The good news, reflected in the current bond rally, is that the United States, which used to have some of the highest long-term interest rates of any industrial country, is now on the low end of the spectrum. Closing the Gap
American rates on 10-year Government bonds -- the usual global yardstick, since many countries do not issue 30-year bonds -- have recently been just over 7 percent, compared with more than 8 percent in Germany and more than 9 percent in Britain.
Although Japan still has lower rates, at around 6 percent, the gap between Japanese and American rates has narrowed from more than 400 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, a few years ago.
This welcome decrease in the cost of capital mostly reflects the fact that the United States, once the most notable high-inflation country among the industrial powers, has joined the low-inflation crowd. So far in 1991, the Consumer Price Index has risen at a 2.5 percent annual rate, compared with 4 percent in Germany and around 3.5 percent in Japan.
Granted, a break from lower energy and food prices has pushed this year's actual inflation rate below the long-term trend. Nonetheless, a number of Fed officials, as well as many private forecasters, think the long-term rate is between 3 and 4 percent, compared with 4.5 percent in the five years leading up to the recession.
The Blue Chip consensus of 50 economists, compiled by Robert Eggert in Sedona, Ariz., which has been trimming its price forecast for a few months, sees 3.7 percent inflation in 1992. That, incidentally, is just about where the American public feels comfortable. According to a recent report by the Federal Reserve bank of San Francisco analyzing public attitudes toward inflation, Americans are intolerant of inflation when it exceeds 4 percent. New Zealanders, in contrast, grew disturbed when the rate reached 30 percent.
So far, there are plenty of signs, in addition to the slow money growth of the last four years, that suggest that inflation could remain subdued.
An index of leading inflation indicators from the Columbia University Center for International Business Cycle Research ticked up in September, but is running about 10 points below its level of two years ago. Gains in Productivity
And labor costs remain under control. The restructuring of some service industries, as well as the slow pace of overall hiring, suggest decent gains in productivity and muted pressure to raise wages.
In particular, points out Maury Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., government workers are no longer getting the higher-than-average pay raises typical of the last few years, because of state and local fiscal crises.
Actual price trends have also been encouraging. Inflation in services, far more persistent than in goods, has lately moderated in everything from rents and other housing costs to medical services.
And, as the bond rally itself suggests, inflation expectations seem on the whole to be improving. Commodity prices remain weak. And in a sign that executives do not see much inflation ahead, business appears to be determined to operate with ever-leaner inventories.
A drop in inflation in the first year or so of a recovery, it turns out, is the rule, not the exception. Even after the relatively short and shallow recession of 1969-70, which the recent downturn probably resembles most closely, inflation declined by about 1 percentage point during the recovery. Indeed, lower inflation, which reduces costs and lifts business profits and consumers' purchasing power, is one of the forces that help the economy to recover.
Should prices really stay well behaved, long-term rates could stay below 8 percent even if the economy is growing at, say, a rate of 2.5 to 3.5 percent next year. Mr. Harris said the spread between inflation and long-term rates was averaging about 400 basis points until the recession.
Besides, if investors gradually come to believe that the Fed really means what it has been saying about near-zero inflation, even that spread, which reflects the risk that inflation might be higher than expected, could narrow slowly.
In all, experts are beginning to conclude, America's improving track record on inflation may now be more important to future economic growth -- and to the bond rally -- than whether the Fed eases credit another quarter point this week.

Abstract: Washington and London, at Odds in the Air All's fair in love, war and international airline negotiations. Disputes over airline rights can divide even friends as close as Britain and the United States. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner rejected British Airways' proposed fare cuts to the United States last Tuesday. Britain had blocked the sale by Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, both desperate for cash, of several London routes to Heathrow airport that United and American Airlines want to buy. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, flew into New York himself last week to display solicitude for the ailing airlines. The dispute is "not about knocking Pan Am or T.W.A. out of business altogether," he said. He also urged timid Americans to resume traveling abroad; those who don't risk losing business, he said. What British Airways actually seeks are broader operating rights in the United States, said American analysts. Problem is, that sort of deal might normally take a year to work out; T.W.A. and Pan Am need agreements within a few months. Oddball Salary Inequities When Babe Ruth was asked, about 60 years ago, why he deserved $80,000 when President Hoover only made $75,000, Ruth's legendary response was, "I had a better year than he did." A week ago, Roger Clemens signed a four-year contract giving him a record average of $5.4 million a year; President Bush draws $200,000. Clemens won 21 games, holding opponents to an average of less than two runs a game. George Bush showed quick reflexes in the Persian Gulf but bobbled the tax issue. So Clemens did have the better year. But 27 times better? Enough so that the cost of a single Clemens victory more than covers Bush's salary for an entire season? And the President certainly outplayed, say, Jeff Parrett, the Atlanta Braves pitcher, who recently settled for $855,000 after winning five, losing 10. Memo to team owners wanting to economize: draft George, the former Yale baseball captain, when his Washington contract is up. Alcohol-Fed Inflation Economists have found another fuel to blame for increasing wholesale inflation. A record 5.9 percent jump in alcohol prices raised the core inflation rate in January by five-tenths of 1 percent. Higher alcohol taxes do not figure into producer prices, but many manufacturers took the chance to raise their own prices. Some economists said that, even after accounting for liquor costs, the rising core rate would keep the Federal Reserve from easing further. "The Fed will rest on its oars for at least a couple more weeks," said Irwin L. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust. The broader inflation rate, including food and energy, fell one-tenth of 1 percent, as oil prices declined. Golden Arch of Catfish? McDonald's believes it has found a recipe for Southern success: The Crispy Catfish Sandwich, a 2.3-ounce patty with lettuce and tangy sauce on a bun.

Washington and London, at Odds in the Air All's fair in love, war and international airline negotiations. Disputes over airline rights can divide even friends as close as Britain and the United States. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner rejected British Airways' proposed fare cuts to the United States last Tuesday. Britain had blocked the sale by Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, both desperate for cash, of several London routes to Heathrow airport that United and American Airlines want to buy. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, flew into New York himself last week to display solicitude for the ailing airlines.

McDonald's plans to sell it at 214 outlets in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky and Tennessee. Restaurants that specialize in catfish are hardly trembling. Don Buckner, general manager of Hall's on the River in Winchester, Ky., described McDonald's seafood sandwiches as "block pieces of fish" -- suitable for someone who would otherwise have a quarter-pounder. His $9.95 all-you-can-eat catfish dinner includes vegetables and hush puppies, he added. No hush puppies at McDonald's, said a spokeswoman, convinced that Southern customers will accept french fries. Competition for Cellular Lines All that static on the cellular phone lines is coming from aggrieved duopolists. The Federal Communications Commission decided on Wednesday to allow a new form of mobile service in six cities, including New York. Radio dispatch companies for taxis and delivery services will be able to squeeze thousands of other customers into their narrow slices of the radio spectrum. Cellular services that have flourished under rules allowing only two in each city could find competition heating up. Analysts doubt the new service, to be offered initially by Fleet Call Inc. of Bloomfield, N.J., will match cellular's flexibility and features. But the cellular industry called the decision unfair and threatened a fight. Production Declines Ease The slump in industrial output continued for a fourth month in January, but the decline was a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent after much steeper drops in the two previous months. Some economists said the report hints that the worst of the recession is past. But industries used only 79.9 percent of their capacity, the least in four years. In Brief A seven-tenths of 1 percent decline in already lean business inventories in December gave economists hope that any increase in demand would result in higher production. Citibank, long aloof and superior, has decided to join the automated teller machine masses. Its machines will become part of the Cirrus network, sharing access with machines from 7,200 other banks and financial institutions. COMPANIES
George Ball Steps Down When the big boys on Wall Street are suffering, a guy who tried to play with them but failed is truly in trouble. George L. Ball resigned as chairman and chief executive of Prudential-Bach Securities last Wednesday, felled by his loss of $308 million in less than nine years as the firm's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Ball tried to transform a humdrum brokerage firm into a glamorous, global investment bank, throwing around millions to hire star financiers. When the Prudential Insurance Company of America lost patience with his prodigal ways, he responded with what he called a "light cruiser" strategy, fighting only those competitive battles that he believed the firm could win. The losses continued, however, and Mr. Ball finally gave up his command. Carter Hawley Hale Goes Under The real markdowns at Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. last week were on "junk bonds" and common stock; the largest department store chain on the West Coast, parent of the Broadway, Weinstocks and Emporium names, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Carter Hawley Hale story was another 1980's tale of efficient wealth transfer from bondholders, long-term investors and employees -- whose 45 percent stake in the company is now nearly worthless -- to lawyers, investment bankers and the usual short-term profiteers. In its efforts to fight off a takeover attempt led by the Limited Inc. chain in 1987, Carter Hawley Hale had taken on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Little was left, therefore, to improve the stores. Competition and a slack American economy did the rest. Auto Makers in Decline The Ford Motor Company has cut back, streamlined production and improved efficiency enough to almost rival the Japanese. But its fourth-quarter loss of $519 million confounded its mission to keep profits flowing even when a recession strikes. The General Motors Corporation lost $1.62 billion, giving the industry its second-worst quarter ever. Analysts were understanding, saying that auto companies can face no worse combination than a recession and higher energy prices. As James P. Womack, an auto industry authority at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, "You can't take a 25 percent hit on volume and make much money in any business." In Brief A Federal bankruptcy judge approved the sale of 67 Eastern Airlines takeoff and landing slots and five gates at Washington National Airport to Northwest Airlines for $35.5 million. The Justice Department blocked a bid by United Airlines for antitrust reasons. U S West Inc. agreed to pay $10 million, the largest antitrust fine ever, for violating the agreement that broke up the Bell System. INTERNATIONAL
Germany's High-Cost East One weekend last fall, a carnival on East Berlin's Alexanderplatz was so dreary that visitors had to ask to make sure it was taking place. On the Kurfurstendamm in West Berlin, meanwhile, every evening brought out raucous crowds lingering well past midnight. German officials said last Tuesday that giving eastern Germany much to celebrate will prove far more costly than they had thought. With a turnaround nowhere in sight, the Government approved $3 billion in emergency aid for cities and states. Economists say that rebuilding the eastern regions will cost the Government nearly $100 billion this year, more than $1 trillion over the decade. Traditional Eastern European export markets have evaporated, factories are closing and residents are leaving for the West. Germany's bind might well pinch relations with the United States. The cost of aiding the easterners makes Germans more reluctant to lower interest rates in support of the dollar or finance the war in the Middle East. Trouble With the Trade Deficit The trade deficit is heading in the right direction for the wrong reasons. The gap shrank to $6.3 billion in December, better than most economists had expected. Imports fell 7.9 percent, as the recession curbed America's appetite for foreign goods. But exports slipped also, by 2.1 percent, auguring ill for one of the economy's few healthy areas. "We can't count on that sector as much in the months ahead," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. As foreign economies slow, not even a weaker dollar is sufficient to stoke overseas demand.

Abstract: ''Acting at this time is a way of telling Mexico that we're really serious,'' a senior Administration official said. In late August, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asked the United States to open the talks. ''The political cost associated with accepting foreign investment in the upstream sector of the petroleum industry would be substantial,'' said Rafael G. Quijano, director of the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a Washington energy consulting group. ''Mexico is a wonderful potential market,'' said Colleen S. Morton, director of the United States Council of the Mexico-United States Business Committee. The council represents key American business groups.

Though not the only reason, the Persian Gulf crisis was a factor in the decision, they said.
President Bush, acting more swiftly than expected, will ask Congress next week for authority to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement with Mexico, Administration officials said today. Though not the only reason, the Persian Gulf crisis was a factor in the decision, they said.
They also said Canada, already a free trade partner of the United States, was likely to participate, giving an accord hemispheric scope and clearing the way for common standards and trading rules in all three countries by the end of the century.
The integration of economies in North America would follow similar moves in Europe, as the European Community inches toward economic union.
''Acting at this time is a way of telling Mexico that we're really serious,'' a senior Administration official said. In late August, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asked the United States to open the talks.
Mexico's Oil Reserves

The Middle East crisis has focused the world's attention on global oil supplies. Mexico, with the eighth-largest reserves in the world, would be likely to attract more outside capital with a trade pact to help tap those reserves.
While the United States wants to work with Mexico on increasing oil production, another factor behind the speed-up, officials said, is a desire to accommodate President Salinas, who has seized on free trade to modernize the Mexican economy.
Mexico, which has already cut tariffs from 100 percent or more to less than 10 percent, sees an agreement with the United States attracting foreign capital that would spur modernization.
An economic basket case early in the last decade, Mexico, through deregulation and tax cuts as well as freer trade, has already reduced inflation and interest rates sharply and all but eliminated capital flight.
Cooperation in Energy

Bush Administration officials expect a trade agreement to intensify cooperation in the energy sector, for example, by increasing already robust sales of American oil equipment to Mexico.
One recent sign of cooperation was Mexico's pledge to lift overall oil exports by 100,000 barrels daily to help ease the current pressure on global supplies. Mexico exports about half of its 2.5 million barrels daily. The United States takes about 60 percent of the exports, Japan 15 percent and Europe most of the rest.
Far more controversial is the issue of American participation in Mexican oil and gas exploration, for 50 years the exclusive preserve of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.
Because of political sensitivity about oil, many analysts consider it unlikely that international oil companies would be permitted to operate in Mexico.
''The political cost associated with accepting foreign investment in the upstream sector of the petroleum industry would be substantial,'' said Rafael G. Quijano, director of the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a Washington energy consulting group.
Still Mr. Quijano, a former Pemex executive, suggested that ways might be found to get around the issue.
Foreign Investment Fund

One possible solution, he said, is a financial mechanism, like a trust fund established by foreign investors in a Mexican bank with which Mexican operators would carry out drilling activities.
Decisions on such issues are not likely to be taken before the Salinas Government tests its strength at the polls in 1991 midterm elections.
The Presidents of the United States and Mexico agreed in June to go forward with the pact, but the expectation then was that little progress would be made before yearend.
George W. Grayson, a Mexican oil expert at William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va., said that Mexico was producing about at capacity and that because of rising domestic use from its rapid industrialization, it badly needed to find new oil.
Immigration is another sensitive issue. Mexico had wanted to take up freer movement of workers as well as goods. Washington had warned that this could doom the talks and won its point. Immigration will not be negotiated, American officials said.
Immigration Issues

But immigration could be affected indirectly. If a free trade pact leads to a more prosperous Mexico, there will be less pressure on workers to come north.
Organized labor in the United States has already signaled its strong opposition to a free trade pact with Mexico. But most industry groups, seeing a large potential for exports, have come out in favor.
''Mexico is a wonderful potential market,'' said Colleen S. Morton, director of the United States Council of the Mexico-United States Business Committee. The council represents key American business groups.
If, as expected, Canada joins the talks, in return for greater access to Mexico, Canada would have to be willing to offer Mexico the same tariff cuts and privileged access to Canada as the United States offers.
The Administration's request to Congress starts a clock in which Congress has 60 legislative days, or at least four months, to determine whether such an agreement would be in the United States' interest.
If Congress gives its assent, which is considered likely, negotiations will probably continue until 1993, officials said. It took about 18 months for Canada and the United States to negotiate a free trade pact in the late 1980's. Though still controversial in Canada, that pact has been so successful that the two nations agreed recently to accelerate scheduled tariff cuts.
Mexico is the third-largest American trading partner after Canada and Japan. In 1989 two-way trade exceeded $51 billion. The United States is Mexico's primary export market.

Abstract: ''Domestic economies tend to be the more important influence on interest rates,'' Mr. [Neal Soss] said. He explains the current rise in rates in this country as a ''return to more normal circumstances'' after last summer's startling political developments. Right now, however, he predicts that rates here may fall slightly if the economy continues to weaken. Unlike Mr. Soss, he says the United States is particularly vulnerable to such events because it is so dependent on foreign capital to finance its large trade and budget deficits. ''We're depending on foreign capital inflows of about $10 billion a year to finance our trade balance,'' he said. ''That means we have to pay whatever price is necessary to attract that capital. If interest rates abroad are up, they have to be here.'' ''I still believe the primary factors calling the shots on U.S. interest rates are domestic considerations,'' Mr. Sargen said. ''But going into the 1990's, higher real interest rates abroad become the eventual floor for the U.S. That floor is now being raised. The most difficult question is by how much, and I don't think anyone knows the answer.''

Full text: LEAD: The meshing of West and East Germany - one a sleek, postwar capitalist engine and the other a shattered, inefficient state-run rowboat with high unemployment - is expected to be a formidable task. While the two halves may some day become a seamless and vibrant economy, the transition is expected to be rough, and unsettling for interest rates around the globe.
The meshing of West and East Germany - one a sleek, postwar capitalist engine and the other a shattered, inefficient state-run rowboat with high unemployment - is expected to be a formidable task. While the two halves may some day become a seamless and vibrant economy, the transition is expected to be rough, and unsettling for interest rates around the globe. There are divergent schools of thought on the subject. One group of economists believes that there is a finite amount of capital in the world. As West Germany seeks to finance the redevelopment of East Germany, so the argument goes, borrowers there will bid up interest rates to attract capital, forcing borrowers in the United States and Japan to raise their rates in a global competition for funds.
But other economists say the matter is not that simple. German reunification, they say, may not affect interest rates elsewhere. And even if it does, the shifts will be subtle and indirect. Besides, some say, the German markets are so much smaller than those in the United States or Japan that their impact, while important, is inherently limited.
Rate Rise, Isolated

Neal Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, believes that higher German interest rates are inevitable. The most immediate upward pressure will come as East German citizens demand better housing and clothing, even before production in that country rises. This ''demand shock,'' as it is called by economists, represents an inflationary push on interest rates.
Once production in East Germany improves, there will be a second upward force on interest rates as the capital stock of the nation becomes more productive and businesses begin to borrow more money.
Then too, the so-called ''risk premium'' that German borrowers must offer to investors as compensation for investing in such an uncertain economic climate will also cause rates to climb.
Mr. Soss likens the events in Germany to the reunification of the United States following the Civil War - the problems of unifying the currency and organizing a decimated and largely unemployed labor force in the South.
''The restoration of the States was filled with discord and messiness,'' he said. ''And it will be the same in putting West and East Germany together. There will be a lot of new habits that have to be developed with regard to labor and money. That raises the sense of risk and that is the final influence on rising German interest rates.''
Despite this, Mr. Soss believes, there is ''no reason'' that interest rates should go up in the United States or Japan. He says that rates are influenced more by domestic than international issues. In his view, rates in Japan have been going up only because the unification of the Germanys threatens the belief that Japan is about to become the pre-eminent economic power. The 1990's, which have often been billed as the decade of the Pacific Rim, could instead be a time when economic power shifts to a more dynamic Europe, as the Germanys reunify and Eastern Europe re-emerges as an economic force.
To back up his theory that international rates do not march in lock step, Mr. Soss points to last summer, when the United States enjoyed lower interest rates than many of its trading partners. He felt that this came from the notion of the United States as a ''safe haven'' for capital following the death of the Ayatollah in Iran, the supression of the uprising at Tiananmen Square in China and the political scandals in Japan.
''Domestic economies tend to be the more important influence on interest rates,'' Mr. Soss said. He explains the current rise in rates in this country as a ''return to more normal circumstances'' after last summer's startling political developments. Right now, however, he predicts that rates here may fall slightly if the economy continues to weaken.
Rate Rise, International

The opposite view is taken by C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a research institute in Washington. Mr. Bergsten believes that events in East and West Germany will ''drag up interest rates around the world.'' He, too, sees higher German rates as inevitable. They will first come from the inflationary pressures of reunification as the purchasing power of East Germany is mobilzed. Once this happens, he anticipates that the West German central bank, fearful of inflation, will try to tighten monetary policy, which would push up rates.
But unlike Mr. Soss, he says the United States is particularly vulnerable to such events because it is so dependent on foreign capital to finance its large trade and budget deficits. ''We're depending on foreign capital inflows of about $10 billion a year to finance our trade balance,'' he said. ''That means we have to pay whatever price is necessary to attract that capital. If interest rates abroad are up, they have to be here.''
In Mr. Bergsten's view, ''The chickens have come home to roost. Our dependence on foreign capital has made us hostage to economic events abroad.''
Conversely, Japan is less vulnerable because it is an exporter of capital, he said. But he noted that a rapid German reunification would probably push up inflation and interest rates in Japan by several percentage points, while a slower pace would dampen inflation fears and keep rates more stable.
The Rate Floor

Nicholas Sargan, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., makes a distinction between different components of interest rates: inflation, real returns and the uncertainty premium. He believes that inflation in a given country directly affects rates within its own borders, but has little impact on global rates. To support this, he points to the decline in United States interest rates last summer as inflation dropped and the economy slowed here. This contrasts with Japan and West Germany, where rising inflation fears pushed up rates.
But he believes that real interest rates - the component that is set by the productive capacity of an economy - equalize across the globe and set an international floor for rates. The risk and inflation premiums are then built on this floor level.
Without the demand for capital in West Germany, rates of different nations moved in different directions last year, depending on internal inflation fears. But with this new element in play, Mr. Sargan says, rates all over the globe will inevitably rise.
''I still believe the primary factors calling the shots on U.S. interest rates are domestic considerations,'' Mr. Sargen said. ''But going into the 1990's, higher real interest rates abroad become the eventual floor for the U.S. That floor is now being raised. The most difficult question is by how much, and I don't think anyone knows the answer.''
An End to Euphoria

Alan Reynolds, chief economist at Polyconomics Inc., an economic consulting firm in Morristown, N.J., believes that the current euphoria about investments in Germany may subside once the difficulties of reunification become clear. For instance, he anticipates that much of the foreign money that surged into West German stock funds could flow out when investors begin to realize that a unified German economic powerhouse will not emerge overnight and that these funds have become overpriced. The deutsche mark will weaken as investors sell and covert the marks used to buy the stocks back into dollars. Interest rates will rise in Germany as money flows back into the United States and Japan and as buyers of German bonds demand higher returns to protect them against a weakening mark.
But over time, he says, interest rates in other nations will react to inflationary pressues in their own borders rather than those abroad. ''To say that all our interest rates have to go in the same direction is to say we all have to raise interest rates to the level of Britain or Australia because they have higher rates,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''But they have higher rates for a reason - because people there expect inflation.''
The Limited Markets

Besides, noted Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Company Ltd., West Germany's role in the world economy is limited by the size of its stock and bond markets relative to those in the United States and Japan. He noted that the German equities market is only one-tenth the size of the Tokyo market and that its bond market is one-third the size of the Japanese bond market, which in turn is half the size of the United States bond market.
This means that only a limited amount of funds can flow into West German securities without driving the deutsche mark, which is needed to buy these securities, to ridiculously high levels, thereby choking off any investment value. As a result, while Germany may indeed play a special role in the European economy because of its strength, that role is inherently limited, as is the upward pressure on its rates.
''Germany is still a small niche market and that means money flows can be deflected away from the U.S. and Japan,'' Mr. Brusca said. ''But if any sizable moves in funds occur, it will be so visible that it will push up rates and prices in Germany and become a self-limiting process.''
In fact, Mr. Brusca said, as oil prices rise, Arab investors may play a more important role than the reunification of Germany in international money flows and interest rates. ''One of the things missed in all this discussion,'' he said, ''is the rise of the Arab investor and the question of where all those dollars flow.''

Abstract: ''All long-term plans are on hold,'' Timothy A. Durkin, a Citibank vice president, said of the nervous business mood in this city, often known as the ''locomotive'' of Brazil. ''I know of several $100 million-plus projects that are tabled until the situation is defined.'' The surge of manufactured exports and Brazil's barriers against imports have led to conflicts between Brazil and the United States.

Although some import tariffs have edged down, Brazil remains, in the words of a recent Bank of Boston report, ''very much a closed economy.'' ''We may go with the half-measures of [Leonel Brizola], or with the wrong-headed radicalism of Lula,'' Senator [Roberto Campos] said of the 1990's.

Full text: LEAD: On the eve of its first direct presidential election in nearly 30 years, Brazil, the giant of Latin America, stands frozen at an economic crossroads. Frustrated by a decade of economic stagnation, Brazil's 82 million voters will now decide the path the Western world's eighth-largest economy will take in the 1990's.
On the eve of its first direct presidential election in nearly 30 years, Brazil, the giant of Latin America, stands frozen at an economic crossroads. Frustrated by a decade of economic stagnation, Brazil's 82 million voters will now decide the path the Western world's eighth-largest economy will take in the 1990's.
One school of candidates is offering the classic Western prescription for economic growth in the third world, a path now being followed by Mexico, among others: trade liberalization, more foreign investment and far less state ownership of industry. The other group of candidates in a very crowded field is offering the classic blueprint of Latin American development usually associated with the left: higher wages, land for the landless and at least a temporary moratorium on payments of foreign debt. Brazil has $110 billion in debt, the most in the developing world.
The outcome of the election is impossible to predict. But business leaders say that if the voters choose the pro-Western, free-market course, Brazil will emerge in the next decade with glittering, Pacific Basin-style growth rates. They say that a leftist victory, however, would seriously wound the country, already hobbled by social tension, four-digit inflation and capital flight.
Fueling social combustion, Brazil has one of Latin America's widest gaps between rich and poor. In a nation where three-quarters of the voters earn less than $125 a week, Brazil's conservative military maneuvered for decades to avoid a direct vote for the presidency, fearing a victory for the left. The voting this Wednesday will be the first such election since 1960; since 1964, presidents have been chosen by the military or by a civilian electoral college.
''All long-term plans are on hold,'' Timothy A. Durkin, a Citibank vice president, said of the nervous business mood in this city, often known as the ''locomotive'' of Brazil. ''I know of several $100 million-plus projects that are tabled until the situation is defined.''
With no clear frontrunner in the 22-candidate race, Wednesday's voting is expected merely to clear the field, leaving the two highest vote getters to face each other in a runoff Dec. 17. The winner of the runoff will succeed President Jose Sarney in March.
At stake is the future of Latin America's largest market, with 144 million people. A favorite of American bankers and investors during the high-growth years of the 1960's and 1970's, Brazil lost its allure during the 1980's, when economic growth fell to an average of less than 2.9 percent a year, barely pacing population growth.
Business executives attribute the stagnation to several causes: oil price shocks, a net outflow of capital to service the foreign debt, economic mismanagement that led to gyrating inflation rates and a highly controlled domestic economy that proved increasingly unattractive to investors. Big Trade Surplus
Despite all that, Brazil last year racked up a $19 billion trade surplus, the third-largest in the world after Japan and West Germany. Once largely an exporter of agricultural goods - coffee and the sugar to sweeten it - Brazilian factories now send overseas a panoply of manufactured goods: airplanes, steel, tanks and shoes.
The surge of manufactured exports and Brazil's barriers against imports have led to conflicts between Brazil and the United States. United States officials last May gave Brazil 18 months to lower its barriers or face retaliatory tariffs. Although some import tariffs have edged down, Brazil remains, in the words of a recent Bank of Boston report, ''very much a closed economy.''
Last year, for example, Brazil bought only $4.2 billion worth of American goods, less than what was purchased by Venezuela, which has one-eighth of Brazil's population.
In response, Brazilians say they have to keep import barriers high in order to record a trade surplus that can be used to service the foreign debt. American bankers lead the list of creditors of the $65 billion commercial portion of the debt.
In September, Brazil quietly stopped servicing the foreign debt, in what was seen as a temporary, improvised move. But the debt remains a burning issue in the presidential campaign. Indeed, two strong left-wing contenders have made the debt public enemy No. 1.
Leonel Brizola, a Socialist former governor of Rio de Janeiro state, and Luis Inacio da Silva, a trade unionist known as Lula who has strong Marxist backing, have blamed it for a wide range of ills - from stifling the economy to spurring inflation, now at an annual rate of 1,300 percent.
The two candidates are calling for a formal moratorium on payments while auditors review the debt and far more favorable terms can be negotiated - a process that could easily take a year.
A victory of the left would probably cause further strains with the United States. Dismissing as insufficient Washington's country-by-country debt-relief plan, the leftists say that Brazil should lead a coalition of debtor nations. In the 1980's, such coalitions never got beyond the talking stage. But this could change with an energetic leftist at the head of Brazil.
A milder stance on the debt has come from the frontrunner of the center-right, Fernando Collor de Mello, a former governor of Alagoas state.
But the campaign rhetoric, which is expected to sharpen during the second round of the election, may well force the new president to adopt an unrealistic position on debt negotiations after being inaugurated for a five-year term next March 15.
Many American banks are now in a stronger position to resist Brazil's pressure and to cut off new lending. This year, many banks raised their loan-loss reserves, effectively taking early losses on Brazilian loans.
''We can now be tougher at the negotiating table, because we have very little to lose,'' said one American banker in Rio.
In the third world, the secondary debt market serves as an informal barometer of international assessment of a nation's debt management, political stability and general economic policies.
In Latin America, Chile and Colombia, two careful money managers, score high - their debt securities trade for about 65 percent of face value. Mexico and Venezuela, two countries that this year adopted decisive economic programs featuring free-market reforms, score in the medium range - about 40 percent. Hitting Rock Bottom
Last week, Brazilian debt securities hit their lowest point ever - 21 cents on the dollar. Among the major debtors, only Argentina (at 18 cents) and Peru (6 cents) scored lower.
Meanwhile, confidence in domestic debt securities issued by Brazil has dropped so low that the Government is paying real interest rates of 6 percent a month to attract lenders. Analysts calculate that Brazil's internal debt has increased 50 percent this year, to about $120 billion, roughly a third of the country's gross domestic product. By comparison, Mexico's internal debt has declined as a percentage of G.D.P., to 28.6 percent at the end of 1988, from 33.3 percent the year before.
The lack of confidence reflects the Brazilian Government's increasingly precarious hold on the economy. In the last 15 years, tax collection has dropped from 17 percent of G.D.P. to 9 percent. And with an estimated 90 percent of this year's budget going to pay salaries for the state's 8 million employees, the Government has resorted to printing or borrowing money to pay for nearly everything else, fueling inflation.
It is even unclear whether Brazil's economy can make it to March 15 without disintegrating into the kind of hyperinflation that sparked widespread street rioting in Argentina after presidential elections there last May. With the emergency, Argentina's new President, Carlos Saul Menem, was able to galvanize bipartisan support for a tough anti-inflation program - raising taxes and public utility rates, cutting Government subsidies and selling money-losing state companies. Waiting for a Disaster
''Unlike Argentina, we have not yet had a disaster - only a half-disaster,'' said Roberto Campos, a senator and economist who advocates a similar set of tough measures for Brazil. Under a new Constitution, Brazil's Congress wields strong powers over economic policy. But there is no consensus in Congress for an emergency program, Senator Campos said.
Looking ahead, a diplomat in Brasilia concurred: ''A key issue is whether the next president will be able to mobilize huge sectors of the population and Congress for an economic salvation program.''
In Sao Paulo business circles, there is growing support for cutting the state sector and for opening Brazil to foreign investment and imports.
''The closing of our borders keeps us inefficient,'' said Jose E. Mindlin, president of Metal Leve, a Brazilian-based multinational auto-parts manufacturer.
Antoninho Marmo Trevisan, the president of an economic consulting group here, predicted that the budget shortfall will force the Government to start dismantling the state empire of 230 companies.
''Whoever wins, whether it is Lula or Collor, he will have to privatize if he wants to build schools, roads and health clinics,'' Mr. Trevisan said, advocating selling the money-losing state companies to a mix of foreign and local investors.
But it is unclear whether the voters will follow the recent prescription of a Sao Paulo newspaper: ''Less government, less misery.''
''We may go with the half-measures of Brizola, or with the wrong-headed radicalism of Lula,'' Senator Campos said of the 1990's. ''Then we will have to wait another five years for Brazil to grow again.''

Full text: LEAD: In unusually harsh language, the world's central bankers said today that the United States' failure to make further progress in reducing its budget deficit was ''deplorable.''
In unusually harsh language, the world's central bankers said today that the United States' failure to make further progress in reducing its budget deficit was ''deplorable.''
In its annual economic report, the Bank for International Settlements, often called the central bankers' central bank, said a reduction in Washington's budget deficit is the most important thing that can be done to bring down worldwide interest rates and reduce the soaring value of the dollar.
''The case for using whatever measures are available to reduce the United States Federal deficit has been made so often and so convincingly that the lack of significant further progress is deplorable,'' said the bank, based in Basel, Switzerland. Sharpness Borders on Bitterness
Central bankers have often criticized governments for being too timid to cut budget deficits to help fight inflation. They have also complained that governments usually let central banks do the hard work, like raising interest rates. Nevertheless, in discussing Washington's budget deficit, the Bank for International Settlements spoke with a sharpness, bordering on bitterness, rarely seen in official economic policy circles.
The bank said the American Government has relied too much on the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates to fight inflation, with higher American rates pushing up the dollar's value. The bank said that by making American goods more expensive abroad and foreign goods cheaper, this has undermined efforts to reduce the American trade deficit and cut Japan's and West Germany's trade surplus.
''National control over short-term rates,'' the report stated, can ''pull the exchange market in the opposite direction from that which the fundamentals would warrant.''
In its report, the bank expressed concerns that the process of reducing trade imbalances among the leading industrial nations ''has come to a halt and has in part even been reversed.'' 'Policy of Sustaining'
Speaking about the United States and other countries, the bank said, ''there has been a policy of sustaining rather than reducing'' trade imbalances.
The bankers contended that the process of reducing trade imbalances must be strengthened, expressing fears that nagging imbalances may again threaten the financial markets.
The report said that reducing domestic American consumption, specifically by budget tightening, ''has to take the lead in new efforts to substantially reduce the current-account imbalances among the large industrial countries.''
The report said that by reducing its deficit, Washington would reduce domestic consumption and thus inflation, thereby allowing interest rates to come down.
Two weeks ago in Paris, in a speech to finance ministers of industrial countries, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the Bush Administration had negotiated hard with Congress to bring down the fiscal year 1990 budget deficit to the target of $100 billion set under the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.
Nonetheless, the bank report expressed fears that the American budget deficit would significantly exceed the Gramm-Rudman target as it has in previous years. The bank complained that no progress was made in reducing the underlying deficit last year. It added, ''Nor is any expected in the current financial year.''
The report said the industrial nations ''find ourselves in an exceptional situation in which a major shift in fiscal policy in the largest economy would unambiguously and simultaneously serve'' domestic interests and would help to reduce trade imbalances.
The bank expressed puzzlement as to whether interest rates should be raised or lowered around the world. It said that although there are fears that the tightening of monetary policy may not have succeeded in keeping inflation at bay, there are concerns that further tightening could undermine the boom in capital investment that has helped to increase economic growth.
It said monetary authorities face a difficult choice between further tightening and waiting to see the effectiveness of their earlier actions. ''Should policymakers adopt a 'wait and see' attitude and prove to be wrong, the achievement of bringing inflation down to levels not seen for 20 years will be jeopardized,'' the report said.
The report, written by the bank's general manager, Alexandre Lamfalussy, will be delivered to the central bankers when they hold their annual meeting in Basel on Monday.

Will Reagan's Luck Outlast Reagan?

Publication info: New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]01 Jan 1989: A.11.

Abstract: He regularly mangled facts, and his small talk was the stuff of vaudeville. He once referred to President Samuel Doe of Liberia as ''Chairman Moe.'' He introduced the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and his wife to Nancy Reagan as ''Sugar Ray and Mrs. Ray.'' He laughed about his work habits. ''It's true hard work never killed anybody,'' he said in 1987, ''but I figure, why take the chance?'' Some believe that Mr. Reagan's hidden purpose was a ''strategic deficit'' that would slam the door on any future social spending. That's not clear. But whether the deficits arose from a failure to understand economics or, in the words of economist Benjamin Friedman, ''moral irresponsibility on a truly astonishing scale,'' they have left George Bush with a huge problem. It's too early to judge the consequences of the Reagan era. It's also too early to give it a name, although Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has taken a look and called it ''this mindless decade.'' It is better than that. Any President would be proud to claim some of Mr. Reagan's major accomplishments: beating inflation, reforming the tax code, controlling arms and muting regional conflicts.

Full text: LEAD: Ronald Reagan, who knows something about scripts, is busily writing one of his own to guide future historians. They are likely to ignore it. His simplistic gloss does little justice to eight years full of contradiction and surprise.
Ronald Reagan, who knows something about scripts, is busily writing one of his own to guide future historians. They are likely to ignore it. His simplistic gloss does little justice to eight years full of contradiction and surprise.
Moreover, while he surely has a right to be proud of much of his legacy, some of his triumphs were achieved at what could be great cost. The tax cuts and defense buildup brought an immediate sense of satisfaction to many people. But they may also have placed painful claims on the future. And many problems were hardly addressed at all.
Ronald Reagan leaves no Vietnam War, no Watergate, no hostage crisis. But he leaves huge question marks - and much to do.
Mr. Reagan made good on his basic agenda -lifting spirits, lowering taxes, improving defenses. Yet his tenure was marked also by discontinuities - promises unmet, achievements few foresaw. Pledging a ''revolution in ideas,'' he hardly disturbed the nation's political or ideological balance. A self-proclaimed fiscal conservative, he presided over a staggering increase in foreign and domestic debt.
A lazy and inattentive man, sometimes dreamily disengaged from reality, he engineered basic changes in domestic and foreign policy. An avowed enemy of the Soviet Union, he left relations with Moscow in much better shape than he found them. An enemy of activist government, he was anything but passive, and may even have left people with a better opinion of government.
His greatest asset was that the country was ready for him, or someone like him. It was, as he correctly noted in the 1980 campaign, down in the mouth, tired of dour Jimmy Carter, wounded by the hostage crisis, dispirited by inflation. Mr. Reagan brought to this yearning for a sturdier society the promise of a ''morning in America,'' an infectious optimism, a sense of humor and a personality remarkably free of meanness or ugliness.
He regularly mangled facts, and his small talk was the stuff of vaudeville. He once referred to President Samuel Doe of Liberia as ''Chairman Moe.'' He introduced the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and his wife to Nancy Reagan as ''Sugar Ray and Mrs. Ray.'' He laughed about his work habits. ''It's true hard work never killed anybody,'' he said in 1987, ''but I figure, why take the chance?''
But the country laughed with him. It liked him and trusted him. That trust was the basis of his Teflon. It cracked once, when word got out in November 1986 that he had tried to trade arms for hostages, defying all previous pledges. His popularity dropped 20 points overnight. Triumphs and Time Bombs
At home, Mr. Reagan's great achievement was to restore confidence in the economy. He brought inflation down from 13 percent in 1980 to about 4 percent today. The country paid a price: double-digit unemployment and a severe recession. But since then there have been six straight years of recovery and expansion - the most in peacetime history. Employment is the highest ever; unemployment is down to 5.3 percent.
He also cut personal income tax rates and revamped - at a cost of more than $2 trillion - the military. He pretended that his third objective, balancing the budget, would be achieved by cutting domestic spending and by greater growth stimulated by lower taxes. But the supply-side fantasy turned out to be just that. The result was a calamitous rise in the Federal debt from $900 billion to $2.3 trillion, and a concurrent rise in foreign debt to half a trillion dollars.
Some believe that Mr. Reagan's hidden purpose was a ''strategic deficit'' that would slam the door on any future social spending. That's not clear. But whether the deficits arose from a failure to understand economics or, in the words of economist Benjamin Friedman, ''moral irresponsibility on a truly astonishing scale,'' they have left George Bush with a huge problem.
There were other failures. For all the talk about the social ''safety net,'' more families live below the poverty line now than in 1980. Children fared especially badly: nearly one in four live below that line. On drugs, he offered more rhetoric than resources. On the homeless, he repeatedly served up the silly notion that the homeless are homeless by choice. Little was done to protect the environment, much to exploit it for private gain.
On these and other issues Mr. Reagan's mangling of the facts wasn't funny at all, instead betraying a callous indifference.
Remember the vodka story? When Mr. Reagan took heat for his failure to keep the food stamp program apace with the cost of food and the people who needed stamps, he told of the woman who bought an orange with food stamps and a bottle of vodka with the change. Colorful - but wrong. Change from food stamps is limited to 99 cents, which, in any case, is hardly enough for vodka.
Or killer trees? ''Approximately 80 percent of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation, so let's not go overboard on setting and enforcing tough emission standards from man-made sources,'' he said in 1980. Wrong on at least two counts. Man-made oxides really hurt. Trees actually help clean the atmosphere. Abroad: Staying the Course
Foreign policy produced his most surprising successes. True, his policies in Central America haven't worked. His stubborn insistence on a military solution defied diplomacy. His decision to send Marines to Lebanon was disastrous, his invasion of Grenada melodramatic.
But elsewhere he did well. He punished Colonel Qaddafi, sent arms to the Afghan guerrillas and ships to the Persian Gulf. His measured use of American power arguably contributed to a decline in terrorism, the Soviet decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, and the Iran-Iraq cease-fire in the Gulf.
Similarly, despite nervousness in Europe and at home, he deployed Pershing II missiles aimed at the Soviet Union, and stuck with his so-called ''zero option'' for six years. It worked. The treaty banning intermediate-range missiles - the first arms-control agreement since 1972 - was entirely on Mr. Reagan's terms.
Mr. Reagan was lucky - lucky to survive an assassination attempt, lucky even in his enemies. Much of what he accomplished abroad might not have been possible without the emergence of Mikhail Gorbachev, who for his own reasons chose to seek accommodation. Still, Mr. Reagan's firmness and patience weighed heavily in the scale.
It's too early to judge the consequences of the Reagan era. It's also too early to give it a name, although Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has taken a look and called it ''this mindless decade.'' It is better than that. Any President would be proud to claim some of Mr. Reagan's major accomplishments: beating inflation, reforming the tax code, controlling arms and muting regional conflicts.
If asked whether they feel better off than they did eight years ago, many Americans would surely say yes. But many would not. Mr. Reagan asked the country to dream dreams, and it has. Yet as Hugh Heclo, a Harvard professor, noted in a recent essay, ''these were necessarily dreams of private advantage, not public accomplishment.''
Just as he promised, Mr. Reagan's social gospel celebrated individualism. At its best, this gospel sought to release private energies; at its worst, it too easily tolerated money-grubbing and, among his own associates, sleazy behavior.
There was virtually no talk about collective purpose, sacrifice, hard choices. The worry, therefore, is that Mr. Reagan may have borrowed too heavily against the future to gratify the present. History may prove him lucky again. But which of us, George Bush included, dares to bet on it?

Abstract: [Carla Hills] has already served with distinction in the Cabinet under President Ford and I'm pleased to ask her back to the Cabinet table as the United States Trade Representative. As a member of my Cabinet she'll serve as our trade minister at home and abroad. There are many challenges facing the United States in the trade area. The mid-term review of the current GATT round which Clayton Yeutter is working on as we speak, the implementation of the new trade bill and the great opportunity presented by the Free Trade Agreement that we've signed with our neighbor Canada. Carla's wide experience in Government - she's been Secretary of H.U.D. and Assistant Attorney General; and in law - she's now the co-managing partner of a, of the Weil Gotschal firm here; and in leadership positions in several companies and professional organizations are going to serve us very well. And she's traveled widely abroad. Domestically, she is a tough no-nonsense attorney and Carla and I have spoken about the need to work aggressively to expand trade opportunities for American companies. And she stands for free trade and fair trade. And I'm very very pleased that she will be a part of my Administration. A. Well, my philosophy is that the law should be meticulously followed. I do believe that from time to time properly found covert actions are essential, and I know [Bill Webster] feels exactly the same way. And I think that - I don't think there'll be any difference at all. And you notice I said ''properly found.'' I don't know whether I'll promulgate a new executive order on that or not, but we follow the existing executive order to a T. We will -those orders will be properly found and properly reported to the appropriate commission. Jerry, and then you. Membership on the Cabinet A. I have some time, but I have to take the offense. And I've made clear to the Speaker and to Senator Dole and to Senator Mitchell that it is my responsibility to do that. And how, what that means in terms of form I'm not quite sure yet, haven't defined it. We haven't, we're just fleshing out our economic team here today. And I'd like to keep in a self-serving sense pointing out, I think we're quite a bit ahead of where previous President-elects have been in the selection of these teams.

Following is a transcript of portions of President-elect Bush's news conference yesterday in Washington, as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of Cable Network News and ABC Radio News: OPENING STATEMENT
I have several announcements to make and they're part of a [ laughter ] - pay a little attention here - part of a continuing effort to appoint people of talent and distinction to senior positions in Government service. And I said that naming an economic team would be one of the early priorities of my transition and today I want to nominate the remainder of that top team. There are other very important posts to fill but this is the remainder of the very top team.
First I intend to submit the name of Robert Mosbacher, a friend of long standing, a very successful leader in the business community, as my nominee for Secretary of Commerce. I've known Bob for longer than he'd like to admit, but for more than 30 years. He's built a very successful business. He currently serves as the chairman and chief executive officer of the Mosbacher Energy Company of Houston. He is a leader, not only in the energy industry but in the business community nationally. He serves as a director of several companies, nonprofit organizations as well, national business organizations, including the A.P.I., American Petroleum Institute, and the American Business Conference, which brings together a lot of the leaders of the strongest and somewhat newer companies. Also he's been very active in that in terms of the high-growth companies.
Bob's going to bring his tremendous energies to the task of promoting U.S. exports abroad. Another major responsibility will be to carry out the oldest functions of the U.S. Government - that's the administration of the 1990 Census. He'll bring a wealth of experience to the department and I'll be glad to have his wise counsel in my Cabinet and I'm grateful to him for once again responding to the call. Carla Hills as Trade Representative
Carla Hills has already served with distinction in the Cabinet under President Ford and I'm pleased to ask her back to the Cabinet table as the United States Trade Representative. As a member of my Cabinet she'll serve as our trade minister at home and abroad. There are many challenges facing the United States in the trade area. The mid-term review of the current GATT round which Clayton Yeutter is working on as we speak, the implementation of the new trade bill and the great opportunity presented by the Free Trade Agreement that we've signed with our neighbor Canada. Carla's wide experience in Government - she's been Secretary of H.U.D. and Assistant Attorney General; and in law - she's now the co-managing partner of a, of the Weil Gotschal firm here; and in leadership positions in several companies and professional organizations are going to serve us very well. And she's traveled widely abroad. Domestically, she is a tough no-nonsense attorney and Carla and I have spoken about the need to work aggressively to expand trade opportunities for American companies. And she stands for free trade and fair trade. And I'm very very pleased that she will be a part of my Administration.
The third key member of the economic team that I'm announcing today - you might say Carla is a Californian - is another Californian - the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Dr. Michael Boskin is one of this nation's pre-eminent economists, currently serving as the Wohlford Professor of Economics at Stanford University. Professor Boskin has worked with me in these past few years to formulate a strategy to continue to create economic growth in this country. And I'll be grateful to have his expertise in this Administration. Boskin to Head Economic Council
He is no stranger to Washington - served on several national commissions; testified many times before the Congress. He's also widely published on Government spending and taxing, U.S. saving behavior, capital formation; many other critical subjects. And he's been voted by the students at Stanford as one of the university's outstanding teachers. And so I have great hope that I can learn from him in the future just as I have in the past. And I know he is committed to jobs and opportunity for all Americans through low tax rates and low inflation and I look forward to working with him in charting the courses ahead.
Now there are two other announcements this afternoon that are unrelated or beyond the economic team. And these are in the area of foreign policy and national security.
First I've asked Bill Webster to continue to serve as Director of Central Intelligence. I know this agency well, having served as its director for a short time. I have total confidence that he is the man - the best man - to build and lead our national intelligence community. It's been - what? - 21 months since Bill Webster was appointed by President Reagan to serve in this post. But in that short time period, he's shown his ability to lead, to inspire confidence, to work with the Congress. Prior to that, of course, he served nine years as an outstanding director of the F.B.I. and prior to that as a Federal judge, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals and then U.S. District Court as well. My own view is that it is important for there to be some continuity in executing the mission of our intelligence agencies. And Bill Webster's continuing service will help set a healthy precedent. I'm grateful to him for agreeing to stay on.
And my final announcement is about another post that I know well, that I remember fondly, that I, I put as the foremost diplomatic appointment that I have to make. Recent events have made the post of United States Ambassador to the United Nations increasingly important. I believe I know the limitations of the U.N. But I also know of its tremendous potential. And so it's only fitting that my choice for U.N. Ambassador should be an individual with truly exceptional experience. Thomas Pickering, the current United States Ambassador in Israel, has given a lifetime of service to this nation. He served as Ambassador to El Salvador, to Nigeria, Jordan in the past, and as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and Environment and Scientific Affairs.
I have a high regard for our nation's Foreign Service. I've worked with Foreign Service Officers when I was - headed the Mission in China and at the United Nations as well and as Vice President. And Tom Pickering is one of our outstanding public servants and very, very top Foreign Service officers. His expertise will serve our nation well at the United Nations and I am delighted that he has agreed to take this post. It symbolizes the importance I place on the United Nations as well as on the Foreign Service.
And so I'd like to ask each of these individuals - four - to just say - have their say and then I'd be glad to take a few questions. And then if you can talk them into taking questions, why they might do the same. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Covert Action and Intelligence
Q. Mr. Vice President, do you have a common understanding with Mr. Webster on what is the place of covert action in the intelligence work of the United States? There have been reports that [ unintelligible ] . Can you tell us what your philosophy is?
A. Well, my philosophy is that the law should be meticulously followed. I do believe that from time to time properly found covert actions are essential, and I know Bill feels exactly the same way. And I think that - I don't think there'll be any difference at all. And you notice I said ''properly found.'' I don't know whether I'll promulgate a new executive order on that or not, but we follow the existing executive order to a T. We will -those orders will be properly found and properly reported to the appropriate commission. Jerry, and then you. Membership on the Cabinet
Q. Mr. Vice President, will the U.N. Ambassador and the C.I.A. director be members of your Cabinet? And did you discuss with Mr. Webster any time period under which he should serve?
A. No, they will not be. But both will attend Cabinet meetings as they impact on their fields of interest. There is no point in the United Nations Ambassador sitting around, as I did for a while, talking about ag policy. If there's an N.S.C. meeting or a Cabinet meeting that impacts on the mission at the United Nations, Ambassador Pickering will be at the table.
I like this, because I want to have an orderly flow in foreign policy making - the foreign policy making. And the Ambassador should report, in my view, to the President through the Secretary of State. Bill Webster now is operating in our Administration, President Reagan's and mine, in this manner. I think it's working in effectively. And he will be included in those - in those meetings that affect where, where we have to make decision based on intelligence.
Bill and I are in total accord that this D.C.I. should be - not be in the policy business, but be in the intelligence business. And these lines can be very, very clear. He's in policy when a covert operation is found and he must manage that. But I think that this arrangement is the best in terms of good government.
Q. Mr. Vice President --
A. I didn't answer the last part of his.
Q. Did you discuss how long you want Mr. Webster to serve at any time?
A. Yes. Open-ended. Role at Gorbachev Meeting
Q. On the eve of tomorrow's minisummit, is there a risk because of Gorbachev's aggressiveness and his appeal and his use of propaganda, if you will, in the fact that you are deliberately taking a secondary role and then President Reagan is on the eve of his departure? Is Gorbachev going to be the main player? And is there a down side for you in the policy on that?
A. There's no down side on policy. The Soviets know how our system works, and they know that I become President on Jan. 20. They also know - because you've given me an opportunity to define my expectations for the summit - how I feel on it. And so I will go there as Vice President. I will not be accompanied by members of my own national security team, and I'm confident that the Soviets understand that. And I'm confident they know our system well enough to know that it is only prudent to review foreign policy and to review national security policy and, certainly, to review our relationship with them.
Having said that, I will make clear to the President that we want to go forward. But I'm not going to be pressed into going beyond that prudent approach. Hopes for Soviet Changes
Q. But during the campaign, in fact, you seemed to be a little more cautious about Mr. Gorbachev than President Reagan has been in recent statments. Do you think that perhaps we've invested too much hope in real change in the Soviet Union?
A. No. I want to - I hope that we have a reason to help be a catalyst for real change. To work with - effectively with the Soviets to - to better our relationship and, certainly, to encourage in the field of human rights more openness. That's a policy of the U.S. now and it will be the policy when I become President.
But, no, this doesn't concern me. I think that it - I think it's only prudent to get your own people together; set out your own priorities, and not go off - charging off without the benefit of those to whom I'm going to look for advice. Status of the Cold War
Q. Soviet officials said over the weekend that the cold war may be fading and may be over. You said during the campaign, I believe, that you don't believe the cold war is over. On the eve of Secretary Gorbachev's visit, could you tell us your opinion on the state of the cold war? Is it fading, is it over?
A. I don't, I don't, I'm not going to respond in terms of those words. You have to define for me what you mean by cold war. Do we have any differences with the Soviets? Absolutely. Are they regional? Yeah. Are they on human rights? Yes. Do we have some differences on how we ought to approach the arms control agenda? Certainly. But do I see, am I optimistic about what I see in the Soviet Union? Absolutely.
And you just take a look at the human rights question. There's been some good forward steps there. And I want to see more.
I think that, I think we come into a great period of opportunity in terms of reduction of regional tensions. But there's an awful lot that the Soviets can do to make me feel I'm right in that.
I think that the arms control agenda is one where we have a chance for real progress. But there's some big problems. I keep talking about my commitment on chemical weapons and biological weapons - love to be the one to lead the free world and then work with the Soviets to, and other countries to ban these weapons. But it is an extraordinarily difficult verification problem. So we got to start talking at an appropriate time with them about that kind of thing.
So, I don't like to use these code words because they mean different things to different people. Yeah. Reaction to a Surprise Offer
Q. Mr. Bush, you may be prudent, but if Gorbachev makes a Christmas surprise tomorrow to propose some kind of grandiose, but self-serving, conventional arms reduction, for example, Congress may not be prudent. The public opinion may not be prudent and in fact, may try to pre-empt an orderly negotiating process by even beginning in January to discuss troop reductions in response to that proposal. What would you do to prevent that kind of --
A. I would make clear to the Soviets that it's the President of the United States that is going to set the foreign policy and the national security of the policy of this country, working with the Congress. And I see no likelihood of that. That is so hypothetical that I see no likelihood of that happening whatsoever. Yeah. Selection of Defense Secretary
Q. Sir, is it true what I read in the paper about you? That you have surveyed the reports given you about Senator Tower's womanizing and alcoholism and about his representing foreign and domestic defense contractors, and you don't think that's any deterrent in his being made Secretary of Defense?
A. I'm not sure you were at the last one of these minipress conferences we had. But I said then that I wasn't prepared to discuss the, the, who might be Secretary of Defense or anything about that until it got a little further along. And I'm in the same mode today. So I would prefer not to respond.
Q. -- but I want to know if what I read in the paper, that you've already surveyed these reports and that they mean nothing to you. That you have said, in the paper today you were quoted as saying that doesn't impress me at all. I still think he ought to be the Secretary of Defense.
A. You have to - Look, I don't want to go into this, because I don't know which reports you're talking about. There's so many out there, but I just will leave it that way. I have a great, high regard for Senator Tower. And so if you're talking about negative reports, I'm disinclined to believe anything of that nature. Yeah. Dealing With the Deficit
Q. There's considerable debate over how much time you have, sir, to come up with a serious and definitive plan for dealing with the deficit once you take office. Do you feel that you have to go in with both guns blazing? Or do you have some time to deal with it.
A. I have some time, but I have to take the offense. And I've made clear to the Speaker and to Senator Dole and to Senator Mitchell that it is my responsibility to do that. And how, what that means in terms of form I'm not quite sure yet, haven't defined it. We haven't, we're just fleshing out our economic team here today. And I'd like to keep in a self-serving sense pointing out, I think we're quite a bit ahead of where previous President-elects have been in the selection of these teams.
So, but in terms of the urgency of the problem, I do feel the urgency of getting something moving on the deficit front. And I'll do my level best to do that early on and take the offense. What I think they're concerned about is that I'll turn to the Congress and say this is your problem. I will not do that. I'm going to lead. Yes, Jerry. Need for a Tax Increase
Q. You had a chance to discuss the budget with Congressman Rostenkowski today. He apparently suggested a gasoline tax might be a good idea and has said in the last few days that he might feel compelled to try to raise marginal tax rates if you proceed with a capital gains tax reduction. Do you want to respond to the chairman?
A. Well, only that we didn't go into that detail with him, but having known him a long time and him having known me a long time, he knows my position. And I pointed out to him out there, I don't remember Congressmen, a lot of your colleagues on either side of the aisle running on the necessity of a tax increase. Maybe I'm missing something. Give me a few names. And look, he's a very experienced chairman of that tax-writing committee. And I know him well. And I can work with him. But I'm go out there and do what I said I'd do. And I think he understands that. Now, does he differ with it in some ways? I'm sure he does. Yeah. Minorities in Leadership
Q. A few weeks ago, you said that you had a good list of very talented minorities for consideration in your administration. If the list is so good, if the minorities on the list are so talented, why haven't we seen them?
A. You've seen one. If you call - if you consider Hispanics minorities, you've seen my pledge fulfilled. And I'd like to get more. But stay tuned; we're only about halfway through this act.
Yeah, two more and then I'm going get - one, two. Then I quit. Cutbacks and the Deficit
Q. Mr. Vice President, you have talked about your flexible freeze as a way of dealing with the budget deficit, and it seems that boils down to a call for Congress to give you the ball in what cuts they make. And yet you have been unwilling to suggest to us what programs might be restrained. Are you willing to take that now, since obviously you have seen enough in programs that you feel you might be able to restrain to balance the --the get rid of the budget deficit?
A. Absolutely. When I'm President of the United States, I'll do that. Yes. Speculation About Tower
Q. On the Tower question, would you at least endorse Craig Fuller's statement that nothing has come to the transition team that would indicate that Senator Tower in any way would be disqualfied from serving?
A. Sure, I'd say that. But I don't want to get into the speculation that I'm trying to stay out of. But in fairness to the man, I'd say that, absolutely. All right, that's it.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

Abstract: ''If it is slow and gradual and not too drastic, it will not have a whole lot of impact, said Richard W. Rahn, vice president and chief economist of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. ''I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.'' ''There is a dream scenario,'' said Rudiger Dornbush, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, speaking of a decline in the dollar coupled with a decline in the budget deficit. ''But if the fiscal adjustment does not come, the dream scenario turns into a nightmare. It becomes inflation.'' Some economists do not believe that the dollar needs to decline at all. Mr. Rahn of the Chamber of Commerce is betting that inflation in the United States will be lower over the next several years than in Europe and Japan. ''If you have an economy growing at a good rate with inflation at low levels, these problems are largely self-correcting,'' he said, referring to the trade deficit.

The sharp decline of the dollar last week and the effort by President-elect Bush to stabilize it this week are only the latest round in a long-running debate about the proper level of the dollar.
The dollar declined slightly yesterday, after rising Monday in response to supportive comments by Mr. Bush, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Japanese and West German officials and the intervention of central banks.
The dollar debate has raged through most of the Reagan Presidency, involving politicians, central bankers, business people and economists from the major industrialized nations. Ultimately the level of the dollar affects the trade deficit, interest rates and inflation.
The dollar rose through much of the early 1980's, hitting a peak against other major currencies in February 1985.
But the strong dollar had several troublesome consequences. It was widely blamed for damaging American exports of agricultural and manufactured goods. And by lowering the price of imported products, it encouraged American consumers to go on a buying binge that led to an enormous increase in the nation's trade deficit.
Since September 1985, the Administration, in cooperation with its economic allies, has worked to bring the dollar down, and it has fallen about 50 percent from its highs.
Now the markets are looking for signals on what the Bush Administration's dollar policy will be.
Many economists and foreign-exchange traders are convinced that the dollar must fall still further to reduce the persistent United States trade deficit, which has not shrunk as fast as many anticipated when the dollar began to decline.
This view has become so widely held that many traders are predicting that the dollar will continue to decline just because they think that it is the right economic policy and that the Bush Administration will have to follow it. A lower dollar helps to reduce the deficit by making United States products less expensive abroad while imports become more costly for Americans to buy.
Mr. Bush seemed to say the opposite - that a weaker dollar is not a desirable goal - with his effort on Monday to calm the markets, an effort that was joined by Japanese and West German officials and supported by central banks' market intervention to bolster the dollar.
But Mr. Bush spoke only of ''exchange market stability,'' which does not necessarily mean that the Administration wants to keep the dollar at its present level. Rather, it means that he wants to avoid a sharp, fast drop in the dollar that could create uncertainty, spilling over into the stock and bond markets and shaking investor confidence in the American economy.
Even some economists who favor a stronger dollar believe that an orderly and moderate decline will not have a major impact on the economy.
''If it is slow and gradual and not too drastic, it will not have a whole lot of impact, said Richard W. Rahn, vice president and chief economist of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. ''I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.''
But while the further, gradual decline of the dollar should help improve the trade deficit, it would pose other problems. The main danger is inflation. First, a lower dollar raises prices in the United States by making imports more expensive. It also can create price pressure if it spurs export production at a time when factories are operating at or near full capacity and unemployment is low, as is the case now.
Also, if the dollar falls foreign investors may be reluctant to invest in Treasury securities unless interest rates rise. Investment by foreigners in Treasury securities is considered crucial to financing the Federal budget deficit.
In light of those concerns, some economists believe that if the dollar continues to decline without action by the White House and Congress to reduce the Federal trade deficit, the economy will be harmed.
''There is a dream scenario,'' said Rudiger Dornbush, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, speaking of a decline in the dollar coupled with a decline in the budget deficit. ''But if the fiscal adjustment does not come, the dream scenario turns into a nightmare. It becomes inflation.''
Some economists believe the dollar must decline substantially. Martin S. Feldstein, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan Administration and an adviser to the Bush campaign, has said many times that the dollar has to fall as much as 20 percent over the next several years or the trade deficit will not narrow. He repeated these comments just after the election and the dollar declined, although he said he was speaking for himself. Later in the week, Bush advisers said his remarks were not a statement of Bush policy.
One of the main reasons Mr. Feldstein is calling for such a steep decline is that he expects inflation to be higher in the United States over the next few years than in Europe or Japan. Thus, he wants the dollar to drop to offset the increased prices of American goods caused by inflation.
Some economists do not believe that the dollar needs to decline at all. Mr. Rahn of the Chamber of Commerce is betting that inflation in the United States will be lower over the next several years than in Europe and Japan. ''If you have an economy growing at a good rate with inflation at low levels, these problems are largely self-correcting,'' he said, referring to the trade deficit.
John Lipsky, director of bond market research at Salomon Brothers, also believes that the dollar does not need to decline more. He said there are indications that the dollar is not significantly overvalued at this time and is not hurting the competitiveness of American exports. Price is only one factor in determining whether American goods sell overseas.
Mr. Lipsky believes that a significant decline would not be much of a help to exports but would still increase inflation. Last May Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, made this argument in saying that a further significant decline of the dollar was not called for. The dollar, which rallied this summer before its autumn decline, was at about the same level as it is now.
As the debate continues, uncertainty itself becomes a problem. A declining dollar, even one that is dropping slowly, can create uncertainity because investors do not know when the decline is going to stop. This can discourage investment from abroad and lead foreigners to sell their dollar holdings. The dollar selling by itself could precipitate a sharper decline in the dollar than was wanted.
''The prospective fear of a decline can discourage investment flows,'' said David C. Munro, senior corporate forecaster at the General Motors Corporation.

Full text: LEAD: Secretary of State George P. Shultz urged Asian nations today to resist trade protectionism and keep their markets open.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz urged Asian nations today to resist trade protectionism and keep their markets open.
In what was described as a major economic policy speech to the Indonesian Economist Association, Mr. Shultz praised Japan for making structural reforms to encourage growth at home, expand world trade and prevent a global recession, and he faulted West Germany as not taking enough steps in that direction.
He criticized the members of the Association of South East Asian Nations for retaining high tariffs, often with import licensing and other non-tariff constraints.
''Such trade barriers in Asia provide a rallying point for those in the United States who wish to increase protectionism and, from an Asian point of view, also reduce competition and consumer choice at home,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''To this I can only say that protectionism is arson that eventually burns down everyone's house.'' Rigid Policies Criticized
The Secretary said Asian countries should abandon rigid structural policies because, he said, they prop up inefficient industries, subsidize exports and restrict foreign investment. The Association of South East Asian Nations consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
As for the United States, Mr. Shultz portrayed its economy mainly in terms of achievement. He surprised some people in the audience by praising the American trade deficit.
He said that when the history of the 1980's is written ''it will be recognized that the growth of the United States trade deficit, with all of its potentially troublesome implications, was a mutually beneficial development, enabling world trade to expand while helping our own economic growth to proceed without inflation.'' A sentence acknowledging that this trend could not be indefinitely sustained was deleted from the final draft of the speech, an American official said.
Mr. Shultz also proposed the creation of an intergovernmental group in Asia that could be modeled on the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. Functions of a Forum
An Asian organization, he said, would offer a forum ''where like-minded countries could compare experiences, discuss ideas and prepare analyses on subjects that are of interest to most countries in the region,'' he said. Mr. Shultz cited problems that such a forum could deal with, including investment policy, deregulation, tax revision and privatization.
Japan favors the idea. In a San Francisco speech last March, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone called for an Asian version of the O.E.C.D.
But other Asian countries have expressed concern that Japan - with its sophisticated economic structure, its extraordinary prosperity and its status as the only Asian partner in the Group of Seven industrial democracies - would try to dictate policies to its Asian trading partners.
In an effort to dispel a growing perception in Asia that the United States is a great power in decline while nations like Japan are on the rise, Mr. Shultz said the United States was ''doing just fine'' in adapting to change and was enjoying ''unprecedented growth and prosperity.''

Full text: LEAD: The dollar's recent rally has exposed a rift in the worldwide policy coordination that has governed the currency markets since 1985, when the United States and its allies agreed to force a big decline in the dollar.
The dollar's recent rally has exposed a rift in the worldwide policy coordination that has governed the currency markets since 1985, when the United States and its allies agreed to force a big decline in the dollar.
For political and economic reasons, the Japanese are now cooperating with the Americans in allowing the dollar to rise against the yen and other currencies. But the West Germans have been resisting the two-week-old rally at every turn.
The rift shows how hard it is to coordinate world economic policy when individual domestic concerns conflict, and it could be a lesson for the United States and European nations that are moving toward a more unified economic system in the 1990's. Confusion and Volatility
The opposite moves being made daily in the currency markets by the Germans and the Japanese have created confusion, added volatility to the dollar's movements and fostered the suspicion that the harmonious dollar policy of the United States and its industrial allies that has been followed for the last two and a half years may be in jeopardy.
While there is no open break, something could be brewing. The cooperation between the United States and Japan during the dollar's rise has been so unusual that it has even led to speculation in the markets that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, a close ally of Vice President Bush, and the Japanese Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, have reached a private agreement on the dollar.
''The changes are not enough yet for major tensions,'' said John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''But if the Europeans think the Japanese are too willing to take a mark appreciation, that could lead to tension. I can see the possibility that something might emerge.''
''It's a difference of where they put their priorities,'' added Stephen H. Axilrod of Nikko Securities.
A rising dollar is good economics and politics for the Reagan Administration and Vice President Bush in this election year. It reduces the prospects of rising inflation because it lowers the cost of imports. It could make the trade-deficit figures look better in the short run because the total value of imports will decline. And it reduces the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to curb inflation.
Japan seems willing to support the United States for several reasons. One is diplomatic. Given the strained relations between the two countries over Japan's trade surplus, the Japanese Government apparently wants to take this opportunity to cooperate. In addition, Japanese officials have said that so far they are not worried about the immediate inflationary consequences of a run-up of the dollar. The reason, said one Japanese analyst, was that the Government expects the dollar to fall back from the current 133-yen level to around 125. Germans Feel Threatened
But the West Germans feel threatened by the rising dollar. Because a higher dollar increases the cost of imports, it raises the fear of inflation, the prospect for higher interest rates and the chances of a less competitive stance abroad - particularly in competition with the Japanese.
For Germany, the rise in the dollar presents both short-term and long-term problems - a double whammy that has forced the Government to try to stop the rise with both large dollar sales and increases in interest rates.
In the short term, the lower mark means that commodities, like oil, are more expensive for the Germans because they are priced in dollars.
''They have a tremendous fear of inflation,'' said Craig S. Shular, manager of foreign exchange risk at Union Carbide. For Germany, which was ravaged by inflation after World War I, even small rises create political and economic problems. Raising Interest Rates
The threat of inflation and the depreciating mark have already forced the Germans to raise key interest rates to defend the mark. And if the dollar continues to rise, another increase is likely.
The global split also means the yen is falling against the dollar faster than the mark, which means the yen is also falling against the mark. That results in lower import costs for Japanese goods - a worrisome trend for German manufacturers.
In addition, the Germans worry that in the long term, an appreciating dollar will slow or stop the shrinking of the United States trade deficit. All the major industrial nations agree that this would be damaging because it could spur protectionism and set off a sharp drop in the dollar that could push the world economy into recession.
''This is asymmetrical,'' said Horst Schulmann, managing director of the Institute of International Finance in Washington and a one-time adviser to the former German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt. ''In the short run it is good for the United States. But in the short run and the long run it is not good for the Germans.'' 'Cool Reaction' From Japan
He added, ''I was a little bit surprised by the cool reaction of the Japanese authorities.''
In Japan, the situation is different. ''One mystery is what the Japanese attitude is,'' said Frank Watson, vice president of the Swiss Bank Corporation. The split reflects ''a different political situation in Japan,'' he said.
''The yen has been extremely strong, which hurts export industries. I think it's much more difficult for the Japanese to be seen to keep the dollar down as long as Baker does not mind the dollar going up,'' he added.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, suggested that the Japanese willingness to cooperate with the Reagan Administration may be in partial repayment for the cooperation Mr. Baker showed in 1986 to help then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone politically.
Beyond the diplomatic and political reasons, there is less fear of inflation in Japan because prices are stable and the overall health of the economy gives Japan more flexibility than West Germany. In addition, the economy is less open than West Germany's, which means the yen depreciation has less impact on prices. Dazzling Adjustment
The economic strength is a product of Japan's rapid and dazzling adjustment in the last two years to a stronger yen, a weaker dollar and the need to curb exports. This was done by stimulating domestic demand by encouraging the Japanese to buy.
''Their concern is to restructure their economy, and a small depreciation in the yen will not hurt that,'' said Mr. Williamson of the economics institute.
Yoshindo Takahashi, president of the Nomura Research Institute of Technology in New York, said, ''Basically, the Japanese are less worried about inflation.''
Economists, including some working for Japan's central bank, have indicated that a yen between 130 and 135 to the dollar will not have a major impact on prices.
Mr. Takahashi also said the Japanese have flexibility because he thinks they believe the dollar will fall again and the yen will recover. Since the lows reached in December, the dollar is up about 16 percent against the mark but about 10 percent against the yen. Doubts on Letting Yen Fall
But despite the apparent harmony with the United States, there are emerging doubts in Japan over how far to allow the yen to fall.
The key problem is that Japan has been able to adjust to a strong yen. Even at 120 yen to the dollar - the year's low - the Japanese seem able to remain competitive. This means a weakening yen could stimulate their exports even more. The level that some Japanese officials worry about is 135 to 140, not far from yesterday's 133 level in New York.
The higher level would increase the Japanese trade surplus and quickly aggravate its trade problems with the United States. Such a development would raise the possibility of retaliatory action in the new Administration, especially if it is Democratic. And this is what the Japanese appear to be trying to avoid by cooperating with the United States now.

IMMIGRATION LAW IS FAILING TO CUT FLOW FROM MEXICO

Author: LARRY ROHTER, Special to the New York Times

Abstract: ''There's thousands and thousands of people in Mexico City looking for jobs that just don't exist,'' said Emiliano Benitez, a 37-year-old farm worker from the state of Morelos, just south of Mexico City, who was traveling with his 16-year-old son, Esteban. ''With the dollar worth 2,300 pesos and jobs available for the asking, look how much you can earn in the United States.'' As a result, men who in the past came up north alone in the spring and returned to Mexico for the Christmas and New Year holidays now appear to be sending for their wives and children. Dr. [Wayne Cornelius] said his researchers had observed that ''housing densities in California neighborhoods where undocumented migrants live are increasing'' at the same time that some sending areas in Mexico ''are being turned into ghost towns.'' #47 Percent of Houses Closed ''In one village in Michoacan I recently visited, 47 percent of the houses were closed, some locked up with chains, because everybody in the household is in the United States,'' he said. ''The neighbors who have stayed behind told us that more wives and children have gone up this year than ever before.'' ''It's harder to cross, but we do get across, if not on the first try, then on the second, third or fourth,'' said Manuel Mendez Roldan, a 40-year-old who has been coming to work in the United States every summer since 1970. ''They can't close the border to us, no matter how hard they try.''

Full text: LEAD: The 1986 immigration law is failing to stem the illegal flow of Mexicans into the United States and may be creating new problems on both sides of the border by distorting traditional immigration patterns, Mexican and American researchers say.
The 1986 immigration law is failing to stem the illegal flow of Mexicans into the United States and may be creating new problems on both sides of the border by distorting traditional immigration patterns, Mexican and American researchers say.
Studies by immigration specialists at the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana and the Center for United States-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego, indicate that the number of Mexicans illegally seeking work in the United States has actually increased in recent months.
The data also show that these illegal immigrants are staying in the United States longer, are increasingly arriving in family groups and are coming in growing numbers from parts of Mexico that have not sent many migrants in the past. No Effect on Flow Seen
''There is no sign the legislation has had any impact on the flows,'' said Jorge Bustamante, director of the College of the Northern Border, a Mexican research institute that studies immigration and other social issues. ''The basic, underlying pattern has not changed in any significant way.''
Wayne Cornelius, director of the Center for United States-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego, offered a similar picture.
''Clearly, we have reached the end of the period of fear, uncertainty and confusion about the 1986 law among workers still based in Mexico,'' he said. ''Those who delayed migration to the U.S. during 1987 are now coming, having observed that work is still available even for new arrivals lacking papers.'' Enforcement Stepped Up
The 1986 immigration law is intended to discourage illegal immigration while providing amnesty to undocumented foreign workers able to demonstrate they entered the United States before Jan. 1, 1982, and have lived there continuously since that date. The application period for the amnesty expired May 4, and the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service is both stepping up enforcement along the border and carrying out a program of sanctions against those who employ illegal immigrants.
The sanctions include fines of $250 to $10,000. Employers who engage in a ''pattern and practice'' of violations also face a prison sentence of up to six months. In the first phase of enforcement, the authorities familiarized employers with the law and issued warnings rather than fines in most cases, but since June 1 immigration officials have been empowered to seek fines for first offenses under the new law.
That system of employer sanctions was intended to make the law more effective. But in interviews with 100 California employers, the University of California study found that employers were resorting to a variety of subterfuges, including subcontracting work, accepting documents they know to be forged and hiring workers for fewer than 72 hours, in which case they are exempt from the paperwork the law requires.
According to statistics compiled by the immigration service, there were 494,144 apprehensions of illegal immigrants along the border during the first five months of this year. That figure represents a 11.9 percent increase over the comparable period in 1987, when the immigration legislation was gradually being put into effect. The law is formally known as the Immigration Reform and Control Act and popularly known as the Simpson-Rodino bill after its sponsors, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Peter W. Rodino, Democrat of New Jersey.
Information gathered by Dr. Bustamante's researchers shows an even larger increase. According to their observations at Canon Zapata, the busiest illegal crossing point on the 1,952-mile border, the flow of illegal immigrants from Mexico to the United States is up 15 percent during the last six months and is now approaching the record numbers recorded just before the law went into effect in November 1986. Apprehensions Are Down
In a panel discussion in San Diego this month, the I.N.S. Commissioner, Alan C. Nelson, said that though apprehensions were up this year compared with last, ''they are still down from before the Immigration Reform and Control Act, So there has been a net reduction.'' He said that indicated the law was, in fact, working as intended.
Research on both the Mexican and American sides of the border suggests, however, that the pressures generated by Mexico's economic crisis have been stronger than the sanctions of the law and the new manpower provided to enforce it. Inflation in Mexico last year hit an all-time high of 160 percent, and although the Government has a new anti-inflation program, unemployment continues to be high and real wages are still declining.
Traditionally, Mexicans reluctant to risk their luck at the border have sought a better future by going to Mexico City, the country's industrial center. But the research, supplemented by a reporter's interviews with Mexican migrants waiting to cross into the United States here, indicates that the economic crisis has increasingly made internal migration less attractive.
''There's thousands and thousands of people in Mexico City looking for jobs that just don't exist,'' said Emiliano Benitez, a 37-year-old farm worker from the state of Morelos, just south of Mexico City, who was traveling with his 16-year-old son, Esteban. ''With the dollar worth 2,300 pesos and jobs available for the asking, look how much you can earn in the United States.''
Facundo Roldan, a 37-year-old farm worker who said he was crossing the border for the first time, said: ''Even when there is work available back home, you're only making $2.25 for nine hours of work. You're working six days a week just to buy a pair of shoes. Compare that to the stupendous money you can make working in the United States, and you'll know why I am here.'' More From Urban Areas
In fact, more than 20 percent of the newly arrived immigrants interviewed in the University of California survey were from Mexico City or its neighboring states, areas that in the past have not sent large numbers of workers to the United States. Dr. Bustamante, broadening the focus, said migration from large cities across Mexico was increasing in general.
''We're seeing less people coming from the countryside and more from urban areas,'' he said. ''That pattern is related to inflation, the rate of devaluation of the peso versus the dollar, and the fact that Mexico's economic crisis has made it too expensive for the very poor to consider outmigration.''
The Mexican research group obtains some of its data from photographs taken three times a day at the staging field at Canon Zapata. Other information comes from the 75 interviews it has conducted every weekend here since April 1987 and from weekly interviews with Mexican migrants at five other points on the border.
The University of California survey is based on 670 detailed interviews with Mexican workers and American employers in Southern California during the last year. The institute also draws on field research being conducted in three towns in the Mexican states of Jalisco, Michoacan and Zacatecas.
Dr. Cornelius said that in another striking departure from the norm, nearly two-thirds of the illegal immigrants his institution had interviewed in California over the last year were in the United States for the first time. Workers who whiled away their time jeering the Border Patrol as they waited for darkness to fall at Canon Zapata said that trend, too, was a consequence of Mexico's worsening economic situation. Joined by Eight Friends
Efrain Garcia, a 22-year-old from Acapulco, said that when he announced a few weeks ago that he was heading north to pick cherries and apples in Washington State, eight friends who had never before crossed the border suddenly asked to join him. All eight men, who ranged in age from 19 to 24, said they had decided to seek their fortunes in the United States after being unable to find jobs at home. ''You fill out applications, and nothing happens,'' one said.
''We all recognize the immigration push-and-pull factors at work here,'' Mr. Nelson said when asked to account for the increase in apprehensions along the border. ''If Mexico's economic problems increase, then the push factor grows.''
While the Simpson-Rodino law does not seem to have deterred immigration from Mexico, it does appear to have encouraged those Mexicans already in the United States illegally to relinquish their habit of spending part of the year at home. That is partly a result of the ''grandfather clause'' that allows migrants without papers to keep jobs they held before November 1986 and also of their fears that it will be too difficult and costly to come back and find regular employment.
As a result, men who in the past came up north alone in the spring and returned to Mexico for the Christmas and New Year holidays now appear to be sending for their wives and children. Dr. Cornelius said his researchers had observed that ''housing densities in California neighborhoods where undocumented migrants live are increasing'' at the same time that some sending areas in Mexico ''are being turned into ghost towns.'' #47 Percent of Houses Closed ''In one village in Michoacan I recently visited, 47 percent of the houses were closed, some locked up with chains, because everybody in the household is in the United States,'' he said. ''The neighbors who have stayed behind told us that more wives and children have gone up this year than ever before.''
Mr. Benitez said that in the past he had shuttled back and forth between Mexico and California. But this time, he said, ''if I get across, I plan to stay at least three or four years.''
Mr. Benitez and other would-be immigrants interviewed at Canon Zapata said that they were well aware of the provisions of the law, but that it was possible to get around it by buying fake qualifying documents in the United States. They also acknowledged that the American enforcement effort had become more visible in the last year, but argued that their own persistence and need made the law meaningless.
''It's harder to cross, but we do get across, if not on the first try, then on the second, third or fourth,'' said Manuel Mendez Roldan, a 40-year-old who has been coming to work in the United States every summer since 1970. ''They can't close the border to us, no matter how hard they try.''

Abstract: Among Canadians, opinions on the strengthening of the currency depend on where one stands. In recent years, the streets of this city's downtown shopping district have often been dotted with American couples shopping for bargains at furriers like Paul Magder on Spadina Avenue. The rise of the Canadian dollar threatens to depress this retail business, because goods are becoming more expensive in terms of the American dollar. But the millions of Canadians who head to Florida and California as tourists every winter are realizing substantial savings from their dollar's gains. As for exporters - and close to 80 percent of all Canada's exports go to the United States - the stronger currency can be a serious problem. Opposing Political Views Politicians, too, have differences of view. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, facing a general election within 18 months, greeted the dollar's push through the 80-cent barrier earlier this month as an endorsement of the economic policies of his Government, which has begun to rise in opinion polls after a year of recording some of the most dismal ratings in Canadian history. The opposition has been warning that failure to halt the dollar's rise could choke off the country's impressive economic growth. ''[John Crow] wants to make it abundantly clear that he's not going to cut interest rates, risk overheating the economy and rekindling inflationary forces,'' Mr. Saba said. But he added that keeping borrowing costs high -and pushing the dollar up with them - posed a threat to exporters who have had to trim profit margins to maintain United States markets. ''It's creating a lot of hardship,'' he said.

Full text: LEAD: After 12 years of trading their currency at a discount to the United States dollar, Canadians have watched recently with a mixture of satisfaction and concern as the Canadian unit has bumped progressively upward, passing the 80-cent (United States) level last recorded in February 1984.
After 12 years of trading their currency at a discount to the United States dollar, Canadians have watched recently with a mixture of satisfaction and concern as the Canadian unit has bumped progressively upward, passing the 80-cent (United States) level last recorded in February 1984.
At the close of the financial markets in Toronto on Friday the Canadian dollar was at 80.51 cents (United States), up more than 3 cents this year and more than 11 cents - 16.5 percent - from the low of 69.13 cents recorded in February 1986. Many Canadian analysts think that the rate could rise to 85 cents by midyear, and some even think that the two currencies could be at par in the early 1990's.
Among Canadians, opinions on the strengthening of the currency depend on where one stands. In recent years, the streets of this city's downtown shopping district have often been dotted with American couples shopping for bargains at furriers like Paul Magder on Spadina Avenue. The rise of the Canadian dollar threatens to depress this retail business, because goods are becoming more expensive in terms of the American dollar. But the millions of Canadians who head to Florida and California as tourists every winter are realizing substantial savings from their dollar's gains. As for exporters - and close to 80 percent of all Canada's exports go to the United States - the stronger currency can be a serious problem. Opposing Political Views
Politicians, too, have differences of view. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, facing a general election within 18 months, greeted the dollar's push through the 80-cent barrier earlier this month as an endorsement of the economic policies of his Government, which has begun to rise in opinion polls after a year of recording some of the most dismal ratings in Canadian history. The opposition has been warning that failure to halt the dollar's rise could choke off the country's impressive economic growth.
Arguments over the rising dollar turn quickly into debate about the monetary policies of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank. In pursuit of a low inflation rate, currently 4 percent, the bank has persisted in setting stiff interest rates that act as a magnet to international currency flows, and thus bolster the value of the Canadian dollar. Last week, despite the dollar's continuing rise, the bank set its bellwether rate on 91-day Treasury bills at 8.75 percent.
For months, Canadian rates have averaged about 2.5 percentage points higher than the rate on equivalent United States Treasury notes; the spread between Canadian and United States rates for commercial loans and mortgages is about the same. Although Canadian rates have usually run higher than those in the United States, the current policy has provoked widespread criticism of John Crow, the English-born economist who took over as Governor of the Bank of Canada last year. Anti-Inflation Policy
One critic has been George Saba, chief economist with the Montreal Trust Company, who has urged an easing of monetary policy.
''Crow wants to make it abundantly clear that he's not going to cut interest rates, risk overheating the economy and rekindling inflationary forces,'' Mr. Saba said. But he added that keeping borrowing costs high -and pushing the dollar up with them - posed a threat to exporters who have had to trim profit margins to maintain United States markets. ''It's creating a lot of hardship,'' he said.
A surge in exports to the United States has been an important factor in the Canadian economy's strong growth in the last five years. Last year, the Government measured the growth at 5.7 percent after inflation, and the official forecast for this year is 3.7 percent. The figures mean Canada has one of the fastest-growing economies among industrialized nations, accompanied by an impressive number of jobs being created. Last month, unemployment was officially recorded at 7.9 percent of the work force, the lowest level in seven years.
But with the Canadian dollar riding high, economists, bankers and others have begun to worry that United States markets could shrink, choking off the growth.
As one example, they cite exports of Canadian automobiles and trucks, which account for as much as 40 percent of all Canada's exports to the United States. Since 1985, when these exports reached a record $20.5 billion (Canadian), the drop in auto and truck sales has closely followed the rising unit costs of the vehicles in United States dollars. In the first nine months of 1987, as the Canadian dollar strengthened against the United States unit by about 5 percent, vehicle sales fell by 7.5 percent, to $2.4 billion (Canadian). Anxiety Over Rising Dollar
Anxiety over the rising dollar has also been expressed by the oil and gas industry, centered in Alberta, whose exports to the United States totaled more than $8.2 billion in 1986.
In a statement after the dollar rose above 80 United States cents, the Canadian Petroleum Association calculated that the industry, whose export prices are denominated in United States currency, loses $10.5 million (Canadian) with every increase of one United States penny in the value of the Canadian dollar.
Some say that the dangers of a rising dollar have been exaggerated. They point to other factors that, they say, should offset whatever losses Canadian exporters have had in the United States. Among these are the gradual improvement in commodity prices - for lumber, minerals, fish and other products - that constitute a major part of Canadian exports. Combined with this, the Canadian dollar, along with the United States currency, has declined by 30 percent to 40 percent against the major European currencies and the Japanese yen.
Together, the weakening of the Canadian currency against these currencies and improving commodity prices have bolstered Canada's trade balance with the rest of the world, so much so that Canada's overall trade deficit has been falling.
While exports to the United States have been declining, from $20.5 billion (Canadian) in 1985, to $17.4 billion in 1986 and $16.7 billion in 1987, the country's overall trade deficit has shrunk, falling from $7 billion in 1986, to $6.4 billion in 1987, and dropping still further this year.

Full text: LEAD: FOR Americans traveling or residing abroad, the shrunken value of the dollar is felt not only as a strain on the pocketbook but as a personal insult. Feeling overcharged, overspent and over there, Americans ask: ''Is this what we're worth now - half what we were a few years ago?''
FOR Americans traveling or residing abroad, the shrunken value of the dollar is felt not only as a strain on the pocketbook but as a personal insult. Feeling overcharged, overspent and over there, Americans ask: ''Is this what we're worth now - half what we were a few years ago?''
For the professional economist, the value of the dollar is an abstraction, a function of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, as affected by a host of factors: the flows of imports and exports, disbursements of interest and dividends, capital movements, the relative level of American and foreign interest rates, events in the securities markets, the intervention of central banks, relative levels of private savings and investment here and abroad, the Federal budget deficit, productivity changes and inflation, the growth of United States gross national product relative to growth abroad and, as economists now have learned to say, ''expectations.''
For the economist, the falling dollar may seem a very good thing for restoring eqilibrium to the current balance of payments, but for the innocent abroad, the shrunken dollar is a blow to his purse, ego and national pride. The depreciation of his currency makes him angry, and he searches for villains - foreigners who are ripping him off or his own politicians who are doing the same.
Dollar depreciation is a kind of inflation. It not only erodes the value of money but undermines confidence in its reliability, the most important attribute of money. That makes the individual feel part of a crowd - the crowd of the cheated and humiliated. As Elias Canetti, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981, put it, ''Inflation is a crowd phenomenon in the strictest and most concrete sense of the word.'' It drives those who think they have been cheated together, and unites them against those who they think have cheated them. And, in the case of a runaway inflation, such as Germany experienced after World War I, they never forget it.
Canetti called inflation ''a witches' sabbath of devaluation where men and the units of their money have the strangest effects on each other. The one stands for the other, men feeling themselves as 'bad' as their money; and this becomes worse and worse. Together they are all at its mercy and all feel equally worthless.'' They seek vengeance on those who they think did this to them.
Thus, Canetti warned, inflation causes something to happen that is so dangerous that anyone charged with public responsibility who is capable of foreseeing it must fear it: It is a ''double devaluation'' originating in a double identification - the identification of the individual with his money, and the identification of the individual with the crowd of the dispossessed, hostile to those who have dispossessed them.
The devaluation of the dollar against foreign currencies does not affect the entire population of the United States with the same force as a domestic inflation. Nevertheless, the inflationary impact on American prices of more expensive imports is significant not only for Americans traveling or living abroad but on all Americans purchasing goods from abroad or from domestic producers feeling less pressure from their foreign competitors. In the last 12 months, inflation, as measured by consumer prices, has averaged 4.5 percent in the United States, compared with less than 1 percent in West Germany and Japan, and this trend is likely to continue, or rise, in the coming year, largely because of the dollar devaluation.
Rejecting the advice of those economists who have urged the Administration to let the dollar float lower as a means of reducing the trade deficit, President Reagan has declared that the United States wants stability of the dollar and is working for that with its trading partners. The Administration does not want to risk a further plunge in the dollar this election year, which could be both economically and psychologically disturbing to the electorate and to foreign governments.
The stock market has also tended to react negatively to the falling dollar, and the last thing the Administration wants is another shock like ''Black Monday'' before the election.
At the same time, the Administration does not want to see the Federal Reserve raise interest rates to defend the dollar, lest higher rates choke the slowly growing economy into recession. It believes that the dollar can be defended at about its current level by a combination of intervention by central banks in the market and ''open mouth'' policy - warnings to currency speculators that they are running the risk of being beaten by the central banks if they bet against the dollar.
To avoid the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, the Administration is putting pressure on foreign governments to reduce their own rates. This would help keep the world economy expanding and ease the debt repayment burdens of the hard-pressed developing countries. Thus electoral politics is dictating the script of a more stable dollar, steady or lower interest rates and a continuing expansion in 1988.

Abstract: ''The United States trade balance has shown less turnaround than anyone expected, or than any of the models predicted,'' Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said at a recent conference of international economists on ''The Economics of the Dollar Cycle'' at Brandeis. In standard economic theory, if the yen appreciates by 50 percent against the dollar, that exchange rate shift should be largely ''passed through'' in the form of a 50 percent price increase on Japanese products. That should increase sales of domestic products, which are now cheaper, and depress sales of imports. By the same token, a cheaper dollar also ought to make United States products more attractively priced in foreign markets. According to Professor Krugman, formerly a trade specialist on the staff of the Reagan Council of Economic Advisers, foreign companies, especially Japanese, are adept at ''pricing to market'' - they adjust prices to fit competitive conditions in different markets. American companies, though, characteristically don't. ''Pricing to market is not symmetric,'' Professor Krugman said. ''The United States is a market that is priced to, but United States firms do not correspondingly price to other markets.'' Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, arguing for a cheaper dollar rather than a ''competitiveness agenda,'' recently wrote that ''A 10 percent decline in the dollar exchange rate is equivalent to a 10 percent tariff on all imported goods and a 10 percent subsidy on all exported goods. Its short-run impact on the trade balance dwarfs anything that can be done to improve productivity.'' But evidence presented at the Brandeis Conference suggests that such standard assumptions have been overtaken by events. Since 1985, a 10 percent decline in the dollar exchange rate in fact does not produce a 10 percent increase in the price of imports.

Full text: LEAD: THE persistent failure of the cheaper dollar to significantly improve the United States trade balance not only signals problems for Administration economic policy. It is a puzzle - and increasingly an embarrassment - for an economics profession that predicted almost unanimously that a cheap dollar would bring dramatic trade improvement.
THE persistent failure of the cheaper dollar to significantly improve the United States trade balance not only signals problems for Administration economic policy. It is a puzzle - and increasingly an embarrassment - for an economics profession that predicted almost unanimously that a cheap dollar would bring dramatic trade improvement.
Despite the good news in the November trade statistics, the improvement in the balance of trade resulting from the cheaper dollar has been a far slower and less reliable process than expected. Even the improved November deficit of $13.3 billion still represents an annual imbalance of more than $159 billion, which exceeds the 1986 trade deficit.
''The United States trade balance has shown less turnaround than anyone expected, or than any of the models predicted,'' Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said at a recent conference of international economists on ''The Economics of the Dollar Cycle'' at Brandeis. In standard economic theory, if the yen appreciates by 50 percent against the dollar, that exchange rate shift should be largely ''passed through'' in the form of a 50 percent price increase on Japanese products. That should increase sales of domestic products, which are now cheaper, and depress sales of imports. By the same token, a cheaper dollar also ought to make United States products more attractively priced in foreign markets.
When the dollar was undervalued in the late 1970's and then overvalued in the early 1980's, prices responded pretty much the way economists expected. ''In the past, 100 percent of exchange rate changes were passed through to price changes within two years,'' according to Catherine Mann, a World Bank economist who has done extensive research on how actual prices respond to currency swings.
But during the long slide of the dollar that began in early 1985, the predicted shift in prices has largely failed to materialize. Though a strong dollar in the early 1980's caused prices of American products to rise steeply on world markets, a cheap dollar has not reversed the damage.
FAR less of the higher yen or Deutschmark has been passed through to American consumer markets in the form of higher import prices. As a result, consumers have continued to buy imports, and the trade deficit has only worsened.
At first, most economists assumed that the failure of the deficit to improve simply reflected a time lag - the oft-mentioned ''J-curve.'' A decline in the dollar makes imports more expensive, but consumers change their buying habits in response to the new prices only gradually. Thus, in dollar terms, the trade deficit gets worse before it gets better. Supposedly, the picture eventually improves.
But in the mid-1980's, something fundamental changed. Foreign producers managed to hold down their export prices despite enormous changes in currency values. And if relative prices of imports and domestic products fail to change, then the predicted benefits of a cheaper dollar fail to materialize.
According to Professor Krugman, formerly a trade specialist on the staff of the Reagan Council of Economic Advisers, foreign companies, especially Japanese, are adept at ''pricing to market'' - they adjust prices to fit competitive conditions in different markets. American companies, though, characteristically don't. ''Pricing to market is not symmetric,'' Professor Krugman said. ''The United States is a market that is priced to, but United States firms do not correspondingly price to other markets.''
Some American companies, like Ford and I.B.M., have been very successful at operating overseas. But unlike their Japanese competitors, much of their production is also located abroad. If Fords sold in Europe are produced primarily in Europe, the cheaper dollar does not increase exports of made-in-U.S.A. cars. Because capital investments are expensive, major manufacturing companies do not suddenly relocate billion-dollar operations in response to short-term currency swings. Over the long term, a cheaper dollar may induce American manufacturers to move some production back to the United States (this has already begun in some industries like electronics), but not nearly enough to make a major dent in the overall trade imbalance.
So far, much of the trade debate has centered on the dollar's value. Because the trade accounts have not improved, most economists think the dollar must continue to fall. Other economists believe the dangers of imported inflation outweigh the dangers of the trade deficit; they want to stabilize the dollar.
But by focusing on the dollar, economists may be missing a large part of the problem. By and large, economists have not examined in detail the dynamics of how foreign companies manage to hold down their export prices in the face of a declining dollar, and why United States companies apparently are less tenacious at pricing to hold market share.
''That question,'' said Ms. Mann of the World Bank, ''is viewed by most economists as a black box.''
Instead, most economists have investigated what went wrong with the predictive power of their equations. Part of the reason the equations have not worked, according to Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, is that the Administration chose to drive down the value of the dollar by lowering interest rates rather than by cutting the Federal budget deficit. The mix of relatively low interest rates and a big public sector deficit, he says, has perpetuated a consumer spending boom, which continues to pull in imports. In addition, Professor Sachs believes the period of adjustment to currency swings may be lengthening.
BUT, he concedes, that still does not tell the whole story. And even fairly mainstream macroeconomists like Professor Sachs are beginning to look harder at the ''structural'' issues of competitiveness that modern macroeconomic analysis has avoided as old-fashioned.
''We need more industry-by-industry examination of why American producers are failing to compete despite the cheaper dollar, and that has to be integrated with the macroeconomic analysis,'' Professor Sachs said.
This is a task that modern economics has on the whole disdained as hopelessly ''anecdotal'' and imprecise. There is no significant economics literature on how individual foreign industries or companies have altered their marketing strategies to compensate for exchange rate shifts, for example. Most of the studies that do exist try to infer corporate strategies from aggregate statistics, rather than examining them directly.
One statistical study, by Japanese economist Ruyhei Wakasugi of Shinshu University, found that the cost of raw materials, capital and labor fell in many Japanese industries, allowing them to hold down prices with only a moderate decline in profits.
According to research by Federal Reserve Board economists Bonnie Lupescu and Robert Johnson, increases in Japanese export prices have varied dramatically among industries. In chemicals, for example, where competition is fierce, Japanese producers have taken advantage of the drop in the yen price of oil, and have held price increases to an estimated 9 percent. In precision instruments, where some specialized products are made only in Japan, dollar export prices rose about as much as the value of the yen, without hurting sales.
Economists baffled by the failure of trade balances to follow predictions have even borrowed a term from physics, ''hysteresis,'' to express their puzzlement. Hysteresis, as used in physics, simply means the failure of an object to return to its previous equilibrium path once a disturbance is removed. As used in economics, hysteresis means that if the dollar rises by 50 percent and then drops back to where it was, trade flows might not return to their previous levels. That is because the rise might have led to some structural change, such as an American producer being pushed out of a market, say color televisions, while a foreign competitor gains a commanding position. A reversal of currency misalignments would not necessarily reverse the situation. If it is defined as continuing structural change, ''hysteresis'' would seem to be a normal condition of modern industrial life.
In general, however, macroeconomists, who have been the dominant voices in the debate about trade and the dollar, have been extremely skeptical about the role of structural factors in the trade deficit. On the whole, the economics profession tends to believe that if the cheaper dollar has not reversed the trade imbalance, it must be because the dollar simply has not fallen far enough. In standard economic analysis, where markets are assumed to equilibrate on the basis of price, structural change is seen as a puzzling and untrustworthy special case. Moreover, in the words of Jeffrey Sachs, ''Most economic analyses do not allow for it mathematically.''
''Anecdotal'' evidence, of the sort that formal economic analysis generally mistrusts, suggests a variety of reasons why prices of foreign goods have not followed the yen and the Deutschmark skyward.
* Most raw materials are priced in dollars. In Japan, a 70 percent decline in the dollar means a 70 percent decline in the cost of oil, iron ore, chemical feedstocks, and so on, which substantially offsets the effect of the higher exchange rate on the finished product.
* All currencies have not appreciated against the dollar. Both American and Japanese producers have increasingly moved production to cheap-currency, low-wage countries like Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, China and Mexico.
* Capital costs are far lower in Japan and Germany. This means that a Japanese company can shave profit margins to hold the line on prices, and still make an acceptable return.
* Many foreign producers did not pass along the full savings to United States customers when the dollar was expensive, so they had a substantial cushion to absorb anticipated price increases as the dollar got cheaper.
In addition, a large share of imports today are marketed in the United States by American retailers or wholesalers, who share the foreign producer's interest in holding down the price. Big American retailers like Sears, Roebuck, who attach their own brand names to imported products, or makers of designer apparel who license the use of their labels to foreign producers, are able to shift purchases to the lower-wage, cheaper-currency countries if they encounter price increases from Japanese sources; that, in turn, intensifies the pressure on Japan to hold the line on prices in the United States.
For example, the Tandy Corporation, maker of Radio-Shack electronics products, gets about 50 percent of its products - including disk drives, laptop computers, and printers - from the Orient, especially Japan. Despite the dramatic decline in the dollar, though, only 4 percent of the products in Tandy's 1988 catalogue increased in price. According to Bernard Appel, Tandy's president, both Radio Shack, and some of its Japanese suppliers, have held down price increases by moving some production to lower- cost producers.
JAPAN'S trade surplus with the United States in manufacturing did not decline in 1987, but Japan did increase its imports from other Asian nations by about 30 percent, much of that in component parts for re-export. Interestingly, this shift is not captured by the official United States trade statistics, which are based on information from customs receipts. If a computer imported from Japan contains chips made in Korea, 100 percent of the cost nonetheless shows up in the trade accounts as an import from Japan.
In many other cases, Japanese producers have held the line on prices by trimming profit margins on their sales to the United States. But this factor is often exaggerated. In the first year of the cheap dollar, many economists assumed that Japan was restraining export prices by undergoing a significant profit squeeze, which could not continue over time. But more recent research by a number of American and Japanese economists indicates that Japan's ability to hold the line on prices has more to do with the decline in prices of raw materials, productivity improvements, and Japan's own selective relocation of production offshore. Over all, major companies traded on the Tokyo stock exchange reported only a slight drop in their earnings per share between 1985 and 1987.
IN theory, if Japanese companies are artificially holding down their United States prices, even in part by taking lower profit margins on those sales, they are ''dumping.'' But United States law only holds that products may not be sold below their cost or their home-market price. In practice, pricing decisions of big conglomerates give Japanese companies ample latitude to use domestic profits to shave United States profit margins without violating the letter of the anti-dumping law.
Late last year, Du Pont persuaded the United States International Trade Commission that a Japanese competitor was dumping granular teflon, a product widely used in compression-molded plastics. As evidence, Du Pont, apparently breaking legal ground, contrasted the rise in the yen with the decline in the United States price of the Japanese product. But few industries have been able to meet the standard of proof necessary to demonstrate Japanese dumping.
According to Paula Stern, a former commissioner of the International Trade Commission, the number of anti-dumping cases filed in 1987 actually declined by 42 percent. Moreover, in many situations, such as the purchase of Japanese products for sale under the label of an American company (like Tandy or Sears), the dumping issue is moot because the American company is happy to get the lower price and there is no complaining party to file suit.
The policy implications of these developments suggest a paradox: The dollar may have to become even cheaper just to compensate for the relative decline in the competitivness of American companies that has already occurred. But at the same time an ever cheaper dollar by itself may not be sufficient to produce a tolerable trade balance. All the factors that allowed America's competitors to adjust to a declining dollar would continue to operate.
In the view of a minority of economists who emphasize structural factors, such as M.I.T.'s Lester Thurow, the danger is that an ever cheaper dollar will only make the United States a relatively poorer country, without making American products fully competitive. Even at 100 yen to the dollar, it is questionable how many American-made Chevrolets would be sold in Japan, or how many VCR's will be made in America.
Despite the puzzlement of an increasing number of economists, the academic debate about the dollar continues to be cast primarily in terms of whether the dollar should be allowed to fall even more, or whether it should be stabilized, and not whether currency manipulation is a sufficient means of repairing United States competitiveness. But because most economists still tend to focus on statistical aggregates, rather than observing what companies actually do, much of the debate fails to shed light on why foreign producers seem to operate more adaptively than American ones, despite swings in exchange rates.
Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, arguing for a cheaper dollar rather than a ''competitiveness agenda,'' recently wrote that ''A 10 percent decline in the dollar exchange rate is equivalent to a 10 percent tariff on all imported goods and a 10 percent subsidy on all exported goods. Its short-run impact on the trade balance dwarfs anything that can be done to improve productivity.'' But evidence presented at the Brandeis Conference suggests that such standard assumptions have been overtaken by events. Since 1985, a 10 percent decline in the dollar exchange rate in fact does not produce a 10 percent increase in the price of imports.
And Germany and Japan have continued to enjoy both strong currencies and trade surpluses precisely because they continue to show impressive gains in productivity. In Germany and Japan a strong currency is the accurate measure of high real wages and a strong economy; in the United States, a steadily weakening currency is the measure of a steadily weakening economy.
ACCORDING to the structuralists, like Mr. Thurow and Harvard's Robert Reich, America may well need not only a relatively cheap dollar, but also heroic efforts to improve competitiveness. Their agenda would include a better educated work force, lower capital costs, a reduced public deficit, strategic investment in key industries, and a new marketing outlook appropriate to an open global economy, as well as more effective diplomatic efforts to get Germany and Japan to accept responsibility for overall balance in the trading system.
In this view, if America relies only on an ever cheaper currency, and productivity growth continues to lag behind that of major competitors, at some point - perhaps an exchange rate of 50 yen or one Mark to the dollar - our trade accounts will formally balance. But by then America will be a much poorer country.
Until lately, most macroeconomists largely wrote off the structuralist view. But the limits of the cheap dollar solution may force the economics profession to put aside the equations and adopt more empirical methods to learn what is inside the black box of actual companies, technologies and marketing strategies.

Abstract: To be sure, nobody really knows the state of oil inventories. Prof. Maurice Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been studying the oil industry for 35 years, says inventories in the hands of companies are not well known and those downstream are ''a statistical black hole.'' With heightened competition among oil producers for market share, and continued consumer investment in equipment to economize on energy, the danger of another steep inflation in oil, which was a critical factor in the global inflation in the 1970's, looks far-fetched in the years immediately ahead. The quick end to the current flap over Iran's threat is evidence of that. The widespread anxieties about worsening inflation that have been troubling the stock market this week do not rest only on oil prices. The inflationary case, as spelled out by such analysts as Henry Kaufman, Richard Berner and Jerry Pegden of Salomon Brothers, is this: Higher import and energy prices have been the driving force behind higher inflation this year. Now, renewed concern about the dollar, which was manifest in the stock and foreign-exchange markets yesterday, could cause a spillover of ''import inflation'' into next year. But the major impetus to inflation in 1988, which the Salomon economists expect to hit a 6 to 6.5 percent rate, will be ''home grown,'' in the form of a quickening in the rise of wages, emerging bottlenecks in several product markets and prospectively higher Federal excise taxes.

Full text: LEAD: WITH the economic news full of surprises -most strikingly the jump in the United States trade deficit to a record level in June, when it was supposed to shrink - the stock market has become extremely nervous.
WITH the economic news full of surprises -most strikingly the jump in the United States trade deficit to a record level in June, when it was supposed to shrink - the stock market has become extremely nervous.
After closing above 2,700 for an all-time high Monday, the Dow industrials yesterday fell 45.91 points. Anxiety about the plunge in the dollar set off the stock market's fall. Underlying its anxieties about both the trade deficit and the dollar are the market's fears of inflation.
But, just as expectations are congealing around the idea that a sharp step-up in inflation is in the works, a critical factor - the oil price - has taken a dive. Contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark United States crude, which had climbed above $22 in early August following the American reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers, have fallen $2.33, or 11 percent, from their peak. West Texas Intermediate dropped 76 cents Monday, to $19.83 a barrel, the first time it had been below $20 since June 25.
That drop stemmed from the market's realization that Iran, heavily dependent on oil exports to sustain its economy and its seven-year war with Iraq, wants a closing of shipping through the Persian Gulf like a hole in the head. Even more fundamentally, the market recognizes that world oil inventories are swollen beyond current demand.
To be sure, nobody really knows the state of oil inventories. Prof. Maurice Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been studying the oil industry for 35 years, says inventories in the hands of companies are not well known and those downstream are ''a statistical black hole.''
Data on current production are also murky, with suspicions of a lot of cheating by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Oil prices are likely to remain unstable in the months ahead, but not go much higher. Even though Saudi Arabia has re-established itself as the swing producer, after baring its fangs by letting the oil price fall below $10 a barrel, OPEC itself has very shaky control over the world oil price.
Yet, flying blind, it will struggle to hold the price fairly high and steady. But it may not succeed. What Mr. Adelman foresees is a continuation of the cycle of meetings, firming prices, cheating, price declines, threats and promises, more cheating and more meetings.
These cycles will be punctuated by outbreaks of war and revolution, periodically thrusting oil prices up. It is impossible to systematize the oil cycle of wars and revolutions, but one could make a case for a six- or seven-year cycle - roughly the interval between the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the seven-year Iran-Iraq war, followed this year by the increase of Iranian revolutionary fervor and threats to other states in the region, as well as to the United States and other Western powers.
But this latest Iranian threat has been a fizzle, most clearly in its lack of lasting effect on the oil price. The oil market has apparently concluded that the underlying supply-and-demand conditions for another oil price explosion are simply not there.
The debate now is whether those fundamental conditions for a renewed oil inflation will be there even in a few years. The consensus, looking toward rising prices in the coming decade, is that the current oil glut will be dried up by growing world demand and limited resources. But some experts, including Mr. Adelman, insist that the probability of a continuing world surplus of oil is strong, because virtually every producer, whether in OPEC or outside it, has been struggling to maintain surplus capacity to strengthen its bargaining position, and is likely to continue to do so.
Even falling oil prices after 1981 did not check the growth of oil capacity; indeed, the 50 percent price decline after 1981 acted like a needle in the arm to both OPEC producers and others, inducing them to raise production in an effort to sustain their net income.
With heightened competition among oil producers for market share, and continued consumer investment in equipment to economize on energy, the danger of another steep inflation in oil, which was a critical factor in the global inflation in the 1970's, looks far-fetched in the years immediately ahead. The quick end to the current flap over Iran's threat is evidence of that.
However, the widespread anxieties about worsening inflation that have been troubling the stock market this week do not rest only on oil prices. The inflationary case, as spelled out by such analysts as Henry Kaufman, Richard Berner and Jerry Pegden of Salomon Brothers, is this: Higher import and energy prices have been the driving force behind higher inflation this year.

The decline of unemployment to 5.9 percent in July, the lowest rate in the last eight years, and the just-announced July rise of the rate of operation of American factories, mines and utilities to 80.5 percent of capacity, the highest in 18 months, have added to the case for inflation in 1988.

Abstract: Are these forces likely to bring a speed-up in inflation as the year wears on? ''Concerns about a continuing reacceleration of inflation are exaggerated,'' said Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. He said the inflation rate was already moving down to the 4 percent range. The Labor Department said last week that the producer price index in July rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent, providing evidence of slowing inflation. ''We must face reality,'' he said. ''The only force strong enough to stop this nation's massive, runaway budget is the Constitution.''

Full text: LEAD: WHILE Wall Street was cheering the fifth anniversary of the big bull market that had carried the Dow Jones industrial average from 776.92 on Aug. 12, 1982, to a record close of 2,691.49 Thursday, some experts were worrying that the economy was ready to throw the stock market a curve.
WHILE Wall Street was cheering the fifth anniversary of the big bull market that had carried the Dow Jones industrial average from 776.92 on Aug. 12, 1982, to a record close of 2,691.49 Thursday, some experts were worrying that the economy was ready to throw the stock market a curve.
A Phillips curve, to be exact. Named for the British economist A. W. Phillips, the theory holds that when the unemployment rate falls, the inflation rate moves upward. The logic is that when labor markets tighten, wages rise, pushing up prices.
In July the nation's unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent, an eight-year low and a full percentage point below its level a year ago.
Even more striking has been employment growth: The number of jobs has increased by 12 million since President Reagan took office. Though the service sector has provided the bulk of the growth, with manufacturing jobs falling a million overall, last month there was a 70,000-job spurt in manufacturing.
At the same time, inflation has been rising in recent months. Where the Consumer Price Index went up by a mere 1.1 percent in 1986, so far this year it has risen at a rate of 5.4 percent. The producer price index, measuring the wholesale prices that businesses pay for finished goods and raw materials, has turned around even more sharply. After dropping 1.7 percent last year, producer prices rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the first quarter and 5.4 percent in the second quarter this year.
Is all this an ominous indication of an unemployment-inflation trade-off? Are threats of labor shortages and wage escalation so great that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten money, driving up interest rates and knocking down the stock market and the economy?
In fact, the economy, unlike the stock market, has not been booming. After growing at a rate of 2.9 percent last year, the real gross national product, the total output adjusted for inflation, stepped up to 4.6 percent in the first quarter, then fell to a 2.6 percent growth rate in the second quarter. Disposable Income Drops
The rates were slower than they looked, because much of the gain came from the piling up of inventories that did not move off warehouse shelves - or were not driven away from the auto dealers' lots. Final sales -total national output minus the increase of inventories - scarcely grew in the first half of 1987.
Consumers have simply not had enough money to spend on cars, housing and other items to send the economy spiraling upward. Disposable personal income - the amount of money consumers have available to spend or save after deducting taxes - has been rising slowly, but, after adjusting for inflation, it actually dropped 4 percent in the second quarter of this year.
As yet, there is no evidence that the drop in unemployment is causing wages to start climbing faster, putting the inflationary heat on prices. In 1986, hourly earnings in nonagricultural jobs rose by only 2.5 percent. In the first half of 1987, the rate of increase in hourly earnings had been averaging only 2.2 percent over last year's, measured in current dollars. When measured in constant dollars, wages have fallen 1 percent below last year.
The upturn in inflation appears to be the result of international factors, not increasing wages. Oil prices have been rising, and markets for metals and other raw materials have recovered. The dollar is cheaper, causing import prices to rise and giving American producers greater leeway to raise their prices.
Are these forces likely to bring a speed-up in inflation as the year wears on? ''Concerns about a continuing reacceleration of inflation are exaggerated,'' said Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. He said the inflation rate was already moving down to the 4 percent range. The Labor Department said last week that the producer price index in July rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent, providing evidence of slowing inflation.
Meanwhile, the international forces that have caused higher inflation now seem to be ebbing. Oil prices were given a sharp push upward immediately after the American reflagging of Kuwaiti oil tankers, but have since fallen again as the threat of the closing of the Persian Gulf has receded. Sluggish growth in the world economy is not putting much pressure on commodity prices. And, after its steep fall in 1985 and 1986, the dollar has stabilized and even risen again.
With the big United States trade deficit still dogging not only producers but politicians, the country has been pressing foreign central banks to intervene in exchange markets to prevent the dollar from rising further and inflicting new damage on American exports. The Commerce Department reported Friday that the trade deficit was $15.71 billion in June, an all-time monthly high.
The danger remains that the chronic budget deficit could be the undoing of the American economy and securities markets. Last week, in his televised address, President Reagan renewed his request for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.
''We must face reality,'' he said. ''The only force strong enough to stop this nation's massive, runaway budget is the Constitution.''
This could become an issue in the election campaign. Vice President Bush has indicated his strong support for such an amendment. But the Democrats, who point to the huge growth in the debt during the Reagan Administration, are likely to brush off the President's proposed constitutional solution as a political red herring that might have a perverse effect in a recession by forcing steep spending cuts or tax increases when the economy is already falling.
In the end, the job of economic management is likely to depend not on the fiscal actions by a divided Republican White House and Democrat-dominated Congress but on the monetary policies pursued by Alan Greenspan, sworn in last week as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and his colleagues. The Fed seems sure to lean against the wind of inflation in the coming year, but not too hard, since pressure coming from the other axis of the Phillips curve, falling unemployment and tightening labor markets, does not yet seem excessive.
Mr. Greenspan may get the honeymoon any new Fed chairman would like in an election year. If so, the stock market, ever fearful of rising inflation and interest rates, can relax for a while.

Abstract: LEAD: Fight inflation, fight inflation and fight inflation! That's the advice Alan Greenspan, chairman-designate of the Federal Reserve Board, is getting from many of his fellow economists. It's bad advice. Fight inflation, fight inflation and fight inflation! That's the advice Alan Greenspan, chairman-designate of the Federal Reserve Board, is getting from many of his fellow economists. It's bad advice. One source of inflation is excess demand caused when Government and the private economy attempt to buy more than we are capable of producing - hence, the aphorism, ''Too much money chasing too few goods.'' But that is clearly not the case now, with unemployment still persistently over 6 percent, much of industry operating well under capacity and economic growth sluggish. Reducing demand and purchasing power by denying people money and credit may well keep inflation in check, or even drive prices downward. But to restrict purchasing power when there is no excess to begin with could easily lead to a reduction in real output. There is, at the moment, no compelling reason why the Fed should choose to refight the last war - the war against the double-digit inflation of 1979 and 1980. Even that inflation stemmed largely from soaring petroleum prices rather than excess purchasing power.

Not that inflation is a good thing. But it must be resisted prudently, at the right time and with the right tools. Moreover, the Fed has other goals besides limiting inflation, not the least of which is achieving high employment and maximizing the real volume of goods and services available to the American people. A mistimed assault on inflation could ruin our chances of meeting these goals.
One source of inflation is excess demand caused when Government and the private economy attempt to buy more than we are capable of producing - hence, the aphorism, ''Too much money chasing too few goods.'' But that is clearly not the case now, with unemployment still persistently over 6 percent, much of industry operating well under capacity and economic growth sluggish. Reducing demand and purchasing power by denying people money and credit may well keep inflation in check, or even drive prices downward. But to restrict purchasing power when there is no excess to begin with could easily lead to a reduction in real output. There is, at the moment, no compelling reason why the Fed should choose to refight the last war - the war against the double-digit inflation of 1979 and 1980. Even that inflation stemmed largely from soaring petroleum prices rather than excess purchasing power.
Our current problems arise, rather, from an economy that is out of joint. Large Federal budget deficits accompanied by an excessively restrictive monetary policy have contributed to high real interest rates and a dollar so expensive on world markets that we have been exporting far less than we import. The result has been sluggish business investment and a misguided lurch toward protectionism.
The obvious solution is not, as some advise, to keep money tight - but to do just the opposite. The Fed should see to it that the money supply is fully adequate to finance all the activity our economy is capable of.
Increasing the money supply would, first of all, make it cheaper to borrow. Lower interest rates would then encourage private investment and, by lowering the interest burdens on the Treasury, reduce the budget deficit. This in turn would relieve the political pressure to cut public investment in the physical and human capital on which the nation and its future depend.
Second, the dollar would be cheaper in terms of foreign currencies. A lower dollar would bring major progress toward genuinely ''fair'' trade and a better balance between exports and imports. Along with appropriate stimulative policies abroad, easier money in the United States would thus help move the world to higher levels of prosperity and growth.
Yet the siren songs of those who insist that inflation must always be our first and dominant concern continue to inhibit effective policy. This misplaced concern stems in part from exaggerated fears about inflation, which, after all, has been very modest over the past 12 months and is not expected to go much higher. But it also stems from the failure of the public, the politicians and some of our economists to find the real bottom line. That is and should be the goods and services that we as a people enjoy, and not the prices we pay for them.
To be sure, inflation can get so bad that the economy becomes disorganized and production suffers. Inflation falsifies expectations and changes the distribution of income in capricious and unfair ways. But what matters is how we fight inflation. Inflation can be fought efficiently by promoting competition at home and abroad, eliminating ineffective and costly regulations and ridding ourselves of Government programs, including those in the agricultural sector, that are aimed at propping up prices.
Inflation-fighting of this sort would help increase productivity and improve the bottom line. But those things are not under the control of the Federal Reserve. What the Fed should be doing with the tools at its disposal is leading the nation toward higher levels of prosperity and growth.

Abstract: EACH month's inflation news suggests our new environment of low inflation has staying power. But how long can it continue? Right now, the dollar's decline since last winter is causing concern that inflation may reignite - a lower dollar could mean a rise in the price of imported raw materials and finished goods, and corresponding price increases in similar domestic products. This concern assumes that the dollar will continue to fall and that the inflationary response will be symmetrical to its response when the dollar was rising. Such symmetry has occurred in the past. But a symmetrical response is not likely this time, nor is the dollar likely to retrace its rise and give up the 87 percent it gained over the five-year period that ended last winter. The remaining question is how far the dollar will fall from its present level. The agreement reached on Sept. 22, by the Group of Five - the United States, Japan, Great Britain, West Germany and France - stated that ''some further appreciation of the main non-dollar currencies against the dollar is desirable.'' But there is reason to believe that the practical intent of that statement was to raise the value of the yen against the major non-yen currencies. SINCE the September 22 agreement, the dollar has depreciated 17 percent against the yen, compared with depreciation of 7 percent to 10 percent against the currencies of the three European countries. Prior to Sept. 22, the dollar had depreciated only 8 percent from its high against the yen, compared with a 14 percent to 20 percent depreciation against the currencies of the three other countries. Now the dollar shows about the same total decline -24 percent - from its peak against each of the four currencies. So, the yen has been put in line with the three European currencies without pushing the dollar down too much farther on average.

Full text: EACH month's inflation news suggests our new environment of low inflation has staying power. But how long can it continue? Right now, the dollar's decline since last winter is causing concern that inflation may reignite - a lower dollar could mean a rise in the price of imported raw materials and finished goods, and corresponding price increases in similar domestic products. This concern assumes that the dollar will continue to fall and that the inflationary response will be symmetrical to its response when the dollar was rising. Such symmetry has occurred in the past. But a symmetrical response is not likely this time, nor is the dollar likely to retrace its rise and give up the 87 percent it gained over the five-year period that ended last winter.
The world economy differs from that of five years ago in two important respects. First, there is a surfeit of agricultural, energy and other industrial commodities. Second, the strong dollar promoted the development of substantial manufacturing capacity in the Far East, particularly among the newly industrialized countries of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. As a result, these exporters have an excess supply of commodities and, thus, are not likely to risk losing their market shares in the United States by raising prices.
The widespread availability of crude oil and natural gas has been apparent for some time. Oil prices have fallen by almost a third from their peak. The combination of declining consumption, plentiful reserves (30 years at current production rates) and the increasing availability of those reserves outside of the volatile Middle East, suggests that the prices of crude oil and petroleum products sold to the United States will not rise to offset the decline in the dollar's value.
Similar excess-supply conditions exist for other industrial materials, largely because deeply indebted third world countries are important suppliers - and they are flooding the market in an effort to get dollars needed to service their debts.
The picture is much the same in agriculture and manufacturing. Over the last decade, world consumption of grains has grown about 2.25 percent annually, the same rate as the yield per acre. Grain inventories at the end of this crop year should be about one-third higher than they were 10 years ago, when shortages were widespread and farmers were getting record prices. And with capacity utilization of manufacturing in both Europe and the United States hovering at around 80 percent, there is a substantial margin for capacity to rise before bottlenecks appear.
Beyond that, there has been substantial growth of capacity in the newly industrialized countries in the past several years, prompted in large part by the outsourcing and direct investment of American manufacturers seeking relief from the intense competitive pressures placed on them by the strong dollar. The slow growth - 2 percent - in the United States economy from the middle of last year to the middle of this one, has hurt the newly industrialized countries. It has created the excess capacity that will prevent those countries from raising prices on goods they sell to the United States.
This worldwide picture of excess manufacturing capacity and raw material abundance means this year's decline in the value of the dollar is unlikely to add much if anything to the inflation rate next year.
The remaining question is how far the dollar will fall from its present level. The agreement reached on Sept. 22, by the Group of Five - the United States, Japan, Great Britain, West Germany and France - stated that ''some further appreciation of the main non-dollar currencies against the dollar is desirable.'' But there is reason to believe that the practical intent of that statement was to raise the value of the yen against the major non-yen currencies. SINCE the September 22 agreement, the dollar has depreciated 17 percent against the yen, compared with depreciation of 7 percent to 10 percent against the currencies of the three European countries. Prior to Sept. 22, the dollar had depreciated only 8 percent from its high against the yen, compared with a 14 percent to 20 percent depreciation against the currencies of the three other countries. Now the dollar shows about the same total decline -24 percent - from its peak against each of the four currencies. So, the yen has been put in line with the three European currencies without pushing the dollar down too much farther on average.
That the objective of the Group of Five was to raise the value of the yen against all four currencies rather than to lower the dollar is very plausible. Their public claims notwithstanding, the Europeans know they need a strong dollar and yen. Before the worldwide recession of 1981 and 1982, Europe paid for its trade deficit with the United States by exporting to the OPEC countries and to other developing nations. But those markets dried up with the fall-off in prices of oil and other industrial and agricultural commodities. Europe needed markets in the United States, Canada and the Far East to compensate. But its ability to increase penetration in those markets was limited by its labor costs; the rise in the dollar facilitated that penetration.
Unit labor costs in all three countries were well above those of the United States in 1980. Now they are well below. So the strong dollar provided the impetus for a swing in Europe's trade with the United States, from a deficit of $20 billion in 1980 to a surplus of about $15 billion in 1984.
Thus, the European economies are not yet ready to bear the consequences of further dollar depreciation. They must await the reopening of new markets. How soon that occurs depends on whether the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, really does want to pursue policies that will increase trade between Western Europe and the Eastern bloc countries.
For now, the dollar appears to have fallen about as much as it will for the next several years. And the decline to date is unlikely to result in a rebound of United States inflation that is symmetrical to that which occurred when the dollar rose.
Surely inflation will creep up, as long as our economic expansion coontinues. But international currency developments are not a threat to the low inflation rate over the next 12 to 18 months. And the strengthening of price stability stemming from worldwide abundance should keep inflation far from double digits for the rest of the decade.

Abstract: The results are rather dramatic. In the first three quarters of 1984, United States earnings on direct investment abroad were about $28 billion. In contrast, the profits on overseas investments in the United States were only about $7.5 billion. Thus, while the book value of American direct investment abroad was only half again as much as direct investment in the United States, its earnings were four times as much. From this figure, we can establish a net capital value for American overseas investment of about $350 billion (against a net book value of $77 billion).

Full text: Is the United States truly a debtor nation, as the Commerce Department reported last week? I think not. While there is no disputing that America's international investment position has fallen dramatically, the official figures give a highly misleading impression. The reason lies in a failure to properly allow for inflation.
The total of international assets is a hodgepodge of shares, government bonds, bank deposits and overseas assets. Shares, bonds and bank deposits have a market value that is readily determined. The stock of direct investment, however, is the cumulative book value of investments. As any book-value calculation, it understates the replacement value of the assets. The older the investment, the greater the understatement, especially in an inflationary time.
United States direct investment abroad is greater in book value terms (around $226 billion in October 1984) than direct investment in America (about $149 billion). It is also older; about one-half of direct investment in the United States took place over the last five years, while only one-fifth of American direct investment abroad was added in those years.
What is the true replacement value of American direct investment overseas? Data that would allow a direct calculation are not available. But the earnings from direct investment can be capitalized to give a rough market evaluation, on a par with that of shares and bonds.
The results are rather dramatic. In the first three quarters of 1984, United States earnings on direct investment abroad were about $28 billion. In contrast, the profits on overseas investments in the United States were only about $7.5 billion. Thus, while the book value of American direct investment abroad was only half again as much as direct investment in the United States, its earnings were four times as much. From this figure, we can establish a net capital value for American overseas investment of about $350 billion (against a net book value of $77 billion).
Thus, the United States is not a net international debtor, and will not be for another couple of years, even if trade deficits turn out as high as forecast. However, this should not disguise or minimize the fact that the pattern of international direct investment has drastically changed.

PROTECTIONIST MOOD: MOUNTING PRESSURE SMOOT AND HAWLEY

Abstract: After Herbert Hoover was elected, Congress wrote a trade bill that steeply increased tariffs not only on farm imports but also on virtually all other imports. When Smoot-Hawley reached the President's desk 1,038 American economists - including just about every reputable economist of whatever political view - signed a petition urging him to veto the bill. They warned that it would ''inevitably provoke others to pay us back in kind,'' damaging the United States economy. But President Hoover, who felt bound by his party's platform pledge, signed the Smoot-Hawley legislation. The real pressure for protection has little to do with the balance of trade, according to Lionel W. McKenzie, professor of economics at the University of Rochester. Instead, he said, it stems from ''particular industries which can benefit from excluding Japanese products.'' In his view, these are ''rich industries which pay high wages and salaries and have a corresponding political clout.'' President Reagan, seeking to undercut Congressional pressure for protectionism, has introduced a more aggressive policy to open foreign markets to American goods. He has said he would initiate a series of investigations into ''unfair trading practices'' of Japan, the European Economic Community, South Korea and Brazil. And it now seems likely that additional tough measures, intended to impress and appease Congress, will follow. Outcome Is Unknown On President's Efforts It is too early to know whether the President's efforts to stanch protectionism, possibly reinforced by his veto power, will prevail - or whether his efforts to use tough means to redress the American trade position will themselves become a form of protectionism.

Full text: After pursuing a free-trade policy for the past 50 years, the United States Congress is seriously considering protectionist measures of the sort contained in the damaging Smoot-Hawley tariff act of 1930, which many economists believe helped to create the Great Depression.
There is much perplexity about the strength of protectionist sentiment in Congress - and much anxiety over the danger that, if it prevails, the United States would again provoke retaliation and start a trade war that would inflict grave damage on the economy of America and the world.
Could this happen again, or has the danger been greatly overblown?
Supporters of restrictive trade legislation today insist that they are not trying to start a trade war but seek only to protect American labor, industry and agriculture from unfair competition.
What their intentions are and what the results would be, however, may be two different things. Most trade experts believe that the danger of serious protective measures taken by the United States is a real danger and that such measures could indeed spark some kind of trade war. But they add that its disastrous economic effects could be tempered if the United States and other countries undertake strong spending programs or other expansionary moves.
In 1930 the supporters of Smoot-Hawley intended merely to help some injured Americans - especially the farmers. The Republican Party had promised in its 1928 platform to relieve the agricultural depression, which had already begun.
After Herbert Hoover was elected, Congress wrote a trade bill that steeply increased tariffs not only on farm imports but also on virtually all other imports. When Smoot-Hawley reached the President's desk 1,038 American economists - including just about every reputable economist of whatever political view - signed a petition urging him to veto the bill. They warned that it would ''inevitably provoke others to pay us back in kind,'' damaging the United States economy. But President Hoover, who felt bound by his party's platform pledge, signed the Smoot-Hawley legislation.
The economists were right about retaliation from America's trading partners. Britain, France, Italy and other nations raised tariffs or introduced quotas. Switzerland boycotted American products. Canada raised its tariff walls to the highest in history. International conferences were held in 1931, 1932 and 1933 in an effort to work out a truce in the trade war. All those talks failed. The higher American trade barriers frustrated Tokyo's efforts to improve the economic conditions of the Japanese people through expanding trade. Japan turned to a more nationalistic and militant foreign policy.
The United States was worse off after Smoot-Hawley than it had been before. This country's exports plunged because of the higher trade barriers and because of the spreading world depression, which was aggravated by the collapse of trade. By 1932 American exports had plummeted to about one-fourth of their 1929 level. Agriculture, the sector President Hoover had tried to help, suffered the most. Wheat exports, which had totaled $200 million 10 years earlier, slumped to $5 million in 1932. Auto exports fell from $541 million in 1929 to $76 million in 1932.
In retrospect, Smoot-Hawley was worse than futile. It failed to solve unemployment and other problems of American labor, industry and agriculture; instead it aggravated the problems. And it contributed to the deepening political and economic crisis and the bitter nationalism that helped to bring on World War II.
In light of these past events, why are serious people in Congress and their supporters now contemplating setting off the biggest wave of restrictive trade legislation since the Depression? Industry and Labor Put Pressure on Congress For one thing, the pressure on legislators has been mounting as the nation's trade deficit swells. The pressure comes from affected industrial and labor groups demanding a more restrictive and aggressive American trade policy. Administration officials and private economists have forecast that the trade deficit will widen to between $140 billion and $160 billion this year, compared with $123 billion last year, and there is no turnaround in sight.
No nation, whether the United States or Brazil or Argentina, can expect foreigners to finance its deficits indefinitely. ''Such a gigantic imbalance is simply not sustainable,'' said Lawrence A. Krause, an international economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, voicing a widely shared sentiment.
Another major reason for the buildup of protectionist pressure -despite the benefits in lower prices or better quality that imports can bring to consumers - is the fact that specific industries and groups of workers suffer an immediate loss of income or jobs. This means losses that they consider unacceptable, regardless of the long-run effect on the nation's trade.
The real pressure for protection has little to do with the balance of trade, according to Lionel W. McKenzie, professor of economics at the University of Rochester. Instead, he said, it stems from ''particular industries which can benefit from excluding Japanese products.'' In his view, these are ''rich industries which pay high wages and salaries and have a corresponding political clout.''
But if some high-wage industries, such as steel and autos, are pressing for protection from imports, so are some low-wage industries such as textiles and shoes. What all these manufacturers have in common is a loss of ground in both foreign and domestic markets. American Resentment Against the Japanese Particularly vexatious is the loss of position in areas where the United States has considered itself the world leader: high technology and capital goods. While the United States still ran trade surpluses in these categories in 1984, the surpluses have shrunk considerably.
Unquestionably, a significant factor in the upward surge of protectionist spirit among many Americans is that the losses to the Japanese have been both large and growing, and they feel that the Japanese have not played fair but instead have discriminated against or excluded American goods from their market through a variety of methods. At the same time, however, American consumers have continued to buy Japanese goods heavily.
Last year the United States ran its biggest bilateral deficit in trade with Japan - more than $37 billion, compared with a bilateral trade deficit against West Germany of just $8 billion.
Yet the threat to American dominance in manufactured goods is by no means limited to Japan. It comes from the newly industrialized nations of Asia - South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. And as technology is rapidly diffused throughout the world, the threat also comes from many developing countries as well, ranging from Brazil to China, which is now making an enormous bid to take its place among the industrial nations.
It is these strains that are now weighing on American trade policy. Since the Reciprocal Trade Act of 1935, that policy has been based on the proposition that free and open trade is the best means of promoting the development of both the United States economy and the world economy.
Although economists still generally support free trade, they are beginning to take a more skeptical look at the doctrine in the light of present conditions. The Present Problem: Economists' Viewpoint Stephen V. O. Clarke, an economist who has served in senior positions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, suggests, ''Free trade is designed to serve the self-interest of the nation that is industrially dominant.'' In his view, Britain swung from mercantilism to free trade when it became industrially dominant early in the 19th century, and the United States followed a similar course in the earlier part of the 20th century.
One way of regarding the present surge of protectionist spirit, not only in Congress but also in American industry, is that the United States has lost confidence that it is the industrial leader and needs to revert to a more aggressive and nationalistic trade policy. Under this theory, Japan, as the emerging world leader, ought to embrace free trade. And indeed there are some signs that it is doing so, although some critics of Japan believe it has waited too long and has endangered an open world trading system by provoking American resentment and protectionist spirit.
How great is the danger that the mood of protectionism will prevail in the United States? And, if it does, how great is the danger that the world economy would suffer the kind of shock that followed Smoot-Hawley? Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate majority leader, says he has ''never seen stronger sentiment'' in Congress for restrictive trade legislation.
But President Reagan, seeking to undercut Congressional pressure for protectionism, has introduced a more aggressive policy to open foreign markets to American goods. He has said he would initiate a series of investigations into ''unfair trading practices'' of Japan, the European Economic Community, South Korea and Brazil. And it now seems likely that additional tough measures, intended to impress and appease Congress, will follow. Outcome Is Unknown On President's Efforts It is too early to know whether the President's efforts to stanch protectionism, possibly reinforced by his veto power, will prevail - or whether his efforts to use tough means to redress the American trade position will themselves become a form of protectionism.
If, in fact, protectionism does win out in the United States, either with Mr. Reagan's acceptance or despite his resistance, would it provoke retaliation and unleash the depressive forces that swept the world economy in the wake of Smoot-Hawley?
The disastrous effect last time of a worldwide trade war would probably have a considerable effect in causing many nations to try to scale down their counterattack on the American measures. The existence of international agreements - especially the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, past resolutions on open trade reached at economic summit conferences of leaders of the industrial countries and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - would act to check a trade war.
Geoffrey Bell, president of Geoffrey Bell & Company, a New York consulting firm that advises Venezuela and other countries on their economic policies, believes that the response of foreign countries to restrictive American measures would also be muted because of their strong interest in keeping a stake in the huge United States market, by far the biggest in the world. But Teh Kok Peng, chief economist for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, fears that many countries would be driven to respond to American protectionism because of domestic political reasons as well as economic reasons.
Even if trade barriers proliferated, however, they might not touch off the same kind of downward economic spiral into industrial stagnation and unemployment as happened in the 1930's. Since the Depression, nations have learned a great deal about how to use fiscal and monetary policy to maintain a high enough level of aggregate demand for goods and services to prevent a plunge into mass unemployment. In the United States 25 percent of the labor force was unemployed in 1933. Role of Central Banks In Counteracting Slump Last time many governments and monetary authorities raised taxes, cut spending and choked off demand, thereby aggravating the Depression, Next time - if there is one - both the governments and central banks of the industrial nations would almost certainly use monetary and fiscal policy to counteract the depressive forces as much as possible.
What could inhibit stimulative governmental measures, however, are the huge budget deficits in many countries, including the United States, and fears of inflation.
But if the potential for problems seems reduced now, the stakes are greater than they were in the 1930's. Nations have grown far more dependent on foreign trade as the world economy has become increasingly integrated. Just in the past two decades, total world exports and imports have each risen from 9 percent of gross domestic product to 17 percent.
Also, the developing countries have piled up enormous debts, which now exceed $800 billion. An outbreak of protectionism could gravely aggravate the world's precarious financial web. The developing countries, seeking to cope with their debt burdens, have been restraining imports and stimulating exports. A wave of protectionism, hitting the Brazils and Argentinas and Mexicos of this world by shutting out their exports, would make it impossible for them to service their debt, which would affect the banks in the industrial world that have lent heavily to them, threatening a financial disaster.
Thus, the policy issue confronting the United States today is not whether it will correct its gigantic trade deficit but how - whether by measures aimed at reducing imports or by measures aimed at expanding exports. A Different Strategy: Expansion of Exports Protectionist measures aimed at restricting imports, on the Smoot-Hawley model, run the danger of causing world trade to deteriorate and world depression to emerge. Measures to expand exports, on the contrary, can be made consistent with an open world trading system, encouraging efficiency and stimulating the growth of output, income and jobs.
Pursuing the latter course of expansion for the United States will involve reducing what the vast majority of economists regard as the overvaluation of the dollar. They do not think it is a coincidence that the rapid appreciation of the dollar since 1980 occurred at the same time as the worsening of the American trade deficit. Some economists attribute as much as two-thirds of the trade deficit to the overvalued dollar, which raises the prices of a broad range of American-made products abroad and cuts the prices of a broad range of foreign goods imported into the United States.
Restoring the dollar to a better alignment with other currencies involves several elements. Foreign countries might accelerate the growth of their economies or the United States could reduce its own growth or go into recession. This is likely to be a major issue at the coming meetings of the International Monetary Fund next month in Seoul, South Korea.
The United States might also seek to reduce its level of interest rates as a way of helping to bring down the foreign-exchange value of the dollar. But to reduce ''real'' interest rates -the nominal rates, adjusted for inflation - the United States would have to change its mix of fiscal and monetary policy. That would require, first of all, a major reduction in the Federal budget deficit, thereby reducing the Government's demand for funds, including foreign savings, to make way for an easier monetary policy by the Federal Reserve System, aimed at bringing down interest rates. Fed Remains Cautious On Specter of Inflation Some economists believe that the Federal Reserve could and should take more risks to bring down interest rates and the dollar's value, even in the absence of major budget-shrinking actions by Congress.
But Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and his colleagues remain cautious about reigniting inflation by such measures in the absence of a less stimulative fiscal policy.
The dollar has fallen about 10 percent since its peak in late February, but its decline seems to have stalled. And with the macroeconomic factors that have aggravated the United States trade deficit still uncorrected, Congress and the affected industrial and labor interests are focusing their efforts on dealing directly with the problem of import. The Jenkins bill, for example, would roll back textile imports by about 30 percent, and even stiffer measures than that have been proposed.
The President, having sought to stop the protectionist attack frontally - by vetoing a bill to cut shoe imports, for instance - now appears to be preparing a more aggressive line to accommodate Congressional pressures. His actions on the trade front are apparently aimed at heading off even tougher action by Congress. He is still hoping to deal with the trade problem mainly by opening foreign markets wider to American goods.
As long as the macroeconomic conditions making for an overvalued dollar and a huge trade surplus prevail, however, the trade issue (as Senator Dole has said) is likely to endure through the 1986 Congressional and 1988 Presidential elections, producing great political heat and increasing the risks of retaliation and a contraction in trade and the world economy.
Representative Willis Hawley, Republican of Oregon, and Senator Reed Smoot, Republican of Utah, co-authors of the tariff act of 1930 that bears their names, were Congressional leaders who made their mark as experts on taxation and finance.
Willis Hawley came to Congress in 1906 after having taught economics and constituitonal law at Willamette University, where he had earned bachelor of science and law degrees and also served as its president. In Congress, Mr. Hawley was named chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in 1928.
Mr. Hawley was one of many Republicans who lost his seat in the Democratic landslide of 1932, during the Great Depression, when Franklin D. Roosevelt won election to the White House. Many people believed the trade war that followed adoption of the Smoot-Hawley legislation aggravated the Depression. President Roosevelt, who had attacked the tariff act in his 1932 campaign, subsequently dismantled it. Mr. Hawley died in 1941 at the age of 77.
Reed Smoot, elected to the Senate in 1902, was an expert on tariff taxation and a champion of government economy. He became chairman of the Finance Committee, where he worked 17 months for passage of the tariff bill.
Mr. Smoot grew up in Salt Lake City and graduated from Brigham Young Academy (now Brigham Young University). In Utah he gained prominance in banking, mining, livestock raising and the manufacture of woolen goods. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention five times.
A well-known Mormon leader, Mr. Smoot was named president of the Utah Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and became one of the 12 apostles of the church in 1900. His election to the Senate was contested on the ground that, as a high Mormon official, he sanctioned polygamy in violation of the laws of Utah.
Like Mr. Hawley, he lost his Congressional seat in 1932. Mr. Smoot continued to serve in the church until his death in 1941.

Abstract: This outcome is not inevitable. Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, during his Congressional testimony last week, warned that ''we are piling up debts abroad in amounts unparalleled in our history,'' and said, ''When we are living on this much borrowed money, we are also living on borrowed time.'' But faced with the threat of a hard landing, Mr. Volcker gave the impression that the Fed would fight to halt the dollar's decline and capital outflow, even if it meant tighter money and higher interest rates. Preston Martin, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said in an interview yesterday that he believed the Group of 10 leading industrial countries was starting to come to grips with the need for cooperative action. ''This country can't go it alone,'' he said. ''Our partners in Europe and Japan have a bigger G.N.P. than the United States, and they must come forth with more stimulative policies.'' He said Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d was ''a skilled negotiator'' and would make them see the importance of expanding their economies and their imports as a contribution to restoring balance to the American trade position. At the same time, Mr. Martin said the United States needed to take a ''tougher line'' against foreign trade barriers and was sure that the new United States trade negotiator, Clayton K. Yeutter, would do so.

Full text: IS a soft landing for the dollar - a gradual decline that would reduce the United States trade deficit - feasible or has a hard landing, or a crash landing, now become virtually inescapable?
Stephen N. Marris of the Institute of International Economics finds a soft landing highly implausible as a matter of ''simple arithmetic.''
In the current issue of Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Mr. Marris calculates that if the dollar were to depreciate by 5 percent a year, it would take 14 years to eliminate the United States current account deficit, by which time the American external indebtedness would have risen to more than $2.3 trillion.
Such an external debt, he suggests, is nonsensical. But even if one could conceive of borrowing that much money, the real interest rates in this country would have to be so high - at least 5 percent above the potential United States growth rate - as to stifle economic growth. Alternatively, he calculates, real interest rates in other countries would have to be so low - 5 percent below their potential growth rates - as to breed virulent inflation.
Another version of the soft-landing scenario envisions capital inflows to the United States gradually slowing down to, say, 1 to 2 percent of gross national product by 1990. But, if the American economy were to maintain a moderate growth rate while gradually reducing its trade deficit, Mr. Marris estimates that this would require a 35 percent drop in the dollar by 1990 - by which time the United States net external debt would have risen to about $800 billion.
''In other words,'' he writes in the current Brookings Papers, ''some asset holders, somewhere, would have to be induced to increase their exposure in dollars by about $800 billion at a time when, for example, the German mark would be appreciating against the dollar by about 75 percent.''
That he finds unbelievable. Rather, he expects that for a period of a year to a year and a half, people's willingness to increase their dollar exposure will fall faster than the United States economy's need for capital inflows to make up for its deficiency of domestic savings.
The result is likely to be a financial ''crunch'' and a hard landing for the dollar, Mr. Marris says, with a shooting up of interest rates by at least five percentage points above what they otherwise would have been. That hard landing, he says, would cause a recession, rising unemployment and accelerating inflation in the United States, with fallout on other countries.
However, this outcome is not inevitable. Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, during his Congressional testimony last week, warned that ''we are piling up debts abroad in amounts unparalleled in our history,'' and said, ''When we are living on this much borrowed money, we are also living on borrowed time.'' But faced with the threat of a hard landing, Mr. Volcker gave the impression that the Fed would fight to halt the dollar's decline and capital outflow, even if it meant tighter money and higher interest rates.
Yet, despite Mr. Volcker's efforts to quiet what was in danger of becoming a ''disorderly'' market, the Fed's true aim appears to be to permit or even engineer a gradual decline in the dollar. Yet, along the way, it means to keep speculators from running wild.
Many academic economists, and some central bankers as well, believe that the United States cannot solve the problems of an overvalued dollar and a widening trade deficit on its own.
Preston Martin, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said in an interview yesterday that he believed the Group of 10 leading industrial countries was starting to come to grips with the need for cooperative action. ''This country can't go it alone,'' he said. ''Our partners in Europe and Japan have a bigger G.N.P. than the United States, and they must come forth with more stimulative policies.''
He said Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d was ''a skilled negotiator'' and would make them see the importance of expanding their economies and their imports as a contribution to restoring balance to the American trade position. At the same time, Mr. Martin said the United States needed to take a ''tougher line'' against foreign trade barriers and was sure that the new United States trade negotiator, Clayton K. Yeutter, would do so.
But thus far the response from America's trade partners has been sluggish at best. ''There is at present absolutely no sign that Japan, West Germany or the United Kingdom would be prepared to take expansionary action of the required order of magnitude,'' Mr. Marris said.
In a time of growing world deflationary pressure - most notably in the area of oil prices, with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries near the point of cracking - the European countries and Japan remain most afraid of inflation. They fear that a decline in the value of the dollar would exacerbate that problem. Besides, they do not want to give up the advantage to their own export-oriented economies that an overvalued dollar conveys.
So the United States trade deficit continues to worsen, and the danger of a hard landing for the dollar increases. The question now is whether the Western allies can move ahead of an economic crisis, or whether, however risky, a crisis has become crucial to a solution.

Abstract: To be sure, what is true for the United States is emphatically not true for other parts of the world. Oil prices, for the most part, are denominated in dollars, and the strengthening dollar has overwhelmed falling oil prices for Western Europe. The result is that in real terms the Europeans are paying more than they ever have in the past - the effects of the strong dollar on their prices are rightly referred to as the ''third oil shock.'' If the United States were only a consumer of energy, all this would be enough. The United States is also a producer, and falling oil prices trouble and threaten ''good faith'' energy investment. This applies right across the spectrum - making allies, ironically, of people who have seen themselves in competition with each other - from those involved in alternatives and conservation to those in domestic oil and gas. Many banks, looking at their energy portfolios, will share that distress. These are the groups that will seek a tariff to protect the domestic energy economy.

Full text: The crisis in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is clear to everyone. Hardly recognized, however, is the extent to which the second oil price shock - the rapid rise in prices between 1979 and 1981 - is almost over, at least for the American consumer.
The price of oil has been falling for four years. Since 1981, it has dropped more than 25 percent. The drop is even sharper if we take inflation into account. In real terms, oil prices have fallen 40 percent since 1981.Yet even this does not capture the full extent of the drop. When corrected for inflation, United States oil prices in 1985 are just about back to where they were in 1975 - $27.66 per barrel in April versus $27.07 in 1975.
The change is even more striking if we turn to the price at the gasoline pump. If you put 1975 prices into 1985 dollars, the American motorist was paying only a dime less then than now - $1.12 in 1975, compared to today's $1.22.
Four factors have been responsible for this: conservation, the recession, weak economic activity and the growth of alternative, non-OPEC supplies. All of this has put us in an era of surplus in which prices have nowhere to go but down.
To be sure, what is true for the United States is emphatically not true for other parts of the world. Oil prices, for the most part, are denominated in dollars, and the strengthening dollar has overwhelmed falling oil prices for Western Europe. The result is that in real terms the Europeans are paying more than they ever have in the past - the effects of the strong dollar on their prices are rightly referred to as the ''third oil shock.''
The forces that brought oil prices down continue to work. World oil demand is proving very slow to recover, even with renewed economic growth. Many markets for oil have permanently shrunk. Coal and nuclear power have taken over much electricity production from oil - to such an extent that France, for instance, is now trying to sell its nuclear-generated electricity - once a program of national survival - to its neighbors at bargain rates! Other markets will be constricted. Americans will continue to replace cars that get 12 miles to the gallon with cars that get 26 and 27 miles to the gallon.
American consumers are winners from falling oil prices. Less of their budgets will go to paying for energy, meaning that they will have more money to spend for other purposes. The non-oil developing world is also a big winner.
Another winner is the Reagan Administration. Falling oil prices provide a stimulus to economic growth and a most welcome antidote to inflation. Both are very valuable in a time of huge and intractable budget deficits and uncertain economic performance.
If the United States were only a consumer of energy, all this would be enough. The United States is also a producer, and falling oil prices trouble and threaten ''good faith'' energy investment. This applies right across the spectrum - making allies, ironically, of people who have seen themselves in competition with each other - from those involved in alternatives and conservation to those in domestic oil and gas. Many banks, looking at their energy portfolios, will share that distress. These are the groups that will seek a tariff to protect the domestic energy economy.
Further weakness in price will undermine the rationale for a great deal of existing and new investment in energy. Energy consumers will conclude that conservation investment is less important. Oil companies will reduce their efforts to develop new oil fields in frontier regions.
Does this mean that the world will again face a difficult energy situation in the future? Not for several years, at least. The surplus of oil and energy worldwide is very large - so large that tankers and oil installations in the Persian Gulf can be attacked and the price of oil goes down, not up. That cushion will be quite a number of years in eroding. Oil will beome more like other commodities, with volatile prices.
But unless there is a major technological development, at some point the reduction in energy investment will come back to haunt us, and market realities will again give way to geological realities - the concentration of oil reserves in OPEC and in the Middle East. And that will eventually put the era of surplus behind us.

PRACTICAL TRAVELER: WHEN PAYING WITH DOLLARS COSTS MORE

Abstract: A notable exception, however, is the QE2. ''You can buy in pounds in London only if you are a U.K. resident - if your passport is British,'' said Alice Marshall, Cunard's assistant vice president for public relations in New York. ''If we charged U.K. residents the same price we charged others,'' she added, ''there wouldn't be any U.K. business because it would be priced out of the market.'' Under ''Tour Conditions'' on page 82 of its 1985 ''Europe's Best Bargains'' brochure, distributed in the United States, Cosmos Tourama states that its dollar prices were set in August 1984 and are subject to increase without notice if rates change substantially. ''In converting all the European currencies which make up the Cosmos tour prices to U.S. dollars,'' the company says, ''it has been necessary to use a rate approximately 5 percent higher than the current (August 1984) bank rates of exchange to cover the higher cost involved in making reservations in Europe available in the United States.'' Here is one of the results, based on a comparison of this brochure, obtained in New York, with one obtained from Cosmos in London. A 14-day ''Grand European Folklore'' tour, beginning and ending in London, is priced at $549 a person in the United States and $:389 ($486) in Britain. Can an American pay in pounds in London? ''We don't care what they are,'' said Jeffrey Joseph, executive vice president, sales and marketing, for Cosmos in New York. ''They can be green, yellow, Americans, Britons -it doesn't make any difference.''

Full text: They have never met, but Robert B. Turner and Sol Chazin have something in common. Each of them has taken an escorted tour conducted by a London-based company called Voyages Jules Verne and each has been disturbed by what happened. Among their principal complaints was that Americans paid substantially more than Europeans on the same tours.
Mr. Turner, who lives in Manhattan Beach, Minn., paid $9,310 for his wife and himself to travel by air and rail from London to Hong Kong along what the company calls ''The Golden Road to Far Cathay.'' The journey began Sept. 19 and ended Oct. 28. In a recent letter to The New York Times, Mr. Turner said, ''During the trip we discovered that Jules Verne had a dual pricing policy. North Americans paid 57 percent more!''
Mr. Chazin, a mechanical engineer from Tenafly, N.J., traveled through India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, mostly by rail, on a tour called ''The Raj Express.'' The trip began in London on Feb. 5 and ended there March 13. ''To start with,'' Mr. Chazin complained in early April, ''I paid $4,100 for the excursion. The rest of the 22 tour members - mostly British -had booked the trip in London for $:2,500. I'm no mathematician, but the exchange rate seems a little off there. Considering that the British pound is worth $1.05 or so, I overpaid by roughly 45 percent.''
By mid-May, the pound had strengthened and was running about $1.25. Even so, there were substantial disparities between what some of the same trips cost in London and in the United States. Voyages Jules Verne was hardly alone in dual pricing; such policies extended to much larger operations, including Cosmos Tourama and Trafalgar Tours, both based in London, and trans-Atlantic sailings of Cunard Line's Queen Elizabeth 2.
In some cases, there are ways to get around this. Most tours out of London can be bought there in pounds. You usually have to be there, however, and identify yourself as the actual passenger. This could mean that if a tour is popular and you do not arrive until shortly before departure, it might be sold out.
A notable exception, however, is the QE2. ''You can buy in pounds in London only if you are a U.K. resident - if your passport is British,'' said Alice Marshall, Cunard's assistant vice president for public relations in New York. ''If we charged U.K. residents the same price we charged others,'' she added, ''there wouldn't be any U.K. business because it would be priced out of the market.''
So, according to Miss Marshall, an inside cabin in trans-Atlantic class, the lower of the two classes on the ship, with upper and lower berths, on a sailing from Southampton to New York, costs Americans $1,510 a person, based on two in a cabin, but it costs Britons $:855. The British price amounts to $1,067, or $443 less, computed on the recent rate of $1.25 to a pound. A first-class cabin with two lower beds costs Americans $2,720 and Britons $:1,540 ($1,925). A deluxe cabin with two lower berths (and dining in the choice Princess Grill) costs Americans $3,440 a person and Britons $:1,945 ($2,431).
To take advantage of the favorable pound rate, a Briton who planned to sail from New York to Southampton would have to buy his ticket in Britain before leaving home. ''We don't sell in pounds in the United States,'' Miss Marshall said.
Tour operators defend dual pricing on the ground that they have to establish rates up to a year in advance. Said Philip Morrell, managing director of Travel Promotions Ltd., which owns Voyages Jules Verne: ''Trying to anticipate what will happen between the dollar and the pound is like trying to hit a moving target.''
Operators say it costs more to market tours in the United States than in Europe. They cite higher costs for advertising and handling reservations. Reached in London, Mr. Morrell said commissions to travel agents run about 15 percent higher in the United States than in Britain because the rate is higher here and because all his American sales are through agents while half his British sales are direct to travelers.
Should the dollar weaken, it could work to Americans' advantage on European travel for which prices are guaranteed in dollars. Americans would find, however, that shopping and any accommodations and meals not included in a tour package would cost much more than they do now.
Miss Marshall of Cunard said, however, that the company's price structure was based primarily on local conditions rather than on currency fluctuations. ''Prices are raised or lowered according to inflation in local markets,'' she said. ''Prices have been sort of steady for the past few years. But if the inflation rate in the United States was 5 percent, that's about how much rates would go up in the United States. If inflation in the U.K. was 15 percent, that's about how much rates would go up in the U.K.''
Under ''Tour Conditions'' on page 82 of its 1985 ''Europe's Best Bargains'' brochure, distributed in the United States, Cosmos Tourama states that its dollar prices were set in August 1984 and are subject to increase without notice if rates change substantially. ''In converting all the European currencies which make up the Cosmos tour prices to U.S. dollars,'' the company says, ''it has been necessary to use a rate approximately 5 percent higher than the current (August 1984) bank rates of exchange to cover the higher cost involved in making reservations in Europe available in the United States.''
Here is one of the results, based on a comparison of this brochure, obtained in New York, with one obtained from Cosmos in London. A 14-day ''Grand European Folklore'' tour, beginning and ending in London, is priced at $549 a person in the United States and $:389 ($486) in Britain. Can an American pay in pounds in London? ''We don't care what they are,'' said Jeffrey Joseph, executive vice president, sales and marketing, for Cosmos in New York. ''They can be green, yellow, Americans, Britons -it doesn't make any difference.''
Similarly, the same ''Scenic Europe'' itinerary of Trafalgar Tours is priced at $775 in the United States and $:420 ($525) in London. For Americans, however, the price includes three nights in London hotels, which are not part of the British offering. So if you subtract $99 for those nights (at Trafalgar's listed rate of $33 a night), the comparable American price drops to $676. (In its British brochure, however, Trafalgar offers, as an optional extra, the same accommodations at $:22 - $27.50 - a night.) Asked to comment, Nigel Osborne, vice president, sales and marketing, for Trafalgar in New York, said, ''We don't specifically market those tours in the U.K. The brochures are there in our London reception center in case somebody returning from one of our tours wants to buy another one.''
With American Express, the policy is different, according to Miriam Trokan, manager of business support communications. She said that most of its European tours were priced in dollars and a European who paid in local currency would do so at the then-current exchange rate. The company's short tours and villa vacations - priced in pounds - could be bought by anyone at that rate, she said.
Explaining Jules Verne's dual pricing, Mr. Morrell said that many of the company's expenses were incurred in Communist or developing countries where they had to be paid in dollars or at rates set in relation to the dollar. He said that few Britons took his tours anyway (a point that some travelers have disputed) and that, because trade regulations limited the surcharges that could be imposed on them, they were in effect being subsidized by non-Britons. He said, however, that if an American in London insisted on paying the pound price, he could do so, but that in mid-May the rates in the 1985 brochure were subject to a 9.9 percent surcharge and that prices for 1986 would be up to 20 percent higher than those advertised for this year.
Once an American has paid in dollars - as Mr. Turner of Minnesota and Mr. Chazin of New Jersey learned after substantial correspondence - seeking a refund is likely to be futile.

Abstract: * The Measurex Corporation in Cupertino, Calif., makes computerized manufacturing systems, mostly for the paper industry. Ten years ago, well before the rise of the dollar, Measurex opened a factory in Waterford, Ireland, where it assembles its systems for sale to the European market. But in January, because of the dollar, the company switched to ''local currency pricing'' - quoting its prices in foreign currencies rather than dollars, to remain competitive, even though that means lower earnings in terms of dollars. ''We can't demand a fixed dollar price any more,'' said Robert McAdams Jr., senior vice president for finance. ''The competition won't allow us to do that.'' * The Brunswick Corporation in Skokie, Ill., is a diversified manufacturer whose products include the Mercury and Mariner brands of outboard motors. ''Over the past four years, our motor sales have declined, mostly because of the dollar,'' said Max E. McGrath, vice president for finance. Japanese competitors - Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha - have captured much of Brunswick's market. ''We're dealing with it,'' he said, ''primarily with an extensive cost-reduction program, so when we deliver our engines our goal is to meet their price.'' Brunswick is also importing more engines from Japan under its own label. * The Briggs & Stratton Corporation in St. Paul is one of the nation's best-known makers of gasoline and diesel engines. ''We get pretty emotional about the dollar,'' said L. William Dewey, executive vice president. ''We used to have 26 percent of our sales outside the United States. Right now, it's less than half that. We attribute it almost totally to the dollar.'' Briggs & Stratton's strategy for dealing with Japanese competitors in America is ''zero pricing,'' which means the company does not raise prices. Overseas, the company, like Measurex, has switched to ''local currency pricing.'' In the 1960's, Mr. Dewey said, the company considered opening a manufacturing plant abroad and decided not to. ''It's a strategy we have to seriously consider again,'' he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON THE week of the dollar is over.
And in the immediate aftermath, it is clear that the world's leading industrial powers have quietly agreed that the dollar must be stopped.
Their strategy showed itself with a vengeance in midweek after the dollar had registered one of its biggest one-day gains in history - reflecting a marketplace view that President Reagan would do nothing to bring it down. The Western nations sold dollars from their reserves - more than one billion by most accounts - and with that, it was evident that the Administration and its Western allies were trying to move toward a common economic policy that would eventually bring the dollar into check.
The scale of the governments' intervention Wednesday appeared to come partly in response to the statement of Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that interventions to date had been too small to make a difference. With the Germans in the lead, the countries stunned the market with an overflow of dollars and provoked one of the dollar's sharpest one-day declines in history.
It looked like a bold move, and indeed it was compared with the rare and tentative interventions of the last few years. But $50 billion to $100 billion washes through the currency markets each day, and to many of the market's experts, the intervention last week - by itself - could do little more than discourage another rise like Monday's. ''It would take $10 billion to $15 billion to count as a substantial amount,'' said Roger Kubarych, chief economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York until January and now at the Conference Board.
More significant than the size of last week's intervention was the signal it sent of the changing official attitudes toward the dollar and the future roles of the economies that underlie major currencies. The dollar, the intervention said, has become politically untenable, especially for the Reagan Administration. Damage to such sensitive constituencies as farmers and numerous manufacturers is finally forcing the President to modify his long-held view that the dollar should ride with the tides of the open market.
''One could make the argument until the middle of last year that the rise of the dollar was beneficial in forcing companies to operate more efficiently,'' said Robert D. Hormats, an economist at Goldman Sachs and formerly a top State Department economist in the Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan Administrations. ''But industries are now getting hurt by imports through no fault of their own, like Caterpillar Tractor and DuPont. The question is, what pace of this adjustment is acceptable. That's where we are today.''
The new Reagan strategy is likely to include a major intervention, in cooperation with its partners, to derail any sharp, future ascent of the dollar. It appears also to incorporate a new willingness to slow the American economy, should it show signs of growing faster than the 4 percent annual rate that the Administration has set as its goal for the years ahead. Faster growth would intensify credit demand, pushing up interest rates and, presumably, demand for dollars to invest in United States securities at the higher rates.
And finally, the new Reagan approach officially acknowledges, for the first time, a link between Federal budget deficits and the might of the dollar. To get one down, the other must come down, James A. Baker 3d, the new Treasury Secretary, said a few days ago.
Nothing, of course, says that such an ambitious policy will work. Previous efforts among the industrialized nations to synchronize their economies have failed. Over the next year or two, inflation could reappear in Europe as the new economic growth there reduces the 10-percent unemployment level and factories begin to push the limits of their capacity. The United States could dip into a recession next year, as many economists expect. Inflation in Europe and flagging growth in the United States would force unwanted shifts in currency values that the countries would be hard put to prevent.
Still, the message coming from the Reagan Administration and its Western allies last week was that they seek only a modest decline in the dollar's value - certainly nothing more than 5 or 10 percent over the next year, a drop that would barely erase the dollar's 9 percent rise since December alone. The reluctance to allow a precipitous fall stems from the realization that the accelerating recovery in Europe and in the developing world has come to depend on the profits earned from exports to the United States.
''It would be a mistake to believe that the rest of the world can afford a dollar that comes down too much,'' said Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Europe would lose jobs if the dollar were to collapse.'' Adds James T. McGroarty, vice president for foreign exchange at the Discount Corporation of New York: ''Everyone fears a major intervention package. I don't see the ingredients there. I don't think the political will is there.''
THE new Reagan dollar strategy
falls into line with the views of
Mr. Volcker, who said twice in Congressional testimony last week that intervention can be useful as one of several tools to bring down the dollar.
From mid-January through the third week of February, the major Western nations intervened several times, but in small amounts, totaling about $4.5 billion, without noticeable affect, a Treasury official said. ''It was eaten up,'' he said. ''Baker thinks it's absurd. He saw it didn't do anything.'' Last week's intervention, however, was different.
Mr. Volcker and Reagan officials hold that the real way to bring foreign currencies into a better alignment with the dollar is by improving the balance of the economies behind the currencies.
That's also the view in Europe. Until a few months ago, the governments of Europe assailed and even ridiculed the contentions of the Reagan Administration that its economic policies - even with their associated budget deficits - were beneficial for the world. Reagan officials argued that their policies brought on the American recovery and thereby created markets for foreign manufacturers.
The Europeans, however, had argued that the explosion of Government borrowing that the deficits required pushed up interest rates and those high rates in turn lured capital from Europe, stifling investment there and driving up the dollar. They wanted the deficit cut and the dollar driven down. They did not want to raise their own interest rates and thus risk slower growth.
But now European officials are talking of the extent to which their export industries have benefited from the mighty dollar. With their production costs declining in dollar terms, European companies were able to undersell their American competitors, both in world markets and the United States. Their soaring profits have washed through the economies of Europe, pulling all from the prolonged recession of the early 1980's. In short, their recovery is export- driven, with the help of a strong dollar.
The countries' stock markets have been rising, signalling resurgent investment, and their interest rates now are close to the levels of the United States. That has made European governments less critical of Reagan Administration economic policies. Their attitudes vary now, but in general their intervention shows that they want the dollar down - but not by too much.
MEANWHILE, a Reagan Administration that stood back and cheered the rise of the dollar as validation of its economic policies is having second thoughts of its own, mostly because the strong dollar is rousing such political unrest in the United States.
Farmers are mounting marches on Washington, appealing for Federal aid and vigorous action to bring down the dollar. It has been so strong that a grain company decided recently that it could ship Argentine wheat half- way around the world and sell it at a profit to a Louisiana flour mill, for less than wheat purchased in Kansas. The angry outcry of farmer organizations stopped that deal.
The aging behemoths of steel, shoes and textiles, at the same time, stepped up their demands for protection against the rush of foreign imports, and they are no longer alone. For otherwise healthy, growing industries, even the thriving computer industry, the rising value of the dollar has been overwhelming.
Robert W. Galvin, chairman of Motorola, one of the giants of American technology, has called for a temporary, 20-percent tax on imports of foreign goods. ''Kellogg will still make cereal in Battle Creek,'' he says. ''But we see a grave injury to American manufacturing taking place under our nose.''
Under this sort of pressure, the first sign of the shift in the Administration's attitude turns out to have been the meeting here last Jan. 17 of the top economic officials of the five leading industrial countries - the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and France. It was to have been a routine meeting without public coverage. But the ministers released a communique, restating their commitment to joint intervention in the currency markets when they became ''disorderly,'' and Donald T. Regan, then the Treasury Secretary, added that the disorderly criterion had been broadened to cover intervention when it would be ''helpful.''
It wasn't clear then what helpful meant. It seemed to reflect a desire to placate Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had written to President Reagan just days before the meeting. ''She said 'give me a hand with the pound,' '' a Treasury official recalled, ''and you don't want to be unkind to your best friend.'' With the small interventions that followed the meeting, however, it became evident that help for Mrs. Thatcher would also help the United States.
Acontinually rising dollar could
pose even greater risks to the
Administration's fervent commitment to open markets, both for currency and trade. The President's first-term agreements to set up protectionist trade barriers for such industries as steel, textiles and motorcycles were compromises enough, Administration officials say.
To stem the dollar-driven domestic demand for protectionism, then, the Administration is redoubling its efforts to force the rest of the world, and Japan and Europe in particular, to drop their barriers to imports of American goods.
Just last week, the Secretary of Commerce, Malcolm Baldrige, demonstrated the point at an unusual news conference. He announced that to persuade the Japanese to talk ''nitty-gritty'' about opening their markets to American goods, he had canceled the Tokyo visit of a senior trade negotiator because the Japanese, Mr. Baldrige said, only wanted to discuss ''generalities.''
At the same time, he said, he urged repeal of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act to allow American companies to merge and to cut costs so that they could compete more effectively against foreign competitors - a drastic step that found a chilly reception in Congress.
For all the political concern over the impact of the dollar, economists disagree over the damage it has wrought to the American economy by opening the nation to such an influx of foreign goods and cutting so deeply into exports.
Certainly farming has been hurt. ''Harvested acreage is coming down from its peak of the early 80's,'' said Robbin Johnson, a vice president of Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, the company that pondered shipping the Argentine wheat to the United States. ''We are slowly but surely shrinking the acreage devoted to wheat.'' Big grain companies like Cargill, too, are losing ground because their vast investment in storage and shipping facilities in the United States are operating far below capacity.
MANY of the jobs in the automobile, steel and leather goods industries that were lost in the last recession are gone for good, partly because of the dollar. But companies in healthier industries have relinquished American jobs as well, moving operations abroad because of the pressure of the dollar, and buying materials and parts abroad that they previously bought from American manufacturers.
Anthony M. Solomon, who recently retired as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, suspects that the jobs that have been lost to the dollar will be a long time coming home. ''My guess would be that if the dollar were to decline,'' he said, ''it would be somewhat easier for us to regain a significant part of those export markets that have recently been lost, especially in the agricultural commodities, than it will be to erase the increase in the import share of manufactured goods.''
Employment in manufacturing has fallen 6 percent since 1979, according to Mr. Dornbusch, the M.I.T. economist. ''When the dollar comes down, those firms aren't going to be there,'' he said.
The country's huge machine tools business is one of the biggest victims of the strong dollar. Imports accounted for 8 percent of all domestic business spending for machine tools in 1970. Ten years later their share of the market had doubled. By 1983, it was 20 percent, and last year, with the dollar taking an ever-bigger toll, it was 26 percent.
Economists, however, also look at American business in another context. In the aggregate, more new businesses have been formed since the recession ended than in any simliar period, business investment in new domestic factories and cost-reduction equipment has been uncommonly strong, and employment has climbed all through the economy's recovery and subsequent expansion. Many are service jobs that on average pay less than manufacturing jobs, but still, there are more jobs.
''Some people say the trade deficit costs 3 million jobs - that's preposterous,'' said Robert Z. Lawrence, economist at the Brookings Institution. ''The same process that has given us the trade deficit has given us economic growth. Many of the jobs that are lost are really hypothetical. Not adding hypothetical jobs is quite a difference from actually losing jobs.''
ECONOMISTS are also uncertain
how the dollar might behave
once it starts to decline in value. In the conventional view, born of historical precedent, a lower dollar could mean somewhat higher inflation in the United States, but it could also mean a reduction in the trade deficit and, over- all, a healthier, more balanced economy.
Little in the behavior of the dollar of the 1980's, however, has much precedent in history. In rising more than 70 percent since the middle of 1980, the dollar has climbed far beyond the boundaries of normal currency behavior, defying one nugget of conventional wisdom after another.
Currencies are supposed to fall when the trade of the economies behind them fall into deficit, but the United States has recorded two consecutive years of record trade deficits, and still the dollar rose. Currencies are supposed to fall when the economies behind them are more inflationary than others, but inflation in the United States, although low, exceeds that of Japan, and yet the dollar kept rising against the yen.
Most orthodox economists, including Mr. Volcker, say repeatedly that a sharp fall of the dollar means rising domestic inflation. But David C. Lund, a Commerce Department economist, has produced a study arguing that there would be far less inflation than most economists have promised. Commodity prices could quickly rebound, he said, but the prices of European and manufactured goods might not change.
Those prices never went down. They merely stabilized, and as the dollar rose, the foreign manufacturers reaped fatter profits. Once the dollar declines and American prices become more competitive, there's room in the foreigners' profits to hold prices down. ''It's Newton's other law,'' Mr. Lund said. ''What didn't go down won't go back up.''
It could even turn out that all the efforts of Europe, Japan, the Reagan Administration and Mr. Volcker to move the dollar will be for naught. A sounder worldwide economy would mean lower budget deficits, and lower budget deficits could prove just the recipe for another ascent of the dollar.
''The United States would be in such a strong position without that last black cloud hanging over it,'' said Edward L. Hudgins, economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ''If the deficit went down, all other things being equal, the exchange rate of the dollar would go up.''
STRUGGLINGTO LIVE WITH A MUSCULAR DOLLAR
The strong dollar has changed the way American companies do business:
* The Huffy Corporation in Miamisburg, Ohio, is the country's largest maker of bicycles, and it has a peculiar problem with the dollar. The currency of its chief competitor, Taiwan, is tied to the dollar, so both rise and fall together. Thus Taiwan faces the same difficulty in selling to foreign markets that American companies do, and it concentrates its efforts on the United States. ''Four or five years ago, we built a plant in Ponca City, Okla.,'' said the chairman of Huffy, Stuart J. Northrop. ''We've had to close that facility, and it's up for sale.''
* Cincinnati Milacron Inc. is one of the world's leading producers of machine tools. To keep its domestic costs down, a spokesman said, ''we're increasing our worldwide sourcing'' - buying the materials and components the company needs from abroad, rather than from American manufacturers. In addition, it has hired subcontractors in Japan to make its robots for the Far Eastern market. ''That market is virtually closed to us because of the yen-dollar gap,'' the spokesman said. The company has also licensed a major Japanese company, Fanuc, to make its injecting-molding machine, used to make plastics.
* The Measurex Corporation in Cupertino, Calif., makes computerized manufacturing systems, mostly for the paper industry. Ten years ago, well before the rise of the dollar, Measurex opened a factory in Waterford, Ireland, where it assembles its systems for sale to the European market. But in January, because of the dollar, the company switched to ''local currency pricing'' - quoting its prices in foreign currencies rather than dollars, to remain competitive, even though that means lower earnings in terms of dollars. ''We can't demand a fixed dollar price any more,'' said Robert McAdams Jr., senior vice president for finance. ''The competition won't allow us to do that.''
* The Brunswick Corporation in Skokie, Ill., is a diversified manufacturer whose products include the Mercury and Mariner brands of outboard motors. ''Over the past four years, our motor sales have declined, mostly because of the dollar,'' said Max E. McGrath, vice president for finance. Japanese competitors - Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha - have captured much of Brunswick's market. ''We're dealing with it,'' he said, ''primarily with an extensive cost-reduction program, so when we deliver our engines our goal is to meet their price.'' Brunswick is also importing more engines from Japan under its own label.
* The U.S. Shoe Corporation in Cincinnati is the country's No. 2 supplier of shoes, the producer of such brands as Red Cross Papagallo, Capezio and Liz Claiborne. Its competition with imports predates the rise of the dollar. It has been manufacturing overseas for more than 20 years, and imports account for 65 to 70 percent of the women's shoes it sells in the United States. With the rise of the dollar, a spokesman said, its import business has been thriving, and its domestic manufacturing waning. It has laid off workers in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.
* The Briggs & Stratton Corporation in St. Paul is one of the nation's best-known makers of gasoline and diesel engines. ''We get pretty emotional about the dollar,'' said L. William Dewey, executive vice president. ''We used to have 26 percent of our sales outside the United States. Right now, it's less than half that. We attribute it almost totally to the dollar.'' Briggs & Stratton's strategy for dealing with Japanese competitors in America is ''zero pricing,'' which means the company does not raise prices. Overseas, the company, like Measurex, has switched to ''local currency pricing.'' In the 1960's, Mr. Dewey said, the company considered opening a manufacturing plant abroad and decided not to. ''It's a strategy we have to seriously consider again,'' he said.

Abstract: ''The second half of the 1980's will be a better period,'' said David Kern, chief economist at the National Westminster Bank here. ''We haven't eliminated economic cycles, but the low points will be a very small decline and remain higher than the average for the previous 10 years.'' ''There is, at the moment, a reversing of the roles between the United States and Europe,'' said Hans Mast, chief economist of Credit Suisse in Zurich. ''Growth in Europe will be helping the United States' economy by the second half of the year.'' ''The 1970's saw a large write-down in perceptions of what was achievable,'' said Michael Emerson, chief economist to the European Economic Commission in Brussels. ''Public attitudes have been through a sea change.''

Full text: Analysts are being pleasantly surprised by the economic recovery that began in Britain in 1982, gathered steam last year in Germany and now is taking hold in virtually every country from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean.
''The recovery in Europe has been stronger than expected,'' said David Kingston, chief economist for PA Management Consultants and a specialist in business strategy for the London-based firm.
The main reason, according to Mr. Kingston and many of his peers, is the strength of the dollar, which has spurred European exports to the United States. But modest increases in domestic consumer demand and more industrial investment than some analysts predicted are also factors.
''There's been a sharp increase in manufacturing investment,'' Mr. Kingston said. ''In some areas, such as advanced engineering materials like plastics, it is moving quite rapidly.''
A few analysts see an even brighter picture. Economists at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. argue that it is a mistake to attribute Europe's progress to higher exports. They note that high exports are a result of exchange-rate imbalances related to high interest rates in the United States, and that the rates have also had a depressing effect on Europe by luring some investment funds across the Atlantic.
''Europe is putting its economic and financial house in order despite, not because of, developments in the United States,'' they wrote in the New York-based investment firm's latest monthly international investment study. ''We believe that it has accomplished and is accomplishing a far greater victory than it now realizes.''
Range of Performances

No recovery comes at the same pace to all nations in an area as diverse as Western Europe, whose combined economies are almost as large as that of the United States.
Finland's economy, for example, grew more than 4 percent last year, after adjustments to account for inflation, while Portugal's output fell by more than 2 percent. In addition, as in the United States, performance varies widely from industry to industry and from region to region within the larger countries.
The most hopeful sign is probably West Germany's 4 percent growth rate since the end of a nationwide strike last June by IG Metall, its largest manufacturing union. That development in Western Europe's largest economy was greeted editorially in The Times of London as evidence ''that Europe is not quite as moribund as both sides of the Atlantic had come to believe.''
And Britain, now entering its fourth year of growth, could get an increase of 1 percentage point or more to its growth rate this year from the end of the 10-month-old miners' strike, which observers believe is on the verge of collapse.
Inflation figures, which are generally declining or holding steady, are another reason for positive thinking. Moreover, those rates have been achieved despite the inflationary impact of the rising dollar, the currency used to pay for imported commodities. Thus, analysts have concluded, most of Europe has made more progress in controlling the domestic sources of inflation than the recorded inflation figures indicate.
Sustained Growth Suggested

To be sure, Europe's growth figures and outlook remain unimpressive by American or Japanese standards. In 1985, according to the most recent forecast by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Europe's economies will grow 2.5 percent while that of the United States will expand by 3 percent and Japan by 5 percent. However, the trends suggest that, like its more prosperous trading partners, Europe may have emerged from the volatile 1970's into an era where it can achieve sustained growth with low inflation.
''The second half of the 1980's will be a better period,'' said David Kern, chief economist at the National Westminster Bank here. ''We haven't eliminated economic cycles, but the low points will be a very small decline and remain higher than the average for the previous 10 years.''
As the O.E.C.D. now sees it, 1985 will be the first year since 1978 in which no European nation suffers a decline in output. Moreover, it will be a year in which Europe's rate of growth increases slightly while that of the United States and Japan declines, at least temporarily narrowing the growth gap in a manner that some economists believe highlights the significance of a healthy Europe to its trading partners.
''There is, at the moment, a reversing of the roles between the United States and Europe,'' said Hans Mast, chief economist of Credit Suisse in Zurich. ''Growth in Europe will be helping the United States' economy by the second half of the year.''
Some Reservations

Such positive developments are not quite enough to eliminate the grimace economists normally wear when discussing Europe. ''Things are looking better, but they are not rosy,'' said Richard Freeman, chief economist for Imperial Chemicals Industries P.L.C.
The main problem is that projected growth rates are not nearly strong enough to prevent 1985 from being the 13th straight year of rising unemployment. Unemployment for the region as a whole may creep up to 12 percent in 1986, with little prospect of a significant drop in the next few years.
Some countries, such as Sweden, have managed to keep unemployment rates low by heavy spending on training and subsidized employment programs. Most have decided, however, that the policies of Sweden's Social Democrats are too inflationary or simply unworkable in their countries as old industries are forced to trim workers in the battle to become efficient enough to compete.
The unemployment situation is expensive in both human and financial terms, creating pressures for Government spending and intervention that some fear will undo Europe's progress in controlling inflation.
The danger, as economists like those at the O.E.C.D. see it, is that Governments will pump resources into spending programs that do little to create long-term employment.
According to O.E.C.D. figures for the past two years, demand rose at comparable rates in Europe and the United States - almost 20 percent - but the result in Europe was a much lower increase in output and a higher increase in prices to meet that demand than in the United States.
A Change in Direction

Most economists agree that such structural problems - often blamed on the strength of Europe's trade unions and restrictive trade practices - are a major, chronic shortcoming. However, where Governments once freely legislated to protect citizens from economic changes at the cost of hobbling growth, they now move gingerly in the opposite direction. Thus, countries like Belgium, France, Denmark, Italy and Spain have all begun to dismantle indexed wage increase systems that guaranteed workers protection from inflation.
''The 1970's saw a large write-down in perceptions of what was achievable,'' said Michael Emerson, chief economist to the European Economic Commission in Brussels. ''Public attitudes have been through a sea change.''
A key aspect of the change has been the effort of Governments of all philosophical hues, from Sweden's Social Democrats to Britain's Conservatives, to encourage private enterprise. ''There is a feeling everywhere that you need less Government and more market,'' said Mr. Mast.
Rise in Confidence

Business profits have soared during the recovery and so, in many cases, has confidence in Europe's ability to compete internationally.
''Twelve months ago, I thought Sweden was lagging behind the United States on economic restructuring,'' said Gunnar Eliasson, head of the Industrial Institute for Economic and Social Research in Stockholm. ''Now, I think we might be a bit ahead.''
Where Europe is clearly behind, there are often signs that it is headed in the right direction.
Despite the slow development of the domestic computer industry - Britain's home computer makers excepted - Europe is now embarked on a steep growth curve in the application of some forms of information technology. The technology is expected to improve productivity and increase Europe's ability to compete internationally.
In the field of personal business computers, for example, the London- based market research firm of IDC Europa estimates that annual sales will jump from 500,000 units in 1983 to 5 million by 1989.
Europe also seems to be moving, albeit slowly, toward more flexible financial markets and the development of venture capital resources. More funds should encourage the creation of more start-up companies in high-technology areas. Europe's poor performance on this front is widely regarded as a threat to future growth prospects.

Full text: STAYING ON TOP
The Business Case for a National Industrial Strategy. By Kevin P. Phillips. 171 pp. New York: Random House. $15.95.
KEVIN P. PHILLIPS, the conservative political analyst, writes with verve, insight, remarkable sensitivity to the changing moods and beliefs of the American electorate and an objectivity that commands respect and attention, whether one agrees with his politics or not.
But even these qualities may not be sufficient for the complex task he has tackled in ''Staying on Top'' - analyzing and prescribing solutions for America's trade and industrial problems. As he recognizes, much of the dislocation of this country's economy and its soaring trade deficit have stemmed from the macroeconomic policies (those relating to the economy as a whole) of the Reagan Administration, with its huge budget deficits, high real-interest rates and overvalued dollar. While correctly observing that the country's trade and industrial problems antedated the Reagan years, Mr. Phillips does not weigh the impact of macroeconomic policy during the Nixon, Ford and Carter years of instability, inflation, unemployment, oil price shocks and growing protectionism throughout the industrial world - or what lessons we can learn from that experience.
Leonard Silk, the economics columnist of The New York Times, is the author of the forthcoming ''Economics in the Real World: How Political Decisions Affect the Economy.''
''Macroeconomic policy for the mid-1980's is a separate book - somebody else's book,'' Mr. Phillips writes. Instead, he buys the proposition that America's trade problems are due to its industrial decay, especially in manufacturing. But a number of studies - most importantly, ''Can America Compete?'' by Robert Z. Lawrence of the Brookings Institution - challenge the proposition that American manufacturing is decadent. During the 1970's, despite the decline of employment in steel, autos and some other industries, more jobs were created in manufacturing in the United States than in any other country, and the value of manufacturing output here grew faster than in every industrial country but Japan. ''Staying on Top'' arrives at a time when confidence in the vitality of the United States and the strength of the dollar is soaring. This euphoria looks to me as exaggerated as yesterday's gloom about the American economy.
Mr. Phillips wants the United States to pursue an ''aggressive'' trade policy, threatening to injure other countries to force open their markets. But such a policy can be dangerous and costly. As the economist Jeffrey J. Schott has observed in ''The Trade Policy Debate,'' ''More often than not, retaliation begets retaliation; trade flows are reduced, and the welfare of both target and sender country is reduced.''
THE United States has no claim to injured innocence; it has been just about as protectionist as any other country in recent years. In the postwar period, this country had a firm grasp of the benefits of trade for ourselves and others and was the leader in building a growing and more integrated world economy. But the belief is now rife in this country that America has been betrayed by those it helped and that we should respond aggressively.
Although Mr. Phillips is not a protectionist, he says he ''more or less'' endorses what amounts to a new ''economic nationalism'' - though he says he uses the term with some reluctance because of its pejorative connotation in some quarters. He defends a more aggressive nationalism on the grounds that in the past few decades there has been ''a parochialization of loyalties'' across a wide spectrum of values - economic, ethnic, racial and regional - not only in the United States but all around the world.
MR. PHILLIPS exemplifies a new breed of analysts whose skills are dedicated to the interests of particular politicians. (Mr. Phillips was a key adviser to President Nixon.) Cool and meticulous, they serve politicians without necessarily sharing their ideologies. It is possible these analysts deserve credit for bringing politicians' programs into line with their own objectives. But many people may find it chilling to contemplate a world in which gifted political thinkers become, in effect, brains for hire.
Mr. Phillips, too, seems troubled by this. He dislikes the jingoism and populist extremism of the Sunbelt, which he named and identified as a political entity. The Sunbelt is no longer a geographical zone stretching from Florida to Southern California but a province of the mind whose outposts are spreading everywhere. Sunbelt ideology, he writes, has ''substantially transformed U.S. conservatism into (a) flag-waving credo.'' He thinks that if fierce global economic competition continues, Sunbelt ideology could supplant free-market ideology.
And he warns that the Sunbelt's angry, frustrated middle- class populism could turn into fascism, as happened in Germany under Hitler and in Italy under Mussolini. In his previous book, ''Post-Conservative America,'' written during the deep 1981-82 economic slump, Mr. Phillips warned of a swing to the far right if Reaganomics failed. He repeats that warning for 1985- 86 and seeks to guide the Reagan Administration away from supply-side economics and laissez- faire toward a new partnership between Government and business, with other groups, including workers and academics, invited to join a broad coalition that would have strongly nationalist, or corporatist, tendencies.
Mr. Phillips recognizes that what he is proposing could be attacked as a corporate state. ''Free-market purists,'' he writes, ''will talk of 1930's economic corporativism and the return of Benito Mussolini. Libertarians will still want government to wither and disappear. High-tech futurists will think the economy is demassifying into something much better. And finally, leftists will continue to be ever fearful of a Pentagon-big business axis.''
But, while granting that ''there is some truth in many of these concerns,'' Mr. Phillips contends that, just as Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal co-opted the corporatist impulse and middle- class frustration during the Depression, a new economic nationalism could play a similar role now, channeling popular fears and frustrations into ''a crusade for a resurgence of a robust American economy.''
So he offers a 15-plank platform, including the establishment of a Federal Department of International Trade and Industry to foster American competitiveness; a revised tax code to spur international competitiveness; the expansion of the United States Export-Import Bank; revision of our trade laws to counter foreign industrial policies; an intensification of American business lobbying overseas and greater regulation of foreign lobbying here; a revision of the antitrust laws to allow American corporations to collaborate on research and development; increased Government support for technological research, including a ''basic research trust fund,'' the protection of American technology against patent abuse, theft and espionage, and an expanded national program for scientific and technical education.
Mr. Phillips thinks his ''center- right'' industrial strategy, which he says he has derived from the thinking of various business leaders, makes far more sense than the industrial policies advocated by different Democratic leaders. The so-called Atari Democrats look to the high-tech industries for the jobs of the future, while party veterans from the ''rustbelt,'' labor unions and minorities want protectionism to preserve the industries of the past. The two factions, symbolized by Gary Hart and Walter F. Mondale respectively, could not unite their images and ideologies during the current campaign.
NOW Mr. Phillips has offered his own industrial strategy to keep America ''on top.'' If the economy goes sour after the November election, his vision could help shape a new Reagan doctrine. As a prophet, Mr. Phillips deserves honor for his earlier prescience on political and economic questions. Whether he has correctly perceived the state of the nation's economy and the causes and cures of its past and potential troubles, however, is another question.
Charles L. Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Carter, has called industrial policy ''a solution in search of a problem.'' The problem for which Mr. Phillips's industrial strategy may be a solution is where the Republican Party goes from here.B

Abstract: ''No one should be amazed that it now takes three Deutsche marks to buy one dollar,'' said a New York banker who asked not to be quoted by name. ''I remember back in the 60's, when it took four marks to buy a dollar.'' ''The performance of the U.S. economy has been so good compared with others, it is perceived as offering the best opportunity for 'real' investment,'' said Robert T. Parry, executive vice president and chief economist of the Security Pacific National Bank. ''In a lot of countries people are saying, 'If I'm going to invest, I'll invest in the United States'.'' According to Mr. [David C. Redding], some economists are going a step further in downplaying the importance of trade deficits. ''They are not saying the trade deficit is to be dismissed, but that it should be seen in a broader context,'' he said. ''To them, it makes more sense to lend a lot of money to a well-managed country than a little to a poorly managed one.''

Full text: Just last February, it was fashionable in financial circles to brood
about the imminent collapse of the dollar. The only question seemed to be whether it would be a hard or a soft landing.
But the dollar confounded the markets and the pundits, as it has for much of the past two years. Rather than plummeting, it soared. And those who bet against it - including some of the biggest banks - have been sorely burned.
Indeed, last week the dollar was stronger than ever. It rose to record levels against the British pound, the French franc, and most dramatically, the German mark. In the case of the mark, the dollar cracked through a psychological barrier, and for the first time since floating exchange rates were introduced more than 11 years ago, it took three marks to buy one dollar.
The recent rise was especially spectacular because, by the reckoning of previous years, it should not have happened. When interest rates in the United States decline, the dollar also is expected to decline. But the dollar's recent surge has occurred even though American interest rates have been moderating as of late.
And there was more news that should have depressed the dollar, but did not. Last month, the Commerce Department announced another whopping trade deficit, for July.. Traditionally, the dollar declines when the trade deficit rises, because the gap between imports and exports ultimately must be financed - and that usually means pumping dollars into foreign money markets.
But in some circles, the dollar's persistent rise is no longer considered perverse behavior. A growing number of economists, foreign-exchange traders and bankers are beginning to disregard the old verities and reassess their basic views on why the dollar is so strong.
''The skeptics are coming around,'' said Alan Meltzer, professor of economics at the Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ''They are beginning to understand that foreigners, like Americans, are investing in the United States because this is where the profit potential is.''
There is a growing sense that the dollar's strength is not an aberration, but a reflection of a more permanent change in America's competitive position in the world. The dollar will continue to have its ups and downs, according to the new thinking, and there may even be a downward ''correction'' from the sharp gains of recent weeks. But, according to this analysis, the dollar has reached an appropriate plateau and it is not likely to plummet to former levels.
Those who hold this view - and they still seem to be in the minority - contend that the American economy is regaining the leadership role it held for the two decades following World War II, when the United States set the economic pace for the rest of the world, and the dollar was the hot currency.
''No one should be amazed that it now takes three Deutsche marks to buy one dollar,'' said a New York banker who asked not to be quoted by name. ''I remember back in the 60's, when it took four marks to buy a dollar.''
At that time, the dollar was in such demand that gold was being dumped to buy dollars. Today, the price of gold has been falling as the dollar rises, although at a slower pace. And the slower pace, some argue, is appropriate, too. Although the United States economy has become a powerhouse once again, it does not command the overwhelming dominance that it enjoyed in the years immediately following World War II. Thus, it is argued, the dollar does not belong at four marks, but neither does it belong at two.
''Most people can't believe that the dollar is fundamentally strong, because they can't remember before 1965,'' said David C. Redding, vice president and economist at the Bankers Trust Company.
As it was in the 1950's and 60's, the United States economy has again become a magnet for investment. Investors around the world have come to believe, according to a growing number of economists, that the United States offers incomparable economic growth and incomparable stability, both political and economic. This view is backed by figures that show that foreign investment in the United States surged to $158.3 billion in the first half of this year, from $33.9 billion for all of 1983.
''Right now,'' said Robert Heller, senior vice president of the Bank of America, ''the U.S. economy is the strongest in the world and is attracting a lot of investment, both direct and portfolio.''
Among the factors cited by economists is the low rate of inflation. Only last Friday, the Government reported a decline in the producer price index, a key indicator of inflation. And over the last 12 months, the index has climbed only slightly more than 2 percent, compared with a rise of 12.8 percent in 1979.
Lower inflation has buoyed the economy. Growth remains strong and, in the view of many economists, well balanced, Mr. Redding of Bankers Trust contends that lean inventories and hefty capital spending will result in greater growth ahead. In his view, increased spending on plants and equipment, by expanding industrial capacity, makes way for more non-inflationary growth.
''The performance of the U.S. economy has been so good compared with others, it is perceived as offering the best opportunity for 'real' investment,'' said Robert T. Parry, executive vice president and chief economist of the Security Pacific National Bank. ''In a lot of countries people are saying, 'If I'm going to invest, I'll invest in the United States'.''
That feeling is especially strong in Europe. Just last week in Brussels, for example, Herbert Giersch, president of the prestigeous Kiel Institute of World Economies, a West German think tank, predicted that the dollar's strength will endure for years.
Money is flowing into the United States not because of high interest rates and tight monetary policies, but because of the rising levels of corporate profitability, he said at a seminar sponsored by the Conference Board.
In Mr. Giersch's view, the recent bruising recession in the United States forged a highly efficient economy. He attributed the greater competitiveness of the American economy to several factors: The moderation of wage increases; the increased pace of deregulation in such key industries as transportation, finance and communications; the ready acceptance of new technology that enhances efficiency, and the post-recession creation of millions of new jobs.
Europe, by contrast, he said, is suffering from ''Eurosclerosis.'' He maintains that Europe has been slow to adjust to changing technology and competitive conditions. To catch up, it will have to cut real wages and adapt more quickly to technological change. That process, he predicted, will take at least 5 or 10 years.
This new perception of the longevity of the dollar's strength has also led to some rethinking about the factors that directly affect exchange rates.
For example, traditionally it had been believed that trade deficits - especially if they are persistent and large - should put severe downward pressure on an exchange rate. Indeed, during the 1960's and early 1970's, large trade deficits caused devaluations of such currencies as the British pound.
But now even the markets have been paying relatively little attention to the dramatic trade deficits reported by the United States. Most economists have attributed that disregard to the high level of interest rates in the United States: They say that investors are more eager to gain short-term yields from high interest rates than to worry about the future effects of today's trade gap.
''Foreign investors don't look at the trade deficit. They ask, 'What are my investment alternatives?' '' said Mr. Redding of Bankers Trust.
According to Mr. Redding, some economists are going a step further in downplaying the importance of trade deficits. ''They are not saying the trade deficit is to be dismissed, but that it should be seen in a broader context,'' he said. ''To them, it makes more sense to lend a lot of money to a well-managed country than a little to a poorly managed one.''
The growing optimism about the longer-term outlook for the dollar also fits well with the free-market philosophy that has become increasingly popular among liberal as well as conservative economists.
That view holds that the world economy is too complex to be fully understood by anyone - including the biggest governments or international organizations. Only the market system is capable of sifting the seemingly infinite bits of information and making sense out of them. And the answer comes out in the form of price - in the foreign exchange markets, the relative value of currencies.
''The market knows,'' said Mr. Heller of the Bank of America.
No ideas, it seems, are exempt from the general reassessment now underway. There is even rethinking about whether a decline in interest rates would hurt the dollar.
S. Waite Rawls, managing director of Chemical Bank, said that if the dollar's basic strength does stem from a robust economy, then over the long run lower interest rates should strengthen the dollar, because they would strengthen the economy.
In addition, some economists argue that there are built-in safeguards against a vast outflow of money from the United States if interest rates were to decline. The United States has become so dependent on foreign funds that a huge outflow, they say, would drive interest rates up again and cause money to flow back into the country.
There is even rethinking about the effect of a strong dollar on the nation's exports. Everyone agrees that the high value of the dollar has inhibited exports and encouraged imports, but some economists say that the ultimate effect of a strong dollar is positive for the nation's exporters.
A strong currency reduces the cost of imports needed for production. For example, when the dollar is strong, imported oil costs less in the United States than it does elsewhere. That, in fact, is why many Europeans, especially the French, have been complaining bitterly about the strength of the dollar.
In addition, a high-flying dollar makes American companies fight harder in both domestic and foreign markets, making the survivors ever more efficient. Not only does this directly enhance their competitive position, but it also contributes to reduced inflation in the United States.
The debate over the dollar is taking place not only in the world's capital cities. In California, for example, agricultural exports dropped eight percent last year, and many of the state's farmers blamed the dollar's strength. But in this year's first quarter, when the dollar was even stronger, the state's agricultural exports rose 20 percent, according to Vernon M. Crowder, vice president and agricultural economist at the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. He said that although the high dollar hurt the state's agricultural exports, other factors also seemed to play key roles. They included government programs to discourage production, steep recessions overseas, the debt crisis in Latin America and foreign protectionist policies, Mr. Crowder said.
Of course, there are those who still vehemently disagree that the dollar can remain for long at its current heights. C. Fred Bergsten, for example, who was Undersecretary of the Treasury in the Carter Administration, said recentlythat the current value of the dollar ''is unsustainable, and at some point it will come down sharply.'' Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential candidate, says the same thing.
Now, many bankers - including some who agree with the Bergsten view - predict that the dollar will plummet if the polls begin to indicate a Mondale victory in November.
''The strong performance of Reagan in the polls indicates that America's basic programs will continue as they are, and that, maybe above all, makes for a strong dollar,'' said Mr. Heller of the Bank of America.
WHY THE U.S. ISA MAGNET FOR FOREIGN MONEY
Last February, four engineers from the People's Republic of China arrived in Amherst, N.H., to spend three months at a small company in which the Chinese Government had invested.
Santec, which is producing what it calls an ''infinite dot-matrix printer'' in the New Hampshire equivalent of California's Silicon Valley, is one example of how attractive the United States is to many foreign investors.
Being good Communists, the Chinese said they were not trying to make a killing on their $2 million investment in the Santec Corporation. Rather, they said, they wanted to buy a ring-side seat at a high- tech company that was shifting from an engineering to a marketing-driven operation.
For many foreigners, the United States offers not only technological sophistication but also a huge and growing market that is affluent as well as politically and economically stable. Many find that combination hard to beat.
And that helps explain, at least in part, why the dollar has been so strong.
Many foreign investments have been much larger than the Chinese stake in Santec. Recently, for example, the Nestle Company of Switzerland offered $3 billion to acquire the Carnation Company in the United States.
And other similar investments have taken place within the last year:
* Japan's Nissan Motor Company has dedicated a $660 million truck plant in Tennessee.

Abstract: The United States is the only major nation which can play a positive role in building a structure of peace in the Mideast. Israel cannot have peace if it continues to be surrounded by implacable enemies - not just the radical Syrians but more moderate states like Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia as well. It is better for the United States to be a friend of Israel's neighbors and potential enemies than to leave a vacuum which an avowed enemy of Israel - the Soviet Union - is thirsty to fill. The ability of the United States to influence Israel's neighbors is at a low point, in part because of the tragic events in Lebanon.

Full text: To the Editor:
For several weeks I have been following with great interest, and also great concern, news reports concerning the proposal to move our embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
I am deeply committed to the security of Israel, as demonstrated by my action in providing for the massive airlift to Israel during the 1973 war and the alert of our forces which prevented the Soviet Union from intervening in that war. It is because I am committed to Israel's security that I am opposed to the proposal to move our embassy.
Such a move would not contribute one iota to Israel's security. On the contrary, it would jeopardize it.
Israel has desperate economic problems, with an inflation rate of 200 percent and with 30 percent of its gross national product going for defense, the highest percentage in the world. The Israelis suffered casualties in three months in Lebanon which were the equivalent of what the United States suffered in 10 years in Vietnam. The conclusion is inescapable: Israel needs peace.
The United States is the only major nation which can play a positive role in building a structure of peace in the Mideast. Israel cannot have peace if it continues to be surrounded by implacable enemies - not just the radical Syrians but more moderate states like Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia as well. It is better for the United States to be a friend of Israel's neighbors and potential enemies than to leave a vacuum which an avowed enemy of Israel - the Soviet Union - is thirsty to fill. The ability of the United States to influence Israel's neighbors is at a low point, in part because of the tragic events in Lebanon. If the U.S. moves its embassy to Jerusalem, the situation would be dangerously exacerbated, and the U.S. would lose whatever influence it has today to play a constructive role in the area. Congress will soon make its decision on the embassy proposal. So far, Congressional debate has presented the view that a vote to move the embassy is pro-Israel and that a vote against moving the embassy is anti- Israel. This puts the issue upside down: the exact opposite is the truth. RICHARD M. NIXON New York, May 24, 1984

Abstract: the United States and the rest of the industrial world. ''In the 'Golden Age' of the 1950's and 1960's,'' said Angus Maddison, a British economist, ''economic growth in the advanced capitalist countries surpassed virtually all historical records.'' He saw an ''enormous opportunity'' to set in train a long period of growth and greater stability, but stressed that his ''happy vision'' would not come about if the nation sat back and simply hoped the ''recent good news would produce a lasting momentum of its own.'' Henry Wallich, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, who in the past has favored an incomes policy based on tax incentives, offered a new idea in San Francisco. He suggested ''taking a leaf from the wisdom of Japan'' with a system of two-step wage increases, the second step of which is a bonus. ''With a bonus in prospect,'' said Mr. Wallich, ''the first step can be more moderate. The second step would reflect price and profit developments in the intervening period.'' He proposed a dialogue between business and labor, both of whom he thought had much to gain from such a plan.

Full text: THE two decades after World War II have been
called a ''golden age'' of growth and stability for
the United States and the rest of the industrial world. ''In the 'Golden Age' of the 1950's and 1960's,'' said Angus Maddison, a British economist, ''economic growth in the advanced capitalist countries surpassed virtually all historical records.''
But, starting in the late 1960's, the United States economy was battered by a series of economic and political shocks that turned the golden age into an age of tin. First came President Johnson's ''guns and butter'' policy that bred inflation during the Vietnam war; then came President Nixon's surprise of Aug. 15, 1971, when he suspended convertibility of the dollar into gold, imposed wage-price controls and embarked on a highly stimulative fiscal and monetary policy. International financial chaos and the end of the Bretton Woods monetary system of fixed exchange rates hit the world economy in 1973, and the OPEC nations twice in that decade tipped the world into economic shock with monumental increases in oil prices.
As the United States economy careened from one shock to the next, inflation soared, productivity foundered, real growth slowed, several deep recessions battered industry and unemployment rose to the highest rates since the Great Depression. Internationally, mountains of debt, spawned by the explosion in oil prices, threatened to produce a world banking crisis.
But with the dawning of 1983, the darkness began to lift. The United States swung into a strong recovery, spurring weaker recoveries in other industrial countries. And now, a year later, some economists have begun to speculate that the nation - with inflation still low, unemployment high and industrial capacity ample - may even have an opportunity once again for a sustained period of economic growth reminiscent of the early sixties.
The Reagan Administration, facing an election race next year, has eagerly embraced that prospect. Its budget for the fiscal year 1985 and projections through 1989 are based on the President's belief that the nation has entered a long period of steady economic growth (4 percent a year during the second half of the decade), subdued inflation (3.5 percent measured by the deflator in 1989), lower interest rates (a 5 percent Treasury bill rate by then), and reduced unemployment (5 percent in 1989).
But has the United States truly entered into a post- shock era of economic calm? Or will 1983 and 1984 turn out to be a brief interlude of growth, the prelude to another unsettling economic shock?
There is a great deal of skepticism among economists and businessmen about the dawning of a new era. Most expect 1984 to be a good year but are worried - primarily by the huge size of the expected Federal deficit - about what lies beyond the election year. A recent poll of 627 managers of financial institutions by A. G. Becker Paribas Inc., an investment bank, found that fewer than 8 percent expect depression or hyperinflation in 1984. But 30 percent expect a depression and 36 percent expect hyperinflation before 10 years have passed.
There is a dissenting view, however, and not just at the White House. It is held by those who think that enough can be learned from studying the events and disappointments of the past two decades of economic history to mark a better course for the future.
One of the nation's most powerful economists, Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, asserted this view at last month's meeting of the American Economic Association in San Francisco. The United States, he said, may be able to reverse the experience of the 1970's and demonstrate that ''an economy that seemed to be going downhill, with one adverse shock begetting another, can go up as well.''
''I do not share,'' he said, ''the doubts and skepticism - indeed the deep cynicism of some - about our capacity as a nation to learn from bitter experience and draw practical lessons for the future.''
He saw an ''enormous opportunity'' to set in train a long period of growth and greater stability, but stressed that his ''happy vision'' would not come about if the nation sat back and simply hoped the ''recent good news would produce a lasting momentum of its own.''
There are new and and unprecedented risks to sustaining progress, Mr. Volcker warned: the enormous budget deficits that loom ahead, the international debt problem, the gaping and still growing imbalance in the United States' international accounts, the strong forces of protectionism, and ''not least,'' he said, ''the temptation to return to behavior patterns bred in the years of inflation.'' But he thought the threats could be met if the nation would act upon the lessons of the bitter past.
Even the skeptics might agree to that proposition. But what are the key lessons from history? Although economists and others may differ in degree about what these might be, there appears to be general agreement on a few key points:
P RESIDENTS must make the tough decisions on how to use limited national resources while there is time, not subordinate those decisions to immediate political advantage.
Inflation was kicked off in this country during the Vietnam War when President Johnson, with the economy approaching full employment, delayed, for political reasons, the difficult choice among three possible policies: raising taxes, cutting his Great Society programs or curbing military spending. And President Nixon gravely aggravated inflation a few years later with his New Economic Policy of Aug. 15, 1971, simultaneously launching a highly stimulative fiscal and monetary policy, clamping on wage and price controls, suspending the convertibility of the dollar into gold and embargoing sales of certain American agricultural products. When the controls were lifted after his electoral victory in 1972, the suppressed inflation burst forth.
There is a broad consensus among economists that President Reagan is taking undue risks of imposing inflationary strains on resources by his huge budget deficits, stretching, as David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, has put it, ''as far as the eye can see.''
If tight money is employed to keep those inflationary pressures from getting out of hand, the consequence, once again, is likely to be a shooting up of interest rates and another steep recession.
Economists differ on just how much time President Reagan has to put his budget in better order. Some see his so-called ''supply-side'' tax cuts as really Keynesian demand-side tax cuts that have, combined with an easier monetary policy, fortuitously helped to lift the economy out of the deep recession and should be allowed to push it even closer to full employment.
Thus, Gardner Ackley, professor of economics at the University of Michigan and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Johnson, told the economists in San Francisco: ''For 1984, I see no reason to worry about the deficits. Rather, we should welcome them for their contribution to recovery. But I do worry about deficits of the size currently forecast if they extend much beyond 1984.'' His reasons: Unless curbed by tighter monetary or fiscal policy, the deficits threaten to reaccelerate inflation. And if excess demand were curbed primarily by tight money, as now seems likely, that could generate even higher interest rates and come at the expense of investment and growth.
Supply-siders, such as Alan Reynolds of Polynomics Inc., a consulting firm, still contend that concern about budget deficits is vastly exaggerated and that it would be foolish to try to reduce them by raising taxes. President Reagan, on that point, still marches with the supply-siders and is determined not to raise taxes if he can help it and not to reduce the planned rapid buildup of military spending.
But most of the President's own economic advisers, especially Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, disagree. They fear a situation like Vietnam revisited - with military spending rising, taxes falling and the budget deficit widening. They believe, as do most economists, that with the economy in a recovery it is vital to bring down the deficit. Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, who believes the President should defer the tax issue until after the election, has laid out a list of options for Mr. Reagan to consider, if the President decides to increase revenues to reduce the fiscal year 1975 deficit from its expected $186 billion level. In a memo to the President, which reached the press last week, Mr. Feldstein said, ''As you know, there is no chance that we can get all of the proposed spending cuts enacted in 1984.''
T HE United States must pay more
heed to the international economy in setting its domestic economic policies.
President Nixon, ignoring this rule, slammed the gold window shut to prevent the further outflow of United States gold and make it possible for him to pursue a highly stimulative economic and monetary policy. That move set off waves in the world economy that accelerated inflation and eventually ended the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. Mr. Maddison, the economist, blames the ''messy'' collapse of Bretton Woods and the resultant system of floating exchange rates as a major cause of the breakdown of the golden age of growth and the unleashing of stagflation in the seventies.
Mr. Volcker, in his address to the economists' convention last month, stressed that the need to close the budget gap and bring down interest rates was ''pressing'' for international reasons. The level of dollar interest rates, forced upward by the deficits, he said, ''plainly aggravates the strains on the international financial system - strains apparent in the heavy debt burdens of many developing countries and in the persistent and growing flow of capital into the United States, with its counterpart of a widening trade deficit.'' Mr. Volcker said he did not share the comfortable assumption of some that working for better budget balance could wait a year or more.
C. Fred Bergsten, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, warns that high interest rates and the huge American trade deficit - now threatening to reach $120 billion in 1984 - could bring on a deluge of protectionism and wreck the world trading system as other countries retaliated. Foreign governments blame high American interest rates for holding down the European recovery and for draining the financial resources of developing countries like Brazil, Argentina and Nigeria almost to the breaking point. But untangling this skein could itself be tricky. Geoffrey Bell, a leading international monetary expert and former British Treasury official, fears that at some stage the process of a strengthening dollar ''will certainly be reversed and then the fall of the dollar could be very dramatic.'' That, however, could deal a new shock to the monetary system.
T IGHT monetary policy must be
used with great caution.
There is no doubt any longer about the potency of monetary policy in checking inflation. But, in the process of squeezing inflation down over the past few years, tight money policy has taken an enormous toll in lost production, jobs, investment and growth.
There is a still a school of economic thought, led by Professor Emeritus Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago, that insists monetary policy should be properly applied by a simple rule: The money supply be increased year by year - or, if possible, month by month or day by day - at a rate consistent with the national growth of productivity. Following the rule, says Professor Friedman, will permit inflation-free growth over time - though it will not necessarily rid the economy of cyclical fluctuations in production, income and employment.
Since the fall of 1979, Mr. Volcker has experimented with what he calls ''practical monetarism,'' heeding Professor Friedman's call for more attention to gradual growth of the money supply and less to the level of interest rates. But when tight money produced the recessions of 1980 and 1981-82, Mr. Volcker swung to much more rapid rates of monetary expansion than sanctioned by the Fed's ''target ranges'' and paid more heed to interest rates. Thereby, discretionary monetary policy was used as a powerful tool for getting the economy out of deep slumps. All but the most orthodox monetarists have cheered the moves.
As Prof. James Tobin of Yale, a Nobel laureate who eschews monetarism, put it recently, ''Our Federal Reserve finally took mercy on the economy about a year ago and suspended its monetarist targets. Its easing of monetary policy saved the world financial system from dangerous crisis and averted further collapse of economic activity.''
A BETTER way must be found for
combining high employment
and growth with price stability.
With 8.2 percent of the labor force unemployed, this problem does not loom immediately ahead, but if the recovery continues into the mid-80's it will. Mandatory price and wage controls, last used by President Nixon, have proved rigid and inefficient. Resisting overstimulus while controls were in place proved impossible for the Nixon Administration. When the controls were finally lifted, inflation accelerated.
But recessions are a costly way of undoing inflation, too. Thus, many economists have been on the prowl for years to devise a new form of voluntary ''incomes policy'' to hold back price and wage increases with less pain and less market interference. Arthur Burns, as chairman of the Federal Reserve, had been urging an incomes policy when President Nixon leap-frogged past him to mandatory controls.
Henry Wallich, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, who in the past has favored an incomes policy based on tax incentives, offered a new idea in San Francisco. He suggested ''taking a leaf from the wisdom of Japan'' with a system of two-step wage increases, the second step of which is a bonus. ''With a bonus in prospect,'' said Mr. Wallich, ''the first step can be more moderate. The second step would reflect price and profit developments in the intervening period.'' He proposed a dialogue between business and labor, both of whom he thought had much to gain from such a plan.
Mr. Volcker also welcomed the new interest amongst both business and labor in profit-sharing arrangements or other ways of ''rewarding workers when things are good, without building in an inexorably rising floor on costs.''
THIS is just the top of the list of
lessons to be learned from the
past. Economists who share Paul Volcker's ''happy vision'' would argue that for the first time in almost two decades the United States and the rest of the world have at least a chance, however small, to profit from the harsh experiences of the late 60's and 70's and enter a period of stable and lasting growth.
Inflation, for the time being, has been battered down, unemployment is still relatively high, much industrial capacity is idle and after a rough run of recessions, American corporations have cut costs and improved profitability. Not since the Kennedy Administration in 1961 inherited an economy that had been through back- to-back recessions has there been such an opportunity for noninflationary growth.
At the San Francisco meetings Prof. W. Arthur Lewis, of Princeton University, the outgoing president of the economists, admonished his colleagues for failing to study history: ''If our subject is lowering its sights, this may be because the demise of economic history in economics departments has brought us a generation of economists with no historical background.''
Still, there is no simple formula provided by history to prevent the nation from being blind-sided again by another shock - or a series of them.
Moreover, even if economists fully agreed on the lessons to be gleaned from the troubled past, it does not follow that politicians would join in the agreement or enforce its prescriptions. Inevitably it is they, not their economic advisers, who will call the shots - or the shocks.

Abstract: ''Foreign competition and the strong dollar have been the main force holding inflation in check,'' Albert M. Wojnilower, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, said in a recent speech. ''Were we producing here, above and beyond our present output, the extra goods we have been importing,'' he said, the economy would already be showing signs of overheating. ''While the trade deficit is important, it is swamped by capital flows,'' he said. ''It is still a world of dollar shortages.'' He added that international reserves of central banks are no longer rising. In fact, they are falling sharply for many members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and less developed countries. The reliance on capital inflows ''has created a potential new area of vulnerability for the economy,'' Mr. [David D. Hale] said. ''If and when capital flows to the U.S. slow or reverse, the dollar will weaken, inflation rates and interest rates will rise, the economy's growth rate will slow.''

Full text: The strength of the dollar throughout 1983 attracted strong foreign demand for dollar-denominated securities and helped keep interest rates and inflation lower than they would otherwise have been. Many analysts, however, say that may not continue through 1984.
Foreign trade is a small part of the American economy compared to other economies, but many analysts say that currency developments in 1984 could be crucial to the course of interest rates, inflation and the economy.
''Foreign competition and the strong dollar have been the main force holding inflation in check,'' Albert M. Wojnilower, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, said in a recent speech. ''Were we producing here, above and beyond our present output, the extra goods we have been importing,'' he said, the economy would already be showing signs of overheating.
Effect on Markets
Mr. Wojnilower said it may be ''a long time'' before the dollar weakens significantly. But when foreigners do tire of exchanging goods and services for dollars, analysts agree, it will result in significant changes in the United States credit market and economy. Concern stems largely from the huge United States trade deficit. Government data released last week showing a $7.4 billion deficit in November was the latest reminder that the United States is importing far more than it exports, and is paying for the difference with dollars.
So far, the dollars have been willingly accepted, partly because investments in the United States have been attractive. United States stock prices have done well, and interest rates on Treasury securities have been so much above inflation that they, too, have attracted investors.
According to estimates by Salomon Brothers, the investment banking firm, foreigners bought about $9.9 billion of corporate stocks in 1983, and might buy another $9.1 billion this year. Their net new purchases in the Treasury market could total $17 billion, down from $18.5 billion last year.
Strengthened by High Rates
Continued buying of United States securities by foreigners will depend on whether they keep their view of the dollar as a strong currency whose value is not being eroded by inflation. Since 1979, the value of the dollar has increased nearly 50 percent, as United States interest rates have been kept high relative to inflation.
The Federal Reserve, according to the Salomon Brothers analysts, will ''keep U.S. rates sufficiently competitive to attract the net new foreign funds needed to finance prospective American credit demands in 1984.''
Jeffrey Bell, an international financial consultant, said the odds are good that foreigners will continue to find dollar-denominated investments attractive this year.
''While the trade deficit is important, it is swamped by capital flows,'' he said. ''It is still a world of dollar shortages.'' He added that international reserves of central banks are no longer rising. In fact, they are falling sharply for many members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and less developed countries.
Value May Weaken
Not all analysts expect the dollar to remain at its high levels in the face of the record trade deficits, estimated at $60 billion or more this year.
Paul Neild, chief economist at Phillips & Drew, a London-based securities firm, thinks the dollar could weaken this year. ''If oil prices hold, then the position of OPEC members is not likely to deteriorate further,'' and the 13 members of the group will no longer be aggressively selling their nondollar foreign currencies, he said.
''The worst of the world indebtedness crisis seems to be over,'' Mr. Neild said, and the flight of capital to the United States could decline substantially this year. The dollar could also weaken if international lending by United States banks begins to expand once again.
David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, argues that the United States cannot be financed indefinitely by an inflow of capital. In a recent speech, he said, ''We are currently enjoying a guns and butter economic program because of the willingness of foreigners to absorb our large payments deficits.''
The reliance on capital inflows ''has created a potential new area of vulnerability for the economy,'' Mr. Hale said. ''If and when capital flows to the U.S. slow or reverse, the dollar will weaken, inflation rates and interest rates will rise, the economy's growth rate will slow.''

Full text: THE outlook for the United States economy and investment is for continued but moderate improvement in 1984. However, the year made famous more than three decades ago by George Orwell will still be a time of tensions and troubles.
The greatest hazards lie abroad. There are military dangers in the Middle East, in Central America, and in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union - the hegemonic powers called Oceania and Eurasia in Orwell's novel.
And there are economic dangers, not mentioned in his script, which stem from the inability of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, the Philippines and other third-world countries to service their foreign debts and control their domestic economies without producing political explosions.
But the greatest difference from Orwell's vision of the future is the survival of vigorous forms of capitalism, in the United States, in Japan and in other countries on the rim of East Asia and in Western Europe, instead of the decay into totalitarianism he warned against.
Despite the strains on the international monetary system, the revival of the United States economy this year holds forth the hope that the world economy will succeed in working its way out of the troubles bred by inflation, two severe oil shocks and the worst global slump since the Depression of the 1930's.
Traditionally, as Anne Kreuger, the chief economist of the World Bank has put it, ''what takes place in the large United States market is a reliable indicator of worldwide trends.'' And, after three years of weak or declining world trade and economic growth, the American recovery is spreading seeds of growth throughout the industrial world.
The equity markets correctly anticipated the rise. Among encouraging signs that the rise will continue are the decline in nominal interest rates, the decline of oil prices and, excluding oil, the recovery of world commodity prices, which had fallen to historic lows. The volume of international trade is starting to recover. American imports from the developing countries are on the upswing. The growth of third-world country exports is the single most important development if they are to escape from their debt crisis.
''Wide growth disparities exist among the developing countries,'' said Lawrence A. Veit of Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. ''On balance, however, the tendency is toward accelerating real growth.''
Yet no early end can be expected to the problems that have plagued the world economy for more than a decade. It is likely to take several years, even with good luck, to overcome the problems of unemployment, excess capacity, budget deficits, high real interest rates and heavy national and international debt left in the wake of the stagflationist 70's.
The rapid rate of expansion of the United States economy during the first three quarters of 1983 seems sure to slow in 1984. Much of the rise this year resulted from the big swing from inventory cutting to inventory building.
In the October-December quarter of 1982, American businesses were liquidating inventories at an annual rate of $56.4 billion. In the July-September quarter, businesses added $11.8 billion to their inventories. That swing meant a net lift of $68.2 billion to gross national product in the first three quarters of 1983. So strong a thrust from inventories is highly unlikely in 1984. Even if industry were to double its third-quarter 1983 rate of stock building, that would represent only a $10 billion increase to the country's gross national product, not the nearly $70 billion lift from inventory change this year.
Lawrence Chimerine of Chase Econometrics said he considered it highly likely that the inventory building process in 1984 would be relatively modest, ''especially in view of still high nominal and real interest rates, relatively low commodity and finished goods inflation, improved methods of inventory control, and continued efforts of many companies to improve profit margins and liquidity.''
Since the future growth of production will depend on changes in the rate of inventory accumulation, inventory shifts will add less to the growth of production than in recent months. The decline in the inventory-to-sales ratio this year, as in earlier years, has been the mirror image of the rise in industrial production, which swung upward from an index of 135 (1967-100) at the end of last year to 153.7 in September.
Another mirror image of that rise in output has been the decline of unemployment, measured as changes in initial unemployment claims. The unemployment rate for all workers, including members of the military, has come down to 8.7 percent in October from a peak of 10.7 percent last December, with the civilian jobless rate declining to 8.8 percent from 10.8 percent. But that left 9.9 million workers unemployed, down from 12 million jobless last winter. Unemployment remains the major economic liability President Reagan faces in another run for the White House, which he now seems prepared to make.
The probability is that the jobless rate will come down more slowly in 1984 than it did this year. The latest consensus forecast of 46 leading economists surveyed by Blue Chip Indi- cators is that unemployment in 1984 will average 8.6 percent, a figure that now looks too high. The jobless rate could bedown to 8 percent by Election Day. But that would still be high by postwar standards. The impact of unemployment on the election will depend on whether the public is more impressed with its still-high absolute level or with its decline from the peak. Experience suggests that voters are more responsive to the rate of change.
Similarly, the odds are that inflation, down far below its peak double- digit rates during the Carter Administration, will work in Mr. Reagan's favor. Lower inflation portends lower nominal interest rates, to the delight of the stock market. However, inflation is likely to move up a bit next year.
Producers' prices have been flat in the first three quarters of 1983, and consumers' prices have risen at an annual rate of under 3 percent. Such low rates look unsustainable in a continuing recovery.
The underlying rate of inflation, based on wage increases, productivity gains and interest rates, is more like 5 percent, and the current rate of inflation should approach that level as excess capacity shrinks. That trend will be reinforced by the impact of the drought and the Government's payment-in-kind program on food prices.
The United States dollar, after its huge run-up against foreign currencies, is likely to weaken next year, putting some upward pressure on domestic prices. Even so, the danger that inflation will grow beyond the 5 percent level does not seem great. Overcapacity in the oil-producing countries will keep energy prices in check, barring a major shock such as large-scale war in the Middle East or a move by Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz.
The Federal Reserve Board, under Paul A. Volcker's pragmatic leadership, will be striving to maintain a moderate growth in the monetary aggregates, seeking to prevent a revival of inflation on one side and excessive slowing of growth or a recession on the other. That would be a capital offense in an election year. It seems unlikely that Mr. Volcker, reappointed by Mr. Reagan for a second term, would halt the expansion if he could possibly avoid it.
The perilous international debt situation also will cause the Fed to do its best to keep the United States economy moving upward next year. Mr. Volcker himself made plain his intentions this fall when he told the American Bankers Association convention, meeting in Hawaii, that the ultimate success of all the efforts to rescue debtor countries and the world monetary system depends on ''sustained economic recovery.''
He added, ''I must also point out that the process will be greatly speeded, and better assured, to the extent interest rates decline, most of all in the United States, because of the simple fact that so much of the developing country debt is denominated in dollars at floating interest rates.''
Lower interest rates are also vital to housing, autos and other durable goods in dustries, and to a strong revival of business capital spending. The housing comeback, with starts climbing to a peak of 1.9 million in August, faltered and fell back as mortgage rates ticked upward. Housing starts are likely to run somewhere between 1.6 million and 1.7 million next year. New auto sales peaked in June at an annual rate of 10.1 million units and dropped a bit through the summer as short-term interest rates rose. For the year, auto sales climbed to 9.1 million units and appear to be headed up.
Capital spending was slow to revive this year, which is normal in the first year of a recovery, when the economy still has a great deal of excess capacity. But a strong surge of plant-and- equipment spending now appears to be in the works, provided that it is not stunned by a run-up in interest rates.
Business profits have been rising sharply as many industries move up to more efficient levels of capacity while holding down their wage, energy and other costs. Profits are likely to be up 15 percent this year and could be up that much or more in 1984. Nevertheless, the stock market seems worried about next year's profits. Investors' aggressive expectations, typical of the early phase of a business recovery, have moderated.
While most economists and security analysts have not lowered their expectations of continued advances in profits next year, with gains of 15 percent to 25 percent still anticipated, some are concerned that the stock market has already fully discounted future gains and that there is ''a strong possibility of disappointing earnings results over the next few quarters,'' Ronald B. Koenig, managing director of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, said recently.
But the overall business cash-flow picture looks good for next year. Walter W. Heller, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, estimated that business operations in 1984 would generate more than $350 billion in corporate cash, up $60 billion from 1983. ''No wonder most companies can finance their present capital needs without banging on their bankers' doors,'' Mr. Heller said.
However, an upsurge of interest rates next year, especially if it outran prospective profits, would choke off capital spending and slow the expansion in its second year.
With all these reasons for wanting lower rates and continued growth, the Fed appears to be pursuing a monetary policy biased toward expansion. Thus, keeping the recovery going is the goal of Fed policy, and holding down interest rates is the means of achieving it.
While business loan demand is still relatively weak, accommodating the Treasury's need to finance a $200 billion Federal deficit poses no great problem for the Fed. In 1984, however, the problem will worsen as competition for savings between the Treasury and private borrowers is likely to intensify, as business investment revives and the huge budget deficit persists. Neither the President nor Congress appears to have the will to do anything about the deficit before the election.
Threats abroad are stepping up pressures on the military budget, while domestic political pressures are keeping down White House zeal for cuts in social spending. Tax increases are seen as highly improbable, despite unhappy noises from conservatives.
All this appears to add up to rising interest rates later next year, which would spell sad news for the stock market and the economy. So Chairman Volcker is trying to jawbone the banks into reducing interest rates and the White House and Congress into narrowing the prospective budget deficits. Just about everybody agrees with Mr. Volcker, and just about nobody intends to do anything about it, at least until after the 1984 election.So real G.N.P. is likely to grow by about 5 percent from the end of 1983 to the end of 1984, with consumption and capital spending on plant and equipment on the rise.
But with the rate of inflation moving above 5 percent, the Fed will be leaning against the wind, subject to political constraints against leaning too hard, lest it check the expansion. After the election those constraints will be lessened, and 1985 promises to be a slower year.

Abstract: A. I think the Soviets are going to negotiate seriously. There is a great propaganda effort going on on their part now because their target is - they've been encouraged by some of the demonstrations that they've helped organize throughout the world. They think maybe they could persuade our allies to turn back and not ask us for the deployment of the intermediate-range weapons, but we're going to deploy, and deploy on schedule. And once they see we're going to do that, and now that they know that we're determined to build our strength and not unilaterally disarm, as we so foolishly have done over recent years, I think they're going to see that the best thing for them is to negotiate with us and in good faith. And they may do some things - they may try, as has been rumored, a walkout, and things of that kind, but we'll just wait at the table. And I think they'll come back. Q. Sir, I want to ask you about a proposal that you are backing that's before the Senate now. I don't think they've passed it quite yet but they're about to. It's that Project for Democracy, and we would - it would mean, I believe, that we would provide taxpayers' money and private sector leaders to go into other countries to decide if they have a democratic government or not? If we think they don't, then we would turn over that government and set up a government that we liked. Don't you think that would get us into a lot of wars? A. Well, would that be all bad? If you've got everybody building defense, then nobody's going to start a war. And that's maybe part of the idea. The danger that we're in today was voiced by Dwight Eisenhower in a letter to a publisher back in 1956, in which he, a man of war, said that couldn't we see that the weapons that we're building today are making victory or defeat obsolete - that we're coming to a stage in weaponry in which there can be no victory as we've always thought of it - no winner or loser in war that can just be the destruction of the people. And he said when that moment arrives - and I think it has arrived - he said then won't we have the common sense to sit down at a negotiating table and do away with war as a means of settling our disputes?

Full text: Following is a transcript of President Reagan's news conference last night in Washington, as recorded by The New York Times: OPENING STATEMENT
Good evening, I have a statement. This week, we marked an anniversary here in Washington - at least some of us did - the 1,000th day since we charted a new course for America. From the outset, we knew that a breaking with the past and beginning on the new road would be long and hard, and it has been.
Coming to grips with the most serious economic crisis in postwar history has tested our mettle, our patience and our unity. And, believe me, I understand how difficult it's been to hear that America is making sure and steady progress when it's our family and friends who are suffering the ache and disappointment of hard times.
But we Americans are a people of deep faith, hard work and common sense, and we never stop believing in ourselves. So we're emerging with renewed confidence. We've made great strides in these first 1,000 days; inflation and interest rates are down dramatically, we've passed the first real tax cut for everyone in nearly 20 years, and now a strong recovery is sending Americans back to work. Almost 400,000 found jobs last month.
We have the highest number of people working in our history, almost 102 million. Virtually every sector of the economy, from construction to the auto industry to high technology, is expanding, creating new hope and a more secure future.
We have the chance to build the kind of lasting economic expansion that this nation has not enjoyed since the 1960's. And I ask the Congress for cooperation in these last four weeks before it leaves for the year. Many key budget decisions remain and we have a real opportunity to hold down spending and reduce deficits. And I think we should remember these deficits didn't just spring up in a thousand days; they're the product of too many years of tax and tax and spend and spend.
In these closing days of Congress, let us rededicate ourselves not to taxing people more but to making government spend less. This is the way to keep the United States on a steady path of economic growth and opportunity for all our people. And now your questions.
Jim?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
View On Nicaragua
Q. Mr. President, regarding the recent rebel attacks on a Nicaraguan oil depot, is it proper for the C.I.A. to be involved in planning such attacks and supplying equipment for air raids, and do the American people have a right to be informed about any C.I.A. role?
A. I think covert actions have been a part of government and a part of government's responsibilities for as long as there's been a government. I'm not going to comment on what, if any, connection such activities might have had with what has been going on or with some of the specific operations down there, but I do believe in the right of a country when it believes that its interests are best served to practice covert activity and then - while you people may have a right to know, you can't let your people know without letting the wrong people know - those that are in opposition to what you're doing.
Marines in Lebanon
Q. There's growing concern about the marines in Lebanon, and your national security affairs adviser has said that the loss of life is unacceptable and that the partition of Lebanon is unacceptable. What are you going to do about it and I'd like to follow up.
A. Helen, we're going to keep on doing what we have been doing - trying to complete the plan that we launched a little more than a year ago. We know there are hazards there, and no one can feel more deeply about the loss of life and the wounding of some of our men there. We knew it was a hazardous undertaking when we joined in the multinational force. But our objective remains the same.
We have made great progress there. If you remember back, Beirut itself was being shelled daily in an exchange of fire that was killing literally hundreds of civilians on a daily basis, wounding others grievously. That - a cease-fire followed there. A government was created, representatives to a parliament were elected, the Israelis withdrawn to the Awali River and have announced their intention of permanent withdrawing.
The disorders that have plagued Lebanon for some eight years have, of course, taken over - this was one of the reasons for a multinational force to try and have some stability while the Government - and incidentally I left out the fact that the Lebanese Army, which has been created by this new Government in which we've helped with training and supplies is a fine Army - not as big as it should be but the problems its confronted with - but the mission is to enable the Lebanese Government and its military to take over its own country with the withdrawal of all forces.
Earlier in that first ceasefire there was a successful ousting of some 10,000 of the P.L.O. militia from the country. As long there's a possibility of making the overall peace plan work, we're going to stay there.
Peace in Middle East
Q. May I ask what plans do you contemplate, how will you broaden the peace in the Middle East and bring about a reconciliation of all the parties and the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians?
A. Well this - you've named exactly the goals of the plan that I proposed a year ago last September and it began with trying to straighten up the Lebanese situation with the border of Israel - the northern border - being violated as it was by terrorist groups, innocent people there being killed. They had a responsibility to try and defend that border.
Now an agreement has been reached between the Lebanese Government and Israel. We are doing everything we can to persuade Syria to quit being a roadblock in this process. But that was the first phase - Lebanon. Then - and our intention remains the same - working with the more moderate Arab states to bring about the kind of peace with Israel that Anwar Sadat helped bring about. Our process is following the lead that was established in the Camp David talks and the two United Nations resolutions, 242 and 338. And this is what we want to do. But as I say it all is kind of hinging on the resolution of Lebanon.
The Helms Position
Q. Mr. President, Senator Helms has been saying on the Senate floor that Martin Luther King Jr. had Communist associations - was a Communist sympathizer. Do you agree?
A. We'll know in about 35 years, won't we. No, I don't fault Senator Helms's sincerity with regard to wanting the records opened up. I think that he's motivated by a feeling that if we're going to have a national holiday named for any American, when it's only been named for one American in all our history to this time, that he feels we should know everything there is to know about an individual.
And I say I don't fault his sincerity in that but I also recognize there is no way that these records can be opened. Because an agreement was reached between the family and the Government, with regard to those records. And we're not going to turn away from that or set a precedent of breaking agreements of that kind.
Q. Sir, what do we do then in 35 years if the records are opened and we find that Dr. King was a Communist sympathizer? Do we then try to undo the law? I mean I'm not quite certain where the logic is here.
A. The logic is there in that there is no way that this Government should violate its word and open those records now.
I happen to - while I would have preferred a day of recognition for his accomplishments and what he meant in a stormy period in our history here, I would've preferred a day similar to, say, Lincoln's birthday, which is not technically a national holiday but is certainly a day reverenced by a great many people in our country and has been.
I would've preferred that, but since they seem bent on making it a national holiday, I believe the symbolism of that day is important enough that I would - I'll sign that legislation when it reaches my desk.
Positioning of Forces
Q. Mr. President, when I was in the Marines the doctrine was to take the high ground and hold it and not to deploy on a flat open field like the Beirut Airport. What reason is there to prevent the marines from taking some more defensible positions in pursuit of the policy for which you sent them there?
A. Well Gerry, all of those things we're asking ourselves, and we're looking at everything that can be done to try and make their position safer, but you must remember - you were talking about and you were being trained as marines for combat - and if these marines had gone there to join in the combat on the side of whatever force we might have picked, then all of those rules would apply.
But they're there as part of a multinational force to try and maintain a stability, and their sector happens to be trying to maintain that airport and open it up for traffic. So airports just happen to be flat, and we're doing everything we can and making everything possible for them to defend themselves.
Q. Mr. President, does that mean that they cannot sally forth from the borders of the area to which they are assigned if they are attacked from a nearby position, whether it's high ground or not?
A. All I can tell you is, I can't answer that question right now, but I, virtually daily, tell our people that - to be in consultation with the men on the ground, the commanders there, of those units, or anything that in keeping with our mission that we can do to help insure their safety. Now let me turn over in another direction.

Cost of New Holiday
Q. Mr. President, you have said in the past, a year and a half ago, following up on Sam, that you had real reservations about the expense of another national holiday. In fact, to quote you, you said, ''It might be that there is no way we could afford all of those holidays that we would have with people who are also revered figures in history of many of the groups that make up our population.'' So I'm wondering, why have you changed your mind now about the holiday for Dr. King, and why are you willing to sign that legislation?
A. Because I think this has become so symbolic of what was a very real crisis in our history, and a discrimination that was pretty foreign to what is normal with us, and the part that he played in that. I think that the symbolism of it is worthy of this.
Query on Golf Club
Q. I'd like to follow up, then. Can you explain to us why you've decided to spend the coming weekend in Augusta at a golf club that is very exclusive and that we understand has no black members?
A. I don't know anything about the membership but I know there is nothing in the bylaws of that club that advocates any discrimination of any kind. I saw in a recent tournament down there, a national tournament, I saw blacks playing in that tournament on that course. I've been invited as a guest to go down and play a round of golf on the Augusta golf course, and, as I say, I think I've covered all that I know about it.
Dean?
Choice for Interior
Q. Mr. President, your recent nomination of Judge Clark as Interior Secretary shocked just about everybody but yourself and Judge Clark, I think. I wonder, sir, if you could tell us what qualifications he has for that Interior Department post?
A. Well, I think the qualifications of being a very able and fine administrator and manager - I have known him from the time he was my Chief of Staff when I was Governor in California. I know that on the bench as a Supreme Court Justice of California he dealt with many problems of this kind. I know of his own personal interest and knowledge in this field. He's a fourth-generation rancher, as he himself has stated. He's greatly interested in this entire subject, and I believe that he will do a fine job in carrying out the policies which I've advocated there.
Q. Mr. President, did he want to leave the national security post?
A. He expressed a very definite interest in that position. And as I say, it did not surprise me knowing his great interest in that. And I appointed him. Cathy?
Immigration Bill
Q. Mr. President, after years of bipartisan work on a comprehensive immigration reform bill, it appears House Speaker O'Neill has successfully blocked action on it in the House. And he even suggested that you might veto it for political purposes. What, if anything, are you going to do to help House Republicans who are trying to free up that bill?
A. I am going to try and get - and have been supportive of an immigration, some immigration, legislation for a long time. This country has lost control of its own borders. And no country can sustain that kind of position.
I support it actively and worked hard for the passage twice of the Senate bill on immigration. I will admit that the House bill, I had some disagreements with some of the structure in the forms - in the form of that bill but recognize that there was a process called conference, when there were differences between the two bills.
I want to sign, as quickly as possible, immigration legislation. And I'm going to have to shift again here.
Steve?
Re-election
Q. Mr. President, let's speak about re-election if we might for a moment. You have said that you want to delay the decision as long as possible to maintain your credibility with Congress, for instance. This is understandable, as I see it, as long as you run. But it's getting late, and if you don't run at this point other Republicans who would then have an interest in it would be way behind their Democratic opponents. It would seem to hurt the party. Therefore, practically speaking now, don't you have to run?
A. I have to commend all of you people, you can find more different ways of asking that question!
Q. There's one way to stop it!
A. Yes, and down the road one day, probably in the not too distant future, probably before my birthday, I will put your minds all at rest, one way or the other. And I don't think - in the first place, I think that campaigns are too long, and I think one of the reasons we don't have as many people voting as we should in this country is not because they haven't got an interest but because we satiate them and we wear them out until they seem to be campaigning year in and year out and day in and day out. And if any of the Democratic candidates are listening, yes, I mean them too with this.
So I don't think there would be any harm done by - I know that some who've preceded me in this office have waited much longer than I'll probably wait before they've said anything about it.
Q. Just to make sure - every time we've heard it, it's been a little later. Your birthday, I think, is in February? Is that now the schedule?
A. No, I just happened to mention that.
Q. Will we hear by Christmas?
A. What?
Q. By Christmas, perhaps?
A. It's possible. You know, I'm unpredictable in many ways.
Leslie?
Marines in Lebanon
Q. Mr. President, back to the Middle East. You said that the Syrians are being a roadblock to the situation in Lebanon. But there are analysts who say that they are deliberately foot-dragging and in fact harassing us and the marines over there in order to wear you down so that you will pull the marines out. No. 1, do you agree with that assessment? Is that what the Syrians are doing. And secondly, can you be worn down?
A. Well, the answer to the first part of the question is that I know the Syrians are dragging their feet but they have - there have been other indications as to the reason for that. Syria for many years has talked about a thing called Greater Syria in which they believe much of Jordan and much of Lebanon truly should belong to them. And I think that they have that kind of an interest in this, and aided and abetted by about 7,000 Soviet advisers and technicians and some pretty sophisticated Soviet weaponry, I think that they are contributing to the disorder and the trouble.
Now if they're doing it with the idea of wearing me down, they're going to be disappointed.
Q. Could you clarify that. What do you mean they'll be disappointed? What are you going to have the marines doing if they escalate, for instance?
A. Well the marines will always defend themselves, and we will provide that defense. But we're going to - I know that many of the Arab nations have been joining us. We're going to continue the diplomatic process that was advanced so brilliantly by Phil Habib and by Ambassador McFarlane which brought about the present situation and the desire of the Government there to now broaden its base and bring in some of the dissident groups and all. We're going to continue with that process.
But I don't think there's any way we should stand by and just let Syria destroy what so many people want, which is peace and order there in that troubled country.

Arms Control Talks
Q. Mr. President, do you feel the Soviets will negotiate seriously on arms control once the Presidential election heats up? Or is it a matter of achieving an agreement in the next several months or waiting until 1985?
A. Now wait a minute - try that again. I think I was still thinking about some things that I would have said in addition to my other answer.
Q. Given the uncertainty that a Presidential election would create, would you feel the Soviets would still negotiate seriously on arms control once the Presidential election heats up? Or is it a matter of achieving something between now and the time you announce, or wait until '85?
A. I think the Soviets are going to negotiate seriously. There is a great propaganda effort going on on their part now because their target is - they've been encouraged by some of the demonstrations that they've helped organize throughout the world. They think maybe they could persuade our allies to turn back and not ask us for the deployment of the intermediate-range weapons, but we're going to deploy, and deploy on schedule. And once they see we're going to do that, and now that they know that we're determined to build our strength and not unilaterally disarm, as we so foolishly have done over recent years, I think they're going to see that the best thing for them is to negotiate with us and in good faith. And they may do some things - they may try, as has been rumored, a walkout, and things of that kind, but we'll just wait at the table. And I think they'll come back.
Q. Something to follow up. Do you feel confident that you'll get an agreement by the end of your first term?
A. By the end of this term?
Q. Yes.
A. Well I hope very much that we will. We've been at this - I realize the history of negotiations in the past has been long drawn out, but if you will look at some of the negotiations in the past, maybe it was long drawn out because the longer the Soviets sat there the more we unilaterally disarmed, and they found that just by waiting they could get things that they wanted. We're not doing that. We're arming.
Yes?
Vietnam Comparison
Q. Mr. President, before the United States went into Vietnam, the French suffered a devastating defeat there by putting their troops in a saucer- shaped depression with the enemy up around the sides shooting down on them. Doesn't this appear uncomfortably similar, to you, to the way we are deploying our troops in Lebanon, on the low ground? And how soon can we expect that we're going to redeploy them to a spot that makes more sense?
A. Well, right now with the cease- fire it isn't from high ground that they're being fired upon. Actually, much of this that has tragically taken lives there is literally coming from civilians, from radicals in residential neighborhoods, where we have always refrained from using artillery cover or anything of that kind. And when they were fired upon from the hills, that's when naval gunfire responded. And maybe the French at Dien Bien Phu, in that terrible defeat, didn't have a New Jersey sitting offshore as we do.
Q. But our marines are still being killed, Sir.
A. I know and as I say, most of this from the sniper-type fire. As a matter of fact, some of the TV news accounts have carried actual interviews with the very young men who are doing this and who are claiming their right and yet they are not even members of some of the unofficial militia.
They are just individuals that are out murdering. And we're not sitting idly by. We're looking at every option and everything that we can do that can leave us in the position to carry out the mission for which they were sent and, at the same time, make their lives safer.
Iran and Iraq
Q. Mr. President, Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz if Iraq uses its French fighters against Iranian interests. Is the U.S. prepared to use military force to stop Iran from cutting off our oil? And do you believe we would be successful?
A. Let me just say that I don't think it would be proper for me to talk about tactics or what might be done. But I will say this: I do not believe the free world could stand by and allow anyone to close the Straits of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf to the oil traffic through those waterways.
Q. Can you say how far we'd be willing to go?
A. No. As I say, that's for them to wonder about.
Sarah? I have to call on you, I talked to your boss the other day. Q. Thank you, he enjoyed it.
Democracy Project
Q. Sir, I want to ask you about a proposal that you are backing that's before the Senate now. I don't think they've passed it quite yet but they're about to. It's that Project for Democracy, and we would - it would mean, I believe, that we would provide taxpayers' money and private sector leaders to go into other countries to decide if they have a democratic government or not? If we think they don't, then we would turn over that government and set up a government that we liked. Don't you think that would get us into a lot of wars?
A. Sarah, that's not the aim of this program. This is - what you're talking about is the thing that I spoke to the British Parliament about when I was there at the European summit. What we have in mind is that the Marxist-Leninists and the world Socialist movement, for that matter, have - they've been ardent missionaries for their beliefs all over the world. And we in the democracies, and where free enterprise is practiced, have just sort of thought that maybe everyone could see how well we're doing and follow our lead.
The proposal is for people to go and be the same kind of missionaries, and see if they cannot explain democracy. One of the first meetings we had in connection with that was here in this room, in which people from all over the world came and it was a session during our election year to tell them about elections, and how legitimate elections could be won. Not those kind where you've only got one person to vote for and you'd better vote for him or somebody'll come and get you.
And it's going to be - it's an education program. The idea of worldwide - and pointing out the differences that those countries have chosen - new countries - whether it's Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea - those countries that have chosen our idea, our way, instead of statism, authoritarianism or totalitarianism - their living standard, their prosperity, their freedom for their people, is so much greater than anything the other countries have. We just want to explain to people how it works.
Gary?
Outer Space Defense
Q. Mr. President - thank you - do you favor the five-year program that Cap Weinberger has recommended to you for the outer space defense of this country?
A. Gary, nothing has actually been presented to me as yet. I'm fascinated with reading all about it, but I haven't seen it, and I can tell you that no one has suggested any such figure - in the billions of dollars - that have been proposed. All of this is simply the carrying out of what I asked for quite some time ago, and that was for us to see if there is not a defensive weapon that can stop this race in offensive weapons throughout the world that can render maybe a system of horrifying weapons obsolete. And so they're proceeding with the research on that. But I think there's a great exaggeration of the kind of money that's being talked.
Q. Can I follow up? Would this not create, instead of an offensive arms race, a defensive arms race? A defensive arms race between the U.S. and Soviet Union?
A. Well, would that be all bad? If you've got everybody building defense, then nobody's going to start a war. And that's maybe part of the idea. The danger that we're in today was voiced by Dwight Eisenhower in a letter to a publisher back in 1956, in which he, a man of war, said that couldn't we see that the weapons that we're building today are making victory or defeat obsolete - that we're coming to a stage in weaponry in which there can be no victory as we've always thought of it - no winner or loser in war that can just be the destruction of the people. And he said when that moment arrives - and I think it has arrived - he said then won't we have the common sense to sit down at a negotiating table and do away with war as a means of settling our disputes?
Housing Starts
Q. Mr. President, new figures out today show that housing starts were down pretty sharply last month, and the figure for the number of building permits went down for the second month in a row. Analysts are saying this could mean the economic recovery is going to level off, maybe kind of peter out next year, and more people are becoming concerned about high interest rates. Given the big deficits being projected by your own Administration, isn't it time for some strong action by you to get interest rates down?
A. Well, I think what we're doing is aimed at getting interest rates down. Now I'm not sure that interest rates entirely are to blame for this, and I don't know whether the recent figures - in the first place, they're still way above what they were not too long ago, before this recovery started, running around a million-seven or something.
But what I want to know is are they seasonally adjusted or not? I have to tell you I have not seen any evidence as to whether they are, and I'm going to make an inquiry. Because if they're not, then you have to say, Well, is the interest rate - is that the principal cause or only cause? Or is it possible, because people don't start building houses back in the East and the Middle West and in the snow country when autumn comes, there is a great drop-off in building.
Now if it is seasonally adjusted, then we have to look at things like the interest rates. And it wouldn't surprise me if people are waiting because there is - I think there's a great expectation that there's going to be a further drop in the interest rates, and so anyone would be smart to wait for that drop to take place.
But what we are doing about that, and the deficit, first of all is the economic recovery program, which is working. About half your deficit is caused by the recession. So economic recovery can halve your estimate. Our previous estimates of the horrendous deficits have already been trimmed back by the amount of recovery that we've had so far.
The other part of that is structural, it is built in because of government spending. And I'm going to continue as hard as I can trying to get further reductions in government spending as a means of bringing down the deficits and getting us to the point of balanced budget, which we must reach. I have grown up listening to the other party, year after year, in the 40-odd years in which they have controlled both houses of the Congress, tell us that deficit spending was necessary, and a little inflation also, to maintain prosperity. Well, I used to predict out on the mashed-potato circuit that what is happening would happen - the bottom would fall out. It did.
Now that recovery - and if we can continue more spending cuts - if we had obtained the cuts we asked for in the beginning of our economic recovery program, the deficit would be $40 billion smaller than it is right now.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.

Abstract: ''If there are serious signs of a slowdown, the Federal Reserve can easily lower interest rates,'' said Barry Bosworth of Washington's Brookings Institution. But his Brookings colleague, Robert Solomon, an international economist, argues that weakness is very much the problem. The industrial world's ''insistence on restrictive policies will make it impossible for the developing world to generate the export growth it needs to resolve the debt crisis,'' he said. This combination of depression in the third world and slow growth in the West and Japan, is the central paradox in the I.M.F.'s strategy. What export earnings these countries can generate - and it will be modest at best - will be funneled into the repayment of their debt. Brazil's interest on its external debt, for instance, came to 79 percent of export sales in 1982. ''Even if they can afford it,'' said George Soros, a New York money manager who runs the firm that bear his name, ''it will just increase dangerous political tensions. There will probably come a point where they just won't be willing to pay.'' ''To some extent, the debt must be socialized among the world's countries,'' he said. One way frequently proposed to do this would be to have the central banks guarantee or even take over private loans, but at a value discounted to reflect more closely true economic value. George Soros, the New York investment manager, holds to this view. ''The banks won't do it on their own,'' he said.

Full text: This article was reported by Jeffrey Madrick and William Wolman and written by Mr. Wolman.
THE official tone at the International Monetary
Fund's annual conference in Washington last
week was guardedly optimistic. The forecasts framing the discussion called for an economic recovery in the industrial nations modest enough to allow interest rates to subside but rapid enough to enable the nations of the third world to begin working down their mountainous debt. ''The recovery is growing strongly and the adjustment process is working very fast,'' declared Jacques de Larosie re, the I.M.F.'s managing director, with considerable confidence.
The conference focused on replenishing the resources of the I.M.F. and other world lending agencies. Officials clearly felt threatened by the balky United States Congress, which has yet to vote an increase in the American contribution to the fund. But the general view at the meeting was that once Congress comes through - which most expect - the I.M.F.'s slow-growth game plan for dealing with the world financial crisis, adopted at last year's meeting in Toronto, would work.
There is, however, a counterculture viewpoint - which surfaced frequently in the corridors of the I.M.F. meeting last week - that does not share even such guarded optimism about the future of the world economy. A number of economists and bankers, from a broad political and ideological spectrum, believe that the grand design that succeeded in containing last year's international banking crisis has little chance of putting the world economy back on a path of sustained recovery.
THESE somewhat iconoclastic pessimists include
a Nobel Prize-winning economics professor, a
leading Canadian economist of Keynesian pursuasion, a well-known American economist of monetarist bent and a heavy sprinkling of eclectic European and American bankers and financiers of no particular ideological stripe. Their views - which do not coincide on all matters - reflect the deepest fears of a growing number of economists and financiers. Alexandre Swoboda, director of the International Center for Studies of Money and Banking in Geneva, is one of the latter. ''All may be fine in the world for the next six months or so,'' he said last week as he attended the I.M.F. meeting in Washington, ''but then something is going to come undone.''
If these economists are basically correct, the great economic policy trap of the 1980's could prove to be the exact opposite of the one that entangled the world in the 1970's. During the last decade, policy makers and forecasters throughout the industrial and developing world repeatedly underestimated the devastating impact of inflation on the world economy, and paid the price in repeated recessions and slow growth.
Now, according to the counterculture view, these same policy makers and forecasters may be locked into a course that not only underestimates the power of the deflationary forces at work but also imposes severe austerity policies that could make the collapse of prices and economies inevitable. These austerity policies are the core of the I.M.F. game plan.
Many mainstream economists, of course, claim that another era of chronic policy errors can be avoided. ''I am confident,'' said Mr. de Larosie re in a speech before the world's bankers last week, ''that the spirit of cooperation that has sustained the fund over the recent difficult period can be strengthened so that we can meet the challenges ahead.''
Given this general attitude, there was little evidence of fresh thinking at last week's meeting of the I.M.F., and no sign that the world's finance ministers and central bankers were making any serious provisions to deal with the weaknesses, or downside risks, that lurk in many corners of the international economy.
According to Sylvia Ostry, special adviser to the Privy Council in Canada and former chief economist for the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, ''all the risks are now on the downside.'' In her activist approach to tax and spending policies, Mrs. Ostry is an economic Keynesian.
Said Nicolas Krul, a noted Swiss investment banker who shares some of her views: ''The real objective of
The counterculture does not speak with one voice, but its basic message is clear: The world's financial problems - however ominous - must be faced openly by international agencies and major banks if they are to be resolved fairly and with as little political pain as possible. To the group, that means three things:
* Banks will have to give up hope of ever collecting all of the billions of dollars owed them by third-world nations.
* Governments in the industrial nations will have to shoulder more of the burden by pumping more money into the developing world's empty coffers.
* Political and financial leaders must shake off their obsession with inflation and adopt policies that are designed to sustain growth, not restrict it, even though inflation might rise somewhat in the process.
Policies that are quite the opposite, however, are now in place. The banks, reluctant to write down bad third-world debts, are rolling over old debts and making very few new loans to developing nations. On top of this, the I.M.F. has imposed stringent austerity programs on 46 developing countries - a quid pro quo for financial assistance - that in some instances have intensified local depressions that rival the worst periods of the 1930's. And the fear of renewed inflation has so intimidated industrial world leaders that their primary policy initiative has been to hold down growth.
TO many analysts, weak economic growth is not the worry.
''If there are serious signs of a slowdown, the Federal Reserve can easily lower interest rates,'' said Barry Bosworth of Washington's Brookings Institution. But his Brookings colleague, Robert Solomon, an international economist, argues that weakness is very much the problem. The industrial world's ''insistence on restrictive policies will make it impossible for the developing world to generate the export growth it needs to resolve the debt crisis,'' he said.
The only real source of world import growth and the one truly bright spot in the world economy is the United States, where a consumer-led recovery has been generated by record government deficits and a sharp fall in the savings rate. But to the counterculture thinkers, that recovery - which is expected to slow in the fourth quarter of this year - is a shaky foundation for world growth. The great concern is that there is no sign yet that rapid United States growth has provided much impetus to a self-sustaining takeoff in the rest of the world economy. The main problems are the shrinking American role in the world economy, and a United States policy mix that has created high interest rates and an overvalued dollar.
Traditionally, it is the American locomotive that pulls the rest of the economy along. ''But the U.S. ability to pull up the rest of the world is much less than it once was,'' said Mrs. Ostry. ''Every 1 percent rise in the U.S. economy will produce only a one- quarter percent rise in the rest of the O.E.C.D.''
Moreover, according to A. Gary Shilling, a Wall Street economic consultant who heads his own firm, for the first time in post World War II history, weakness in the rest of the world could pull the United States recovery down as the thrust of domestic consumption and government spending peters out.
Europe is only now showing signs of strength amid its worst levels of unemployment since the Depression. Japan's growth is significantly below normal, and dependent on an export surge that for now is feeding the consumer boom in the United States.
The slow-growth attitude of world policymakers was reflected in Bonn's decision last month to raise its discount rate soon after the first signs of economic strength. Japan, concerned that its budget deficit is already too high, plans to provide no further fiscal stimulus to its economy. And its monetary policy remains constrained as it tries to bolster the yen against the rising dollar. The O.E.C.D.'s July forecast predicted growth in the U.S. and Canada next year of nearly 5 percent. But growth in Japan will be 3.5 percent, far below its historical average. And in Europe there will not be enough growth, says the organization, to prevent unemployment from rising above current record-high levels.
Outside the industrial world, the picture is far worse. Mr. de Larosi ere points out that 1983 will be the third year in a row in which economic growth per capita has stagnated in the third world. In Brazil, the real gross domestic product has already declined as rapidly as it did between 1928 and 1931. And the outlook suggests that it will drop still further. Production is off at a similar rate in Chile and real wages in Mexico have fallen sharply.
This combination of depression in the third world and slow growth in the West and Japan, is the central paradox in the I.M.F.'s strategy. What export earnings these countries can generate - and it will be modest at best - will be funneled into the repayment of their debt. Brazil's interest on its external debt, for instance, came to 79 percent of export sales in 1982. ''Even if they can afford it,'' said George Soros, a New York money manager who runs the firm that bear his name, ''it will just increase dangerous political tensions. There will probably come a point where they just won't be willing to pay.''
In some sense at least, the industrial countries chose the slow-growth track upon which they are running. By contrast, the third world has been given virtually no choice but to pull in its belt. Forty-six developing nations are now operating under tough I.M.F. programs designed both to fend off immediate crises and to speed the borrower's return to the private credit markets.
But so far, there is little evidence that the programs are having the intended effect. Net new credits have been minimal in 1983. Data Resources Inc. reports that, based on data from the Bank for International Settlements, net new lending to developing countries in the first quarter of 1983 came to only $2 billion at an annual rate. D.R.I. estimates that the same rate continued into the second quarter. By contrast, new loans in the first half of 1982 grew at a $50 billion annual rate.
''There is no way the major banks can get out of this situation without writing down some of the debt,'' said Fritz Leutwiler, president of the Bank for International Settlements, at a speech at last week's conference. Wassily Leontief, who has won the Nobel prize in economics and is a professor at New York University, says: ''The third world must have transfers of income in order to grow.'' He believes the transfers must come out of the coffers of government if not the hide of the banks. The fundamental problem is that the balance of payments correction that Mr. de Larosi ere is trying to bring about in the third world has been achieved so far mostly by cutbacks in third world imports. To meet future financial obligations - with tighter world credit conditions - the developing countries must grow at a steady pace. But the combination of their existing debt burden and the new I.M.F. restraint programs may make this impossible.
IN Brazil, for example, said John
Williamson of Washington's Institute for International Economics, the I.M.F. has demanded that wages be indexed to 80 percent of inflation, down from 100 percent. More important, the fund wants Brazil to bring its budget deficit to 7 percent of gross domestic product by next year, rather than the last year's 17 percent rate.
The attendant drop in demand would put a burden on Brazil's private sector that economists familiar with the country believe would be politically intolerable. ''Brazil may promise to meet I.M.F. conditions,'' say Larry Sjaastad, a University of Chicago economist and specialist in Latin America, ''but there is no way they can do it.''
Compounding the problem, according to the counterculture analysis, is what some call the self-interest of the private banking system. On the one hand, the banks are earning huge fees in turning over existing loans, said Alan Meltzer, a monetarist economist from Carnegie-Mellon University. On the other hand, the private banking system as a whole is trying to reduce its overall exposure. Regional banks, for example, have reduced their inter-bank lending drastically to certain third world countries. Swiss and West German banks, sometimes at the prodding of their depositors, have also pulled back.
Yet, even if the industrialized world were headed for rapid and sustained economic growth - which would allow it easily to absorb growing exports from the developing world - some analysts say the third world would still need a rapid expansion of private credit from the West to get growth going.
Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist for Morgan Guaranty, estimates that new extension of private credit must grow by a sizable 7 percent a year - about $25 billion - for the developing countries to meet their debt repayment schedules.
It is already becoming clear that the I.M.F. will need more money from governments to meet its commitments than it expected just days ago. According to reports from the Washington meeting, Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German Central Bank, estimated that the I.M.F. would need an emergency loan of $6 billion to $7 billion, in addition to the $8 billion it is waiting for from the United States and $6 billion expected from several other countries.
ACCORDING to the counterculturists, the ultimate irony in
I.M.F. thinking is that, even if its program could work in a few isolated countries, it is doomed to failure when applied so sweepingly to the entire third world. It is one thing to tell a single country to reduce imports drastically and expand exports. It is another to demand it of a whole region. Everybody can't sell more than they buy.
''The I.M.F. is telling everyone to export more; it forgets that somebody must import more,'' said Mr. Sjaastad from Chicago. The Shadow Open Market Committee, an unofficial group of economists that makes alternative policy proposals to actions taken by the Federal Reserve, made the same point recently.
Another bone the counterculture analysts pick with their mainstream colleagues is over the prospects for worsening inflation. ''World leaders are still fighting inflation,'' said Mrs. Ostry, who formerly served as chairman of Canada's Economic Council in Ottawa. But, she adds, ''outside of the financial marketplace, there is little evidence of inflation or inflationary expectations.''
World wages, even in the expanding United States, have been particularly restrained. And volitile commodity prices, while rising substantially, have performed tamely for this point in a recovery. The Economist's index of world industrial commodities is up 17 percent since last year's trough, but it is still 25 percent below its 1980 peak. The moderation in prices contrasts sharply with the inflation premium built into high worldwide interest rates.
For any economist trying to figure out how the third world can move into a period of sustained growth, the most visible problems are high United States interest rates, and the consequent overvalued dollar. Those severely constrain, most analysts say, the ability of America's trading partners to pursue expansionary policies.
First, such countries feel they must keep their interest rates close to United States rates to protect their currencies and prevent huge capital outflows. Second, imports grow more expensive as currencies weaken and so countries worry about the inflationary consequences of stimulus.
''Expansion means more imports,'' says Mr. Swoboda, the Geneva economist. ''And a country whose currency is weak and falling fears that the rising prices of those imports will trigger more inflation than real growth.''
Some imbalances go beyond the problems of a strong dollar. The OPEC oil shock and a decade of slow growth have produced giant excess capacity in many basic industries. In a world dominated by slow growth policies, only the most dynamic economies, the United States, Japan and some countries in southeast Asia, have managed to create new industries to offset some of this decline.
Europe, for example, makes only 5 percent of the computer chips it uses. ''The big problem in Europe is structural,'' says Karl Vak, head of an Austrian Central Savings and Commercial Bank. The great fear in Europe, said Mr. Swoboda, is that industrial backwardness means that economic stimulus will only lead to increased inflation or increased imports, not production or jobs.
Finally, the harsh contraction of imports by the third world, economists say, has cut back a vibrant source of export growth for the entire world. A reduced export market in the third world is not an enormous threat to the industrial nations of the O.E.C.D. because only 7 percent or so of their exports are sent in that direction. But the third world and the oil countries represent the fastest growing markets for the O.E.C.D. nations and in this sense, any slowdown in market growth, could retard growth prospects.
What the capital markets fear - and policymakers, too, at the I.M.F. and elsewhere - is that the world's slow growth crisis will ultimately be resolved by a great injection of reserves by the world's central banks that would, in turn, feed inflation. According to this scenario, central bankers will eventually supply massive reserves to help their banks expand credit, swallow bad debts, or ultimately, to avoid a major bank failure ''A lot of people here are acting as if it will all be papered over,'' said Mr. Swoboda.
So far, however, it's clear that Western governments, especially the United States, are being especially parsimonious in doling out loans to the third world. The battle in Congress could still go against the I.M.F. quota, some Washington observers say. And in sharp and ironic contrast to the fear of too much credit flowing to the third world, the I.M.F.'s restrictive policies are forcing billions of dollars of income to flee from these third world countries to safer and more lucrative havens in the industrial world.
Moreover, the private banking community is actively trying to reduce its exposure to third world lenders and seems to have taken the view that it will expand credits only under official auspices, as in the new $6.5 billion commitment to Brazil worked out with the I.M.F.'s de Larosie re and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker at last week's conference.
These are not conditions that generate inflation, say the counterculture analysts. ''You've got to understand,'' said Carnegie-Mellon Professor Meltzer, ''these austerity programs are killing the debtor countries. They are being made to pay back laons that were never put to productive use.''
According to Chicago's Mr. Sjaastad, between 1971 and 1982, debt service to the third world adjusted for the United States inflation rate grew by 17 percent a year. A study by the Amex Bank in London, a subsidiary of the American Express Company, reveals that since 1978, developing countries repaid $126 billion in interest payments of the total $140 billion lent to them. The small margin of $14 billion is all they had to spend on consumption and investment. And if no new credits are made in 1983, reports the bank, even that small margin will be wiped out.
ALL of which convinces the counterculture group that the potential for a worsening of the financial crisis in 1984 is large. ''The issue is whether we have a controlled solution or an uncontrolled one,'' says Mr. Krul, who is the head of the Gulf & Occidental Investment Company, S.A., in Geneva. ''An uncontrolled one could be disasterous.''
Mr. Krul reflects the view of many analysts who believe that the banks and the governments of the industrial nations must eventually assume some of the developing countries' debt, at the same time forcing the banks to write down and restructure their debt.
''To some extent, the debt must be socialized among the world's countries,'' he said. One way frequently proposed to do this would be to have the central banks guarantee or even take over private loans, but at a value discounted to reflect more closely true economic value. George Soros, the New York investment manager, holds to this view. ''The banks won't do it on their own,'' he said.
To Professor Leontief, the risks are even more stark. ''Either we save the third world and the banks now, or we create political turmoil now, save the banks later, and give up entirely on the countries,'' he said.
Underlying the more sanguine views that prevailed at the I.M.F., is the comforting assumption that what are called ''spontaneous'' forces of recovery will somehow save the day and produce the environment necessary over the next year or two to wring excess debt out of the debtor nations.
But beneath this, say some counterculture analysts, lies a more cynical attitude, particularly among private bankers: Wring all you can from the third world now and if a new crisis comes, the Government will at last bail you out.
Such an ad hoc and painful road to the future should be avoided, say the these economists and bankers. An explicit, open arrangement among nations is needed. As Mr. Krul put it: ''Solving the problem will require more international cooperation than at any other time since the end of World War II.''

Abstract: ''Our monetary system is in a rather frightening state,'' H. Johannes Witteveen, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said at the start of last week's annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank. Most of the world's money men assembled in Washington share his anxiety. President Reagan's speech to the conference, acknowledging as it did the possibility of ''an economic nightmare that could plague generations to come,'' was not just a more realistic appraisal than the White House has hitherto expressed. Because the United States is crucial to any solution, Mr. Reagan's reaffirmation of his commitment to both the Fund and the Bank was the week's most important positive development. The crisis itself produced the change in rhetoric. The question is whether that presages a change in policy. Mr. Reagan sought to dispel doubts that Congress would back him on a no- strings $8.4 billion share in a $42 billion international package to increase the Fund's lending capacity by declaring his ''unbreakable commitment.'' But Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan gave a flat ''no'' to more extended United States emergency support. When asked why, he curtly said, ''No money.'' When the Fund's managing director, Jacques de Larosi ere was asked to comment, he said drily, ''Well, everybody has his difficulties.'' The United States also wants to cut World Bank loans to poor countries.

Full text: ''Our monetary system is in a rather frightening state,'' H. Johannes Witteveen, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said at the start of last week's annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank. Most of the world's money men assembled in Washington share his anxiety.
In ordinary times, the fact that outstanding loans to just five Latin American countries exceeds 150 percent of the capital of the nine largest American banks would be nothing to worry about. Loans to those five debtors account for just 10 percent of the banks' total assets. But these are not ordinary times. Because of depressed exports and high interest rates, the five and scores of other countries in the third world and in the Communist bloc are having trouble just servicing their debt. If more money is not made available to bail them out, the international monetary system could collapse.
President Reagan's speech to the conference, acknowledging as it did the possibility of ''an economic nightmare that could plague generations to come,'' was not just a more realistic appraisal than the White House has hitherto expressed. Because the United States is crucial to any solution, Mr. Reagan's reaffirmation of his commitment to both the Fund and the Bank was the week's most important positive development.
The crisis itself produced the change in rhetoric. The question is whether that presages a change in policy. Mr. Reagan sought to dispel doubts that Congress would back him on a no- strings $8.4 billion share in a $42 billion international package to increase the Fund's lending capacity by declaring his ''unbreakable commitment.'' But Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan gave a flat ''no'' to more extended United States emergency support. When asked why, he curtly said, ''No money.'' When the Fund's managing director, Jacques de Larosi ere was asked to comment, he said drily, ''Well, everybody has his difficulties.'' The United States also wants to cut World Bank loans to poor countries.
Ideological Keys
The Administration's efforts to cut back are based not only on reluctance to go to Congress for more money but also on its conservative ideology. Too great a bailout, it believes, will exacerbate the world's monetary problems by making it easier for debtor countries to avoid making necessary adjustments, such as closing their budget gaps and ending the balance-of-payments deficits that have caused heavy borrowing.
The Americans drew criticism last week from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said they should practice what they preach. Representatives of other countries, including the conservative West Germans and the Socialist French, also accused the United States of purusing ''Keynesian'' big-deficit fiscal policies to stimulate economic advance while practicing a restrictive monetary policy to curb inflation, thus producing high interest rates that impede investment and a stronger world recovery.
President Reagan and Mr. Regan countered that tax increases to narrow the United States deficit would arrest the American expansion which is helping to pull the world out of the slump. Mr. Reagan also made a case for greater security, and hence his military budget increases, as the foundation of economic prosperity. Despite such disagreements, there is a real consensus among the United States, West Germany, Japan and other creditor countries on the need for borrowing countries to put their economic and financial houses in order. Mr. de Larosi ere stressed that loans would be wasted unless the borrowers ended the loose fiscal and monetary policies that produced inflation and sucked in imports from abroad. A.W. Clausen, the head of the World Bank, regretted so much emphasis in the press on ''conditionality,'' as though it were something that the rich imposed on the poor. The poor accepted it, he said, because it was in their best interests. Nations can always create more money, in effect, by printing it. The I.M.F. could print up a batch of Special Drawing Rights - international paper currency - after member countries vote to do so. But there is intense debate on how much more money to create.
Opponents contend that more money, whether in national or international form, would be inflationary because there is still a hangover of excess credit expansion from the past and because it would relieve debtor countries of making those necessary adjustments. Proponents, especially among developing countries, feel they need more resources to give them time to adjust. Some, including economists from developed countries, argue that the persistence of high unemployment and excess capacity minimize the inflation risk. In this argument, the advantage is with the givers. But with the conservative Reagan Administration backed by the conservative British, German and Japanese Governments, the nongivers are likely to prevail.
The immediate crisis centers on Brazil, which cannot service its $90 billion in postponed debts unless it gets a quick infusion of cash. The heaviest work last week was in putting together a rescue package of $11 billion for Brazil - though it is still far from clear that the bankers on a steering committee can get their own nervous boards of directors and those of hundreds of other banks not represented at last week's meeting to deliver.
More fundamentally, the short-run crises dominating official attention mean little thought has been given to how to reform the monetary system to establish more control over it. Mr. Witteveen crushingly said in his Per Jacobbson Lecture in Washington last week: ''The monetary authorities seem powerless to counter or manage the massive capital flows which have come to dominate foreign exchange markets.'' That is the fundamental reason for the lack of confidence in the system.

Abstract: The contrast between Europe's disappointing prospects and the more encouraging outlook in the United States is adding fuel to the fierce controversy between ''Keynesian'' economists and those of the ''monetarist'' or neo-classical school. Continuing Economic Arguments ''We're facing a crisis in economics as well as an economic crisis - there's absolutely no consensus over what to do,'' said Sylvia Ostry, who watched Europe's economic fortunes closely for four years as chief economist at the Paris-based O.E.C.D. before resigning last summer to return to her native Canada. ''The key question is whether economies are self- levitating or not,'' she said. Continuing high interest rates are the most obvious brake on new investment, as European governments find themselves forced to match the high United States rates to keep their currencies from taking an inflationary plunge against the dollar. In Britain and Germany, long-term bonds currently yield more than the average return on industrial investment. ''Investment isn't profitable,'' warns Klaus Wiener, chief economist at the Westdeutsche Landesbank in D"usseldorf.

Full text: Helped by declining inflation and the strength of the American recovery, the economies of Western Europe are finally starting to pick up after the deepest recession since the 1930's, but only slightly.
Indeed, the European upturn, retarded by high interest rates and lagging demand for exports everywhere except in the United States, is feeble and patchy so far. And economists and policy makers are sharply divided over whether even this weak upswing will last and what, if anything, can be done to strengthen it.
In the 1972-73 recovery, Western European economies were growing by almost 6 percent when the first oil price shock punctured the boom. And during the next upswing, in 1976, Europe registered 4.6 percent annual growth.
But today, as Western Europe starts to climb up out of the trough caused by the second oil price shock, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects growth of a mere five- tenths of 1 percent this year, with 1.5 percent next year, and a continuing increase in unemployment.
The contrast between Europe's disappointing prospects and the more encouraging outlook in the United States is adding fuel to the fierce controversy between ''Keynesian'' economists and those of the ''monetarist'' or neo-classical school. Continuing Economic Arguments
For the Keynesians, who believe governments can and should intervene to speed recovery, the time is ripe for countries with low inflation, such as West Germany and Britain, to adopt more stimulative policies, increasing public spending or cutting taxes to increase growth. In their view, the strength of the American recovery stems mainly from the Reagan Administration's highly stimulative fiscal policy, based on one of the biggest budget deficits in American history.
But economic policy in Europe's low- inflation countries is dominated by monetarists, who fear that more stimulative policies would revive inflation. They believe that Western economies will take off on their own again if governments keep inflation low and allow market forces to operate freely.
In any event, the monetarists observe, European governments have been running high budget deficits for a number of years without producing a convincing recovery. Only in Britain will the deficit be smaller in proportion to economic output this year than in 1979.
''We're facing a crisis in economics as well as an economic crisis - there's absolutely no consensus over what to do,'' said Sylvia Ostry, who watched Europe's economic fortunes closely for four years as chief economist at the Paris-based O.E.C.D. before resigning last summer to return to her native Canada. ''The key question is whether economies are self- levitating or not,'' she said.
A snapshot of Europe's leading economies around midyear discloses flashes of strength against a generally somber background:
WEST GERMANY: Europe's economic workhorse is gloomy, with growth of 1 percent forecast for this year and perhaps 2.5 percent next, coupled with a further rise in unemployment, which is already up two points over last year at 9.4 percent. Yet industrial output has climbed 13.7 percent at annual rates over the last three months and retail sales are up a healthy 8.1 percent. Inflation remains low, averaging 2.5 percent over the last year. But it has edged up to a 4.4 percent annual rate over the last three months, spurred by an acceleration in wage settlements.
BRITAIN: Inflation should also be in the 4 percent range this year. The economy is expected to grow about 2 percent, but then shrink back to a 1.7 percent rate in 1984, according to the latest forecast by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research. Industrial production is growing more slowly than in West Germany, up only four-tenths of 1 percent in the last three months, and the trade balance has slipped into the red again, despite the benefits of North Sea oil. Also, unemployment - at 12.8 percent the highest among the major European economies - is still rising, though at a slower pace.
FRANCE AND ITALY: Both have been left out of Europe's mini-recovery and expect stagnant or contracting economies this year with only a marginal improvement next year. They are trying to curtail high rates of inflation - 9 percent and 17 percent, respectively - that are badly out of line with their neighbors.' They also want to reduce huge payment deficits. Unemployment - at 8.3 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively - is expected to edge higher in both countries.
THE NETHERLANDS: Despite having Europe's lowest inflation rate, under 3 percent a year, the Dutch are wrestling with the highest unemployment rate in the European Economic Community - 17.3 percent by the latest figures. The expectation is for stagnant growth this year and next as the country seeks to extricate itself from a fiscal crisis attributed to runaway welfare spending.
BELGIUM: Caught in a similar crisis of high unemployment, which is running at 14.8 percent, and out-of- control Government spending, it is trying to reduce a huge budget deficit through a tight austerity program. Curiously, however, industrial production has surged to an annual rate of almost 13 percent over the last three months.
In the smaller Common Market economies, Ireland and Greece both face stagnant growth and rising unemployment, attributable to continuing high inflation and their neighbors' disappointing performance. In Ireland, unemployment is expected to rise to nearly 16 percent next year, while in Greece, which has little industry and poor statistics, it is expected to climb to 7 percent. Only in tiny Luxembourg is unemployment remaining around the 2 percent level, once the norm for all the Western industrial nations. Outlook Remains Pessimistic
In Western Europe, despite the signs of a mild upturn, the prevailing view among economists, government officials and business leaders remains profoundly pessimistic.
The O.E.C.D., a group that promotes the economic growth of its 24 member nations and the development of emerging countries, warned not long ago that the robust recovery in the United States would not be shared by Western Europe. It predicts that unemployment in Europe will rise from more than 10 percent of the work force to almost 12 percent next year. The Common Market's Executive Commission says unemployment could climb to almost 14 percent by 1988, even if overall growth accelerates to 2.3 percent a year on average.
Europe's recovery is being held back by a combination of factors. In addition to high interest rates and weak demand for exports in most areas, economists agree, the widespread belief that consumer spending will soon falter weakens business confidence, and the rigidity of the European economies makes them less able to adapt to change.
Where recovery signs are strongest, they mainly reflect a consumer spending spree as individuals find that their wages will buy more with inflation falling, and feel less need to save. This, combined with some industrial restocking after the recession and the surging American demand for imports brought on by the strong dollar, is what is pushing European economies modestly upward. A Lack of Investment
What is lacking is the investment boom that monetarist economists believe will materialize on its own once business is confident inflation is under control. After the 1973 recession, investment in Europe turned sharply upward, but not this time. The latest European Economic Commission survey shows industrial investment stagnating in Germany this year and falling in Britain and France, although in Italy it is expected to rise.
Continuing high interest rates are the most obvious brake on new investment, as European governments find themselves forced to match the high United States rates to keep their currencies from taking an inflationary plunge against the dollar. In Britain and Germany, long-term bonds currently yield more than the average return on industrial investment. ''Investment isn't profitable,'' warns Klaus Wiener, chief economist at the Westdeutsche Landesbank in D"usseldorf.
Under Dr. Ostry's leadership, the traditionally Keynesian O.E.C.D. has spent the last couple of years quietly urging Germany, Britain and other low-inflation countries to strengthen Europe's recovery by switching over to more stimulative policies. The effort got nowhere, however, except perhaps intellectually.
Among the converts is Prof. Wynn Godley of Cambridge University, leader of the so-called New Cambridge School. He no longer believes Britain can restore full employment by adopting a stimulative policy behind protectionist barriers. He now advocates an international meeting - similar to the call by President Francois Mitterrand of France for a new Bretton Woods conference - to plan a coordinated economic stimulus combined with new measures to stabilize exchange rates. In 1944, an international monetary conference attended by 44 nations was held at Bretton Woods, N.H., at which the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were created. Ossified Systems Blamed
For the neoclassicists, growth is sluggish and unemployment obstinately high because European economies have become ossified through elaborate social security systems, high taxes and complex regulations.
In a report to the European Parliament, Prof. James Ball of the London Business School and Michel Albert, former head of the French Economic Planning Commission, gave strong support to this view.
The European and American economies both grew by about 2.2 percent a year between 1974 and 1980, they observed. But while European wages increased 2.3 percent a year, adjusted for inflation, and employment stagnated, they said, in the United States real wages were stagnant and employment rose 2 percent a year. ''Europe gave priority to individual income over employment,'' the report says.
The neo-classicists hope this process will go into reverse, as low inflation and high unemployment encourage workers to price themselves back into jobs by accepting less generous wages and governments act to make employing labor more profitable.

Abstract: MARTIN FELDSTEIN, the chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, has told the nation's county governments, meeting in Milwaukee this week, that they should expect not more but less Federal help because it is essential to shrink the share of gross national product going to domestic spending ''if we are to avoid perpetual deficits or unacceptable tax increases.'' That proposal included a complex ''contingency tax plan'' that Congress has shown no inclination to accept and the President appears just as willing to avoid. Without those contingency tax rises, the President's budget plan, if fully enacted by Congress, would yield deficits averaging some $200 billion a year from 1984 through 1988. Not only domestic but international debt as well can be a drag on United States output and employment. To prevent defaults by foreign debtors, the United States has been running a huge deficit in its foreign trade account. Prof. Hyman Minsky of Washington University in St. Louis notes that a little understood ''basic fact of life in the 1980's'' makes it hard for the United States to achieve full employment as the trade deficit hurts profits and employment.

Full text: MARTIN FELDSTEIN, the chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, has told the nation's county governments, meeting in Milwaukee this week, that they should expect not more but less Federal help because it is essential to shrink the share of gross national product going to domestic spending ''if we are to avoid perpetual deficits or unacceptable tax increases.''
Meanwhile, President Reagan went to Hollywood, Fla., to tell the International Longshoremen's Association that, while he was waiting for his new bipartisan commission, headed by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, to forge a long-term United States policy for Central America he would not yield on his requests for military and economic aid for the area, including $362 million this year for El Salvador alone.
And despite reports of waste at the Pentagon, which Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has vowed to halt by making heads roll, Mr. Reagan plans to raise military outlays by $30 billion, to $245 billion in the 1984 fiscal year, and onward and upward to more than $400 billion by 1988.
Even if the economy keeps rising at a 4 percent clip or more year after year, the budget deficits threaten to keep rising. On a current-services basis, the Administration projects that the deficits would rise from $225 billion in the 1983 fiscal year to $284 billion in 1986 and on up to $315 billion in 1988. The Reagan plan incorporated in the 1984 budget proposal calls for chopping those deficits down to $203 billion next year and on down to $126 billion by 1988.
But that proposal included a complex ''contingency tax plan'' that Congress has shown no inclination to accept and the President appears just as willing to avoid. Without those contingency tax rises, the President's budget plan, if fully enacted by Congress, would yield deficits averaging some $200 billion a year from 1984 through 1988.
How will the soaring public debt affect the nation's economic growth? Prof. Benjamin Friedman of Harvard, in a study of the obstacles to growth, notes that, historically, a rising ratio of public debt has meant a falling ratio of private capital formation. During periods of slump, a rising Federal debt acts as a cushion for the national economy and even a spur for recovery. But as the recovery continues and the economy approaches full employment, the clash between public and private demands for capital intensifies, increasing pressure on interest rates.
The United States economy is now heading into that crucial period of transition. If the recovery continues and the Federal Reserve pursues a noninflationary monetary policy, the rising proportion of public debt to gross national product will at some point mean a falling proportion of private debt and capital formation. Climbing interest rates will do the rationing, driving down private investment. If the Fed were to seek to avoid that clash between public and private borrowing by increasing the money supply enough to accommodate both, it would regenerate inflation - but without solving the problem. For as experience in the 1970's made clear, inflation drags down capital formation, impairs productivity and weakens the United States in world markets.
Not only domestic but international debt as well can be a drag on United States output and employment. To prevent defaults by foreign debtors, the United States has been running a huge deficit in its foreign trade account. Prof. Hyman Minsky of Washington University in St. Louis notes that a little understood ''basic fact of life in the 1980's'' makes it hard for the United States to achieve full employment as the trade deficit hurts profits and employment.
One step for breaking the obstacles to steady growth would be for the United States to cut and stabilize the budget deficits it would incur even at high employment - defining high employment today as equivalent to 6 percent unemployment.
But that will not be easy. Professor Friedman estimates that stabilizing the Federal debt-to-G.N.P. ratio at 34 percent, where it will be at the end of the current fiscal year, would mean reducing the deficit to an average of $122 billion a year from 1984 through 1988 - about $80 billion a year less than the deficits now in prospect. A more ambitious effort to stabilize the national debt at 30 percent of G.N.P., where it was at the end of the 1982 fiscal year, would require cutting the deficit to an average of $74 billion a year for the next four years - $130 billion below the Reagan plan without the contingency tax increases.
But the Administration appears to have put aside any effort to shrink the high-employment deficits until after the 1984 election. It hopes to get by without much rise in interest rates or inflation, thanks to the hangover of unemployed resources. But the operating rate at the nation's factories, utilities and mines rose in June to 74.5 percent, the highest rate in 16 months.
The financial markets are already worrying about the coming clash between the Government and private borrowers, and the growtharresting effects that would produce through rising interest rates. The Administration's political anxiety must be that market expectations will force interest rates up enough to hurt the recovery before 1984 is over. But its attack on the deficit problem remains limited and highly selective, pointed at efforts to keep the Federal Reserve from tightening monetary policy too soon and to curb social spending.

Full text: President Reagan was interviewed today by correspondents from Canada, West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Italy. Following are excerpts from the White House transcript. Concern Over Deficits
Q. Since this is, after all, an economic summit, let's start with the economy. There's good news there; the economy is picking up. But if the leaders whom you'll be dealing with have one thing in common, it's that they're worried about the size of the budget deficits that your Administration is running up. They're afraid that it will abort the recovery. What is your reaction, sir, to this, especially since you're an old foe of deficit financing?
A. Yes, I am, and I think about half of our deficit is due to the recession, which, as we know, is worldwide. And the other half I think is structural.
But the main way that we can handle the deficit, I think, is the program that we have under way right now. And that is to restore the economy. There's a limit to how much you can achieve in reducing spending. There's a limit to how much you could achieve if you try to do it with taxes, in addition to which you are threatening then the recovery, by removing the incentives that I think have brought about the start of the recovery.
The answer does lie in economic growth. If we, for example, could for the next few years - if we were one percentage point higher than our estimate in the growth of the economy, it would reduce the deficit by a hundred billion dollars a few years from now.
So we're proceeding, and we think that our program is right. Because we started with interest rates that were more than twice as high as they are now. We started with an inflation rate that was more than three times as great as we've brought it down to. And of course, it is the inflation which contributes to the high interest rate.
And we have a plan that I submitted to the Congress with regard to our budget and contingency taxes for the out-years, once we have established the recovery as definite, that we would be willing to assume, which would lead to a declining pattern of deficits in the out-years and down the line, a balanced budget.
Q. But to follow up, sir, right now the way the deficits are structured, they may soak up as much as 70 percent of all the net savings in the United States. In other words, $7 out of $10, instead of going into the investments that you're talking about, to create jobs, are going to go to service that deficit.
A. On the other hand, maybe not that much, because we have, with our - the tax programs that we've put into effect - we have seen an increase in the percentage of personal savings of billions of dollars that over these same next few years, I think are being underestimated as to what they will contribute to the pool of capital. East-West Relations
Q. Your Government is taking a much stricter anti-Soviet line compared to other allies. And recent news reports said you are not going to meet Mr. Andropov this year. My question is, how do you plan to present this problem to the leaders at the summit.
A. Well, first of all, there seems to be a misperception that we're interested in some kind of a trade war with the Soviet Union, and we're not at all. The very fact that we have told the Soviets that we're willing to sit down and negotiate a long-term grain agreement is evidence of that.
But what we are concerned about is the Soviet expansionism, and particularly when it comes into the Western Hemisphere. There have been several Soviet vessels recently unloading weaponry in Nicaragua and for the use in the effort to overthrow the Government of Salvador. We don't look upon those as friendly acts.
But the East-West trade, I think we and our allies are in very much agreement on that. There have been constant consultations in which we have come to agreements. On the trade that we don't want to extend to the Soviet Union is high technology that can contribute to their further military buildup. And, as I say, we're in great agreement on things of that kind.
We're also - we don't believe that while they're devoting so much of their resource to this military buildup that we should engage in trade in which we, in a sense, subsidize our exports to the Soviet Union, or give them favored treatment with regard to low interest rates on long-time credit. Scope of Recovery
Q. Mr. President, the scenario for recovery is not uniform at all. The American engine is going strong; the Italian economy is not moving yet. Do you expect the recovery will benefit all our nations?
A. Yes, I think it will. I do believe that - I don't believe, I have been told by leaders of our allied states - that recovery must begin in the United States. Evidently we are that much of a factor in world commerce, and they are pleased to see it beginning here and believe that it is aiding their own recovery. For example, the United States will be importing to such an extent that we will have a $55 billion-$60 billion trade imbalance, that we will be buying that much more than we are selling, which should be of benefit to our trading allies. Seeking Coordination
Q. Less optimistic forecasts of a short recovery - do you plan to coordinate it at Williamsburg with the other leaders all the necessary measures to remove the obstacles to a strong recovery?
A. This will be one of the principal subjects, discussing how we can bring convergence of policies together, because all of us need a long-term recovery, and that is what our plan is aimed at, not the what I call quick fix that has been tried in the past, since World War II, and each time has only been temporary and results in a worse recession a few years later. And I think this means all of us doing a job together to reduce inflation worldwide.
The very fact of our success in bringing inflation down as rapidly as we have is going to be helpful in the other countries as well. And, as long as we can stay on that path, not of quick fixes, but all of us seeking long-term, solid economic recovery -sadly enough, the last thing ever to recover from a recession is in the unemployment situation. But even there, there are beginning signs. And that is the ultimate goal of all of us - is to put our people back to work. U.S. 'Responsibilities'
Q. Mr. President, you have repeatedly stated that France is your best ally, at least on defense issues. Why, then, respond with indifference or benign neglect to French and European alarm over the rise of the dollar and the interest rates? Isn't it time the United States realized they cannot pretend to political leadership of the West if they do ignore their economic responsibilities?
A. Well, we are not ignoring our economic responsibilities. We didn't ask for the strong dollar. The strong dollar came about because of our success, so far, in reducing inflation in our country in comparison to the decline in inflation in other countries.
But the figure that I just used a moment ago, the fact that we will have a $55 billion to $60 billion imbalance in trade this year, is an indication of the penalty that we suffer from a strong dollar. It makes our exports higher priced and, therefore, not as desirable. And it also is beneficial to the other countries that are selling to us. Mitterrand's Position
Q. Do you believe you are going to have a direct confrontation over these issues with President Mitterrand?
A. No. I don't really expect confrontation there. We are, pretty much, all agreed upon our participation in the international funding group such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and so forth. And I think we honestly are going to come together in effort to find ways that we can have that convergence I mentioned, where we can try to go forward together in the policies that we're following to get over inflation.

Abstract: A. The, as I've said many times before, in this case, I've said an apple can be an orange, in this case a bad apple might turn out yet to be an orange. We'll just wait and see. And I'll make up my mind on that when I see what hapens in the House. It might not get through the House. A. It just wasn't that easy. You, as I said before about a defense budget, they're talking dollars. They're looking at it and wanting to simply cut dollars. We have to look at things. What do we feel we need to meet our defense strategy worldwide? And if they want to cut money, we have to look and say, 'Where can we responsibly eliminate one of these factors or more that we think are necessary for our national security?' And so all we asked for time was to study and see. Could we cooperate with them? Could we meet some of their demands on this without setting back the progress that we've made in closing that window of vulnerability? And it's just a different way of looking at things. Up there they simply looked at the money as if you could make a percentage cut across the board and it wouldn't have any effect on your military capability. Now, all I can tell you about this is, if this is like the past ones have been, if you can't get that kind of courtroom evidence you need, then you can't make the charge of violation. But what I've said is we've learned enough since we've been here, to know that any treaties that we arrive at with regard to arms limitation or reductions with the Soviets, we're going to make sure they are not ambiguous, that the the thing, the clauses that are in there are hard and fast.

Full text: Following is a transcript of President Reagan's news conference yesterday at the White House, as recorded by The New York Times: OPENING STATEMENT
Good afternoon. I'd like to begin with a few words about the Middle East. The tragic and brutal attack on our embassy in Beirut has shocked us all and filled us with grief. Yet, because of this latest crime we are more resolved than ever to help achieve the urgent and total withdrawal of all American forces from Lebanon, or I should say, all foreign forces. I'm sorry. Mistake.
With this in mind, I've asked the Secretary of State to visit the Middle East next week. His primary purpose will be to bring to a successful conclusion the negotiations in Lebanon.
We are hopeful that an agreement between Lebanon and Israel can soon be concluded under terms which provide for the security of the borders.
I must stress that until all foreign forces are out of Lebanon, that country cannot assert its sovereignty and begin real reconstruction. These are basic goals of our Middle East policy. Outlook on Inflation
I have a second subject. Economic recovery received a big push forward in March, thanks to our continued progress against inflation. Prices rose by only onetenth of 1 percent last month and by only 3.6 percent over the last year. We've had virtually no inflation in America for the last six months. And that's welcome relief for every American family after the double-digit inflation and record interest rates of 1980. We know that zero inflation cannot last forever. Energy prices have firmed a bit in recent weeks.
Nevertheless, evidence indicates that the underlying rate of inflation has fallen below 5 percent, something the experts said couldn't be done. With inflation down, interest rates down and workers being called back, this is no time to sabotage the recovery we've worked so hard for with a quick political fix.
The battle over the budget now moves to the arena of the Senate floor, and I intend to marshal every resource of our Administration to protect the interests of the American people. We're determined to fight unfair and unwise tax increases on the people, to restore defense spending to a level that insures U.S. security and to reduce inflationary domestic spending. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Talks in Middle East
Q. Mr. President, recent public reports indicate that King Hussein apparently views the Mideast peace process as just about collapsed. Can you offer us today any concrete indications that there is still some chance to save your peace plan in the Middle East?
A. Yes. That's why George Shultz is going there. But that statement with regard to King Hussein - I've been in communication with him both by phone and by cable, and that hasn't been the position he expressed to me.
All that really happened was that the effort to persuade Arafat, as a representative of the P.L.O., to allow Jordan to represent the P.L.O. in the negotiations that will follow the removal of forces from Lebanon. He came in with an amendment to what had looked like his willingness to do this, calling for measures that Hussein could not agree to, I could not agree to, none of the other moderate Arab states could agree to. And so they told him that until and unless they came up with something different than what they had proposed - this came from the radical element of the P.L.O. -why we would, all of us, just have to go our own way.
Q. But since it seems unlikely that the P.L.O. will go along with Hussein, how can you pull it out? A. Well, maybe we're making the P.L.O. more important than they are. The negotiations don't have to hinge on the P.L.O. being present. Senate Vote on Budget
Q. Mr. President, if I can return to the last part of your opening statement, what you were referring to is the fact that the Senate Budget Committee yesterday voted against your programs on taxes, on defense and on domestic spending. How do you explain the rejection of really a total program by a Republican-controlled committee, and don't you really have to compromise more than you have so far on the budget?
A. No, the, what actually happened there was that the only way we could've been victorious in that committee was to get every one of the 12 Republican votes. Even one defector and we could not have won out. So it was simply decided to put it out on the floor and take the matter to the floor. And that's what happened.
Q. And as for compromise?
A. What?
Q. As for compromise? Aren't you going to have to compromise more on defense and taxes and domestic spending?
A. We have proposed a compromise, but certainly not to the extent that the committee turned out. Because that would be very irresponsible and it would be irresponsible on my part to not call it irresponsible. Defense and Tax Cuts
Q. Mr. President, are you willing to accept, ah, are you willing to accept that your, the third year of your tax cut might not be put in place? Or are you willing to accept a smaller increase in the defense spending than what you've proposed?
A. I believe that, well we're going to, we're going to seek an increase over the figure that came out of that committee, obviously. We have announced in the beginning that there is a willingness, we have found that we can go somewhat below the original figure that we first introduced in the budget. This has come about through the change brought about by the committee on the MX and all, on better progress in inflation, some things of that kind. So we are, there is a compromise figure on that, but it has been presented to the chairman of the committee. He knows about it.
With regard to the taxes, no, there's no way that we can give up on this third year of the tax increase. Nor can we give up on the indexing, which is strictly for the benefit of those in lower-and middle-income ranges because they're the only ones who can be shoved into higher tax brackets by cost-of-living pay increases.
Q. Mr. President, the Republican Senate voted overwhelmingly yesterday to reject the Administration's plan on withholding, to delay it for four years, which amounts to killing it. And with Senator Armstrong, we understand, who prevented the members of the budget committee - the Republican members of the budget committee - from being unanimous. What has happened to Republican unity? Why is, why are you having so much trouble with your own people in the Senate?
A. Well, this particular issue here, I thought that yesterday's vote in the Senate on the withholding was quite a triumph for the people who were not paying the taxes they fairly owe. And we'll see what happens in the other house, when it goes to the other house. But it seemed a little strange to me, in this great revved-up effort that happened, that that bill was passed without any problem or any protest by both houses of the Congress to have withholding of interest and dividend income. It is not a new tax. Went through the '82 election and it wasn't even mentioned, or was an issue or not.
And then suddenly a very successful lobbying effort went forward and the simple fact is that what was voted in the Senate was to allow people to go on cheating on their income tax rather than making them pay their fair share. Support for Programs
Q. But sir, your own strongest conservative partisans, such as Senator Kasten and Senator Armstrong, are not backing you on these important measures. My question was, what has happened to the united front that you used in '81 and '82?
A. Well, in this particular instance they went their own way. We'll see what happens on some other episodes.
Q.. Mr. President, with that overwhelming Senate vote and the likelihood of a House vote, perhaps of similar proportion, are you still planning to veto that bill in light of perhaps a veto-proof vote by the Congress?
A. The, as I've said many times before, in this case, I've said an apple can be an orange, in this case a bad apple might turn out yet to be an orange. We'll just wait and see. And I'll make up my mind on that when I see what hapens in the House. It might not get through the House.
Q. One last question. But are you predisposed at this time, because it is, they're trying to give you, as they said, wiggle room to get out of this thing because it's veto-proof, would you, in light of the overwhelming vote of both houses, if it should happen, would you veto it? Do you feel that strongly about it?
A. I feel strongly about it. That's all I'll say in advance. P.L.O. Role in Nicaragua
Q. Mr. President, you mentioned a few moments ago about the radical elements of the P.L.O. We understand that the White House now has intelligence information that not only the Libyans but also the P.L.O. have been aiding the Nicaraguan Government and the Salvadoran leftist guerrillas. Can you tell us more about what the P.L.O. is doing - I understand there's some 50 P.L.O. pilots down there -and what you're going to do about it?
A. I can tell you that the report is true. They, like others from the Communist states, have been in there, and are in there. And the episode with the Brazilian halting of the planes from Libya the other day, when the aspirin they were supposed to be carrying turned out to be hand grenades and things, is just further evidence of what we've said all the time - that there are outside forces, all of them principally aligned with or sympathetic to the Communist bloc, who are in there and intervening in the legitimate affairs of those countries.
Q. But if the P.L.O. is doing this, should we be dealing with them or trying to bring them into the peace process?
A. The, there has to be a solution to the problem of the Palestinians. Now, no one ever elected the P.L.O. among the Palestinians. I don't think that what an element of that group is doing should turn us away from trying to find a solution to the problem of hundreds of thousands, millions in fact, of Palestinians, who aren't radicals and who simply want something of a homeland. Vote on Arms Spending
Q. Back on the defense budget, if I might. Do you, you asked Senator Domenici to postpone his, his markup for three weeks and I'm wondering if you feel, in retrospect, that if you and your advisers had gone to the Senators in that period of time, you might now be in a different position, that you might not have been able to get the, the cooperation in those 12 votes you need?
A. It just wasn't that easy. You, as I said before about a defense budget, they're talking dollars. They're looking at it and wanting to simply cut dollars. We have to look at things. What do we feel we need to meet our defense strategy worldwide? And if they want to cut money, we have to look and say, 'Where can we responsibly eliminate one of these factors or more that we think are necessary for our national security?' And so all we asked for time was to study and see. Could we cooperate with them? Could we meet some of their demands on this without setting back the progress that we've made in closing that window of vulnerability? And it's just a different way of looking at things. Up there they simply looked at the money as if you could make a percentage cut across the board and it wouldn't have any effect on your military capability.
Q. Do you still think you're going to be able to put it back together again on the floor to get the defense budget somewhere near what you think it should be?
A. Yeah.
Q. Mr. President
A. Wait a minute. I've got to go back farther. I'm staying down front here too long. Arms Treaty Violations
Q. Mr. President, are you going to be speaking out publicly soon about alleged Soviet violations of current treaties? And if the United States does believe that the Soviets are now violating treaties we have with them, does that make it very difficult to reach agreement on any new treaties?
A. No, but it imposes a responsibility on us to be more careful in a new treaty than we've been in the past. Whether I'll be speaking out or not depends on a study that is going on right now on the most recent testing of a missile.
There have been evidences in the past when we have had indications that we thought possibly meant a violation of previous agreements. Unfortunately, those previous treatments, ah, treaties, are so ambiguous that it amounts to loopholes. And when, as in this most recent case, we feel that there is possible evidence that there was a violation, an interagency task force of experts reviews all the findings that we have. And then they report to my own advisers and then to the National Security Council, all of them looking at this. If there is then further evidence that we believe can be obtained from the Soviet Union, and asking them directly the answer to some questions, that enters into it. And that's all before it gets to me.
And the problem is trying, it is so ambiguous that it is difficult to establish, and have hard and fast evidence, that a treaty has been violated. This most recent case, for example, is one in which the Soviet Union says that they were testing an improved version of a missile that is already proper under the treaty. The evidence that we thought we had indicated that very possibly this was a new missile, which would be in violation.
Now, all I can tell you about this is, if this is like the past ones have been, if you can't get that kind of courtroom evidence you need, then you can't make the charge of violation. But what I've said is we've learned enough since we've been here, to know that any treaties that we arrive at with regard to arms limitation or reductions with the Soviets, we're going to make sure they are not ambiguous, that the the thing, the clauses that are in there are hard and fast.
Q. Are you concerned if you do speak out about possible violations, that this will set back the effort to, for our negotiations with the Soviets?
A. No. No. Not really, no.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
A. Well, I still never got beyond the third row.
A. Drop by whenever you're in the neighborhood.
A. All right. I will. I will. O.K. Thank you.

Abstract: In the United States, long-term Government bonds offered an average yield of 10.58 percent in February, according to Morgan Guaranty's World Finance Markets newsletter, although consumer prices were rising at an annual rate of only 3.5 percent. This gave such bonds what economists call a ''real'' rate of return, calculated by substracting inflation from the yield, of nearly 7 percent, or close to the peak yields recorded in 1982, when inflation was stronger. ''High real rates show people don't believe the present disinflation will continue for the next five years,'' said Paul Nield, chief economist at the London stock brokerage firm of Phillips & Drew. The new inflation figures point up another paradox about the present state of the industrial economies. Although many economists fear persistent high real interest rates could abort the emerging recovery in the United States, Japan and West Germany, stock markets everywhere are booming, suggesting that investors believe corporate profits are now firmly back on an upward track. ''The only explanation is that high real rates will not be such a deterrent to growth as we once thought,'' Mr. Nield argued. Decline Accelerating

Full text: The rate of inflation in the non-Communist industrial world has fallen to its lowest level in 10 years, pushed down by a global recession that has left more than 30 million people unemployed, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported today.
Consumer prices in the 24 industrial member countries climbed by only two-tenths of 1 percent, on average, during February following a rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in January, the organization said in its latest monthly inflation survey.
As a result, the average inflation rate over the 12 months through February dropped to 5.7 percent, compared with 5.9 percent in the 12 months ended last January. These are the first inflation figures at an annual rate below 6 percent since February 1973, the organization said.
High Interest Rates Cited
However, the economic picture is not wholly favorable, some economists noted. In addition to the problem of high unemployment, interest rates remain obstinately high in the United States and most other major industrial countries.
In the United States, long-term Government bonds offered an average yield of 10.58 percent in February, according to Morgan Guaranty's World Finance Markets newsletter, although consumer prices were rising at an annual rate of only 3.5 percent. This gave such bonds what economists call a ''real'' rate of return, calculated by substracting inflation from the yield, of nearly 7 percent, or close to the peak yields recorded in 1982, when inflation was stronger.
''High real rates show people don't believe the present disinflation will continue for the next five years,'' said Paul Nield, chief economist at the London stock brokerage firm of Phillips & Drew.
The new inflation figures point up another paradox about the present state of the industrial economies. Although many economists fear persistent high real interest rates could abort the emerging recovery in the United States, Japan and West Germany, stock markets everywhere are booming, suggesting that investors believe corporate profits are now firmly back on an upward track. ''The only explanation is that high real rates will not be such a deterrent to growth as we once thought,'' Mr. Nield argued. Decline Accelerating
The new O.E.C.D. figures show that the decline in inflation is accelerating. While the annual rate during the 12 months through February was down to 5.7 percent, compared with an average of 7.8 percent during the 1982 calendar year and 10.5 percent in 1981, the rate during the six-month period through February was only 2 percent.
Staff economists at the O.E.C.D. said that slowing world inflation was aided in February by the second consecutive monthly fall in retail energy prices and by the general weakness of other commodity and food prices, brought about by the global recession. As a result, the average rate of inflation in the industrial nations has now tumbled to under half the record level of 12.8 percent it reached during 1980.
The fall in the inflation rate is most striking in the seven major O.E.C.D. countries - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. During the 12 months through February, it was down to 4.8 percent in these countries, compared with 7.1 percent during 1982. But the rate during the six-month period through February was a mere 1.3 percent, or 2.6 percent on an annualized basis, which is below the average inflation rate these countries experienced between 1961 and 1970.
However, not all countries have made equal progress in the fight against inflation, the new figures show. In February, consumer prices were still climbing at an annual rate of 12 percent in Ireland, 13.4 percent in Spain, 16.1 percent in Italy, 18.8 percent in Ireland and 21.3 percent in Greece. Iceland, as usual, held the O.E.C.D. inflation record with a rate of 68.1 percent, while Turkey's was 29.6 percent.

HOW FAR YOUR DOLLAR CAN GO

Abstract: Now, the low rates of American inflation, combined with the continuing high rates of interest paid to holders of dollars, are attracting currency buyers back to the dollar. And they've been selling other currencies, notably the French franc. Dollars cost more -are ''worth'' more - because they're in demand; francs cost less because they're not. An orchestra seat for Agatha Christie's ''The Mousetrap,'' London's longest-running play, would have cost 1.75 pounds in 1972. It was up to 6.50 pounds in 1980 and 1981, and was up again to 7.50 pounds in 1983. Every month, the State Department publishes per diem allowances for cities all over the world. They're based on the cost of lodging, food and miscellaneous expenses for one person at ''adequate, suitable and moderately priced facilities.'' The numbers don't necessarily correspond to what you'll actually spend, but taken together, they're a fairly good index of where you can travel cheaply, and where you can't.

Full text: The dollar is king again, and traveling to Europe is cheaper than it ever was, right? Not exactly. In fact, if your memory goes back to the time before Jimmy Carter's inauguration or to the Watergate period, not at all. Had you gone to Paris in 1972, you could have rented a single room at the Ritz for about $42, had the Tour d'Argent's duck for just under $12, and enjoyed a cup of coffee at the Cafe de la Paix for 69 cents.
If you were on a tight budget then, you might have stayed at the Hotel Henri IV for $2.78 a night and had a burger-fries-and-Coke dinner at McDonald's for $2.08.
The great inflation spurred by the oil crisis has wiped out such bargains - and in many European countries that inflation was greater than in the United States. The same room at the Ritz would now cost $151, the duck $24 and the coffee more than $1. Even the bargain tour has gone up: You would now pay about $7.15 at the Henri IV, and $2.63 for McDinner.
But while the stronger dollar can't wipe out all the effects of inflation, it helps. If things aren't as good for American tourists as they were in 1972, they are much better than they were three years ago.
Go back to 1980, when the dollar was being battered on currency markets all over the world. Even though the cost of the room at the Ritz has almost doubled since 1980 when calculated in French francs, its actual cost to an American has gone up by a grand total of $5.
And - again, thinking in dollars - the price of the room at the Henri IV, the duck or McDonald's meal has actually gone down. In 1980, the Henri IV room would have cost $1 more, the duck almost $6 more, and the meal at McDonald's 58 cents more. Even the cup of coffee was 30 cents more then.
It's not magic; it's the strange sort of economics that has governed the world for the last decade. Of course, a dollar won't buy what it used to buy, even for Americans within the United States, but it really is stronger than it has been in a long time. Still, that can't make up for the waves of inflation that affected almost everyone in the 1970's.
How does it work? Tomes have been written on this subject, but from the traveler's point of view there are two things that count: How much local currency does your dollar buy, and then how much can the local currency you just purchased bring in meals, hotel rooms, postcards or whatever?
The value of the dollar is set essentially by the world's currency traders and - to a lesser degree - by currency agreements among countries. Currency traders are looking for the best deal. When inflation was especially high in the United States, the currency market didn't have much confidence in the dollar and exchanged it for other currencies, notably the German mark, the Japanese yen or the Swiss franc. These currencies promised to be worth more over time than the dollar.
Now, the low rates of American inflation, combined with the continuing high rates of interest paid to holders of dollars, are attracting currency buyers back to the dollar. And they've been selling other currencies, notably the French franc. Dollars cost more -are ''worth'' more - because they're in demand; francs cost less because they're not.
In 1980, a hundred American dollars could buy 423 French francs or about 43 British pounds. Today, those hundred dollars would buy 725 francs or 68 pounds - if you had a way of getting them at the official exchange rates. In fact, most tourists are condemned to getting inferior rates and paying bank charges, so those 725 francs per hundred dollars come out closer to 700 or 710.
All other things being equal, that means you could walk into a flea market in the Paris suburbs with almost twice as much money in your pocket.
But all other things are seldom equal. In the same period that the dollar's value went up, so did prices. Given the inflation rate, something that costs 725 francs today - say, an expensive meal for two - would have cost only about 500 francs in 1980.
Thus, your hundred dollars still buy more today than in 1980, but not quite as much as you might have hoped. Taking prices into account, today's dollar can buy, very roughly, about a fifth more in French goods than it did in 1980. What it comes down to is that the increased value of the dollar abroad allows you to wipe out the effect of inflation - something you can't do at home - and then save a little more over that.
This also explains why things are still far more expensive than they were in 1972. The increase in the value of the dollar in francs is big enough to make up for the last three years of inflation, but not for the last 11.
There are other factors to take into account. For one thing, not all prices go up at the same time, or at the same speed. Since 1980, for example, the cost of the room at the Ritz has gone up $5, because the dollar's value didn't go up fast enough to wipe out the price increases that hotel has levied over the years. But the cost of getting a shirt done by the Ritz's laundry service has gone down, from $4.50 in 1980 to $3.45 now. Laundry prices - at least at the Ritz - went up slower than room rates.
By this standard, one of the great bargains is sauerkraut at Paris's Lipp bistro, where many of France's most important people get together. The price of sauerkraut there has gone down from $9.45 in 1980 to $7.85 today. That's true for an American thinking in dollars; for France's elite, paying in francs, the actual price has gone up, from 40 francs to 57 francs.
The other factor you have to take into account is that prices have gone up much faster in some places than in others and the dollar, while generally strong these days, is not equally strong against every currency.
In France and Britain, for example, the dollar is at its highest point in decades; in Britain, it has never been worth more. But in other places, notably Germany and Switzerland, the dollar - though worth more now than it was a few years ago - is far less valuable than it was a decade or two ago.
To take the happy example first: Everyone raves about the wonderful bargain London theater is compared to Broadway. It used to be, and then prices went through the ceiling, but thanks to the dollar, it's a pretty good deal again.
An orchestra seat for Agatha Christie's ''The Mousetrap,'' London's longest-running play, would have cost 1.75 pounds in 1972. It was up to 6.50 pounds in 1980 and 1981, and was up again to 7.50 pounds in 1983.
But the pound is now at its lowest level in history compared to the dollar. A pound cost $2.50 in 1972; it had dropped to $2.32 by 1980 and now stands at about $1.46. So, the ''Mousetrap'' ticket that went from about $4.35 in 1972 and $15 in 1980, is down to just under $12 now.
In Germany, on the other hand, the long-term trend is not nearly as good. In 1972, a dollar bought 3.19 marks. By 1980, the value of the dollar had fallen to 1.82; it's now back up again, but has recovered only part of the loss, and now stands at about 2.42 marks to the dollar.
What does this mean in what you pay? At the Hotel Drei Loewen in Munich, a double room facing the courtyard (with breakfast) cost 79 marks in 1972, 136 marks in 1980 and 166 marks now. With the decline in the dollar, this meant that, for an American, the price of the room tripled between 1972 and 1980, going from just under $25 to just under $75. The improvement in the dollar has brought the price down to $68 - still a long way from 1972.
The story is similar in Switzerland. The dollar is now worth substantially more than it was in 1979 and 1980, but it still buys less than half the Swiss francs it did in 1970 or 1971. In those days, you could get more than four Swiss francs to the dollar; now, even with the recent improvements, you get just over two.
Then there are the countries in Southern Europe that have been the traditional bargain spots for tourists: Spain, Portugal and Greece in particular. In fact, the dollar buys more than three times as many Portuguese escudos now as it did in 1972; two-and-a-half times as many Greek drachmas, and more than twice as many Spanish pesetas.
But such changes don't happen by accident. One of the reasons for the big increase in the dollar's value is that inflation ran in the high teens or twenties in all three places for most of the last decade. Even taking all that into account, though, these countries are still a good deal for tourists.
And so, the ultimate question: If your budget is tight, and you want to go somewhere relatively inexpensive, where do you go?
There is no definitive answer to a question like that - you may despise mountains, or the shore. Or you may want to go to Scandinavia, no matter how much it costs. But if you're willing to look for bargains, you can find help from the United States State Department.
Every month, the State Department publishes per diem allowances for cities all over the world. They're based on the cost of lodging, food and miscellaneous expenses for one person at ''adequate, suitable and moderately priced facilities.'' The numbers don't necessarily correspond to what you'll actually spend, but taken together, they're a fairly good index of where you can travel cheaply, and where you can't.
In Europe, Greece remains one of the best deals available. The per diem allowance in Athens for last January was only $48. That was down $11 from last year - a clear indication of the dollar's new strength - and up only $7 from six years ago. Lisbon at $64 a day is also a relative bargain, and Madrid at $71 is not terribly expensive either.
At the upper end of the scale, Ireland has become vastly more expensive over the years - $124 a day is the allowance there -as has Israel at $100 a day.
The Scandinavian countries are also very expensive. But there's been a substantial improvement for dollar holders over the last couple of years. Oslo, according to the State Department, is now about 12 percent cheaper for travelers who spend dollars than it was last year, and Stockholm is somewhat less expensive. But these things are relative: Sweden and Norway are still two of the most costly places in Europe. Among the Scandinavian countries, the State Department figures suggest that Denmark is the bargain.
The figures show that Britain, France and Italy - the more popular tourist countries -are in the middle price ranges. Britain and France are, generally speaking, as inexpensive as they've ever been in the last five years, but, as we have seen, still more expensive than they were before that. The same, roughly speaking, is true in Italy, though in Venice, a favorite tourist stop, prices continue to climb. Germany continues to be quite expensive.
Note, too, that it is often a lot cheaper to travel the hinterlands. Edinburgh, one of Great Britain's most beautiful cities, is about $21 cheaper a day than London. Siena, a pretty and peaceful Italian town, is less expensive than Rome and Venice.
As for Eastern Europe, it's hard to say anything definitive because the official exchange rates often bear no relation to what currency trades for in the much-trafficked black markets.
Having said all of this, what can you do to make your dollar go farther? Generally speaking, unless you plan to spend tens of thousands of dollars, you should not become obsessed with exchange rates. Banks usually offer better deals than hotels, some banks are better than others, and the places that are open over the weekends often take advantage of your urgent need for cash by giving you a bad rate.
But don't waste hours to try to save $2 on a $500 exchange. Exchange rates are usually posted in the windows of banks and you can get a good sense quite quickly of what constitutes a fair rate. Travelers checks usually bring a premium. And don't change such small amounts of money that you keep having to go back to the bank and pay a lot of unnecessary charges.
Can you make money on currency speculation? You are, after all, buying and selling money just like the traders. Don't expect to make much - most of your gains would be wiped out by the bank charges anyway - but it doesn't hurt to keep an eye on the newspapers.
Last month, France devalued its currency 2.5 percent, and Germany upgraded its currency by 5.5 percent. That meant that a mark suddenly bought 8 percent more francs than it did before. If you were traveling from Germany to France and had a lot of marks left over, you could have saved a small bundle by holding on to your marks for a few days. But such situations are rare.
Finally, How long will the strong dollar last? Those who play the currency markets pay a lot of money trying to figure out precise answers to such questions. There is much talk now that the dollar is overvalued and that it could drop back. That would change many of the numbers and, depending on which other currencies rose and fell, almost all of the calculations could go out the window. On the other hand, few people think the dollar is in for anything like the beating it took in the late 1970's.
Among the uncertainties facing travelers going abroad is what to do about money. As you plan your trip, it is worth examining the alternatives. For guidance, ask a travel agent, a major bank or foreign-exchange dealer, an international airline that flies where you are going or perhaps the appropriate government tourist offices in New York. To find them, ask your agent or check the Manhattan Consumer Yellow Pages under ''Tourist Information.''
Cash - Carrying large amounts of money is always risky. For a twoweek trip, I generally carry about $50 in United States currency, mostly in one- and five-dollar bills. I use this for such incidentals as porter tips upon leaving and returning to the United States, buying drinks on a plane or to help pay a local departure tax or unexpected airport expenses.
Foreign-exchange dealers in the United States often encourage travelers to buy enough foreign currency to pay for tips and transportation to town from the airport of arrival, or to cover them for weekend arrivals. These days, however, most major foreign airports have foreign-exchange kiosks (often run by local banks) that are open for all flights from abroad, regardless of day or time, and that will give you as good a conversion rate as anywhere.
Major banks or foreign-exchange dealers in the United States will sometimes offer foreign currencies at far better than the official rate in the issuing country. Before you plunge, however, be sure that it is legal to take that money into the country. Even if it is legal, there may be an officially recognized unofficial rate within the country that is better.
Traveler's Checks - If lost or stolen, they can be replaced (although not always as easily as advertised) providing you have a record of the serial numbers of those you have not spent. Their principal disadvantage is that you must pay for them up front, which means that the company is getting interest on your money until you use the checks. Some companies, notably American Express and Thomas Cook, market traveler's checks in the United States in a number of major foreign currencies. So consider buying traveler's checks in French francs, for example, if you plan an extended stay in France: They will usually be easier to use than dollars. But be aware that if the franc falls in value - as happened when France recently devalued it - your franc traveler's checks will suddenly be worth substantially less than when you bought them.
Changing Money Abroad - You generally get the best rate at banks, except where, as in Brazil and the Dominican Republic, there is an unofficial rate at which you can trade legally elsewhere, such as in hotels and shops. But always avoid money-changers who approach you furtively in building lobbies or on the street. Keep invoices covering all exchanges at official rates; you may need them to change money back into dollars when you leave the country.
Credit Cards - Their principal advantage - and it is a big one - is that your money can keep drawing interest in your bank until you are billed by the card company, which may be several months after you charged something abroad. However, different companies use different methods of converting foreign charges into dollars, and the benefit or disadvantage to you can vary according to the rates on the day of conversion.
If you plan to use a credit card heavily, make sure that it is readily acceptable where you are going. Be aware, also, that while you usually have 30 interest-free days to pay bills for purchases, interest begins accruing on the very day you use a credit card for a cash advance. Also, since credit-card conversions are usually at the official exchange rate, you will do much better in Brazil and the Dominican Republic, for example, to use cash or traveler's checks.Paul Grimes

So consider buying traveler's checks in French francs, for example, if you plan an extended stay in France: They will usually be easier to use than dollars. But be aware that if the franc falls in value - as happened when France recently devalued it - your franc traveler's checks will suddenly be worth substantially less than when you bought them. Changing Money Abroad You generally get the best rate at banks, except where, as in Brazil and the Dominican Republic, there is an unofficial rate at which you can trade legally elsewhere, such as in hotels and shops. But always avoid money-changers who approach you furtively in building lobbies or on the street. Keep invoices covering all exchanges at official rates; you may need them to change money back into dollars when you leave the country. Credit Cards Their principal advantage -and it is a big one - is that your money can keep drawing interest in your bank until you are billed by the card company, which may be several months after you charged something abroad. However, different companies use different methods of converting foreign charges into dollars, and the benefit or disadvantage to you can vary according to the rates on the day of conversion.
If you plan to use a credit card heavily, make sure that it is readily acceptable where you are going. Be aware, also, that while you usually have 30 interest-free days to pay bills for purchases, interest begins accruing on the very day you use a credit card for a cash advance. Also, since credit-card conversions are usually at the official exchange rate, you will do much better in Brazil and the Dominican Republic, for example, to use cash or traveler's checks.

Abstract: According to the sources, Mr. [Donald T. Regan] was furious - not at Mr. de Larosiere but at Mr. [Beryl Sprinkel]. The Under Secretary was ''speaking for himself,'' Mr. Regan told aides to say. Mr. Regan also told them to stress that there had been no change in policy. Mr. Regan declined to respond today to questions about the possible existence of rifts in the Treasury, but pointedly stated at a news conference that it was necessary to achieve world growth ''in a more stable fashion,'' without ''massive doses of inflation.'' ''Speaking for the United States,'' Mr. Regan added, ''we would not want to return to above 5 and 6 percent inflation.'' That rate is about the current annual rate of price increases in the United States.

Full text: The first that Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan knew about the comments of his errant Under Secretary was early Monday, when Jacques de Larosiere, the managing director of the 146-nation International Monetary Fund, telephoned from Paris.
Mr. de Larosiere wanted to know whether the remarks of Beryl Sprinkel, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, signified a major change in American policy - from one of emphasis on controlling inflation to one that gave priority to economic growth, even if such a policy ignited inflationary forces again.
Mr. Sprinkel made his comments at a news conference in Paris on Sunday. Official sources here, who declined to be identified, recounted the story, which sheds some light on relationships in high places in the Treasury at a time of policy ferment in the Reagan Administration.
According to the sources, Mr. Regan was furious - not at Mr. de Larosiere but at Mr. Sprinkel. The Under Secretary was ''speaking for himself,'' Mr. Regan told aides to say. Mr. Regan also told them to stress that there had been no change in policy.
The Treasury chief was miffed because he was about to get on a plane himself - and go without sleep that night in the process - to lead the American delegation in Paris at a meeting of finance ministers from the 10 largest industrial nations. The Secretary saw it as his job, not Mr. Sprinkel's, to speak for the United States.
Mr. Sprinkel, the sources said, had not informed the Treasury Department's press office that he was meeting with reporters. The sources added that Mr. Regan was much more distressed, however, over the misunderstanding that apparently had been caused by the Under Secretary's remarks.
The question raised by Mr. de Larosiere, and apparently others in Europe, was whether the United States was now about to initiate a much more expansionary set of policies domestically and press other nations on a similar course.
If this were true, it would require a new global economic strategy, one that the officials of the 10 industrial nations, gathered in Paris Monday and Tuesday, were unprepared to address. The meeting was called mainly to negotiate a substantial increase in the lendable resources of the International Monetary Fund, so that the I.M.F. would be better able to help developing nations deeply in debt. Mr. Sprin-kel had warned that attempts to solve the international debt crisis will fail unless other Western nations and Japan joined the United States in adopting policies to stimulate their economies out of recession. The emphasis that he put on getting faster growth suggested to some people that the Treasury Department was putting its top priority on growth, rather than on the fight against inflation.
Mr. Regan declined to respond today to questions about the possible existence of rifts in the Treasury, but pointedly stated at a news conference that it was necessary to achieve world growth ''in a more stable fashion,'' without ''massive doses of inflation.''
''Speaking for the United States,'' Mr. Regan added, ''we would not want to return to above 5 and 6 percent inflation.'' That rate is about the current annual rate of price increases in the United States.

Abstract: Mr. [Dan Rostenkowski] had a talk with Vice President [George Bush], an old friend. ''I told him, 'George, if you want a vote on the floor on the third year, I'll give it to you,' '' the Congressman recalls today. In other words, he would not use parliamentary tactics to prevent the House from voting on the three-year tax cut. ''But I said, 'Let's stay out of oil and gas and the estate and gift taxes. Because if it gets to be a bidding war, George, I'll bid.' '' In fact, the President apparently remained personally aloof from the day-to-day details of the process even as he insisted that his overall principles could not be compromised. At one meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House between a group of Presidential aides and a collection of Congressmen of both parties, Secretary [Donald T. Regan] beckoned the President to sit down and join the horse-trading - votes for tax breaks. ''Heck, no,'' the President replied. ''I'm going to leave this to you experts.'' The Power of an Image On the evening of Feb. 5, 1981, seated at his desk in the Oval Office, [Ronald Reagan] delivered his maiden television address as President and offered a fresh pitch for his program of tax cuts. ''Over the past decades,'' he said, ''we've talked of curtailing Government spending so that we can then lower the tax burden. Sometimes we've even taken a run at doing that. But there were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know we can lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and breath. Or we can cure their extravagance simply by reducing their allowance.'' In December and January, the White House staff launched yet another ''offensive'' - a proposal to raise perhaps $45 billion in new taxes in 1983-85. Newspapers came to be filled with items about these plans. Finally, at a staff economic meeting in the Cabinet Room, Mr. Reagan began the session by announcing, ''You know, everybody in the press says that you guys have a conspiracy to talk me into a tax increase.'' By the time the session was over, Mr. Reagan found himself declaring: ''By God, they're right!'' There were still many people close to Mr. Reagan who felt that the supply-side tax cuts had not been given time to have their energizing effect, and, not surprisingly, Representative [Jack F. Kemp] was in that group. He led a counteroffensive that convinced the President to reject his aides' advice.

Full text: It was like a rerun from the 1980 Reagan campaign: The tall, athletic figure standing beside a huge cargo vessel, face wreathed in a characteristic lopsided grin as he placed a hard hat on his head and waved to a crowd of longshoremen. ''America's economy is ready to lead the world out of recession and into recovery,'' he declared as the workers cheered.
But President Reagan on the campaign stump in the port of Long Beach, Calif., earlier this month was, in fact, very different from Candidate Reagan of two years ago. Back then, he joyously lashed President Carter and the Democrats for causing the nation's economic stagnation. Now, with the economy still floundering, Mr. Reagan finds his own policies under attack. The very day of his appearance at the shipyard, the Labor Department reported that unemployment had reached 10.1 percent, the highest level since the Great Depression. Republican Congressmen fear that the economic malaise will drag them down to a crushing defeat in the election next month, threatening the future viability of the Reagan Administration itself.
No economist lays the entire blame for the current recession at the doorstep of Reaganomics. But judged on its own terms, Mr. Reagan's allegedly painless means to economic recovery has failed to deliver on its promise of simultaneous low inflation, robust growth and a balanced budget.
How could the nation have gone from hope to gloom in less than two years? It is a critical question as the 1982 election approaches. Yet there is another, possibly more significant question to be asked: How could Mr. Reagan's economic plan have been enacted in the first place? For it was a program that lacked any sort of traditional constituency in Congress or in the Government, a program whose premises were challenged by conservative and liberal economists alike and that was widely characterized as a risky gamble with the nation's future.
This question hovers over much of the current debate about Reaganomics, just as it hovered, unasked, over a somber meeting in the White House just two months ago. There, as the sun streamed in through the French doors of the Cabinet room, a combative President was pressing 25 Republican Congressmen to support a measure he himself would have ridiculed earlier, a $98 billion tax increase. Many in the room opposed the measure, including Representative Jack F. Kemp of suburban Buffalo, an early advocate of the so-called ''supply-side'' theory that deep tax cuts by themselves would spur economic recovery.
The room fell silent as Paul Laxalt, the rangy, silver-haired Senator from Nevada, spoke up. Mr. Reagan's closest friend on Capitol Hill, Mr. Laxalt not surprisingly supported the President in seeking the tax in-Page 28 crease. But it was a poignant moment. The three-year tax cut, which had been at the heart of Mr. Reagan's economic program, and which had been enacted amid such promise the previous summer, had been a mistake, Mr. Laxalt said, and now it was time to take corrective action. After all, he reminded listeners, it wasn't as if they had all been true believers in supply-side economics. ''If there had been a secret ballot in the Senate last year,'' he said, ''there wouldn't have been more than 12 votes for the tax cut.''
The Senator's astonishing statement passed without comment at the Cabinet Room, even from Mr. Reagan. But viewed in the light of the past year, given the staggering political and economic impact, now and for the future, of the biggest tax cut in the nation's history, his words are worth pondering. Given all those misgivings about the program, how could it have happened?
Recently, in dozens of interviews with The New York Times, central figures in the Administration and Congress have explored that question. Their observations - offered on the condition that the sources not be identified - shed new light on the first six months of the Reagan Presidency, on the personal and institutional forces that combined to produce a remarkable episode in modern American history.
Some Republicans in Congress and members of the President's own team set aside their reservations out of loyalty and, in some instances, because they were not sure they were right. Others hoped that the system of checks and balances would lead to a compromise. But there were also Congressmen who yielded because of Administration promises, which were not kept, and newcomers to Republican leadership posts who didn't want to rock the boat. There were miscalculations by Senators about the House, by Reagan staffers about the power of the Pentagon and by almost everybody about the difficulty of cutting the Federal budget.
The most dramatic revelation, however, concerns those White House aides who, one by one, as the economic news worsened, began to fear that the tax-cut program would not work - and failed to alert the President. David A. Stockman, the budget director who told of his early doubts about the program in a magazine article, was but one among many. After the law was passed, Mr. Reagan's men set about a series of sometimes desperate efforts to undo what had been done. And running through all the comments of those interviewed was the image of a charming, insistent President - politically skilled, ideologically stubborn, a man who defied the odds and bent the public and the Government to his will. Riding Two Horses Economically speaking, Ronald Reagan rode two horses to victory in the election of 1980, and they corresponded to the two chief problems he promised to solve. The large tax cuts, as espoused by the supplysiders, were designed to energize the economy. The reining in of the nation's money supply, as called for by the monetarists and endorsed by Mr. Reagan, was aimed at controlling inflation. In the first six months of 1981, those two horses went dashing off in different directions. At first, those in charge seemed not to recognize the crisis in the making; then, as some now admit, they fell prey to self-deception and political expediency. One of the first orders of business for any new Administration is to produce a projection of the economic future. Within days of the Inauguration, the optimistic supply-siders at the Treasury Department were ready, predicting an economic growth of more than 5 percent for each of the next two years - compared with 3.2 percent growth in 1979 and a small decline in 1980. Meanwhile, the monetarists in the Administration were sure their tight-money policy would bring inflation down from its double-digit levels of 1980 to 7 percent in 1982 and even 2 percent by 1984. (When Murray Weidenbaum, then chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, was presented the 2 percent figure on a working paper, he refused to sign his name to it.)
Before they became official, the predictions were leaked to the press, which carried articles about the Administration's ''rosy scenario.'' Some quick, minor adjustments in the figures were made. The incident was an early demonstration of the White House's diverging policies.
What was most significant about the statistics was the way they ignored economic realities. There had been a surge in the money supply toward the end of 1980, with inflation still raging out of control; in the first months of '81 the economy showed signs of improvement. Under the leadership of Paul A. Volcker, and with the blessing of the new Administration, the Federal Reserve Board was moving in traditional monetarist fashion to restrict the quantity of money flowing through the nation's economic system. Inflation was the chief enemy, and the Fed seemed ready to do battle, even if the price of victory was a minor recession.
Given the Administration's expectation that the Volcker campaign would succeed, the likelihood of a spurt in economic growth was virtually nil. How could the Administration have ended up with an official projection that still called for a growth rate of 4.2 percent in 1982 and 5 percent in 1983?
''We took a given high level of growth, and the lowest level of inflation we thought we could get away with,'' a White House official now admits, ''and we added the two together. The issue didn't get settled. It just got added up.'' In order to justify the tax-cut program to which the President and his Administration were committed, the economic experts failed to see - or, seeing, decided to ignore - the program's all-but-inevitable impact on the economy. Page 29 As the first months of the Administration passed, the restrictive policies of the Fed started to take hold, with the supply of money actually falling below some of the Fed's own targets. The bond markets were watching. They knew that a sudden drop in the money supply would restrict the pool of funds available for borrowing, and they were convinced that the proposed three-year tax cut would produce giant budget deficits. That meant the Federal Government would be forced to compete with the private sector in the already tight money marketplace, and the cost of borrowing would soar.
In April and May, the markets moved to beat the clock, finally pushing the prime rate for borrowing up to more than 20 percent. That rate made it prohibitively expensive for corporations to borrow to finance expansion or for individual citizens to borrow to buy automobiles or homes. The chances that a rush of new investment would rejuvenate the economy were clearly in jeopardy.
At the White House, the dangers of the soaring interest rate had become apparent to a handful of economic aides. Mr. Stockman began prodding the Cabinet for more budget cuts to reduce the Federal deficit. He and other aides finally won Mr. Reagan's approval of a package of reductions in Social Security benefits. But after the package was made public, it was resoundingly rejected by Congress and then disavowed by the President himself.
Meanwhile, as the bond-market interest rates were reaching historic highs, Mr. Reagan and some of his West Coast entrepreneurial colleagues seemed baffled and angry. ''I have never found Wall Street a source of good economic advice,'' Mr. Reagan commented.
In July, the recession that had always been a probable result of the Fed's tight-money policy began, and along with it came a reduction in Federal tax revenues. Suddenly, what had been a budgetdeficit problem was a budget-deficit crisis.
As the economy went into its nose dive, Secretary of the Treasury Donald T. Regan publicly questioned the wisdom of the Federal Reserve Board's tight-money actions; perhaps Chairman Volcker had overdone things, he said. Yet it was an awkward position to take. From the start, Mr. Volcker had the President's blessing for his tight-money policy, and the Fed chairman had frequently made clear his conviction that the Administration should do its part in combatting inflation by curbing the deficit. This the President had failed to do. Mr. Volcker told an associate that he found Secretary Regan's criticism ''astounding.''
Today, economists have other questions. They wonder how the Administration could have dreamed that a tight-money, monetarist policy would be compatible with the giant, supply-side tax cut. And some wonder how, after interest rates topped 20 percent in May, the Congress could have gone on to vote for the tax-cut measure.
The President's Men Ronald Reagan's unwavering personal faith in the economic theories of the supply-siders plus his superb capacity to frame and present those theories to the American public and Congress thrust his untried tax-cut program toward enactment in 1981. But Mr. Reagan and his program benefited as well from the services of a brilliant, dedicated - and unquestioning - staff.
In most Administrations, there comes a time when advisers prevail, when the weight of their arguments and their unanimity persuade a President to alter his course. Jimmy Carter, for example, promised during his election campaign to undertake a vast governmental reorganization in the interest of efficiency, abolishing several Federal agencies along the way. After the election, his aides convinced him to drop the plan.
Mr. Reagan also campaigned with the promise of making a sweeping economic change if elected, and during of the first six months of 1981, his aides also harbored ever greater doubts about the wisdom of actually pursuing their boss's plan. But interviews with White House officials and aides show that the President was basically not informed of their reservations until after his program was enacted in July. Loyalty, uncertainty, timidity, miscalculation, expedience and general weariness combined to bring about their silence.
The doubts about Reaganomics among Mr. Reagan's staff actually had their seeds in the 1980 Presidential campaign when he became the first nationally recognized Republican to campaign for the threeyear, 30 percent supply-side tax cut. It had an appealing premise - the tax cuts would quickly spur such an increase in investment and thus in economic growth that the Government would soon be raking in more tax revenues than had been cut in the first place.
But during the primaries, Mr. Reagan's opponents ridiculed the scheme. George Bush called it ''voodoo economics.'' Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois said that the only way Mr. Reagan was going to fulfill his promises to cut taxes, balance the budget and increase defense spending was with mirrors. And economists of both parties, including some who were to join Mr. Reagan's staff, expressed strong reservations.
In September 1980, the decision was made to confront the doubters, and a major speech was scheduled for Sept. 9 in Chicago. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford, was asked to work with Martin Anderson, a Stanford University economist who was a longtime Reagan adviser, to patch together a more credible program. It was known within the staff as the ''mirrors'' speech.
For the first time, in that address, Mr. Reagan modified his supply-side stance and promised to cut spending as well as taxes. No spending cuts were specified, though, and in the following months many Republicans remained skeptical. A few, like former President Ford, continued to express their distrust of the whole supply-side approach, but most leaders and aides kept their silence in the interest of party unity. Another explanation has since been offered by a campaign adviser: ''Nobody thought it was even remotely possible that the whole tax cut could be enacted.''
Once in office, Mr. Reagan continued his supply-side rhetoric. A day after outlining his budget to a joint sesthe White House East Room that every other modern tax cut had resulted in the Government ending up with more revenues than it started out with, and that ''we're just convinced'' it would happen again. It was an amazing statement in light of the official Administration budget projections released at the time. They indicated that there would be sizable budget deficits as a result of the massive tax cuts.
When aides are asked to explain the discrepancy, they tend to shrug their shoulders and offer comments like, ''He really does believe it.'' Several aides quoted the President as saying that he had never put much faith in economic projections anyway. Yet for all Mr. Reagan's certainty, his staff was getting nervous.
The first to worry about deficits, according to insiders, was Martin Anderson, the bookish, self-effacing domestic policy adviser. He counseled his colleagues to work out a compromise with the Democrats in Congress on a two-year tax cut. But Mr. Anderson never told the President of his feelings -for a variety of reasons. As a veteran of the bitter arguments over the program during the campaign, for example, he shared with some other Reagan old-timers a reluctance to reopen those wounds. He also believed in the customary procedures of the Reagan office whereby the staff reached a consensus on a major issue before going to the President with it - and that point never seemed to arrive.
The next aides to become upset were Mr. Stockman, the 34-year-old budget direc-tor, and Richard G. Darman, then 37, a White House aide in the policy and legislative areas. Mr. Darman, a former protege of Elliott Richardson, a pillar of the Republican establishment, forged a crucial early alliance with Mr. Stockman.
Mr. Stockman sent discreet signals to his friends among the Democrats in Congress of his hope for a tax-cut compromise, but he was outside the direct negotiations. The two men were supervised by James A. Baker 3d, the shrewd, affable White House chief of staff, along with Treasury Secretary Regan.
The budget director also began warning his White House colleagues about the burgeoning deficit. A sophisticated reader of Mr. Reagan's first budget submissions, for example, would have noticed that between Feb. 18 and March 10 of 1981 the 1984 projected deficit, accounting tricks aside, grew from $30 billion to $44 billion - $14 billion in 20 days. ''There was a sinking feeling that every time we went into a meeting with Stockman, his numbers got worse,'' recalls a White House official. ''What we looked at in June was far different from what we looked at in February or March.''
Another of the President's men troubled by the deficit figures was Murray Weidenbaum, but he too failed to convey his concern to the President. He saw his role more as a mediator between optimists and alarmists.
Then the doubts reached James Baker. He had been told by Mr. Darman in March that the Administration's deficit forecasts were too low. He later heard the same thing from Mr. Stockman and from budget experts in Congress. He responded by trying to achieve a compromise with the Democrats on the Administration's tax bill, an effort supported by his colleagues, Edwin Meese 3d, the White House counselor, and Michael K. Deaver, the deputy chief of staff. Mr. Baker was wary of pushing too hard for compromise, however, because of his former role as campaign manager for George Bush, the man who coined the ''voodoo economics'' phrase.
In the spring and early summer, the aides came to the President with possible concessions that could be made to move along the negotiations with the Democrats. Mr. Reagan did accept a reduction of the tax cut in the first year from 10 percent to 5 percent, his only major concession. And once it became clear that the President did not intend further compromise, Mr. Baker went all out for the man to whom he now owed his loyalty.
By all accounts, Secretary Regan was the last supply-side dropout in the President's inner circle - and his loss of faith came only in the fall of 1981, well after the tax program was in place. Mr. Regan's tenacity was nothing if not ironic. During his confirmation hearings, he had said that ''the more important parts'' of the Reagan program were the spending cuts - not the tax cuts. Then Mr. Regan was converted by Norman B. Ture and Paul Craig Roberts, the leading supply-siders at Treasury.
All the doubts came to a head at a crucial strategy meeting on June 5. The prime rates had moved beyond 20 percent only days earlier. White House aides crowded around a mahogany conference table in James Baker's spacious West Wing office to discuss whether to issue a new, less optimistic economic forecast. The case for the new forecast was made by Lawrence Kudlow, the senior economist in the budget office.
Secretary Regan told colleagues that he remained optimistic about the economy. He pointed to certain signs of growth in the first quarter of the year, and suggested that an even rosier scenario might be in order. Finally, he said that, as a practical matter, a less optimistic forecast at that point would derail the chances of the Administration's tax bill.
But the Administration's economic goals were inherently contradictory, Mr. Kudlow insisted. Then Mr. Baker spoke up: ''You mean it really is voodoo economics after all?'' The room erupted in laughter. Later, Mr. Baker told an associate that he saw no reason to change the forecast and jeopardize the chances of the Reagan program.
The unwillingness of the Reagan staff to challenge the President's deeply held beliefs can be explained, in part, by their relationship with the man himself. As a newcomer to Washington and the Federal bureaucracy, Mr. Reagan depended heav-ily on his staff to help translate his themes into political and legislative realities. In return, he offered these younger men an unusually large share of the limelight. A sign near his desk in the Oval Office reads: ''There's no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.'' Moreover, Mr. Reagan, as a man of genuine warmth and generosity, earned his staff's loyalty on a personal level.
At the same time, the President was supremely confident in himself and his ideas. He came to the Presidency convinced he had been given a mandate by the voters to carry out his program, and his staff by and large agreed. That was another reason why they hesitated in bringing doubts to him.
'It was not our role to go in there and try to reshape the President's policies,'' said a senior White House official. ''To rewrite the Reagan agenda was just not appropriate.'' Billions for Defense Ronald Reagan's call for a cutback in Federal spending had always left room for new Pentagon programs, but the military expenditures he sought after taking office far exceeded any of his campaign promises. That commitment to the largest peacetime military buildup in history made it all the more difficult to keep the budget within bounds. And according to interviews with participants, the decision was made by officials who avoided customary review procedures and mistakenly assumed that agreements, once reached, could be rescinded.
During the campaign of 1980, Mr. Reagan first laid out his military spending projections in the Sept. 9 ''mirrors'' speech. The figures had been set the evening before his talk in an angry meeting in a Chicago hotel room among Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Anderson and William R. Van Cleave, a University of Southern California professor who was serving as the candidate's defense consultant. The two economists, already nervous about the budget outlook, favored an annual spending increase of 5 percent, after allowing for inflation. Mr. Van Cleave, a longtime critic of detente and the nuclear-arms treaties with the Soviet Union, insisted on 7 percent.
''It was a hell of a battle,'' said a campaign official. The struggle came to an abrupt halt minutes before a news conference called to brief reporters on the speech. Mr. Anderson simply grabbed a piece of paper, typed a set of numbers on it and passed it on to an aide to be distributed to the press.
During the two previous years, the Carter Administration had increased defense spending 3 percent, after inflation, and Mr. Carter had called for a 4 percent annual growth through 1985. Mr. Anderson was willing to raise the ante, but not by much, and the annual projection he typed out was for 5 percent. Mr. Van Cleave was not pleased.
On Jan. 15, 1981, Jimmy Carter of-fered up some of the same kind of valedictory one-upmanship that had distinguished President Ford's last days in office four years earlier. He called for defense spending to increase annually at 5 percent.
The Carter recommendation was contained in a proposed budget for the 1982 fiscal year that had no legal force. But for Mr. Van Cleave, who had been named the Reagan transition team's director of defense planning, it had a large political and strategic significance. It was now essential, he told Caspar W. Weinberger, the incoming Secretary of Defense, that Mr. Reagan send a ''signal'' to the Soviet Union of his determination to spend more for military preparedness than his predecessor. As Mr. Van Cleave saw it, the appropriate signal would be a 7 percent annual increase in defense spending.
On the face of it, Mr. Weinberger seemed an unlikely convert. A former director of the Federal budget office, where he was known as ''Cap the Knife,'' he had been chosen Defense Secretary in part because he was thought likely to find ways to cut spending. Soon after he started on the job, he let it be known that he, not Mr. Van Cleave, would direct defense planning for the Administration. Yet for all his bureaucratic expertise and independence, Mr. Weinberger had little background in military strategy and spending. The new Defense Secretary passed a necessarily unseasoned eye over money requests presented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff -what one Administration official called a ''wish list'' - and concluded that nothing less than 7 percent would meet the Soviet threat as he perceived it.
In February, at a one-hour meeting in the Pentagon, Secretary Weinberger won Mr. Stockman's agreement. But Mr. Stockman, who was frantically churning through endless budget meetings day and night, thought he was looking at tentative figures. Others in the Administration felt the same way. ''A lot of us weren't paying much attention to defense spending,'' one White House official recently acknowledged.
The figures were discussed, for example, at a meeting later that month attended by Messrs. Stockman, Baker, Meese, Anderson, Weidenbaum and Darman. Little attention was paid to details - one official there recalled wondering out loud whether it would be physically possible for the Pentagon to spend that much money. Among those attending, it was ''mostly assumed,'' another participant said, that defense spending would be reduced when the budget office and the Pentagon got down to figuring out exactly how the money was going to be spent over the next several years. In other words, Mr. Stockman and the others would get a ''second crack'' at defense spending.
Pushing to meet the March 10 deadline for the submission of the overall budget to Congress, the White House staff agreed to the 7 percent figure. President Reagan went along. The decision was made.
The determination of how much money an Administration wants to devote to military spending is usually made after a lengthy and intensive review of the proposed programs and in the light of the nation's strategic needs. But no such procedure was followed by Mr. Reagan in 1981 until after the overall budget had been sub-Page 85 mitted and the Administration was publicly committed to a course. It is possible that an earlier, in-depth review might have led the Administration to recognize just how enormous the defense proposal really was. Mr. Reagan's original 1980 pledge to increase defense spending by 5 percent a year had been based on a defense budget of $158 billion for the fiscal year 1981. But Mr. Weinberger's 7 percent solution was based on the 1982 defense budget, which in the meantime had ballooned to $222 billion. Reckoned on the basis of the 1981 budget, the new growth rate was actually 11 percent after inflation, more than twice what Mr. Reagan had promised.
The malfunction of the system of planning and review, under deadline pressure, thus led to a decision many Administration officials now regret. And their hopes of getting a second chance to trim the Pentagon budget have proved to be what one Presidential aide now calls ''naive.'' He added: ''What happened was that the Pentagon bureaucracy just dug in on those numbers. Any retreat was considered a great threat to United States security.'' The Highest Bidder In February 1981, Secretary Regan invited the senior Congressmen concerned with tax legislation to join him for breakfast at a private Treasury Department dining room. He told his guests that he hoped for what he called a ''clean bill,'' a measure limited to President Reagan's campaign promises - the personal tax cut of 10 percent a year over three years and a program to ease depreciation formulas for businesses to encourage investment in new plants and equipment.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, interrupted. ''Mr. Secretary,'' he said, ''you know there might be only one train going to Peoria this year. And if there is, everybody is going to want to get on it.''
The others around the table laughed, but the point was serious. The chances were that there would, indeed, be only one tax bill passed that year, and it wasn't likely to be ''clean.'' Every special interest and constituent group in Washington would besiege Congress, demanding special tax breaks, and some of them inevitably would be part of the final package. Responsibility for balancing the competing demands for tax relief rested with Mr. Rostenkowski and his counterpart in the Senate, Bob Dole, chairman of the Finance Committee.
Of course, there were Congressional traditions that would help in the process. Democrats and Republicans on each of the two committees had a history of working hand in hand on tax matters to sort through the competing proposals. Even after agreements had been worked out with colleagues or lobbyists, there was a fail-safe mechanism: The House com-mittee knew that the worst of its deals would be eliminated by the Senate committee, and vice versa. Tax issues, in other words, were so sensitive that compromise was all but mandatory. In fact, as they sat around Secretary Regan's table, both Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Dole assumed privately that a deal could be made on the new President's three-year proposal itself, leading to a one-or two-year tax bill.
Since most members of both houses of Congress were unenthusiastic about the Reagan tax-cut measure, how could it have passed? One central reason was the breakdown of traditional procedures and relationships between the Senate and the House. In the face of a tenacious, resourceful President, compromise turned into a pitched battle of tax-cut giveaways, and the fail-safe mechanism failed.
In the Senate, the Majority Leader, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, and most of his Republican colleagues had no taste for the three-year tax-cut measure. But they were convinced at strategy sessions with White House officials that the measure should be left intact. This would leave room for the usual compromise solution, a scaling down of the bill to gain Democratic votes in the House.
''Compromise'' was not, however, a word to be bandied about. Nervous White House aides rebuked Senators who spoke publicly of concessions. Senator Dole received the ultimate reprimand after suggesting casually to a reporter that some compromise might eventually be needed. The next day he received a tart, hand-written note from the President, who was recovering from surgery following the attempt on his life in March.
That kind of White House pressure was particularly effective with Mr. Dole, Mr. Baker and other Republican Senate leaders. They were new in their jobs - the party had not controlled the Senate since 1955 - and they were uncertain to what degree they could assert their independence of the President. Moreover, few senior Republican Senators had been great political supporters of Mr. Reagan; Mr. Dole and Mr. Baker, in particular, had actually run against him in 1980 and lost. They were all mindful of the need to prove their loyalty.
''I had to subordinate my own feelings,'' says one Republican Senator. ''I figured, Ronald Reagan was elected the Republican President. That was always in the back of my mind. I'm not here to pick a fight with a brand new President.''
Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, the Democratic leaders disliked Mr. Reagan's approach to tax cutting and geared up to prepare a bill of their own. Democrats charged that the President's bill, with its across-the-board income-tax reduction, favored the wealthy. Moreover, they felt it would produce giant deficits, forcing Congress to cut social programs. It fell to Dan Rostenkowski, a gregarious and combative protege of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago, to seek an alternative.
Mr. Rostenkowski started out with compromise in mind. He and the Democrats at first offered a one-year tax cut but assumed that a compromise on a two-year bill was possible. He knew that Senator Dole was privately ready to deal, and he knew that some in the Administration had begun thinking in terms of compromise. Then Secretary Regan gave the Congressman a sheet of paper containing the outlines of a two-year tax cut, which Mr. Rostenkowski took back to his colleagues for further study.
In early May, though, there was a change in the wind, after Mr. Reagan's preliminary budget cuts came up for a vote in Congress - and sailed right through. Mr. Rostenkowski recalls that he first encountered the change at a secret meeting with Secretary Regan. Mr. Rostenkowski was told that the two-year bill was no longer on the bargaining table. Then he was presented with some new Administration tax ''ideas,'' as they were labeled. They included reductions in estate and gift taxes and in the tax on oil royalties. Unbeknownst to him, while he had been making his rounds of meetings with Secretary Regan and Treasury aides, talking about a tax-cut compromise, another set of aides at the White House had been dangling special tax breaks to win the votes of conservative Democrats from the South and Middle West, the so-called ''boll weevils.'' The White House had suddenly come to the conclusion that it might be possible to win it all.
''You could just feel it in the air,'' says a White House Congressional strategist. ''There was such a feeling of elation over what we had been able to get out of Congress that everybody just wanted to try again and get more.''
Mr. Rostenkowski had a talk with Vice President Bush, an old friend. ''I told him, 'George, if you want a vote on the floor on the third year, I'll give it to you,' '' the Congressman recalls today. In other words, he would not use parliamentary tactics to prevent the House from voting on the three-year tax cut. ''But I said, 'Let's stay out of oil and gas and the estate and gift taxes. Because if it gets to be a bidding war, George, I'll bid.' ''
An Administration official tells of a moment just before the bidding war broke out at the end of May: ''I remember Jim Baker looking tremendously downcast and saying, 'Well, Rosty's dug in and the President's dug in, and we're not going to get the President to change his mind.' Jim said, 'We're going to have to go the other way.' The question none of us knew the answer to was: What would it cost?''
There were two tax-cut bills in the House at this point -the Administration version and the Rostenkowski version, and they were both getting fatter as new tax-cut provisions were piled on in a frantic bid to attract the vote of individual Representatives. Ironically, in the course of the free-for-all, the two bills became more and more alike, offering concessions to many of the same special interests.
As the bidding war got under way, Senator Dole, who had earlier held the loyalist line for a ''clean'' tax bill, returned to the forefront of the battle. He proposed adoption of a so-called ''indexing'' provision, under which an individual's tax rate would be calculated to remove the impact of inflation. Since inflation pushes taxpayers into higher brackets, thereby increasing Federal tax revenues, indexing would cost the Government hundreds of billions of dollars in lost receipts over the next two decades.
When the Senator first sought the indexing provision, White House aides opposed it, but they yielded in the face of his insistence that he needed the measure to win votes. Mr. Dole's fellow Senators, having watched the bidding war in the House, wanted their own chance to earn points with constituents by attaching ''goodies'' to the tax bill. A politician who knows the Senator well offers another explanation: ''Dole figured there was so much junk being put in the tax bill that there might as well be some real tax reform, too.''
The final measure, signed into law on Aug. 13, 1981, contained a three-year, 25 percent tax cut; indexing; new business depreciation allowances, and a dazzling array of tax breaks on oil production, estates, charitable contributions, interest income, deposits into retirement accounts, income from new tax-exempt savings certficiates and other items. A measure intended to encourage investment and spur economic growth had become the biggest, most expensive tax-cut grab bag in history.
There had been some second thoughts. During the spring, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, had received a memorandum from his aide Stephen E. Bell, warning that the budget outlook was ''considerably worse'' than the Administration claimed, with huge deficits looming. A chain-smoking workaholic, Mr. Domenici found himself losing sleep over the prospect. Finally, as the vote neared, he informed Senator Baker that he intended to lead a revolt against the Administration bill.
That rang alarms. Mr. Domenici was called to meetings at the White House with Jim Baker and Dick Darman. They promised they would seek more spending cuts later in the year, including military budget trims, if only he would stay in line now. He was then called to meet with Senator Baker and President Reagan. Finally, Mr. Domenici relented.
Had Mr. Domenici gone ahead with his revolt, he might have affected the outcome, and to this day he remains tortured about his decision. ''I think it'll haunt him for the next 10 years,'' said one of his aides.
The second thoughts about the tax-cut bill have come thick and fast, and there seems more than enough blame to go around. Some Senators have wondered whether Howard Baker and Bob Dole might not have fought for a compromise bill if they had not been so new in their posts. Others have insisted that they were caught by surprise by the Administration's hard-line approach. ''We assumed the House would bail us out on the tax bill,'' said a key Republican Senator's aide. ''Well, we never got bailed out.''
Some White House officials feel that Mr. Rostenkowski was too inflexible in his initial bargaining over the form of the tax cut, that he missed an opportunity to settle on a two-year 20 percent bill when the White House hinted its willingness to compromise. Some Congressional Democrats say that Mr. Rostenkowski was too generous with the tax ''goodies,'' thereby helping to raise the ante of the bidding battle without managing to win the war.
At the Treasury, there are aides who claim that Jim Baker and the White House gave too many concessions too easily. At the White House, there are officials who complain that Secretary Regan failed to drive a hard enough bargain. And in Congress, there are aides and officials who blame both Mr. Regan and Jim Baker, aided and abetted by Ronald Reagan himself.
In fact, the President apparently remained personally aloof from the day-to-day details of the process even as he insisted that his overall principles could not be compromised. At one meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House between a group of Presidential aides and a collection of Congressmen of both parties, Secretary Regan beckoned the President to sit down and join the horse-trading - votes for tax breaks. ''Heck, no,'' the President replied. ''I'm going to leave this to you experts.'' The Power of an Image On the evening of Feb. 5, 1981, seated at his desk in the Oval Office, Ronald Reagan delivered his maiden television address as President and offered a fresh pitch for his program of tax cuts. ''Over the past decades,'' he said, ''we've talked of curtailing Government spending so that we can then lower the tax burden. Sometimes we've even taken a run at doing that. But there were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know we can lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and breath. Or we can cure their extravagance simply by reducing their allowance.''
The message was clear: Since the ''children'' who run the Congress lack the discipline to cut Federal spending on their own, and thereby make lower taxes possible, Mr. Reagan would force their hand. He would simply cut the taxes, and the Congressmen would have no choice -they would have to spend less as their allowance of Federal tax revenues dwindled.
It was a strange kind of argument for an advocate of supply-side economics, which holds that major tax cuts quickly spur economic growth, which in turn makes budget trims unnecessary. But this Children's Allowance Theory had a seductive simplicity, a quality that has often distinguished Ronald Reagan's presentation of public issues.
During the weeks following his television appearance, the new President used this theory to good effect to sell his program. At the same time, in a significant supporting role, David Stockman was brought on stage as the compleat budget cutter; he would prove to any doubters that a strong Administration could keep Government extravagance down.
The Children's Allowance Theory, brilliantly framed and enthusiastically presented by the President, helped overcome skepticism among economic traditionalists - Congressional conservatives, for example, who for years had worshiped at the altar of a balanced Federal budget.
One such skeptic was Representative Barber B. Conable Jr., the senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee and an upstate New York neighbor -though no fan - of Jack Kemp and supplyside economics. Another was Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority whip in the House, whose overriding political goal was to reduce the size and scope of the Government.
Scores of prominent businessmen were also shepherded through the White House to hear President Reagan argue his Children's Allowance Theory. Many recalled later that their fears about tax cuts had been dispelled by the President's assurances that they would lead to budget cuts. (Of course, many of these visitors already liked a tax bill so generous toward business.) One of the most important corporate conversions made with the help of the Children's Allowance Theory was that of Donald T. Regan, the former chairman of Merrill Lynch & Company. He yielded his budget-cut-before-tax-cut beliefs, and as Secretary of the Treasury he became the Administration's chief emissary to the business community, assuring skeptics that tax cuts and a balanced budget were not mutually exclusive. When pressed, Mr. Regan hastened to explain that budget cutting was not in his domain, but the responsibility of David Stockman. (It was many months later that Mr. Regan would admit to an associate that he had been ''naive'' about the budget.)
For Secretary Regan, then, as it was for President Reagan, Mr. Stockman provided the tangible evidence of the Administration's commitment to budget cutting. With his graying hair and boy-wonder mastery of the bureaucracy, learned during six years as a Capitol Hill aide and four years as a Michigan Congressman, the 34-year-old Mr. Stockman captured the public's imagination. His ''black books'' were filled with the names of programs to be trimmed, such once-sacred cows as highways, dairy price supports, student loans, job training, public-service jobs, low-income housing, school aid.
So dazzling was his performance that several things went unappreciated. One: The degree to which the plans to increase military spending, which comprises 30 percent of the total budget, would overwhelm the struggle to cut spending elsewhere. Another: the President's decision to leave several sacred cows untouched, such as Social Security, Medicare, civil-service pensions and veterans' benefits. Nearly half the Federal budget consisted of these and other programs that provide open-ended payments to individuals - the socalled ''entitlements'' - and Mr. Reagan knew that Congress was not ready to dismantle the welfare state, as middle-class Americans have come to enjoy it. ''Ronald Reagan was looking for something that would pass,'' says one White House official. ''He was willing to take risks, but not on a sure loser.''
That left Mr. Stockman a problem: With the military and entitlement programs exempted, along with the mandatory costs of servicing the Federal debt, he was forced to seek most of his 1981 savings from less than 20 percent of the budget.
In July, the Congress approved a $700 billion budget incorporating a $35 billion package of Stockman-initiated spending trims. But as budget officials now admit, some $8 billion of that total consisted of accounting gimmicks and phony savings. And before the year was over, even the remaining $27 billion had been wiped out by cost overruns in interest charges on the Federal debt, farm price supports, unemployment compensation and other items.
The tax cuts had trimmed the Children's Allowance, all right, but they ended up spending more than before. Patchwork President Reagan's mountaintop California ranch was shrouded in fog, that day in August 1981, when he proudly signed his program of tax cuts and budget cuts into law. Yet, behind the scenes, Mr. Reagan's advisers were already quietly plotting a series of ''offensives,'' as they called them, to counter the program's effects. Although they could not know until months later that a recession had, statistically speaking, begun the previous month, they knew the economy was faltering as interest rates continued to rise. They and their President would spend the next year trying to extricate themselves.
The first ''offensive'' came just days after the signing when David Stockman, in a private memorandum to the President, called for a cut in the Defense Department budget. Military spending was now growing faster than anyone had anticipated, Mr. Stockman wrote, and to say it could not be trimmed for security reasons was just ''Pentagon blue smoke.''
The President's other immediate aides, impressed by the argument, felt certain Mr. Reagan would go along, and their sentiment was shared with reporters. The President was said not to be pleased to read that he was expected to go along with his staff on the issue.
Whatever the effect of the press reports, Defense Secretary Weinberger mounted a strong attack on the proposed cuts, with a full and elaborate presentation for the President, insisting upon the validity of the Pentagon's security claims. And preparedness won the day: Mr. Reagan sided with his Defense Secretary.
The White House staff, undaunted, scheduled another offensive. Jim Baker, David Stockman and Dick Darman knew they had a kindred spirit in Senator Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee - who had been stung once before by a Presidential decision to keep the Pentagon budget high. Mr. Domenici worked behind the scenes in the fall to devise a parliamentary scheme whereby a series of new spending cuts, including changes in the entitlement programs, would be incorporated in a single, catch-all resolution. All told, the offensive sought budget savings of more than $40 billion spread over three years.
In September, Mr. Reagan appealed on television for public support of his new package. But it was not to be. Eventually, Congress adopted a resolution that embodied cuts of only $4 billion in one year alone. Mr. Domenici's Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill had grown weary of budget cutting and were inclined to give the supplyside magic some time to work.
According to a White House official, there was also another, lesser reason for the result: the appearance of the article ''The Education of David Stockman'' in the Atlantic Monthly. The suggestion that the budget director had lost faith in supply-side economics and misled Congress doomed the chances of another Stockman-led charge on the budget.
In December and January, the White House staff launched yet another ''offensive'' - a proposal to raise perhaps $45 billion in new taxes in 1983-85. Newspapers came to be filled with items about these plans. Finally, at a staff economic meeting in the Cabinet Room, Mr. Reagan began the session by announcing, ''You know, everybody in the press says that you guys have a conspiracy to talk me into a tax increase.'' By the time the session was over, Mr. Reagan found himself declaring: ''By God, they're right!'' There were still many people close to Mr. Reagan who felt that the supply-side tax cuts had not been given time to have their energizing effect, and, not surprisingly, Representative Jack Kemp was in that group. He led a counteroffensive that convinced the President to reject his aides' advice.
It was not until the spring of 1982 that Republican leaders in Congress, alarmed and emboldened by soaring deficits, joined with the White House staff to persuade Mr. Reagan to accept, in principle, cuts in military spending and new taxes. And it took weeks of haggling and recriminations before the Congress arrived at a package of $98 billion in tax increases for 1983-85 and defense spending cuts worth $30 billion for the same three-year period.
The President plugged for passage of the bill, which he said was needed to eliminate ''unintended'' tax benefits of the earlier taxcut measure - what he later called the ''Christmas tree ornaments that were hung on our program.'' But a few days before its passage in August, he told a news conference that he did not feel bound by the second and third years of the Pentagon spending cuts, which took care of $23 billion of the $30 billion saving.
That backtracking enraged the President's Congressional partners, who had painfully put together the deal making the tax measure possible. And it set the stage for a return performance by those members of Congress like Senator Domenici who believe the Pentagon budget is for cutting. The issue will be raised, most directly, in the review of the Administration's 1984 budget by the budget director and the Secretary of Defense and their staffs. Such discussions usually begin in the early fall, but Mr. Stockman has postponed them until after next month's elections.
The legacy of the Fed's tight-money policies, the three-year tax cut, the defense spending increases and the resulting budget deficits, as most economists view it, has been a recession deeper and longer than might have otherwise occurred. The defense spending and entitlement programs are still growing at several times the rate that tax revenues can possibly be expected to grow. By some estimates, the Federal deficit in the next few years could exceed 5 percent of the gross national product, a level unprecedented in peacetime, sending interest rates soaring again. In 1980 and 1981, the deficit was only about 2 percent of the G.N.P.
Some Reagan advisers say privately that further tax increases might be necessary. And the new Congress will inevitably be asked, once again, to examine such ''sacred cows'' as Social Security to look for trims.
President Reagan has said that it would take a ''palace coup'' to get him to agree to new taxes. Indeed, there is no indication that the President has departed from his belief in the supply-side theory. During the first six months of 1981, Mr. Reagan succeeded in convincing his staff, Congress and the public that this untried approach to energizing the economy should be put into effect. The odds against that achievement were imponderable. Who is to say that he will be unable to withstand the growing pressures to meet the deepening recession with a new economic policy? AFTERWORD Presidents before Ronald Reagan have thought they could defy the odds. Presidents before Ronald Reagan have embarked on programs that had unintended results. But in the case of Reaganomics, the risks and the possibility that the program could backfire were widely recognized, even by members of his own party, and yet the program was enacted into law.
Why? For one thing, the events of 1981 were a triumph of human factors over the inbred conservatism of government institutions. The usual safeguards - the party system in Congress, the independent Federal Reserve, the business community, the Cabinet and the press - all were bypassed or overcome by Mr. Reagan's political skills.
According to James David Barber, a Duke University professor and author of several books on the Presidency, Mr. Reagan was also helped in putting across his program by the average American's attitude toward economics. ''To the public,'' he said, ''economics is like magic, and one economic plan is as plausible as another.''
Surely the timing of the 1980 election was also a decisive factor in 1981. Battered by inflation and confused by such national traumas as the Iran hostage crisis, the voters had grown weary of a President who lectured them about the complexity of their woes. They turned to the man who said he wanted to lead, and who seemed to know where he wanted to go. He interpreted his election victory as a mandate, and many voters felt he should be given a free hand. That has happened before in American history, but seldom has a new President used it to apply so radical a treatment to an ailing body politic.
What happened in 1981 takes on particular importance today. The United States is in the throes of profound economic change. Whole sections of the country are in depression as old industries are phased out. The advent of new technologies is bringing prosperity to some Americans, but poverty to others. And experts have come to recognize that the government machinery to cope with these problems is in need of drastic overhaul.
Reaganomics has deepened the urgency of the crisis. Yet, as the nation moves to find new solutions to its economic woes, the experiences of 1981 may provide an object lesson. Given the manner in which Mr. Reagan's untested program won enactment, Americans may feel that a re-examination of their political system should be their first order of business.

Abstract: Joan Dickie, an information officer at the United States Mission to the United Nations, rejected the idea that the United States had influenced any decision not to publish the report. ''We are not members of the Committee of 24,'' she said. ''We have no power to influence what the committee publishes or does not publish.'' ''Defense expenditures leading to budget deficits, budget deficits leading to inflation, inflation leading to balance-of-payments problems - that is the indirect path by which South Africa arrived at the I.M.F.'s door,'' the report said. ''In addition there was the direct increment to the balance-of-payments deficit caused by rising arms imports.'' The report was sharply critical of the monetary fund's agreement in 1969 to buy gold from South Africa at the official price of $35 an ounce. The report said this decision was ''ostensibly'' for the purpose of stabilizing the world price of gold, but it added, ''In practice, the decision worked to aid South Africa and to destabilize world gold markets.''

The study charges that loans from the monetary fund have helped South Africa maintain its system of apartheid and have contributed to that country's military buildup. In addition it concludes that the I.M.F. has treated South Africa more favorably than other African countries and has ignored declarations by the General Assembly and Security Council that South Africa's occupation of Namibia is illegal.
Jean Gazarian, director of General Assembly Affairs in the office of the Secretariat, said he could recall no other instances in which a United Nations report of this nature was not published as an official document and translated into the U.N.'s official languages. He called the treatment of this report ''very strange'' but said he did not know what had happened.
Special Panel's Project
The study was commissioned by the Secretariat at the request of the Special Committee of 24. Its jurisdiction includes overseeing the carrying out of United Nations declarations on decolonization.
Frank Abdulah, chairman of the Special Committee of 24, declined to say why the report had not been translated and disseminated like other U.N. studies.
''I think you had better ask the United States Government that,'' said Mr. Abdulah, who is the chief representative to the United Nations from Trinidad and Tobago.
The Reagan Administration, seeking to improve relations with South Africa, has allowed high-ranking South African military officers to come to the United States and has adopted a more flexible policy regarding sales of nuclear materials to South Africa.
But Joan Dickie, an information officer at the United States Mission to the United Nations, rejected the idea that the United States had influenced any decision not to publish the report. ''We are not members of the Committee of 24,'' she said. ''We have no power to influence what the committee publishes or does not publish.''
The I.M.F.'s representative to the United Nations declined to make any public comment. Request for a New Loan
The study has acquired new significance because South Africa recently requested a $1.1 billion loan from the monetary fund. A resolution opposing the loan was introduced by Guinea in the General Assembly yesterday.
According to the study, some $543 million in South African drawings from the I.M.F. from 1975 to 1977 ''helped to pay increases in South African defense expenditures.'' During that period, South Africa's military outlays increased by $450 million, the study found.
''Defense expenditures leading to budget deficits, budget deficits leading to inflation, inflation leading to balance-of-payments problems - that is the indirect path by which South Africa arrived at the I.M.F.'s door,'' the report said. ''In addition there was the direct increment to the balance-of-payments deficit caused by rising arms imports.''
The study charged that I.M.F. loans to South Africa have ''demonstrated to the world financial community that, despite increasingly violent confrontations between the majority black populations and the white minority Government in South Africa, the I.M.F. would continue to support the status quo and the white authorities.'' Share of Credits Analyzed
Without I.M.F. loans, and the potential for future loans, the report continued, South Africa would be faced with the ''domestic financial and political costs of its controversial racial policies and of its illegal occupation of Namibia.''
During recent years, the report charged, South Africa received a ''disproportionate share'' of I.M.F. credits that went to African nations. As an example, the study noted that Nigeria, a nation of comparable economic stature, was a current net contributor of $592 million to the I.M.F. last year while South Africa had a net debt of $10 million.
The report was sharply critical of the monetary fund's agreement in 1969 to buy gold from South Africa at the official price of $35 an ounce. The report said this decision was ''ostensibly'' for the purpose of stabilizing the world price of gold, but it added, ''In practice, the decision worked to aid South Africa and to destabilize world gold markets.''

Abstract: Present law does not presume to tell the Fed what measures or targets it should use, or how high or low to set its objectives. The two Democratic proposals would demand a single rigid approach. Senator [Robert Byrd] would require the Fed to maintain ''real'' short-term interest rates - the difference between actual rates and the level of inflation - at ''historic levels.'' In recent years that would have meant increasing the money supply, on the dubious theory that more money always results in lower interest rates. Even if it worked, the rule could easily sap confidence in the currency and drive inflation higher.

Full text: Not to be outdone by the Administration's crowd-pleasing campaign to balance the budget by constitutional amendment, top Democrats in Congress propose now to lower interest rates by legislation. They, too, are being hypocritical and wrong-headed.
With a posse of co-sponsors, the Senate Democratic leader, Robert Byrd, and the House majority leader, Jim Wright, offer bills that would require the Federal Reserve system to focus its operations on the level of interest rates - forevermore. Either bill would be an unprecedented restriction on the management of monetary policy. The Wright bill would go further by directing the President to declare his opinion on every policy move the Fed makes. It would institutionalize blatant political intrusion in a process that is already delicate.
Officially, our central banking system is ''independent'' of White House influence. In practice, it trims its sails to accommodate the policies of the President in power. It would be reckless to do otherwise.
Within this framework, however, the Fed has been free to design and redesign its methods, as it did three years ago in shifting its focus from interest rates to broad aggregates of the money supply. This monetarist approach may not be the best answer to current problems, but it is certainly preferable to political dictation from Capitol Hill.
The itch to curb the Fed at a time like this is understandable. The tightness of monetary policy has riled conservative Republicans as well as liberal Democrats. But why were these radical bills introduced just before the summer recess of a Congressional election year? Are they anything more than campaign fodder?
Present law does not presume to tell the Fed what measures or targets it should use, or how high or low to set its objectives. The two Democratic proposals would demand a single rigid approach. Senator Byrd would require the Fed to maintain ''real'' short-term interest rates - the difference between actual rates and the level of inflation - at ''historic levels.'' In recent years that would have meant increasing the money supply, on the dubious theory that more money always results in lower interest rates. Even if it worked, the rule could easily sap confidence in the currency and drive inflation higher.
The Wright bill would force the Fed to aim instead at long-term rates, an even more difficult technical assignment. Both bills commit the same basic error: they would restrict the Fed's flexibility to adjust to circumstances and give all its work an inflationary bias.
The bill's critics may find it perversely comforting that the House Banking Committee plans only a single day of hearings on the Wright bill. Remember, though, that the House recently approved a major tax increase after no hearings at all. Under the deceptive slogan of ''Balanced Monetary Policy'' - the title of Senator Byrd's bill - this assault on flexibility might be tacked onto other legislation that is guaranteed passage.
If there really oughta be a law, which is doubtful, let it be decently considered.

Full text: The effects of unemployment in this recession will probably be more serious than those in other recessions since World War II because of a shift in the kinds of jobs available, a House subcommittee was told today.
''The most important difference between this recession and most others is that it reflects structural change in the economy,'' said M. Harvey Brenner, professor of operations research at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
''Many workers in the extractive and manufacturing sectors are not going to find re-employment at their old jobs, nor are their sons and daughters or younger brothers and sisters going to find work careers in these stable and contracting industries,'' he said, noting that unemployment was highest in the automobile, steel and other high-wage durable goods industries.
''Training for services and communications-sector jobs, and for lighter industrial work, is necessary to bring these displaced workers back into productive roles,'' Professor Brenner said. Unemployment Patterns Studied
He made his comments at the first of two hearings in which the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy is studying how the distribution of unemployment has changed in the current recession and whether the changing work force has affected the lengths and patterns of unemployment.
The subcommittee, under the chairmanship of Walter E. Fauntroy, the District of Columbia Delegate, is also looking at how the budget is affecting unemployment.
Alice M. Rivlin, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said that the jobless rate ''is projected to decline slowly, but to remain above 8.5 percent in the final quarter of 1983.''
But she added that an ''unusual combination of tight monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy means that there is considerable uncertainty'' about whether an economic recovery can be sustained, and said: ''Without a strong and sustained economic recovery, significant reductions in unemployment will not occur.'' Emphasis on Reducing Inflation
Noting that for the past two years the primary emphasis of monetary policy had been on reducing inflation, Mr. Fauntroy, a Democrat, said lawmakers ''must weigh the benefits of reduced inflation against the costs of increased unemployment that has resulted from an exclusively monetarist anti-inflation policy.''
''If the social, economic and human costs of our present levels of unemployment are relatively small,'' he said, ''we will judge the course of current monetary and economic policies to be correct.''
But he added that ''if, as I believe to be the case, the unemployment rate of 9.8 percent in July understates and conceals the actual degree of suffering and hardship, we need to change our policies so that the road to lower inflation does not leave so much pain and suffering in its wake.''

AWAITING THE NEXT OIL CRISIS

Abstract: Near the end of a recent visit to the United States, the president of a national oil company in a member nation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wrote out a list for his hosts: a shale-oil project in Colorado, a coal project in West Virginia, a tar-sands oil-extraction program in Canada, the Alaska natural-gas pipeline. ... The list went on. Beside each item he wrote one of three words - ''delayed,'' ''postponed'' or ''canceled.'' ''What we're seeing,'' he said, ''is the death of the alternatives.'' He was talking about alternatives to American dependence upon imported oil. The performance was surprising. One might expect an official from an OPEC country to applaud prospects for an increase in American demand for his country's most valuable asset. In fact, he was frightened. The scenario was all too clear to him: Without the alternatives to imported oil, the United States requires more and more overseas petroleum; a sudden, unexpected event -an assassination, a war, a revolution - cuts deeply into available supply. The price soars, and the world economy is traumatized. ''In that case,'' he said, envisioning the effect of a global recession on the long-term demand for his country's products, ''everybody loses.'' Without that growth divi-dend, America becomes a ''zero-sum society,'' in which the main task of the political system becomes, as the economist Lester C. Thurow puts it, ''loss allocation.'' The recent budget fight was a battle over who loses how much. And in the economic slump that would follow the next oil shock, the battle would be much more painful, intensifying social conflict as energy became an engine of ''ungrowth.'' Protectionist impulses would also mount, temporarily insulating some industries from the pressures of the world market, but also penalizing consumers, retarding adjustment, undermining critical Western-alliance relations and lowering overall incomes.

Full text: Near the end of a recent visit to the United States, the president of a national oil company in a member nation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wrote out a list for his hosts: a shale-oil project in Colorado, a coal project in West Virginia, a tar-sands oil-extraction program in Canada, the Alaska natural-gas pipeline. ... The list went on. Beside each item he wrote one of three words - ''delayed,'' ''postponed'' or ''canceled.''
''What we're seeing,'' he said, ''is the death of the alternatives.'' He was talking about alternatives to American dependence upon imported oil. The performance was surprising. One might expect an official from an OPEC country to applaud prospects for an increase in American demand for his country's most valuable asset. In fact, he was frightened. The scenario was all too clear to him: Without the alternatives to imported oil, the United States requires more and more overseas petroleum; a sudden, unexpected event -an assassination, a war, a revolution - cuts deeply into available supply. The price soars, and the world economy is traumatized. ''In that case,'' he said, envisioning the effect of a global recession on the long-term demand for his country's products, ''everybody loses.''
In 1973 and 1979, the nation experienced two oil shocks; we responded by initiating a host of bold and not-so-bold programs to protect us against a third such crisis. Today, those programs are disappearing. Even the great boom in the exploration for oil and gas in the United States, inspired by oil decontrol, high prices and the prospects for even higher prices, has passed its peak; the drilling rate is down a third since January, and drilling rigs are stacking up in Texas.
Essential to our ability to cope with another oil shock is continued momentum in energy conservation. Yet this, too, has been dwindling - and, in some cases, stopping altogether. The airlines are a dramatic case in point. The increase in oil prices hit airlines particularly hard, with energy as a share of total operating costs rising from 12 percent in the early 1970's to a current 30 percent. Many airlines responded by ordering a new generation of fuelefficient jets, including the Boeing 757 and the Boeing 767. Many of these companies have now changed their minds. C. Edward Acker, the chairman of Pan American World Airways, recently explained why: ''These two airplanes were ordered at a time when everyone was projecting a $2-a-gallon fuel price by the end of 1982 and a price of $3 by 1985. At the end of 1982, fuel will probably cost less than it did in 1980.''
In the short run, such decisions seem to make sense. One would expect them from prudent businessmen under pressure from high interest rates, liquidity problems and poor business conditions.
Yet the sum of these actions may very well lead us, as a nation, into deep trouble. For the energy problem is not merely an issue of whether motorists pay $1.20 or $2.20 a gallon for gasoline. The energy issue really involves the possibilities for economic growth, and it is on such growth that our political and economic system depends. It spells the difference between jobs and unemployment lines; it helps to resolve national political tensions, and it eases potential international conflict.
According to calculations developed for ''Global Insecurity,'' on which this article is based, the last two oil shocks have cost the United States and the other major industrial countries $1.2 trillion in lost economic growth -which Americans are now experiencing in the form of the worst economic slump and the highest unemployment since the Great Depression. There is high probability of another oil shock, which could trigger far graver economic and political consequences.
Ever since 1973, the year of the oil embargo and the first oil crisis, analysts and politicians have been looking into the energy future and sounding the alarm. The stakes are now even higher, and we could find by the end of the century that we have run out of time. The alarms are being heard in almost every major industrial country in the world. The head of the Economic Planning Agency in Japan -a country whose growth rate is also dropping - recently remarked: ''Japan is no exception to the worldwide deflationary impact of the second oil crisis.'' But one important country seems not to be listening: the United States.
In order to think sensibly about the past, it is necessary to understand the economic consequences of the last two oil crises. The 1970's were a watershed in modern economic history. They marked the end of the post-World War II era of high growth rates and full employment for most of the industrial world and the beginning of the current economic situation - alternating bouts of high inflation, low growth and high unemployment.
The oil shocks alone could not have caused such a major shift. But in carrying world oil prices from $2.50 to $34 a barrel, they were the primary driving forces.
The first impact was on inflation: The oil-price jumps were reflected directly in higher prices for gasoline, home heating oil and fuel oil. Up went the price index. With the rise in the price of oil came increases in the cost of anything connected with or substituted for it - from plastics and airline travel to coal, housing insulation and Hondas. Up went the price index. Meanwhile, people noticed that prices were going up, and so they sought to compensate through wage hikes. In this way, the oil-price rises became embedded in the underlying inflation - and in people's psychology. Up, up went the price index.
At the same time, the two oil shocks have extracted a considerable toll on economic growth through severe recessions and economic slowdown. The rise in the price of foreign oil means that purchasing power is drained from our economy to the oil producers - the socalled OPEC tax. The two price increases resulted in a cumulative OPEC tax on the industrial world between 1973 and 1981 of more than $1 trillion. The result is less real income and less money to spend, leading to a decline in economic activity and a rise in unemployment. It happened in 1975 - and it is happening again today.
Faced with the double challenge of inflation and recession, most governments have chosen to focus on inflation as the more immediate threat. ''Better 10 percent unemployed,'' they figure, ''than 100 percent chasing to catch up with inflation.''
And so they have used high interest rates and other restrictive monetary and fiscal policies to control inflation. But this approach has reinforced the slump brought on by the OPEC tax and has meant a historic retreat from the postwar commitment to full employment. Meanwhile, the general stagflation (plus high interest rates, uncertainty and increased energy costs) has meant much less investment - investment that is necessary for higher productivity and long-term economic growth. Our economy is certainly weaker in the wake of the second oil shock than it was after the first. It's as if the economy was getting up off the floor after being knocked down in 1973, only to be kicked before it could get back on its feet again. The impact of a third oil shock could be even grimmer.
But how likely are further energy problems? After all, impaired economic performance and decay need not be the only responses to the oil shortages. Modern economies, unlike those of traditional agricultural societies, are not static. And in the nine years since the first oil crisis, a promising process of adjustment has been taking place in our economy. Adjustment, a reorientation of key patterns of energy consumption and production in response to the new realities of the world oil market, is a requirement for a stable economy and sustained economic growth.
Three major sources of oil outside OPEC - the North Sea, the North Slope of Alaska and a new oil province in Mexico - became available in the second half of the 1970's, adding about six million barrels a day to world supplies by 1981.
A good deal of switching to other fuels has also occurred. There is now a greater reliance on nuclear power, particularly in France, but the most important switch has been back to coal. International coal trade increased by 30 percent between 1978 and 1981.
By far the most important and powerful form of adjustment, however, has been in conservation. Until the late 1970's, the conventional wisdom had it that economic growth and growth in energy consumption had to march in lockstep. It has now been proved otherwise. In the United States, it currently takes 18 percent less energy to generate every unit of G.N.P. than it did in 1973.
But there are two other factors that greatly complicate the picture. One involves oil inventories. In 1979 and 1980, as a hedge against even higher prices and a much larger interruption of supply, oil companies built up greater inventories than had been customary. Today, in response to high interest rates, pressure on profits and changed perceptions of the world market, these companies are, to varying degrees, running down those inventories. This inventory depletion has greatly accentuated the apparent drop in demand: Instead of importing oil, American oil companies have been using up their supplies.
The second factor is the deep recession. The link between energy consumption and economic activity has been loosened, but not broken. An economic downturn still leads to less energy consumption. Thus, the drop in oil use cannot be entirely attributed to the adjustment. Ulf Lantzke, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, has expressed the matter succinctly: ''There still is an oil gap; only now it is expressed in the number of unemployed.'' Looking at the pattern of the last decade, a somewhat pessimistic scenario for our energy future in the rest of the century begins to emerge. It is based on the strong possibility that there will be upheavals in the Middle East or a change in outlook by the ruling elite in Saudi Arabia and the already obvious difficulties in finding new supplies and raising capital for new energy projects.
In addition, there is the critical question of whether the United States can halt the decline in its oil production that began in 1970. In its last published World Energy Outlook, Exxon suggested that American oil production -today at 10.2 million barrels a day - might drop to 7.5 million barrels a day by the year 2000 - and a lot of that production would have to come from oil reserves that have not yet been discovered. Others predict it might drop even lower. Such a fall in American oil production would cancel out the gains from a more fuelefficient automobile fleet.
What about oil elsewhere? With the possible exception of reserves currently being explored off the east coast of Canada (which will be hard to recover) and despite the incentive of much higher prices, no discoveries comparable to Mexico, the North Sea and Alaska have been made since the middle 1970's.
Moreover, a number of important OPEC countries -Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, Indonesia - appear to be headed downward in their production capacity. They may not be significant oil producers at the end of the decade, leading to even greater reliance on the unstable Persian Gulf region for oil supplies.
Revolutions, terrorism, coups, social upheavals, regional conflicts, Soviet expansionism - all threaten to disrupt oil supplies from that region in the years ahead. Such disruptions or ''political accidents'' create the conditions for a third oil shock.
But accidents alone will not do it. The more likely flash point occurs when they interact with a market in which demand is rising - as was discovered in 1973 and 1979. Thus, ironically, the world enters the danger zone when economic activity is on an upswing.
Should all these eventualities come to pass, the price of oil could double yet again -to more than $70 a barrel. A doubling of current prices would mean a jump in the OPEC tax of $80 billion a year - and another round of high inflation and economic slump. But it would hit a system already considerably weakened by the incomplete recovery from the earlier shocks.
The initial effect would be a sharp acceleration of inflation. This would be followed by a severe recession - both because of the sudden increase in the OPEC tax and because of the deflationary steps taken by the Government to reduce inflation.
Unemployment would rise, and businesses would fail. One immediate response might be more direct state intervention in the economy -direct bailouts for companies and sectors hardest hit: the Chrysler route. The hard-won compromises over energy prices might collapse, as various groups in society seek shelter from the rigors of the world oil market. On the other hand, the upward ratcheting of prices would have very painful short-term effects on the society, intensifying regional and social conflicts. There would be a search for ''miracle'' solutions and certainly a great effort to find a villain - oil companies, environmentalists or the Federal Government.
The consequences of the next oil shock would take a heavy toll in lost economic growth. In the years after World War II, growth provided the means to avoid the kind of grave crises that afflicted industrial societies in the 1920's and 30's.
Without that growth divi-dend, America becomes a ''zero-sum society,'' in which the main task of the political system becomes, as the economist Lester C. Thurow puts it, ''loss allocation.'' The recent budget fight was a battle over who loses how much. And in the economic slump that would follow the next oil shock, the battle would be much more painful, intensifying social conflict as energy became an engine of ''ungrowth.'' Protectionist impulses would also mount, temporarily insulating some industries from the pressures of the world market, but also penalizing consumers, retarding adjustment, undermining critical Western-alliance relations and lowering overall incomes.
Reduced expectations would take a heavy toll in terms of increased discontent and a loss of confidence in the future, which would undermine the economic and political foundations of society and increase social and racial tensions. Certainly, bitterness, suspicion and a sense of betrayal would be rife.
In such circumstances, the basic legitimacy of our political system might be called into question, leaving the country vulnerable to demagogues who would offer firm authoritarian solutions.
There is a natural enough tendency to assume that such things simply cannot happen in the United States. Our political system has demonstrated a remarkable durability. But Franklin D. Roosevelt, who led the country through a protracted economic crisis, had his doubts. ''When I became President in 1932,'' he once said, ''it looked as if any extremist groups could gain tremendous following among the underprivileged and unemployed. Who knows? The United States might have had a dictator if the New Deal hadn't come along with a sensible program.''
My aim here is not to be apocalyptic, but rather to emphasize the seriousness of the challenge posed by energy -a challenge that could indeed lead to a crisis of the same magnitude as the Great Depression.
This is what the energy problem is really about. It is only prudent to con-sider such a scenario. But it is not inevitable, if we succeed in maintaining the momentum of adjustment. That is why we may now be in a time of decision.
There is an inherent contradiction between the short-term horizons of our political and business calendars - the next election and the next quarter - and the longer-term requirements of the adjustment process.
Nevertheless, what we need is a coherent response. It makes little sense to focus on just one aspect, as the Reagan Administration is doing by putting great emphasis on developing a military-deterrent capability for the Persian Gulf, while assuming that America's domestic energy problems are over.
Other countries are proceeding in a more rational fashion. Indeed, the country that has adjusted the most is Japan, which began from the most energy-spare base. In 1973, Japan used 57 percent as much energy for every unit of G.N.P. as the United States. By 1980, it used only 43 percent.
A basic consensus emerged in Japan in 1973 about the nature of the problem and what to do: It was dangerously dependent on imported oil; the rising costs threatened the balance of payments and were a major burden on the nation. Efficiency and fuel-switching had to be pushed; the economy had to be reoriented. There was a general agreement that Japan had to meet the long-term energy challenge in order to maintain its competitiveness in the world market.
Japan's response contrasts sharply with that of the United States, where a new energy policy seems to be announced every two years, and where there has been protracted debate as to whether there is a problem at all, let alone what it is and what to do about it. In Japan, the tradition is one of constraint. In America, the tradition is one of abundance. Rightly so. After all, the United States is also a significant oil producer: As late as 1952, it produced half the world's oil. But in the next two decades, we became the world's largest importer of oil. And we have little experience at being such a major consumer in a world market.
In the aftermath of the second oil shock, a consensus did start to emerge in the United States: In response to the events in the Middle East, the public began to accept the re-ality of the energy problem. But those ample supplies in the world oil market during the last two years caused the consensus to break down, gave rise to a ''glut'' psychology and led people once again - as they did in 1977 and 1978 - to dismiss the problem as a thing of the past.
Unfortunately, it is also a problem of the future. The challenge is inescapable. The last several years have demonstrated to liberals and conservatives alike the vitality of the market in responding to the swift change in the energy situation. Government has an important role in helping to correct the failures and imperfections of the market, to smooth out the instability that arises from fluctuations in oil prices and to bridge the gap between the short-term horizons of the private firm or individual and the longer-term horizon of the nation.
A reasonable program would channel capital and provide measured incentives to encourage alternative energy sources and conservation. It would stimulate innovative community-based programs and be responsive to the special needs of poor. It would support a broad energy research-and development effort. The current Administration claims that research and development is part of its energy budget, but it has sought an energy budget that would strangle most such programs - with the exception of nuclear power.
There is a great deal of ignorance in the United States about energy efficiency, and information and education programs, gutted by the Reagan Administration, need to be revived. The Government must provide assistance for synthetic-fuel development -not of the magnitude of the $88 billion superplan that the Carter Administration sought, but on a more moderate scale.
Finally, emergency-preparedness measures must be developed. Fireescape routes in skyscrapers are worked out in advance to avoid panic during an actual fire. Responses to oil emergencies need to be demarcated in advance for the same reasons. Currently, such planning is incomplete. The Reagan Administration, to its credit, continued the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve begun by Carter, and it has now reached 265 million barrels. But the Government intends to fill it only to 300 million barrels - perhaps a third of what it should be -because of storage problems. Otherwise, there has been lit-tle preparation.
In particular, the country needs to develop a plan for stockpile and inventory management, an emergency gas tax plan to lower demand and a program of fuel switching in an emergency. The episodes of panic in 1973 and 1979 proved very costly. A glut can turn to a shortfall on little more than an assassin's bullet, and the orderly and reasonable functioning of markets can be brutally overwhelmed by an upheaval and the sudden panic of the unprepared.
Much change, some of it very damaging and impoverishing, has been compressed into a few short years. We now need time to permit the flowering of innovation and technology that will allow the 21st century to look back on these years as a trying interlude, but one safely managed. This is a reasonable and prudent goal. But to achieve it, we must cope wisely and realistically with the pervasive global insecurity that has been caused by earthquakes in the prices, the availability and reliability of world energy supplies. The terrain - political, economic and physical - makes further earthquakes very likely.

Full text: Finance ministers from the seven major Western industrial democracies announced today that they would try to align their national economic policies more closely in the future and would also study ways of making the dollar more stable on international currency markets.
The agreement, aimed ultimately at fostering economic recovery an lowering unemployment throughout the world, is likely to emerge as the most important accomplishment of this year's Western economic meeting, which ends here Sunday.
As a result of the agreement, high economic officials from the United States, Britain, West Germany, France and Japan plan to meet regularly at the International Monetary Fund's headquarters in Washington. They will jointly examine one another's economic policies, trying to insure that they conform to shared targets, such as the need to reduce inflation and encourage private investment.
Canada and Italy, the two other major nations represented at the Versailles meeting, may also join the group. Joint Study Planned
At the same time, finance ministers said the seven major nations at the meeting would undertake a joint study to see whether governments can really do more to stabilize the value of their currencies against the dollar by intervening on international monetary markets, as many European governments believe.
European governments have been complaining for some time that their economies are being damaged by major fluctuations in the dollar's value as it soars on currency markets. These fluctuations disrupt trade and investment plans of other nations and often force them to raise their domestic interest rates.
High European participants here generally welcomed the new agreement, saying it shows that the Reagan Administration is ready to cooperate more closely with its allies over economic matters and may intervene more to keep the dollar stable against their currencies.
President Francois Mitterrand of France, at a news conference today, called the new agreement ''the beginning of a medium-term reconstruction of the internaional monetary system.'' The West German Finance Minister, Manfred Lahnstein, spoke of the Reagan Administration's adopting ''a different philosophy'' and said he expected ''a greater U.S. readiness to intervene in future.'' Treasury Chief Denies Shift
But the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Donald T. Regan, strongly denied today that there had been any major shift in American policy on the dollar.
Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Regan said the United States still believed the best way to stabilize currency values is for other countries to adopt tough anti-inflationary policies that will reduce their inflation rates to the current low level in the United States. Bringing about such a ''convergence'' of Western economic policies was the main reason why countries had agreed to try to coordinate their policies more closely in the International Monetary Fund, he said.
The Reagan Administration, he insisted, will still only intervene to combat ''disorderly markets'' and will never try to change ''the main direction that the dollar might be moving.'' When U.S. Will Intervene
The Treasury Secretary concluded: ''If it is a strong dollar, we are not going to intervene to weaken it. If it is a weak dollar, we are not going to intervene to make it strong. If it is a disorderly market in the dollar, we will intervene.''
The Under Secretary of the Treasury, Beryl Sprinkel, explaining the American point of view in more detail, said all Western nations agreed in 1976 that the key to currency stability lay in a better coordination of national economic policies. He said they had agreed to let the International Monetary Fund exercise ''close surveillance'' over the way individual nations conduct their affairs.
But this surveillance has been conducted only between the I.M.F. staff and the country concerned. The idea now is to substitute ''multilateral surveillance'' of the policies of major nations by their peers, in the hope this will prove more effective in getting them to agree on common goals.
While the new five-nation I.M.F. committee has no power to compel members to change policy, Mr. Sprinkel said, it would exercise ''moral persuasion,'' pointing out the consequences of following inflationary policies. Doubts Government's Impact
Mr. Sprinkel said the Reagan Administration had already concluded on the basis of its own studies that attempts to influence the dollar's market value by government intervention ''do not work.'' But in agreeing to the new study, he said, it would be ''looking at the evidence again.'' .
''I'm from Missouri,'' he added. ''Show me that it works.'' Speaking to reporters Friday night, Finance Minister Jacques Delors of France said a new United States commitment to do more to control the dollar's value on markets was ''implicit'' in the agreement.
By highlighting the significance of today's monetary agreement, officials say, European leaders want to encourage the Reagan Administration to cooperate more closely with them on economic matters in the future, after their prolonged quarrel over high American interest rates.
The European leaders hope that the United States will now take more account of their interests through the talks on policy coordination in the I.M.F. and through the work on the new intevention study. Agreement Called Significant
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was quoted today by his spokesman as saying the agreement was significant because after years of calling for closer monetary cooperation between the Western nations, an economic conference had at least produced concrete action.
''For the last six summits we've talked about cooperation. Now we have least recognized that everyone is responsible,'' Mr. Schmidt was quoted as saying.
Today's agreement may also prove politically useful for President Mitterrand, officials say, as he struggles to bolster the plunging French franc and curb soaring inflation.
The commitment to align France's domestic economic policies with those of its neighbors may help him win support for the unpopular austerity mesures that will needed to stabilize the franc and reduce inflation.

Abstract: ''Unemployment is increasing in all industrial countries,'' he continued, ''and there is no sign that this will change very soon. On the contrary, even if economic activity picks up in the course of this year or at least next year, unemployment will stay at levels which can only be compared with those the Western world saw during the thirties.'' Indeed, some private bankers in both Britain, West Germany and the United States are very worried that, instead, the world is in for a long spell of depressed activity and unemployment. The leading economic spokesman of West German banking, Wilfried Guth of the Deutsche Bank, said, for instance, that he expects the scope for world economic growth to remain ''rather limited'' throughout the 1980's, and that growth is more likely to be found in some OPEC countries and a number of the newly industrialized countries of the third world than in the older industrial countries. Mr. Guth warned that, due to their low profitability and capital erosion in a period of limited growth with continued inflation, companies in the highly industrialized countries are becoming more susceptible to ''unforeseen and problematical situations.'' He has told his fellow bankers to be wary because in such a setting ''the insolvencies of formerly reputable international companies are no longer unthinkable.''

Full text: ONE goes to a summit for the view. But the view from this year's economic summit at the palace of the Sun King is not particularly inspiring. In fact, it seems somewhat depressing.
Dark clouds from the current recession - the second in three years - hang over Western Europe, North America and even Japan, and official policies seem incapable of blowing them away.
The jobless rolls in Western Europe have climbed above 10 million, two million more than a year ago. In the United States, the unemployed exceed 10 million, also two million more than last year at this time.
Even the Japanese economy seems stalled, as other countries dig in against efforts by Japan to solve its domestic problems by exporting more goods to them.
Among the 24 industrial countries, the Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development predicts, unemployment could approach 30 million by the end of this year. And this severe unemployment, which will blight lives and further strain the social service capacities of various governments and economies, may persist throughout the decade, should the noninflationary policies now in vogue fail to work.
That prospect clearly worries bankers and other financial minds. Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, recently stated: ''If I were to try to draw a conclusion from the hours and hours of intensive discussions with finance ministers, central bank governors and other people bearing high responsibility, the outlook would be rather gloomy.
''Unemployment is increasing in all industrial countries,'' he continued, ''and there is no sign that this will change very soon. On the contrary, even if economic activity picks up in the course of this year or at least next year, unemployment will stay at levels which can only be compared with those the Western world saw during the thirties.''
The waves of inflation have receded, although in a few countries, including France, Canada and Italy, the underlying wage and price trends remain disturbingly high. Anxiety that inflation could flare anew prevents governments from trying to cure unemployment by adopting more stimulative fiscal and monetary policies.
Looking down on the financial sector from Versailles, the ranges of interest rates look very high, especially in the United States. Those high rates appear to reflect anxieties over the sustainability of economic recovery, assuming that it starts during the second half of this year. There is a deeply perceived threat to the survival of many businesses if it does not.
And high unemployment and excess industrial capacity also threatens the open trading system that has nourished world economic growth during the postwar years.
A summit is not the occasion for merely contemplating current political and economic disorders but for peering into the future. Though it is part of the summit routine for the heads of state to express confidence about the future, many of the economic seers who advise both government and business leaders are anything but confident.
UNCERTAINTIES abound in the banking and business world in Europe. Many of the best-informed analysts swing, in the course of a single conversation, between optimism and pessimism.
''Matters could turn out to be significantly better or worse,'' Christopher W. McMahon, deputy governor of the Bank of England, told a recent conference in London. An optimist could make a case, he said, for believing that the extent to which inflation has been brought down has been underestimated by the public and the markets, and that, as realization of the improvement spreads, interest rates might fall and sustainable, noninflationary growth begin.
But on the other hand, Mr. McMahon noted, a pessimist could point to serious risks: ''He could argue that until the tension between fiscal and monetary policy in the United States is resolved, doubts must remain about any early or significant reduction in interest rates there and about the strength of any general upturn in the United States economy.
''More generally, he could be concerned as to how economies may react to a long period of high real interest rates. And there is a separate and related question of how far debtors - be they countries or industrial companies - will be able to adjust to the higher real cost of servicing their borrowing.''
While concern is deep here over big United States budget deficits and high rates of interest, foreign heads of state and their advisers are loath to attack President Reagan directly on the issue by criticizing his large tax cuts or rapid military buildup. ''Those are domestic American issues,'' one high British official said.
BUT they recognize, glumly, that the budgetary problem is not likely to be resolved soon by the surrender in Congress of the Democrats, or recalcitrant Republicans, to the President's proposals for further deep cuts in social programs.
Except for France and Canada, which have tried to pursue a more expansionist course, the foreign leaders agree with the priority the Reagan Administration has given to bringing down the rate of inflation over measures to check rising unemployment.
Politically, they believe that sluggish economies and climbing unemployment have not proven the disasters their critics claimed they would be. Economically, they insist their policies are working - or will, given time.
Their economic advisers, with rare exceptions, believe that efforts to promote more rapid economic growth by expansive fiscal and monetary policies would only revive inflation and lead to new setbacks.
No country seems capable of pursuing such expansionist policies on their own. As inflationary expectations mount, investment in domestic industry founders, capital may flee, unemployment rises and exchange rates fall, aggravating the inflation.
This has been true not only of France under President Francois Mitterrand but of Canada under Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Both countries tried to go for growth, to cut unemployment, but both have run into trouble on the price front and in the international exchanges.
In France, financial markets have seemed unwilling to permit the big budget deficit and external deficit that a go-for-growth policy would have necessitated.
The Canadian economy grew strongly in 1981, but the rise in inflationary pressures that accompanied this growth made the Goverment switch again to restrictive policies that, in combination with climbing United States interest rates, threw Canada into the second dip of a double-dip recession. Even so, Canadian inflation still runs above 10 percent.
French and Canadian political leaders are not prepared to throw in the sponge yet on their effort to promote a higher rate of growth. They are considering stronger incomes policies to control inflation as they aim at stronger growth. And they favor joint action among the Western countries to sustain their own expansive policies.
But the conservative politicians and economists representing the Governments of the United States, Britain, West Germany and Japan have concluded there is no real alternative to sticking with restrictive fiscal and monetary policies that, by curbing inflation, will eventually establish the conditions for sustainable growth.
For the most part, private bankers and industrialists agree, but not happily or with the confidence of the theorists who insist that, very soon, healthy economic growth will be resumed, provided the fight against inflation is not relaxed.
Indeed, some private bankers in both Britain, West Germany and the United States are very worried that, instead, the world is in for a long spell of depressed activity and unemployment. The leading economic spokesman of West German banking, Wilfried Guth of the Deutsche Bank, said, for instance, that he expects the scope for world economic growth to remain ''rather limited'' throughout the 1980's, and that growth is more likely to be found in some OPEC countries and a number of the newly industrialized countries of the third world than in the older industrial countries.
Mr. Guth warned that, due to their low profitability and capital erosion in a period of limited growth with continued inflation, companies in the highly industrialized countries are becoming more susceptible to ''unforeseen and problematical situations.'' He has told his fellow bankers to be wary because in such a setting ''the insolvencies of formerly reputable international companies are no longer unthinkable.''
IN London, some of the leading financial minds are highly critical of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for believing that all that is needed to set the country back on the growth track is a tough antiinflation policy that bangs sense into the trade unions - causing wage restraint and rising productivity - and forces reform and rising efficiencies upon delinquent companies and industries.
One London merchant banker said of Mrs. Thatcher: ''She does not seem to realize that, just as prosperity lifts all the boats, as President Kennedy said, high interest rates can sink them all - wellrun companies and badly run companies alike.''
Looking down from the summit, one can espy many problem sectors in world trade - petrochemicals, agricultural products, textiles, steel, autos - and plenty of problem regions - Eastern Europe, the developing countries, and the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
There remains anxiety that OPEC, its power unbroken, will be able to exert greater leverage on prices once again - especially once world economic recovery begins.
And military and trade confrontations between East and West are high on the Versailles summit agenda, as is the impact of government spending on such sectors as aircraft, computers, telecommunications, electronics, and nuclear weapons and materials.
Obviously, one should not expect too much from a three-day summit, but the United States and its partners seem prepared to do a measure of policy trading to strengthen Western cooperation on economic policy, shore up the international trading system and reach a consensus on East-West trade. That would allow all the Western leaders to come down from the summit proclaiming the spoils of victory and asserting that they had restored confidence.
But all the ''hip, hip, hurrahs!'' at the end will not conceal the truth that the Western leaders lack a theory and a policy for setting the industrial world back on the road to strong and steady growth. And the concern about the troubles created by United States fiscal policy and its huge deficits and high interest rates will persist long after Versailles.

FED RETURNS TO M-1 AS ITS KEY MEASURE

Publication info: New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]16 Jan 1982: 2.39.

Abstract: For the last two years, M-1 was replaced by M-1A, M-1B and shiftadjusted M-1B as the Fed tried to keep its definition of money supply in line with the latest changes in checking and savings accounts. Those changes in the rules limiting interest rates on deposits have been drastically weakened since inflation and interest rates began rising in 1974. The result has been big shifts of funds as households tried to get the best deal for their money. Crucial in Measuring Inflation These decisions are not easy, and that is why the old M-1 measure - currency plus noninterest-bearing checking accounts at commercial banks -was reworked into M-1A and M-1B. Except for some technical changes related to interbank deposits, the M-1A measure was the same as the old M-1 and consisted of currency plus noninterest-bearing checking accounts at commercial banks.

Full text: Monetary economists and others who follow the Federal Reserve's weekly money supply reports for clues about future interest rates said goodbye this week to M-1A, M-1B and shift-adjusted M-1B and greeted the return of the old familiar M-1 measure.
Of course, M-1 does not look quite the same as in late 1979 when it was temporarily replaced, but it is still considered the most accurate measure of money held by the public and ava ilable for spending. The new M-1 is the same as the old M-1B, which consisted ofcurrency and all kinds of checking accounts.

Since monetary theory holds that changes in the amount of spendable money held by the public are crucial in determining economic growth and inflation, it is essential that the Federal Reserve keep track of changes in the way the public holds its spendable money, called transactions balances by economists. Besides measuring the new accounts, the Fed needed to decide if they were used by the public as a resting place for spendable funds or funds likely to be saved.
These decisions are not easy, and that is why the old M-1 measure - currency plus noninterest-bearing checking accounts at commercial banks -was reworked into M-1A and M-1B. Except for some technical changes related to interbank deposits, the M-1A measure was the same as the old M-1 and consisted of currency plus noninterest-bearing checking accounts at commercial banks.
M-1B, however, was more broadly defined and more closely watched by monetary policy makers because it included M-1A plus all other checklike accounts offered by banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations (where they are called negotiable orders of withdrawal), and credit unions (called share drafts).
In 1980, the nationwide advent of interest-bearing checking accounts at commercial banks prompted the Fed to modify its M-1B definition to exclude that portion of the new interest-bearing checking accounts that was merely transferred from existing savings accounts.
The adjustment was determined by surveys and totaled about $12 billion by the end of 1981. Now, Fed officials think the interestbearing checking accounts have been aroun d long enough so that the shift from savings accounts is mostl y completed.
The money market mutual funds are currently included in M-2, but Fed officials have serious problems using that measure as a monetary policy tool. Besides money market mutual funds, M-2 consists of M-1 plus savings deposits of less than $100,000 and certain short-term borrowing by banks in the domestic and Eurodollar money markets.

Abstract: Walter F. Mondale, former Vice President of the United States, is of counsel to the law firm of Winston & Strawn and a visiting professor at three universities in Minnesota. By Walter F. Mondale It's been about a year now since my previous employer informed me that my contract would not be renewed. In that year, I've had the opportunity to do a number of things that nationally elected leaders too rarely have the chance to do: to engage in extended discussions with people who are not regular visitors to the White House, to read extensively, to explore long-term issues without the pressures of day-to-day crisis management. This year has meant more to me than simply moving from the West Wing of the White House to a law office on Washington's M Street and new teaching positions in my state of Minnesota. It's meant a chance to refresh myself spiritually and restock the shelves intellectually. And I'm eagerly taking advantage of this opportunity. There have clearly been many major changes in my life since leaving the Vice Presidency. But while the motorcades and state visits, the Air Force jets and constant press entourage are gone, most of that formed a kind of gilded cage that I don't miss. It's true that on election night my wife Joan said I awoke in a sweat at 3 A.M. muttering, ''How will I get to the airport?'' But I've found I can handle that on my own after all. Remarkably, I'm also capable of dialing my own phone and driving my own car. I've very consciously set out to widen the voices and viewpoints that I hear. I've sought out individuals associated with new ideas in economic and social policy. I've deliberately spent a lot of time in the South and West. And I've done a lot of talking with business people who haven't been automatically drawn to the kind of progressive traditions that are my roots. The study and lecturing I've done with Minnesota students under the auspices of the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, Macalester College, and the College of St. Thomas have not only helped me focus my thoughts, they've also enabled me to learn what the next generation of Americans is thinking about. I welcome the chances I get to meet and talk with people outside a political gathering or fund-raiser. This process of reaching out is not prompted by idle curiosity. It strikes at the central challenge facing the Democratic Party today. In an era of heightened and proper concern about efficiency and economy in government, we must search for better ways to achieve those objectives without abandoning the values of fairness and compassion. We cannot turn deaf ears to those concerns, or pretend they will soon pass away. We must carefully sift through the desires and demands of Americans who never attend meetings of either political party, who have felt shut out and who must be a part of any successful progressive coalition.

Full text: Walter F. Mondale, former Vice President of the United States, is of counsel to the law firm of Winston & Strawn and a visiting professor at three universities in Minnesota. By Walter F. Mondale It's been about a year now since my previous employer informed me that my contract would not be renewed. In that year, I've had the opportunity to do a number of things that nationally elected leaders too rarely have the chance to do: to engage in extended discussions with people who are not regular visitors to the White House, to read extensively, to explore long-term issues without the pressures of day-to-day crisis management. This year has meant more to me than simply moving from the West Wing of the White House to a law office on Washington's M Street and new teaching positions in my state of Minnesota. It's meant a chance to refresh myself spiritually and restock the shelves intellectually. And I'm eagerly taking advantage of this opportunity.
Of course, there has been plenty of opportunity to reflect on the changes occurring in my personal life and in our national life. Perhaps the moment when the election results first really hit home was during a trip to San Francisco last winter. After four years of fairly regular television appearances on the network news and weekend public-affairs programs, I found myself booked onto a local television talk show. And as I waited to go on, I found I was to be interviewed along with a gentleman who performed high dives into a bathtub full of snakes, another gentleman whose claim was that he had placed a personal advertisement for a wife in the local newspapers, and other not-ready-for-prime-time personalities.
There have clearly been many major changes in my life since leaving the Vice Presidency. But while the motorcades and state visits, the Air Force jets and constant press entourage are gone, most of that formed a kind of gilded cage that I don't miss. It's true that on election night my wife Joan said I awoke in a sweat at 3 A.M. muttering, ''How will I get to the airport?'' But I've found I can handle that on my own after all. Remarkably, I'm also capable of dialing my own phone and driving my own car.
In many ways, I welcome the privacy possible now that I no longer have a squadron of Secret Service agents and a bus load of reporters as constant companions. I can drive through Washington and Minneapolis without looking like a part of a funeral cortege. And I can carry on a conversation without every nuance being dissected for political and policy implications.
To be sure, there can be too much of these good things. I have been and intend to remain a force in American politics. And as a once and future political leader, I find that people are eager to meet with me and share their ideas. The personal relationships I have developed with foreign heads of state, top businessmen, labor leaders and public officials facilitate continued frank discussion.
Moreover, I would not trade the experience of the last four years for anything. As Hubert Humphrey predicted, as Vice President I learned more about our country, more about the world in which we live, more about the machinery of government - when it works well and when it bogs down - than during my previous 16 years in public life. I have seen, firsthand, the burdens a President must be willing to shoulder, the complexities of the issues he must confront, the challenges he must accept - and they are formidable. These are things I would never have understood as fully had I not served four years as Vice President. Today one of the first questions I am asked is whether I plan to run for President in 1984. Given the volatility of American political life for the last two decades, it's pointless to make any definitive statements regarding my candidacy for any public office. But I regard public service as a high calling, and I'm not turning in my Holiday Inn charge card.
Fortunately, many of the things I would need to do if I were a candidate for national office are things I'm disposed to do anyway after 20 years of public life. I feel both a desire and an obligation to speak out on important issues. I also feel a responsibility to offer aid and counsel to candidates and organizations supporting progressive goals. And I feel my experience can be helpful in shaping the solutions to the critical problems this country faces at home and abroad.
Thus I've been very busy during the last few months not only meeting with people and making speeches around the country but also reading and thinking. It provides a rare chance for spiritual renewal and intellectual replenishment.
After four years of working in the White House, I came away deeply troubled by the way this country's political leaders are forced to live off their intellectual capital, with little hope of adding to it. The pressures of the executive branch of Government require that every issue be summarized and categorized and filtered through intermediaries so that decisions can be made on a timely basis. The epitome of good staff work in Washington too often comes down to a three-page decision memo. Read it, choose an option, and on to the next subject. Often there's too little room or not enough time for subtlety or complexity. And there's little opportunity to see things firsthand.
After four years of that, I have welcomed a chance to read, to reflect, to have an open exchange of views. Recently I read extensively on energy before attending a conference in California, and there I talked to a wide range of people on the most critical energy issues in the 1980's. Before a trip to study NATO in June, I arranged a series of substantive briefings, dug into the best articles and books available, and, I believe, had a very effective trip. In my international travel I find I can draw on the personal relationships I built with foreign leaders during 14 international missions as Vice President. I also made a point of talking to leaders of opposition parties. For example, in Israel I had very fruitful meetings with both Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Shimon Peres, the opposition leader, when I was there in June to receive an honorary degree from Hebrew University.
I've very consciously set out to widen the voices and viewpoints that I hear. I've sought out individuals associated with new ideas in economic and social policy. I've deliberately spent a lot of time in the South and West. And I've done a lot of talking with business people who haven't been automatically drawn to the kind of progressive traditions that are my roots. The study and lecturing I've done with Minnesota students under the auspices of the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, Macalester College, and the College of St. Thomas have not only helped me focus my thoughts, they've also enabled me to learn what the next generation of Americans is thinking about. I welcome the chances I get to meet and talk with people outside a political gathering or fund-raiser. This process of reaching out is not prompted by idle curiosity. It strikes at the central challenge facing the Democratic Party today. In an era of heightened and proper concern about efficiency and economy in government, we must search for better ways to achieve those objectives without abandoning the values of fairness and compassion. We cannot turn deaf ears to those concerns, or pretend they will soon pass away. We must carefully sift through the desires and demands of Americans who never attend meetings of either political party, who have felt shut out and who must be a part of any successful progressive coalition.
Progressives shouldn't simply say ''me too.'' But we must be willing to re-examine old priorities and shibboleths. Liberal and progressive leaders, for example, must concede we have stumbled on the issue of crime. We are recognizing that it is not simply a code word for racism or a form of urban paranoia. There is a deeply felt and widely shared concern in this country that the peaceable life many expected seems threatened.
And when a progressive response to this concern is not forthcoming, the ground has been seized by the lock-em-up-and-throw-away-the-key school of thought. It's clear progressive forces need to offer something more substantial in this area, and I've begun working on this issue. I've met with Patrick Murphy, the former Police Commissioner of New York City and Detroit, with former District of Columbia police chief Maurice J. Cullinane, and with various United States Attorneys and others to learn what they think. I've been reading and looking for ideas that go beyond the cliches of crime in the streets. Progressives must find an approach that provides justice and compassion but still makes sure that criminals will be punished. Ultimately the success of everything we do as a nation depends on a healthy and growing economy. The problems of inflation, high unemployment, and low economic growth touch everyone in this country and were central to the 1980 election results. Ironically, progressives have ended up labeled soft on inflation even though inflation strikes hardest at those whom progressives have traditionally been concerned about. The poor, the elderly, the middle-income wage earners - these are the people who have no portfolios of floatingrate notes nor rapidly appreciating real estate to help them ride the inflationary wave.
Progressive forces have not been oblivious to inflation. I helped slow the growth of the Federal budget in my last two years in office. Indeed, the Carter Administration began talk of budget cutting as an anti-inflationary measure early on. But it is clear we were not vigorous enough in making our concerns felt.
At this point, there is a broad national consensus in favor of restraining the Federal budget and getting inflation under control. It is a goal we can all accept, for inflation is destructive not only of a nation's currency and economy but of its integrity, unity and compassion as well.
Yet firm opposition to inflation and swollen deficits should not be transformed into a rejection of the last 50 years of social progress. No one has been given a mandate to do that, and no one has been given a mandate to be cruel. The American people have not abandoned their traditional values. There is an enhanced interest in effective government, but not at the expense of compassion and fairness. Wherever I go in this country, when the talk turns to welfare frauds and swollen bureaucracies, people get angry. But talk of cutting out minimum Social Security benefits makes them truly livid. In the current economic environment, the American people have a perfectly legitimate desire to get their money's worth out of their tax payments. But they still want and deserve a secure retirement. They're not so selfish that they are unwilling to help those who need help.
We have achieved much as a people because we have listened to our conscience. The history of America has not consisted of closing doors, but of opening doors of opportunity. Our efforts to ensure voting rights and provide legal services, quality elementary and secondary education, fair housing, job training, school lunches and a range of other basic services, all helped promote equal opportunity for all Americans. Because of these actions, millions of people have been able to contribute to and share in the abundance and richness of this country. As we respond to new challenges, we must remain true to our history, and continue to open up opportunities for every citizen and family.
We must be wary of putting too much faith in catchy but simplistic economic theories. In West Germany, government spending is greater than in the United States in terms of relative Gross National Product; moreover, the Germans' tax burdens are higher, their government regulations are at least as extensive, and their dependence on imported energy is much greater. Yet their economy has been growing more rapidly and with less inflation than ours. There aren't any fast, easy solutions, and this country's economy needs more than an injection of supply or demand. We must revive American productivity and ingenuity in order to assure our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly emerging global economic system.
Economic success in the world now depends as heavily on brainpower and technology as earlier economic systems once relied on coal and the steam engine. We need all the scientific and managerial and entrepreneurial skills we can develop in this country. If we are to rekindle the creative genius of American technology, however, we need to invest heavily in the development of our people as well as our capital equipment. Over the years, education has been the best investment this country has made, and we shouldn't shortchange it now. If we continue to provide our young people with opportunity and decent education, then this nation will achieve its full potential as well.
Beyond making a commitment to develop our vital human resources, a sound economic policy must also encourage American industry to look to the future. Americans often have short time horizons. Just as political leaders find it difficult to look beyond the next election, today's business leaders have a hard time looking beyond the next quarterly earnings statement and labor leaders find it tough to think beyond the next contract negotiations. But we need an economic framework that assures the business and financial community that the Government is not gambling with the economy and that the nation is on a sure and steady economic course. We must offer incentives for looking to the future, for making long-term investments, for reducing unemployment, for developing new technologies and new forms of industrial organization. We need economic policies that understand the particularly dire effects of inflation and high interest rates on small-business owners and farmers.
And they must be policies which address the long-term challenges of managing our natural resources. Becoming self-sufficient in energy; providing certain and abundant water supplies for our communities, farms and industries; assuring the continuous flow of raw and strategic materials to our industries, and making certain that our abundant natural resources are wisely developed and carefully used - these are fundamental challenges we face. We must make certain that business, labor and government cooperate and agree on specific goals to insure that our industries, farms and cities have the energy, water and raw materials they need to produce and grow.
I am concerned that progressives have sometimes failed to come to grips with the role of American business. Many progressives have not really been at odds with business so much as uninterested in it. Business seemed eminently capable of taking care of itself. But progressives haven't thought enough about the constraints and problems facing small-business owners and corporate executives. As a new member of the boards of directors of two companies, Control Data Corporation and Columbia Pictures Industries Inc., I've seen why business leaders often feel government has gone overboard on regulation, clogging their desks with mountains of paper work and overly detailed regulations.
A responsiveness to the needs and concerns of business is important not only to formulate successful economic policies but also to achieve progressive social goals. Over the last few years it has become clear that a growing, non-inflationary economy may be the most essential element of a program for advancing social justice. When the economic pie is growing, it's much easier to cut a slice for new members of the community. When people believe their own economic situation is secure, they can be more compassionate toward others. Equal opportunity is more easily shared when there is an abundance of opportunities for everybody.
Thus, the starting point for progressive economic and social policies is the provision of a proper framework for promoting sustainable economic growth and price stability. But this is unlikely to be achieved with untested theories grounded largely in faith, hope or charity for the rich. We must be responsive to business needs without being subservient to them.
In formulating economic policies, moreover, we must recognize we can no longer act unilaterally. The global economic system has extended too far to permit that. A policy of high interest rates in this country, for example, does more than stifle our own economy. As government leaders in Italy, France and West Germany have told me recently, high United States interest rates also throttle the growth of their own economies, undermine their aspirations and reduce their real contribution to our mutual defense.
As recently as a dozen years ago, foreign trade mattered relatively little in this country. But the percentage of our Gross National Product involved in international trade has doubled in the last decade and continues to grow. More and more goods and services are being bought and sold on world markets. We should welcome this, and recognize we need the earnings from foreign trade to help pay for our energy imports. As our economy becomes increasingly intertwined with the economies of other nations, our economic policies cannot ignore the rest of the world, not simply because it isn't right, but more fundamentally because it is no longer possible. All of our international relations must reflect the interdependence among nations as well as the deeply human purpose we can bring to the exercise of American power and influence. When we have lost sight of our national purpose, we have made our greatest mistakes in foreign affairs, and when we have recalled that purpose, we have reached our greatest achievements. As we learned in Vietnam, the exercise of American power can neglect that purpose only at the peril of losing our ideals at home as well as abroad.
There are some who advocate a foreign policy shaped solely by the need to confront and contain the Soviet Union. Relations with all other nations would be determined and measured by the extent to which they affected the competition with the Russians. Such a single-mindedness is unfortunate and counterproductive.
Of course the confrontation with the Soviet Union is not to be taken lightly. The Soviet leadership has continued to build up its military forces while remaining eager to fan the flames of discontent in far corners of the world. Lacking a mechanism for any orderly transfer of power, the Kremlin remains locked in the hands of aged leaders unable to accept the prospect of a new era in external relations.
We must respond to them from a position of strength. I was one of those who strongly advocated an increase in defense spending in the late 1970's. Indeed, from 1976 to 1980, United States defense spending rose 10 percent in real terms, compared to a 35 percent drop in the previous eight years. I continue to believe a strong military capability is an essential element of foreign policy and a major deterrent to aggression. This summer I toured United States military bases in Europe to see firsthand the state of our forces. I also met with General Bernard W. Rogers, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, and received a lengthy briefing at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. But being tough-minded about defense does not mean being permissive about waste in the defense budget. And we must remember our arsenal cannot be the sum total of our foreign policy. We must have something to offer besides a strong sword, and we must stand for something besides an ability to employ force. There are many components of national security beyond armaments. There is the security of our energy supplies, for example, which can free us from the threat of economic blackmail.
Even more fundamentally, a major wellspring of international strength for this country is the attractiveness of our society in the eyes of others. In my travels I am constantly amazed at the allure of things American. Wherever I go, of course, I find blue jeans and American popular music. In many countries, the height of fashion seems to be a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of such American institutions as Harvard, U.C.L.A., the Green Bay Packers and the New York Yankees.
But more importantly, there is also a widespread view of this country as a symbol of certain values beyond material success. I remember vividly listening to the president of Senegal invoke the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And I can recall few prouder moments as Vice President than my meeting with Nigerian leaders after that country adopted a federal constitution patterned after our own. The power of example may well be the greatest power that we have. We must recognize how valuable it is to stand for something. Ignoring human rights raises the risk of misunderstanding and distrust of our motives abroad and erosion of support for our foreign policy at home. We do not need to choose between standing for our interests or defending our values abroad: The point is, they go together.
As Vice President, some of my most difficult challenges involved the fight for human rights - in southern Africa, South America and the Philippines. In Manila, I met with courageous religious and intellectual leaders on human rights at the same time I worked directly with President Ferdinand E. Marcos on the lease renewal for Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base. These two bases are vital to the national security of the United States. While it strains our diplomatic skill, our emphasis on human rights is an important aspect of pursuing our national interest.
These days there are some who say that there are significant differences between right-wing authoritarian regimes and left-wing totalitarian regimes, and that we must tolerate the terror of one and condemn the terror of the other. Among repressive regimes, there may well be differences in the way they organize their economies or part their hair or even in the pretexts they give for repression. But between the army colonel who tortures Jacobo Timerman and the central committee which tortures Anatoly Shcharansky, there is not one iota of moral difference. Torture is torture and terror is terror, and this country should do its best to stop it wherever it occurs.
The advancement of our moral concerns for humanity and democracy, freedom and justice is profoundly in our national interest; it is not an ethereal, idealistic approach but rather an eminently hardheaded one. Regimes which torture their citizens are unlikely to be stable allies. Leaders who mistreat religious or racial groups are leaders whose hold on power may be brief. Offering unreserved support to corrupt governments simply because they are in power or because they are anti-Communist is a recipe for eventual disaster. Selfinterest as well as self-respect should keep us from zealously courting despots.
When we set aside our values in an expedient pursuit of narrow interests, we often end up advancing neither our values nor our interests. Every day that the Soviet Union shows its concept of human values in Afghanistan, in Poland and in Moscow, it advertises its moral and political bankruptcy to countries in which it is competing with us for influence. And every day that we pursue our values, we are strengthened in our dealings with nations and we advance the kind of democratic and humane world in which we can be most secure.
As all of us in this nation search for ways to deal with the problems we face as Americans, this country must be wary of letting any apparent threat, whether economic or military, foreign or domestic, entice us into dispensing with two centuries of concern for the principles of freedom, justice and compassion. The principles which gave our country birth and sustenance will continue to serve us well if we keep faith with them.
After 20 years in public life, I join most Americans in getting my ''briefings'' from the morning paper and the evening news, in watching events in the nation and the world unfold and trying my best to understand and interpret. I am ever-conscious of our nation's strength and resilience and ability to solve problems.
I relish the opportunity to participate in this process. And I intend to do so -with everything that's in me.

Abstract: Speaking at the end of the session, Mr. [Olof Palme] said there had been ''a general consensus that there is now a strong economic case for disarmament.'' The $500 billion a year spent on weapons, he said, is ''tying up resources and skilled manpower that can be more profitably used in other ways.'' In addition, Mr. Palme said the commission generally agreed that ''the beneficial effects of defense spending on employment and technological development tend to be exaggerated and will become more so in future.'' Prof. Emma Rothschild of M.I.T. told the commission that military spending created ''relatively little employment'' because of the increasing sophistication of modern weapons and that it tended to promote inflation by creating shortages of raw materials and skilled labor.

Full text: An international panel on disarmament agreed this weekend that the increased military spending that President Reagan is advocating to match Soviet spending risked making the world's economy worse rather than better.
The panel, known as the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues, was created last year under the chairmanship of former Prime Minister Olof Palme of Sweden to act as a high-level pressure group for world disarmanent.
It took as its model the Brandt Commission on development problems, a group headed by former Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany. The commission achieved a major success last week when 22 leaders of industrialized and developing nations held a meeting in Cancun, Mexico. The meeting had been organized at the Brandt Commission's suggestion.
Prominent members of the disarmament commission, which was holding its seventh meeting, include former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance; Dr. David Owen, former Foreign Secretary of Britain; Georgi A. Arbatov, a member of the Soviet Central Committee; Lieut. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former Nigerian head of state, and former Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil of Egypt.
Speaking at the end of the session, Mr. Palme said there had been ''a general consensus that there is now a strong economic case for disarmament.'' The $500 billion a year spent on weapons, he said, is ''tying up resources and skilled manpower that can be more profitably used in other ways.''
In addition, Mr. Palme said the commission generally agreed that ''the beneficial effects of defense spending on employment and technological development tend to be exaggerated and will become more so in future.''
At previous meetings, the commission has supported the creation of nuclear-free zones as a concrete step toward more effective arms control; urged the United States and the Soviet Union to preserve their treaty limiting deployment of antiballistic missile systems, and called on Washington and Moscow to negotiate reductions in their European nuclear arsenals, as they have now agreed to do at talks that are to begin in Geneva on Nov. 30.
At closed sessions this weekend, participants said the commission examined studies by outside experts that argued that higher arms spending was more likely to promote inflation and unemployment today than stimulate economic recovery, unlike the situation in World War II, when heavy military spending helped pull the industrial world out of the Depression.
Prof. Lester C. Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the American economy could safely afford any level of military spending considered necessary for national security, provided it was financed properly.
In the Korean War, he said, the United States Government wisely raised taxes and imposed controls on the economy to limit the inflationary impact of higher military spending. But, Mr. Thurow said, President Johnson tried to pay for the Vietnam War while also increasing social spending, leading to inflation and recession.
In Professor Thurow's view, President Reagan is in danger of repeating this mistake by combining an increase in military spending and lower taxes. Already, the professor said, the result is high United States interest rates that are depressing the world economy.
Prof. Emma Rothschild of M.I.T. told the commission that military spending created ''relatively little employment'' because of the increasing sophistication of modern weapons and that it tended to promote inflation by creating shortages of raw materials and skilled labor.
Another study, which was written by a Soviet specialist who was not identified and submitted by the Soviet representatives, blamed the United States and its European allies for the arms race. But what interested Western participants was the study's plea for disarmament on the ground that high military spending is absorbing scarce resources badly needed by civil industry in the Soviet Union as well as in the West.

Abstract: Not everyone on Wall Street is critical of the President. Morris Cohen, an economic consultant, describes Mr. [Ronald Reagan]'s leadership as ''almost breathtaking'' and predicts that his program ''should prove highly benefici al to the economy in the next 12 to 18 months.'' ''The big concern is insuring that the President's program doesn't result in a massive budget deficit,'' John K. Castle, president of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., said last Thursday. ''If in fact the outcome were a larger debt and larger deficit, there is no doubt it would continue to have an adverse impact on the securities markets.'' ''I don't believe the market is rejecting the Reagan program, per se'' Thomas Johnson, executive vice president of Chemical Bank's Treasury group, agreed. ''It is saying that the increases being proposed in defense spending, combined with the size of the budget so far and the prospect of zero cutbacks in Social Security, can only mean a deficit that will put continued pressure on interest rates.''

Full text: The Reagan Administration is struggling to decipher an apparent and annoying contradiction: Why, if Mr. Reagan has done so much for business, isn't its applause rolling in? Why, if Wall Street supported his tax cuts, budget cuts and restrictive monetary policies, is the Street now so critical of the Reagan program and driving down the values of stocks and bonds?
Part of the explanation emerges from comments by a broad range of Wall Street figures. This is that the Reagan program did in fact give most of what it wanted to Wall Street - that assemblage of stockbrokers and bond dealers, bankers, investment counselors, financial economists, investors, traders, speculators, corporate treasurers and chief executives who buy and sell securities. But the comments show that Wall Street also woke up with more than it expected, and that ''extra'' has revived fears of Federal deficits running out of control.
Wall Street supported the tax program, including 25 percent in cuts in personal income taxes over three years, cuts in the top income tax rate to 50 percent from 70, cuts in estate and gift taxes, accelerated depreciation, tax breaks for savers and investors and much else. But then it took fright when it saw tax cuts totaling $750 billion over the next five years, plus climbing military and nonmilitary spending, even after the Reagan trims in social programs. In Wall Street's view, that all means a string of budget deficits as far as the eye can see.
''Clearly, the budget is heading in a trend toward a larger deficit, rather than less,'' Michel David-Weill, senior partner of Lazard Freres & Company, the investment house, said. ''This is inflationary in and of itself.''
Not everyone on Wall Street is critical of the President. Morris Cohen, an economic consultant, describes Mr. Reagan's leadership as ''almost breathtaking'' and predicts that his program ''should prove highly benefici al to the economy in the next 12 to 18 months.''
But Mr. Cohen is an exception on the Street. The thinking of many of those who have put their remarks on the record is that budget deficits mean heavy Government demands on the credit markets, and that means trouble. With the Federal Reserve holding a tight rein on money and credit, it means persistently high interest rates. That is bad news for stocks and bonds, and bad news, too, for autos, housing, state and local governments, small businesses and all others dependent on credit and the price of money. 'Adverse Impact' on Markets
''The big concern is insuring that the President's program doesn't result in a massive budget deficit,'' John K. Castle, president of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., said last Thursday. ''If in fact the outcome were a larger debt and larger deficit, there is no doubt it would continue to have an adverse impact on the securities markets.''
''I don't believe the market is rejecting the Reagan program, per se'' Thomas Johnson, executive vice president of Chemical Bank's Treasury group, agreed. ''It is saying that the increases being proposed in defense spending, combined with the size of the budget so far and the prospect of zero cutbacks in Social Security, can only mean a deficit that will put continued pressure on interest rates.''
The Reagan White House has reacted with increasing exasperation - and Republican leaders in Congress with increasing anger - to Wall Street's negative reaction, as though the financial community had let down its man. Senator Howard H. Baker of Tennessee, the majority leader, even warned Wall Street of reprisals in the form of ''credit controls, reorganizing the Federal Reserve, a windfall-profits tax on interest income, and wage and price controls.''
But if Washington's Reagan supporters were disappointed in Wall Street, they should not have been surprised. Connally Had Most Support
Ronald Reagan was not Wall Street's first choice for President, most importantly because it feared the risks of his proposals for large tax cuts in the face of high inflation. If anyone, John B. Connally, Secretary of the Treasury in the Nixon Administration, commanded most support from the business and financial establishment. And it was George Bush, another establishment Republican candidate for President, who called Mr. Reagan's proposed economic program, especially the huge tax cuts, ' 'voodoo economics.''
According to the supply-side school of economics, the Reagan tax cuts would give business and investors new incentives and thereby touch off a burst of economic activity that would more than make up for the lost tax revenues. This expectation has required a leap of faith that conservative Wall Street has been unwilling to venture.
Most recently Wall Street's alarm was intensified by analyses of the budget for fiscal 1982, which begins only two weeks from now on Oct. 1, showing that the Reagan Administration's forecast of a deficit of $42.8 billion was too optimistic. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the deficit would be about $65 billion in the new fiscal year.
Wall Street's most respected economists generally agreed with the Congressional estimate. The mounting cost of interest payments by Government would alone account for most of the underestimate by the Reagan Administration. Large Fiscal Impact Seen
The Conference Board, a nonpartisan business research body, placed the deficit for fiscal 1982 in a range of $57.5 billion to $62.5 billion, but said the true picture was far more stimulative than such figures implied. It predicted that large increases in military expenditures and tax cuts would give the economy a ''massive'' fiscal thrust of $107.3 billion, or 3.33 percent of gross national product, in fiscal 1982. That compared with only $34.6 billion in fiscal 1981, or 1.25 percent of gross national product.
Beyond fiscal 1982, analysts warned that the Reagan program was highly unlikely to produce the balanced budget the President had advertised for fiscal 1984. Data Resources, Inc. estimated that the budget deficit would climb from $62.5 billion in 1981 to $75.7 billion in 1984 - and that it would continue to climb, reaching $90.8 billion in fiscal 1986.
''They are trying to turn around overnight a system and spending patterns we have lived with for decades,'' said Seth Glickenhaus, director of Glickenhaus & Company, a Wall Street investment advisory firm. ''It's just not that simple.''
As painful as such appraisals were to the stock market, which tends to look only months, or maybe minutes, ahead, they were lethal to the long-term bond market. That market, already sinking before Wall Street analysts had added up the budgetary implications of the Reagan tax cuts and the military buildup, sank to record lows. Bond Yields Soar
Yields on bonds soared to record levels, as did interest rates on long-term mortgages. Unless something was done to bring down those rates, the implications for both capital investment and housing construction would be severe.
''In 1979, when all the investors were promised a balanced budget, a $1,000 Treasury bond came out at 9 1/8 maturing in the year 2009,'' Robert L. Shoemaker, manager of the Government trading department of Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis Inc., said last week. ''Today that same bond is selling for $635. This market is going to seek a level to hide at until it has some proof positive that inflationary deficits are not going to continue to eat away at the value of bond coupons.''
Wall Street's doubts did come as something of a surprise in Washington. For one thing, very few Wall Street leaders criticized the President publicly. Some swallowed doubts because they sought favors - in the tax legislation, for instance - but also they were plainly reluctant to attack a President they like and heartily agree with on many issues.
It is also true that the White House has not been especially attentive to Wall Street or to big business. According to one of the President's long-time business friends from California, Mr. Reagan has yet to develop close new ties to leading business figures. He still listens to old friends, who typically are self-made entrepreneurs, not from the Wall Street or corporate establishment. Appointments by Reagan
During his campaign, in an effort to forestall criticism from the financial establishment, Mr. Reagan gave influential roles to such economists as Alan Greenspan, the Wall Street economist and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford, and George P. Shultz, president of Bechtel, the big international construction firm and Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon.
The effort to reconcile the views of these traditional conservatives with the unorthodox supply-side economics produced the campaign budget document of Nov. 9, 1980, in which steep cuts in the budget were combined with the big tax cuts to achieve budget balance by 1984.
It was like trying to square the circle. From the beginning, such traditionalists as Mr. Greenspan expressed grave doubts ab out the taxcuts and the sudden economic surge that was supposed to follow. The true signific ance of the tax cuts, Mr. Greenspan said, was not the promised spur to business, but rather the cuts in Federal spending that would ha ve to follow, to keep the budget in balance.
It was also an effort to reassure the monetarists of the financial world - disciples of the belief, most forcefully promulgated by Prof. Milton Friedman, that slowing the growth of the money supply is the only true way to stop inflation - that led Mr. Reagan to appoint both monetarists and supply-siders to his Administration. He named a monetarist, Beryl Sprinkel, a close Friedman disciple, to be Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Policy, and a supply-sider, Norman Ture, to be the Under Secretary for Tax Policy. Regan Named Treasury Head
Indeed, Mr. Reagan named a Wall Streeter, Donald T. Regan, the former chairman of Merrill Lynch, Inc., to be his Secretary of the Treasury, to yoke these contradictory theories and theorists together.
Yet Wall Street was unconvinced. By May the markets had made clear that they found the President's design for restoring budget balance and reducing interest rates incredible. Despite the President's demonstration that he could win Congressional approval for his deep cuts in nonmilitary spending - a showing his supporters said would strengthen the markets - long-term bond prices plunged, short-term interest rates climbed and equity markets weakened.
For a while, Mr. Reagan's top economic officials argued before Congress that the prospective deficits did not matter; only the money supply mattered. Mr. Regan, the Treasury Secretary, told the Senate Finance Committee in mid-May not to worry that the Administration's tax bill would be inflationary, because ''inflation can be controlled through the money supply.''
Whatever effect this had on the Senate, Wall Street was unimpressed. President Reagan criticized the Street as unintelligent in economic matters, a truth he said he had picked up from Secretary Regan. Response From Wall Street
But one of the top Wall Streeters, Peter G. Peterson, chairman of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., who had been Secretary of Commerce in the Nixon Administration, responded on June 25:
''Wall Street has been told once again, at the highest levels, that it does not offer good advice,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''Yet, because the Street i s not a message, but only a mediu m, the concept of Wall Street advice, like the concept of a Wall Str eet spokesman, is a kind of contradiction. The Street speaks only on tape - in prices andspreads - and these signals come from all ove r the world.
''Blaming us for the implicit message,'' Mr. Peterson concluded, ''is like the fat man blaming his obesity on the waiter.'' Though such criticism by the Wall Street establishment annoyed the White House, President Reagan sought to oblige by reducing the fiscal stimulus in his budget. This led him into one of his few political blunders: the hasty effort to cut an additional $46 billion from Social Security benefits over the next five years. Tax Cut Scaled Down
The President again sought to appease Wall Street by scaling down his proposed tax cut from 30 percent over three years to 25 percent, and this proposal stuck. But in the bidding war with the Democrats over the tax bill in Congress, sufficient additional cuts were added to make the tax cuts at least as big as Mr. Reagan had originally proposed.
Mr. Reagan's advisers fully expected that, once the tax bill, with its benefits to business and the financial institutions, was in place, Wall Street would celebrate. It certainly had got most of what it wanted, both directly in lower tax rates and indirectly through the impact on after-tax corporate earnings and the encouragement to individual as well as corporate savers and investers. Though it did not get a shorter holding period for long-term capital gains, this seemed only a small part of its persistent distress, which is linked primarily to budget deficits and high interest rates.
What Wall Street now wants is a stricter budget and fiscal policy, which would remove some of the burden from tight money and high interest rates. The traditional conservatives of Wall Street, including many pragmatic monetarists, are calling for major cuts in the military budget, amounting to $30 billion or more, by fiscal 1984, as well as further cuts in nonmilitary programs.
Although Mr. Reagan has indicated his willingness to trim his military budget, he is still struggling to minimize the military cuts or even to insist that he will meet his aim of 7 percent annual increases in military spending, adjusted for inflation. And he has renewed his promises to cut nonmilitary spending as well.
His current aim is to reduce the fiscal 1982 budget by an ad ditional $1 0 billion to $15 billion, and to cut $75 billion more from the budg ets for fiscal years 1983 and 1984. But how this is to be done is st ill to be decided, and Wall Street, betting its own as well as its c ustomers' money, is not yet convinced.

Full text: Otto von Lambsdorff, the West German Minister of Economics, expressed sharp disagreement today with the contention of top United States officials that the West European governments had offered no alternatives to the monetary, fiscal and foreign exchange rate policies pursued by the Reagan Administration.
In an interview by telephone at Chateau Montebello, Count Lambsdorff stressed that the West German concern was not over the goal of bringing inflation down but rather over the way the United States was going about it.
Voicing the same misgivings expressed by other Europeans and by the Canadians, he asked: ''Is there a justified mix between United States monetary and fiscal policy?''
The West German official contended that the answer was no - that the United States Government was overloading the burdens of fighting inflation on the monetary side.
Overloading monetary policy, he said, was driving interest rates in the United States and Europe higher than needed. The remedy, he thought, was for United States fiscal policy - that is, changes in taxes, government spending and the budget deficit - to be used more heavily to control inflation. U.S. Tries Persuasion
President Reagan and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan have sought here to persuade the Europeans that they were wrong in their appraisal of United States fiscal policy.
Mr. Regan, interviewed at the Skyline Hotel in Ottawa, said he had asked the Europeans, in meeting after meeting: ''Do you realize what we are doing in the area of budget cutting?''
He stressed that over the next five years, the Reagan Administration would be cutting a cumulative total of $275 billion from President Jimmy Carter's budget projections.
But Secretary Regan and other Americans appear to have had little success in changing the Europeans' attitude that American fiscal policy was too loose. Mr. Regan said he had been successful only with Sir Geoffrey Howe, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, but conceded that he might have needed little convincing, given the like approaches of the Reagan and Thatcher Governments. 'Strength and Determination'
If the United States has not changed the Europeans' attitude here, Secretary Regan declared that, on the other hand, the Europeans had not changed what he described as the Reagan Administration's ''strength and determination'' - but what he granted might seem to them ''stubborn or foolish'' policies.
Count Lambsdorff also expressed the view that the United States was conducting its monetary policy in too rigid and doctrinaire a way, trying to control the money supply on a week-to-week basis. He said West Germany had managed to control its money supply without forcing interest rates to such ''extraordinary'' levels.
But Mr. Regan, former chairman of Merrill Lynch, the stockbrokers, said he had told Count Lambsdorff's chief, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, that there was ''something screwy'' about the financial market's reaction to efforts by the central bank to make more reserves available to curb the rise in interest rates. ''If we pump reserves in now,'' Mr. Regan said, ''we'll blow rates sky high.'' 'Anxiety' in the Markets
Count Lambsdorff insisted, nevertheless, that the efforts of the Federal Reserve, spurred by the Administration, to keep control of the money supply on a continuous basis had led to ''unnecessary unrest and anxiety'' in financial markets.
He added that these were matters for argument among the finance and economic ministers, not for debate among ''heads of state.'' He said it would be ''an offense to the President'' to try to explore such ''sophisticated'' issues as what he regards as a primitive form of monetarism on the American side.
However, the West German official added that a debate among finance ministers had been conducted in the presence of Edwin Meese 3d, counselor to the President, whom he described as ''an interested listener.''
At a news conferences, Mr. Meese was explicit in denying that the Europeans had offered criticism or counterproposals to the American policy mix. ''They didn't offer any alternatives or criticize what we are doing,'' he said, asserting that there was ''not any suggestion that we change our tax cut, particularly as they understood the facts of the tax cut, and as they recognize the fact that we have to improve saving and improve investment.'' U.S. Tax Policies Doubted
In the interview, Count Lambsdorff said: ''I am doubtful that the tax cut will mean revitalizing capital expenditures, and I asked the Secretary where he got the evidence that it would generate savings and investment and not consumption.'' He said he did not share the belief of the Administration that the tax cuts would bring up the savings rate.
The Economics Minister was also critical of the United States for its unwillingness to intervene in foreign exchange markets to prevent erratic movements disturbing to other countries.
Count Lambsdorff said the notion of nonintervention in the foreign exchange markets simply ''fits into the textbook of monetarism.'' He was critical of Beryl Sprinkel, United States Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, for pushing his belief in monetarism so rigidly and aggressively. But he added: ''At least it is our impression that he has started to listen.''

Abstract: T HE Ottawa economic summit meeting could be the most important summit yet. The heads of government of the seven main industrial countries will meet to address not only the usual specific issues - macro-economic policy, energy, trade, etc. -but also the future of economic summitry itself, and, thus, of the cooperation among the heads of government that has enabled them to confront serious and unsolved domestic economic problems in the later 1970's without relapsing into the beggar-thy-neighbor economic policies with which their predecessors reacted to such problems in the 1930's. When Ottawa convenes tomorrow, France, the United States, Britain West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada, in that order, will each have played host to a summit meeting. At Ottawa they will have to decide whether a new cycle should be started and, if so, under what ground rules. The central question will be whether summit meetings should be converted from decision-making meetings into forums for general conversation about strategy, beginning with Ottawa itself. At first glance, this seems like an issue of less-than-shattering importance, but a review of past summit meetings suggests that a good deal is at stake. T HE Venice summit meeting's discussion of North-South issues converged with its consideration of energy. The heads of government were anxious that the developing countries produce more energy, not only to help these countries, but to insure that pressure on world prices, which would hobble the industrial countries' growth, did not revive when world economic growth resumed. They urged the World Bank to explore means of increasing aid to developing countries for energy production, including the possibility of creating a new World Bank affiliate or facility for this purpose. Since Venice, most summit countries - the United States excepted -have come to support creation of this.

At first glance, this seems like an issue of less-than-shattering importance, but a review of past summit meetings suggests that a good deal is at stake.
Economic summitry began in 1975 when the leaders of major industrial countries were confronted by a new set of international economic problems in the wake of the first oil shock. Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany and President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France concluded that these problems could only be resolved if the heads of government met. A series of lower-level meetings had failed to make progress.
The most serious of these disagreements was that between France and the United States on international monetary policy. The Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates had broken down; French failure to accept the shift to flexible rates endangered efficient functioning of the world monetary system.
At the Rambouillet summit meeting in November 1975, the French President accepted the move to flexible exchange rates in return for an agreement from the other leaders that national macro-economic policies should be coordinated, so as to narrow the resulting monetary fluctuations. But the bargain was not fulfilled.
When the leaders met a year later in Puerto Rico, they found that, although there had been improvement on the international monetary front, ''needed stability has not yet been restored'' -that is, coordination of domestic economic policies had not been achieved. To make good this failure, they pledged to give top priority to fighting inflation, even if this meant slowing the rate of economic recovery in some of their countries.
That agreement was short-lived. President Carter came to office committed to an early acceleration in economic growth. The British Government also favored higher growth, particularly by West Germany, whose expansion it thought would help other European countries increase their exports to the Federal Republic. The German and Japanese reactions were unenthusiastic, to put it mildly.
After some fairly sharp argument in preparatory meetings, the London meeting agreed that countries with stronger economies - Germany, Japan and the United States - should seek higher rates of growth, while the other countries should concentrate on fighting inflation.
T HE fact that only the United States fulfilled the growth target pledged at London should not obscure the fact that Germany and Japan took additional expansionist actions that they would not otherwise have adopted. Indeed, their actions, which significantly helped their trading partners without generating increased inflation at the time, were a more beneficial result of this summit meeting than the United States expansionist measures, which clearly reflected an underestimate of the inflationary threat in America.
Media emphasis on the London summit meeting's macro-economic decisions overshadowed what may have been its more lasting achievement - reviving the Multilateral Trade Negotiations, in which prospects for movement then seemed poor to zero.
At London, the heads of government committed themselves to achieve major progress toward substantial reductions in tariff and nontariff barriers, in agriculture as well as industry, before the end of the year. This commitment settled the question of whether the outcome of these negotiations should be a minipackage, as favored by the French, or the deeper cuts in trade barriers and wider coverage proposed by President Carter.
Without this high-level agreement on goals and timing, the Multilateral Trade Negotiations would almost certainly not have been concluded successfully, in the judgment of Robert Strauss, President Carter's chief trade negotiator, and others close to them. And, without a trade agreement, a reversion to protectionism, with consequent higher inflation and unemployment, might well have followed.
Pressed for still further stimulus measures at the Bonn summit meeting in July 1978, Chancellor Schmidt shrewdly perceived his bargaining power. He widened the agenda and insisted that any German economic stimulus should depend on action to reduce United States oil consumption, which he and the other leaders considered a major cause of rising oil prices.
After hard bargaining, a deal was struck - Mr. Schmidt promised to adopt a stimulus equal to 1 percent of Germany's gross national product, and Mr. Carter promised to decontrol oil prices by the end of 1980 - a move that both his immediate predecessors in the White House had considered politically infeasible. The German commitment was punctiliously fulfilled when the Bundestag reconvened. The United States decision to decontrol oil took longer to carry out, but it was probably the most useful (and the most politically painful) economic decision President Carter made.
It led to a substantial and growing reduction in American oil consumption and imports, which proved much more sensitive to price changes than many of his advisers had expected. If some of Germany's trading partners benefited from the economic expansion that it pledged at Bonn (which Mr. Schmidt has since argued contributed to later German inflation), oil importing nations benefited even more from United States decontrol, which marked a decisive turning point in American energy policy.
At the June 1979 Tokyo summit meeting, energy again came to the fore, as a result of a marginal excess of global oil demand over supply, which had generated a catastrophic run-up in oil spot prices, followed by a large increase in the official prices of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. To limit the damage, i.e., prevent the main industrial countries from bidding against each other for scarce oil supplies, the United States proposed national oil import ceilings. But the European Economic Community leaders, who had begun the practice of fixing E.E.C. positions shortly before each annual economic summit, had just decided on an overall community ceiling instead. The United States was unimpressed. It argued that so long as the power to enforce ceilings resided in the national governments, national ceilings were essential.
After bitter argument throughout the first day at Tokyo on this point between President Carter and the four European heads, President Giscard d'Estaing broke with the E.E.C. position, which had been adopted over his objections, and accepted national oil import ceilings. The other European heads of government had little choice but to follow suit, albeit reluctantly.
In their anxiety to protect each of their national economies, the leaders could only agree on ceilings whose aggregate total exceeded the amount of oil exports available.
Nonetheless, acceptance of the principle of oil import ceilings proved useful. In subsequent ministerial meetings of the International Energy Agency, the summit conference participants and other I.E.A. members agreed on lower current import ceilings than those fixed at Tokyo and on procedures for fixing future import targets that could be converted into national ceilings whenever ministers agreed that the imbalance between oil supply and demand made this necessary.
The industrial countries were finally getting their energy act together, offering hope, not yet perceived by Americans who waited in long gasoline lines that summer, and an alternative to the divisive competition for scarce oil imports that might have otherwise followed.
At Japanese and United States initiative, North-South issues were also discussed at Tokyo. The London and Bonn summit meetings had already given a push to needed replenishment of the World Bank, its soft loan affiliate the International Development Association, and the regional development banks - which provided, among them, much of the aid going to developing countries.
At Tokyo, the need to help developing countries increase food production was emphasized, and an American proposal to double the resources of the program for international agricultural research coordinated by the World Bank was adopted. This made few headlines, but it greatly strengthened the work of international agricultural research institutions, which had pioneered the green revolution and, thus, have probably done as much for the human condition as any international activity since World War II.
Energy and North-South relations again dominated the 1980 summit meeting in Venice, and once more the emphasis was on specific decisions -not general conversation.
After the disastrous experience of the 1979 oil price run-up, the heads of government had little trouble agreeing that their countries should increase their production of alternative energy sources by the equivalent of 15 million to 20 million barrels of oil a day by 1990. Recognizing that the greater part of this increase had to come from coal, the leaders called on coal exporting nations - notably the United States - and coal importers in Europe and Japan, to take specific actions to double the use of coal by 1990.
To insure that these and other energy pledges were fulfilled, a special seven-nation group was set up to report at Ottawa on what each country was doing to fulfill its pledge.
T HE Venice summit meeting's discussion of North-South issues converged with its consideration of energy. The heads of government were anxious that the developing countries produce more energy, not only to help these countries, but to insure that pressure on world prices, which would hobble the industrial countries' growth, did not revive when world economic growth resumed. They urged the World Bank to explore means of increasing aid to developing countries for energy production, including the possibility of creating a new World Bank affiliate or facility for this purpose. Since Venice, most summit countries - the United States excepted -have come to support creation of this.
Against the background of this record, it is doubtful that the leaders at Ottawa will decide to give up summit meetings. Too much has been accomplished in past meetings, and too many unsolved international economic problems remain. They may well conclude, however, that Ottawa and future economic summit meetings should eschew specific decisions. Press reports suggest that the Reagan Administration leans toward this view. If so, that view will prevail. Without United States leadership, difficult and painful decisions to meet international economic problems are unlikely.
There is one area in which avoiding decisions and confining summits to a general exchange of views makes sense: macro-economic policy. At Ottawa, the European countries will press the United States to moderate its tax cuts, so that there will be less American reliance on high interest rates to control inflation. All countries will urge the new French Government not to fuel inflation and cut productivity with too much intervention in the economy.
But there will be no early changes in national policies by either Government as a result, since both are bound by commitments to powerful domestic constituencies. Over the longer term, this summit pressure may have a useful effect; but in the main, macro-economic policy will continue to be shaped by domestic pressure.
I N other areas of economic policy, however, discussion of trade, energy, and North-South policy that does not yield specific decisions will leave important concrete problems unresolved, and it will leave the media and the interested public unimpressed.
But will it be feasible to make specific decisions at Ottawa? On energy, the report of the monitoring group set up at Venice should lead the summit participants to agree that they will remove existing obstacles to increased coal trade.
The chief offender here is the United States. Our ports need dredging to accommodate the larger ships that will be increasingly used in coal trade. This function is reserved by law for the Federal Government, which is now no longer able to finance it. Failure of Congress and the executive branch to agree on legislation to transfer this function to individual states, some of which are willing and able to fill the gap, is both slowing the world shift from oil to coal and doing considerable changes to the United States coal industry. Administration leadership is needed in trying to develop a compromise bill that will accommodate the divergent interests of different states in sufficient degree to pass.
Canada's Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, is reported to believe that Ottawa is also a good place to give a push to the Venice proposal for a World Bank energy affiliate, which would provide more resources (particularly from OPEC and the private sector) to help developing countries increase their energy production and, thus, improve the balance between energy supply and demand.
The Reagan Administration is skeptical, and budgetary obstacles to even a modest United States appropriation for a new international program are evident.
A compromise may be found in a recent proposal that the World Bank's callable capital - the capital that its member nations agree to provide in case there is a default on World Bank loans - be increased without any requirement for back-up paid-in capital, since there has never been such a default. A rise in callable capital would not require a United States appropriation; yet, it would enable the World Bank to raise its energy lending.
The summit meeting could pave the way for agreement on this proposal by urging the new World Bank management to work out with member countries the best way to increase its energy lending without cutting down on other important World Bank programs (e.g., to increase developing countries' food production). It could also make clear that it did not expect increased World Bank lending for energy to replace private investment, so as to meet the Reagan Administration's concerns on this point.
The Ottawa participants should also agree on the need to fulfill their countries' existing pledges for financing of the multilateral development banks. In appraising the United States' failure in this respect, other leaders will not be impressed by our fiscal problems. They have had similar problems, and yet they have fulfilled their countries' World Bank pledges. Nothing less than the future of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, which could not long survive a drastic reduction in World Bank hard and soft lending to its customers, is at stake.
One of the reasons the Great Depression of the 1930's was so much worse than any of its predecessors was the absence of a lender of last resort to help countries in distress. The Bretton Woods agreement setting up the World Bank and the I.M.F. was designed to fill this gap. If the Ottawa meeting does nothing more than agree that preserving this system is essential, if we are not to sink back into a world depression, it will have more than justified itself.
An Ottawa outcome that thus focused on energy and North-South decisions would maintain the tradition of summit meetings that do something about international economic problems, instead of merely talking.
There will always be a healthy element of skepticism in press (as in public) attitudes toward summitry. In part, this reflects the inevitable gap between what public opinion wants a summit meeting to accomplish, and what it can accomplish. This gap is inherent in the fact that the summit countries' market economies are not in control of their governments, and that in one important area - macro-economic policy - domestic forces clearly overshadow international discussion in shaping decisions.
These facts should be taken into account in setting the agenda and goals of summit meetings. Exaggerated rhetoric about their purpose and effects should be avoided, in favor of the kinds of practical business that past summit conferences have been able to achieve - reaching specific economic decisions in areas where this is feasible, and offering a forum for general exchange of views where it is not.
If Ottawa follows and confirms this approach, it will have served us well.

Abstract: Recent price behavior raises several important questions for the near-term outlook for the economy: Why has inflation slowed over the past few months? More specifically, do recent events reflect a change in the underlying inflation rate or a temporary reprieve? Why are financial markets still nervous in the face of the ''good news'' on both the inflation and political fronts? In analyzing inflation, we must distinguish ''underlying inflation'' from the actual inflation experience. Although there are several ways of measuring underlying inflation, perhaps the most useful is the movement in unit labor costs. Unit labor costs are a key element because they form three-quarters of all input costs in national output. The central point for the prognosis on inflation, however, is that movements in oil or food prices lead to one-shot, or transient, declines in inflation. We simply cannot count on a progressive fall in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Country's selling price. Until and unless these transient elements affect the underlying inflation rate, there is little hope that a decline in inflation below the underlying 8 to 10 percent range will be durable.

Full text: T HE United States has received very good, and quite surprising, news on the inflation front in the last three months. After rising at rates of around 13 percent annually since 1978, consumer price inflation has slowed to an annual rate of 7 percent over the last three months.
This good news has been cheered by the Administration. But the financial markets have not received the surprise with the hoped-for fall in interest rates and boom in stock prices.
Recent price behavior raises several important questions for the near-term outlook for the economy: Why has inflation slowed over the past few months? More specifically, do recent events reflect a change in the underlying inflation rate or a temporary reprieve? Why are financial markets still nervous in the face of the ''good news'' on both the inflation and political fronts?
In analyzing inflation, we must distinguish ''underlying inflation'' from the actual inflation experience. Although there are several ways of measuring underlying inflation, perhaps the most useful is the movement in unit labor costs. Unit labor costs are a key element because they form three-quarters of all input costs in national output.
Underlying inflation is a useful tool because it removes the influence of volatile transient phenomena, such as one-shot changes in oil prices or interest rates. By focusing on unit labor costs, that is, the movement in labor cost per unit of output produced in the nonfarm business economy, we can unmask the longer-term trends in the key element determining price movements. The accompanying chart illustrates that while there has been an enormous slowdown in the actual rate of consumer inflation, the slowdown has come entirely from the volatile components. Underlying inflation has actually risen almost continuously since 1976.
Put differently, the recent slowdown in inflation has not arisen from slower wage increases or more rapid productivity growth. Rather, it has arisen entirely from the more volatile, non-labor components.
What are these nonunderlying components of the slowdown? The most important, of course, was the enormous deceleration in energy prices. In early 1980, energy prices, which have a 10 percent direct weight in the C.P.I., were rising at a rate of 40 to 50 percent over a 12-month period. Over the last two months, energy prices have risen only one-half of 1 percent. Similar but less dramatic contributions have come from food and housing prices. Finally, the rise in the dollar has made internationally traded goods cheaper.
Economists will argue forever about the exact causal force leading to the favorable trend in oil, food, housing prices and the dollar. While the drop in oil prices is a response to the enormous price increase in earlier years, the favorable movements in the others have been the result of economic policy in the last two years.
The central point for the prognosis on inflation, however, is that movements in oil or food prices lead to one-shot, or transient, declines in inflation. We simply cannot count on a progressive fall in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Country's selling price. Until and unless these transient elements affect the underlying inflation rate, there is little hope that a decline in inflation below the underlying 8 to 10 percent range will be durable.
We should no more think that the recent experience is permanent than we should have thought that the 13 to 14 percent inflation rates of 1979 and 1980 were permanent. The last two years witnessed a bout of incredibly bad luck; the last few months have seen a string of unpredicted good luck.
W HAT then is the inflation outlook? Given the current sogginess in world oil and commodity markets, it seems a good bet that the volatile commodity component of inflation will remain on good behavior for a year or so - or until the next fruit fly invasion. Thus for a while inflation should continue below the underlying rate.
What is the outlook for the underlying rate? Insofar as the wage half is concerned, there is no evidence yet of slowing. Results of contract negotiations from the coal fields and among newspapers like The New York Times show annual increases over the next three years averaging around 12 percent.
The Administration's theory is that, once the private sector recognizes that Reaganomics is here to stay, wage settlements will decline rapidly. But the recent stubbornness of wage behavior raises questions about whether the Administration's expectational theories are realistic. Admittedly, it is unlikely that coal miners have fully digested the Reagan economic theory and have adapted their behavior to the new economic policies. But when Times reporters, surely well informed and rational economic agents, win a hefty wage package, the Administration should regroup its theorists.
Such inertial wage behavior suggests that the decline in wage increases will be glacial. Nor is there yet any evidence of a marked upturn in productivity. Thus, it appears that the underlying inflation rate is still stuck in the 8 to 10 percent range.
The stickiness of wage behavior makes an effective policy for restraining wages a key ingredient in any anti-inflation policy over the coming years. Aside from the dubious expectational theories, however, there is little in the victorious Reagan fiscal program that would have a marked impact on wage behavior.
In light of the inflation outlook and monetary policy, the continuation of high interest rates and depressed stock prices is no surprise. One simple view holds that interest rates are merely a fixed premium, say 1 or 2 percentage points, over the inflation rate. Under this view, interest rates in the 10 to 12 percent range are consistent with the current underlying inflation rate.
A more realistic view augments such a theory to reflect the relative tightness of monetary policy. As monetary growth targets are very low relative to most projections of the growth of real gross national product, this suggests that interest rates will remain high until the economy collapses or until the Federal Reserve caves in.
In this realistic view of interest rates, there has been no major change in the medium-run outlook for financial markets to cheer about. The underlying rate of inflation is unchanged; the Reagan fiscal victory will not markedly affect the economic outlook, and the Federal Reserve is as determined as ever to maintain monetary tightness.
Under these conditions, it would be the most irrational of expectations for investors to bid up stock prices or down interest rates in light of recent transient behavior of inflation. --------------------------------------------------------------------- William Nordhaus is John Musser Professor of Economics at Yale and a former member of President Carter's Council of Economic Advisers.

Abstract: ''Employment is falling everywhere, trade is suffering and there is no industrial investment,'' said Claude Cheysson, France's new Foreign Minister, at a recent meeting of the O.E.C.D. High American interest rates have sent the dollar ''floating in the stratosphere,'' he added, concluding that American policies represent ''a third oil shock in the making.'' ''T HE recovery is on the way in Europe,'' said Arnold Simkin, an economist with Merrill Lynch Economics in London. ''I sense it will be fairly apparent to most people by the fourth quarter.'' Mr. Simkin also believes that the [Francois Mitterrand] program will raise the French growth rate in 1982 to 4 percent from 2.6 percent previously projected. But inflation is also likely to accelerate, he said, to 15.1 percent from the 9.8 percent he had been forecasting. ''This policy was successful in reducing the inflationary effects of the oil price increases,'' the O.E.C.D. reported this week. ''While nominal income growth has accelerated, it has done so by less than would have been expected from past evidence.''

Full text: WHEN the leaders of the industrialized world gather in Ottawa just a week from now - four for their first economic summit - they will be confronting an unusual divergence of economic conditions, of beliefs on what policy should be, and of opinion on what, if anything, can or should be endorsed at this annual gathering.
On the eve of the summit, President Reagan is riding a tremendous popular rush toward tax and budget cutting while keeping one foot heavily on the monetary brakes in a continuing effort to get rid of inflation. His political opposite, newly elected Francois Mitterrand, chose the pre-summit week to announce a radical economic program, startling in its faithfulness to campaign rhetoric, that emphasizes job creation above all and would involve the nationadization of major sectors of the French economy, including large American holdings.
Of the other two new faces, Zenko Suzuki of Japan faces pressing trade problems that threaten his export-dependent economy while Italy's Giovanni Spadolini tries to hold together a nation torn by racing inflation and economic stagnation.
The three familiar faces have problems of their own. In Britain, ultra-conservative Margaret Thatcher continues doggedly down the monetarist road, drawing increasing fire as the economy wilts. In West Germany, Socialist Democrat Helmut Schmidt faces hot attacks for the generous fiscal policies that critics charge have swelled the national deficit and fed inflation in a nation emotionally wedded to stable prices. In Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau is feuding with his southern neighbor over energy policies.
Especially in the cases of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mitterrand, the picture is one of new leaders single-mindedly pursuing policies to which they are deeply committed, leaving moderation for later.
In such an atmosphere, the likelihood of reaching any agreement on macroeconomic policy at Ottawa seems extremely dim. One problem, as a European diplomat in Paris put it, is that ''The margins of maneuvering in economic policy for country leaders are remarkably limited in today's world. New administrations have to learn that lesson.''
Underlying all the political divergence is an array of economic problems, each special to the region involved.The United States, despite all the predictions of a slump, has continued to show signs of economic growth and, perhaps most importantly, has not experienced rising unemployment. Europe, by contrast, remains mired in a slump that has led to steadaly rising unemployment across the continent and few signs of brightening prospects. A further complexity is Japan, fearful of growing protectionist sentiments in other countries.
The divergence so apparent this summer is in substantial contrast to the circumstances just a year ago, when the leaders were glued together by a common external problem. The lingering effects of the 1979 oil price runup left the group - of somewhat different political persuasions then as well -more certain of the need to lean hard against the inflationary effects of that shock.
''We reached agreement last year because of a common problem, the enormous increase in oil prices,'' said a senior official at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. ''This year we knew it would be much more difficult because once we absorbed the oil price increase there would be the possibility of different policies.''
Last week, the Paris-based O.E.C.D. said in its semiannual economic assessment that the recovery in economic activity in the industrialized world, expected late last year to occur in the first half of 1981, would now be delayed by six months or more. Meanwhile, unemployment in the 24 member countries was projected to rise throughout the next 18 months, reaching some 26 million people, or nearly 7 1/2 percent of the labor force, by the second half of 1982.
But that overall assessment masks substantial differences in economic prospects. Members of the European Economic Community are likely to post a collective decline in gross national product of nine-tenths of 1 percent in 1981, after adjustment for inflation, according to Chase Econometrics, a forecasting concern. As for jobs, Europe will show a decline in employment of 1 percent in 1981, following no growth in 1980, according to the O.E.C.D.
Meanwhile, the United States, whose economy grew at a record pace in the first quarter, is expected to continue healthy expansion through the year while employment grows about 1.5 percent in 1981, after a small increase of three-tenths of 1 percent in 1980, the O.E.C.D. reported.
And both Japan and Canada will be barreling along, at a substantially faster rate, in terms of both G.N.P. and employment. These varying outlooks help to explain the highly publicized recent differences between the United States and Europe over monetary policy. In the United States, despite a few good price figures, inflation remains the principal concern. Slower monetary growth - despite the record interest rates that have been the consequence - remains the principal tool.
For Europe, the growing feeling is that interest rates - which were at least a major cause of Europe's economic malaise - need to be lower rather than higher, a goal that the American policy stance puts further from reach. Even in Britain, which has the most conservative government in Europe, pressures had been growing for a cut in the key minimum lending rate, now 12 percent. By comparison, American rates are more than 20 percent.
Bolstered by the high interest rates, the United States dollar has been soaring against all the European currencies. To the European mind, that means trouble - more expensive imports from the United States and higher payments for oil, which is priced in dollars. In other words, inflation.
''Employment is falling everywhere, trade is suffering and there is no industrial investment,'' said Claude Cheysson, France's new Foreign Minister, at a recent meeting of the O.E.C.D. High American interest rates have sent the dollar ''floating in the stratosphere,'' he added, concluding that American policies represent ''a third oil shock in the making.''
The dollar's strength, however, has another important side - encouraging European exports - and many economists feel Europe will gain in the end, for increasing exports just as surely produces jobs as increasing domestic consumption.
''T HE recovery is on the way in Europe,'' said Arnold Simkin, an economist with Merrill Lynch Economics in London. ''I sense it will be fairly apparent to most people by the fourth quarter.'' Mr. Simkin also believes that the Mitterrand program will raise the French growth rate in 1982 to 4 percent from 2.6 percent previously projected. But inflation is also likely to accelerate, he said, to 15.1 percent from the 9.8 percent he had been forecasting.
Often forgotten in the United States is the emphasis in Europe on jobs as a goal of economic policy. Europe, which has traditionally had low unemployment rates, is hurting hard, in its terms. In France, for example, unemployment has risen each year since 1973. In May, joblessness totaled 7.5 percent, or 1.79 million people, up 21.9 percent from a year earlier. One of the new Government's first acts was to propose direct creation of 150,000 public-sector jobs.
This problem may be intensified in coming years by a reversal of demographic trends from the 1970's, according to figures developed by the O.E.C.D. From 1980 to 1985, the rate of growth in working-age population in Europe is projected to rise sharply while that of the United States, historically high, will fall.
The job predicament has compounded for Europe the difficulty of getting control of public spending and borrowing. Government deficits are large - in West Germany, the gap may exceed 4 percent of gross domestic product, one-third higher than two years ago and four times the United States level.
On the other hand, Europe has traditionally had higher inflation than the United States and with the exception of Germany, is less worried about it. Thus in Britain, for example, when the inflation rate fell to around 10 percent from a peak of 23 percent it did no more than set off large calls for economic stimulus, even from many business executives. In France, the commitment to reflation, as stimulus is called here, comes despite an expected inflation rate of 14.2 percent in 1981, according to the Bankers Trust Company.
Despite the worries in Europe, the industrialized world has by nearly all accounts survived the 1979-80 oil shock better than the previous one. Learning from the 1973-74 experience, the industrialized countries moved almost uniformly to limit the spillover effect of oil price increases into the wage arena.
''This policy was successful in reducing the inflationary effects of the oil price increases,'' the O.E.C.D. reported this week. ''While nominal income growth has accelerated, it has done so by less than would have been expected from past evidence.''
To some degree, the inflation improvement has resulted from developments in oil, which is, ironically, the one issue not likely to spark much concern or discussion at this week's meeting. At the moment, with a substantial excess of output and a larger amount of production capacity disused, the oil price pressure is off.

Abstract: The report conveys concern that because inflation has become ''a way of life'' in today's world, it will take a monetary squeeze of intolerable severity to halt inflation. Such a squeeze, in the bank's view, risks setting off a political backlash not just against tightmoney policies but against the Western world's commitment to making inflation-fighting its top economic priority. The bank pointedly recalls that habits of economic cooperation built up since World War II represent ''the most effective bulwark against a repetition of the kind of events witnessed in the 1930's, which ultimately resulted in the disintegration of the world economy.'' The report concludes ominously. ''The warning signs are written clearly on the wall,'' it says. ''The Western world is already paying a high price for having tolerated too high an inflation rate for too long. If, in the present decisive phase, confidence in the effectiveness of international cooperation were to be shaken, the price would be greater still.'' Reflects a Broad View

Full text: The Reagan Administration's stringent monetarist strategy aimed at curbing inflation in the United States is causing serious difficulties for other countries and could lead to a breakdown of economic cooperation that would spell disaster, the Bank for International Settlements warns in its latest annual report.
The annual statement by the bank, which is owned by the world's central banks, traditionally sets out in forthright language the bankers' views on the major economic problems of the day. The report was issued today in conjunction with the meeting of central bankers this week.
The message this year is that the United States and other countries are relying too heavily on monetary policy in their fight against inflation.
Ripple Effect of High Rates
America's high interest rates are forcing other countries to defend their currencies by raising their own rates to damagingly high levels at a time of recession, the bank says. Such defense is needed because the high returns available on dollar holdings draw funds from other currencies.
Business investment is suffering as a result, and with it, the West's chances of reducing unemployment through industrial development. Meanwhile, the developing world's economies are being crushed by the soaring cost of servicing its debt and by slack demand for its exports in the depressed economies of the West.
The bank would like the United States and other industrial countries to take some of the upward pressure off interest rates by doing more to fight inflation by fiscal means: cutting budget deficits, loosening economic bottlenecks and persuading trade unions to limit wage demands by subscribing to voluntary incomes policies. Dangers of a Backlash
The report conveys concern that because inflation has become ''a way of life'' in today's world, it will take a monetary squeeze of intolerable severity to halt inflation. Such a squeeze, in the bank's view, risks setting off a political backlash not just against tightmoney policies but against the Western world's commitment to making inflation-fighting its top economic priority.
If the worldwide monetary squeeze continues, the bank fears a breakdown in international economic cooperation, as European countries rebel against the prolonged recession that the Reagan Administration's tight-money policy is seen as imposing on them.
The bank pointedly recalls that habits of economic cooperation built up since World War II represent ''the most effective bulwark against a repetition of the kind of events witnessed in the 1930's, which ultimately resulted in the disintegration of the world economy.''
The report concludes ominously. ''The warning signs are written clearly on the wall,'' it says. ''The Western world is already paying a high price for having tolerated too high an inflation rate for too long. If, in the present decisive phase, confidence in the effectiveness of international cooperation were to be shaken, the price would be greater still.'' Reflects a Broad View
Although the bank insists that Washington is not the only culprit, its thinly veiled attack on the Reagan Administration's monetarist approach to inflation-fighting echoes the increasingly strident complaints now coming from virtually all other Western countries except Britain.
In recent weeks, European governments have told the United States that soaring American interest rates are spreading stagflation around the world, killing off hopes of an economic recovery in the West this year and raising the cost of oil and other imported raw materials that must be paid for in increasingly expensive dollars.
Europe and the Bank for International Settlements want the United States instead to reduce inflation by cutting its budget deficit, stimulating competition and restraining pay claims, thus making room for a coordinated reduction in world interest rates that would revive the world economy. Demands Due at O.E.C.D. Meeting
These demands will certainly be repeated by foreign and finance ministers at Tuesday's annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. But so far, the Reagan Administration has turned a deaf ear to such pleas, saying that world interest rates would come down as soon as American inflation subsided and not before.
But some Western officials already fear that the O.E.C.D. meeting will provide the first signs of the kind of revolt against the West's inflation-fighting commitment that the bank fears. France's new Socialist Government, for example, has already started to stimulate the economy mildly, and several smaller European countries are starting to say that unemployment is a more serious problem than inflation.
Besides being unduly deflationary, the bank says, a purely monetary assault on inflation is increasingly difficult to carry out, a point made frequently by Paul A. Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Bankers continually thwart efforts to control the growth of the money supply by devising new forms of credit. In the view of the bank, the Federal Reserve's new policy of concentrating on control of the monetary base has led to wild swings in interest rates and exchange rates without making the growth of the monetary aggregates noticeably more stable.
While acknowledging that a restrictive monetary policy is essential if inflation is to be beaten, the bank wants it to be supplemented first and foremost by a general drive to reduce government deficits.

Full text: American exports, aided by the falling dollar in 1977 and 1978 and more aggressive sales efforts, have grown handsomely in the last three years, bolstering profits and creating new jobs.
But the dollar's sharp rise this year on currency markets, along with a comparatively high inflation rate in the United States, is likely to dampen, if not reverse, the mounting export prowess displayed by American companies in the last few years, according to many economists.
High interest rates have pushed the dollar to its most recent peaks against key European currencies. Since the beginning of the year alone, the dollar has risen 22.1 percent against the West German mark, 19.6 percent against the Swiss franc and 24.3 percent against the British pound.
''The basic goal of the Reagan Administration is to lick inflation,'' said Otto Eckstein, president of Data Resources Inc., an economic consulting concern. ''A strong dollar helps, but it doesn't help the exporter. The bloom is going to be off the export market.'' How Dollar Affects Trade
Generally, a stronger dollar makes American-made goods more expensive abroad, while imports into the United States become better bargains. And even though it typically takes six months or more before a big shift in exchange rates makes its mark in exports, the United States trade deficit is already showing signs of widening.
In April, the trade gap jumped to a seasonally adjusted $3.46 billion from an unusually slim $451.4 million deficit in March, in large part because of a sharp rise in petroleum imports. During the month, exports fell 7.5 percent after a strong gain in March.
Government officials, citing the dollar's strength, anticipate that the 1981 trade deficit will will be wider than last year's $36.36 billion gap. The deficit was $40.37 billion in 1979 and a record $42.36 billion in 1978.
''As we go along, the effect of the dollar's rise will become stronger and stronger,'' said Helen B. Junz, an international economist with Townsend-Greenspan & Company, an economic consulting concern.
''It's hard to imagine that U.S. exports can grow as rapidly in the period ahead,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, president of Chase Econometrics Inc., an economic consulting concern.
''We expect U.S. exporters will lose market share in the second half of this year and into 1982, particularly against the Germans,'' Mrs. Junz said. ''You will see it first in a falloff in orders.''
The American industries that compete with foreigners primarily on price, making them most vulnerable to a rising dollar, are consumer electronics, such as televisions and calculators; textiles; automobiles, and steel. Steel Imports Up Sharply
Steel imports, for example, have risen sharply in recent months. Moreover, four large European producers have asked the Commerce Department for permission to sell their steel below the fair price of steel imports established last year by the Commerce Department. The rising dollar has reduced their production costs, they said, and the price they require to sell at a profit.
Although American exporters in general expect rougher seas, companies selling products with superior quality, service and technology will probably be little affected by lower prices from foreign competitors.
These include such major exporters as the International Business Machines Corporation, the Boeing Company and the Caterpillar Tractor Company, according to Mr. Eckstein.
At Caterpillar, which sells heavy road construction equipment through distributors in more than 140 countries, management is counting on durability, low maintenance, 48-hour parts service and financing packages for buyers to overcome any problems with higher prices, a spokesman said.
Caterpillar exported $3.1 billion worth of equipment last year, or 36 percent of its total sales of $8.6 billion. Half of its 62,000 American employees worked in jobs closely tied to exports. For now, Caterpillar is not suffering an exchange-rate disadvantage against its major competitor, Komatsu of Japan. The dollar has risen 3 percent against the Japanese yen in the last 12 months. OPEC Oil Priced in Dollars
Also favoring American exporters is the fact that, although competitors in Western Europe will benefit from the rising dollar, the Europeans have been hit by a sharp jump in the price of oil imported from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC prices its oil in dollars. As the dollar has risen against the European currencies, petroleum-based industries have paid dearly in higher oil bills. This will blunt some of the negative effect of the dollar's rise on trade in the United States economy.
''The Germans, in effect, have just had a 25 percent increase in petroleum prices,'' said Walter Joelson, chief economist of the General Electric Company. G.E. recorded the country's second-highest volume of export sales in 1980, after Boeing.
The jolt from the dollar's climb also will be partially offset by long-term contracts that are common in international commerce, especially on expensive capital goods.
''It may take two or three years for negative impacts of a stronger dollar to be reflected in sales,'' Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist for the Weyerhaeuser Company, said. ''Meanwhile, a strong dollar is going to increase the oil import bill of many of our competing countries. That will aggravate their inflation problem, which would tend to make the dollar even stronger.'' Inflation Rates a Factor
The relationship of the dollar to foreign currencies is important in setting the price of American goods of abroad. Comparative inflation rates also play a fundamental role. If the rate of inflation continues to decline in the United States, as it did in April and May, it will offset some of the disadvantages that American exporters face as potential customers tally exchange rates.
But that is not of much help at this time, especially when American companies go head to head with German competitors. In the 12 months ended last Friday, the dollar climbed 35.9 percent against the German mark. Average wage settlements in Germany of 5 percent have been about half the 10 percent rate in the United States, giving the Germans an edge in labor costs.
Then, too, the German economy has been weaker, making it easier for Germans to sell in the United States than for Americans in Germany. ''There is also a greater effort by foreign companies to sell in the United States,'' Mrs. Junz of Townsend-Greenspan said.
The dollar has recovered most of the losses it suffered against major foreign currencies since 1977. But, while it is expected to advance further, some economists cautioned against putting too much weight on its role as determinant of the fate of American exporters.

Abstract: ''When you build up procurement fast, you tend to build up a huge backlog of obligated but unspent funds that actually get spent at times that you can't predict,'' Mr. [W. Bowman Cutter] said in an interview. ''It adds a factor of uncontrollability to the entire budget.'' Mr. Cutter said Mr. [Murray L. Weidenbaum] was right in arguing that fiscal and monetary policy are more restrained now than during Vietnam. But, he said, ''Where you could get into trouble is in particular industries.'' For example, he said, construction of the MX missile system ''could drive up the price of cement - almost certainly would.'' ''You cannot do both,'' Mr. [Seymour Melman] said in a telephone interview, ''It is out of the question.'' This view is diametrically opposed to the White House's prediction that [Reagan] supply-side policies would lead to major increases in labor supply, the quality of work, savings, investment, productivity and the economy's capacity to product.

Full text: President Reagan's chief economic adviser, Murray L. Weidenbaum, says there is no reason to expect the planned build-up of military spending in the next several years to cause a new surge of inflation.
This assertion by the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, in an interview earlier last week, is part of what appears to be a widening debate about the Reagan proposition that Congress can pass a three-year tax cut, vote for bigger defense appropriations and still be confident that inflation will slow appreciably in the next few years.
So far, the debate has been couched largely in terms of aggregates such as total spending, the size of a tax cut and the size of the economy. But a second line of criticism is also emerging: that any shift of resources from civilian to military use tends to drive up costs and the general price level. Some Reagan economists heatedly dispute this view.
The Situation Then and Now
Mr. Weidenbaum, citing his analysis of inflation during the Vietnam War, took issue with critics who have charged that the Reagan Administration's plans for more ships, aircraft and other materiel - and for a higher state of military readiness - are likely to touch off a rerun of the late 1960's, when the current inflation took root.
Circumstances then and now are markedly different, according to Mr. Weidenbaum. The military build-up will be slower this time and the defense budget will account for a smaller fraction of the economy, an economy the White House assumes will be growing rapidly, he said.
Among the critics have been two economists, Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Henry Kaufman of Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street investment banking house. They contend that the Reagan policy, overall, is too stimulative for an economy already experiencing a persistent 10 percent inflation.
Two officials of the Carter Administration, W. Bowman Cutter, an economist who had a senior job at the Office of Management and Budget, and R. James Woolsey, a lawyer who was Under Secretary of the Navy, have joined the debate. Both agree with the Congressional budget office that the Reagan Administration has understated probable future military spending, especially in the fiscal year 1984, the target for balancing the budget. Comments From Economist
''When you build up procurement fast, you tend to build up a huge backlog of obligated but unspent funds that actually get spent at times that you can't predict,'' Mr. Cutter said in an interview. ''It adds a factor of uncontrollability to the entire budget.''
Mr. Cutter said Mr. Weidenbaum was right in arguing that fiscal and monetary policy are more restrained now than during Vietnam. But, he said, ''Where you could get into trouble is in particular industries.'' For example, he said, construction of the MX missile system ''could drive up the price of cement - almost certainly would.''
The proposition that price surges in particular industries will bring about a rise in the overall level of prices is heatedly rejected by those Administration economists who take a monetarist view of inflation. ''If you restrain growth of the money supply and some individual prices go up, other individual prices have to come down,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of the Office of Management and Budget.
This view, that inflation is caused only by excessive expansion of the money supply, is an overarching principle of Reagan economic policies but is much debated within the economics profession. Pattern Over the Years
In an analysis done in mid-April, Mr. Kudlow examined the growth of military spending and inflation in the years 1962-80. ''Overall, no direct association was found'' between military spending and two broad measures of inflation, the Consumer Price Index and the deflator for the gross national product, he concluded.
Seymour Melman, professor of industrial engineering at Columbia University and a long-time critic of military spending under several Presidents, argues that the Reagan military budget would claim the very resources needed for an expansion of private investment in machines and plants, which is also a Reagan policy goal.
''You cannot do both,'' Mr. Melman said in a telephone interview, ''It is out of the question.'' This view is diametrically opposed to the White House's prediction that Reagan supply-side policies would lead to major increases in labor supply, the quality of work, savings, investment, productivity and the economy's capacity to product.
Mr. Melman also argues that military procurement is inflationary because it encourages the use of high-cost production techniques and that such methods become widespread and entrenched. For example, he said, American producers of numerically controlled machine tools are stuck with a high-cost technology that they developed for the Air Force. Response by Weidenbaum
Mr. Weidenbaum, replying to Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Thurow, made these points:
- The build-up of military spending will lift the total to 6 percent of the G.N.P. by 1984, still below the 8.9 percent during the Vietnam War. Moreover, the rise from 1980 will amount to only one percentage point, against a rise of 1.8 points in 1965-67. Mr. Weidenbaum said these ratios assumed the strong economic expansion predicted in the Reagan budget.
- In constant dollars, the 1965-67 rise in defense spending was 36 percent. The rise projected for 1980-84 is the same.
- There is more unused manufacturing capacity and more unemployed labor now than in 1965-67. That means less risk of bottlenecks that drive up costs. In aerospace, backlogs of unfilled orders have been dropping.

DEMOCRATS BUDGET TOPS REAGAN FIGURE ON SOCIAL PROGRAMS

Abstract: Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. said at a news conference that the Democratic alternative budget was ''designed to address the needs of the 'struggling class' of Americans who are unable to keep up with rising prices, and who find it harder and harder to get by.'' ''It's a plan that's been well thought out, and reflects the art of compromise,'' the Speaker said. ''A lot of work went into it from every segment of our party.'' Mr. [David A. Stockman] said the Democrats' proposed economies, to offset roughly their increases in the [Reagan] nonmilitary budget, were ''questionable, soft or nonexistent.'' He took issue with purported economies for payments to veterans, revenue sharing and the strategic oil reserve. He labeled as ''absolutely artificial'' what he said was the Democrats' contemplated recovery of $1.3 billion from oil companies to settle charges of having violated price controls.

Full text: House Democrats today proposed a $713.5 billion budget for the fiscal year 1982 and recommended more funds than the Administration sought for social programs and what would seem to be more money for military needs as well, although the Democrats said it was actually less than the Administration has proposed.
The Democrats also said that their budget total was $4.3 billion less than proposed by President Reagan in March. They based that statement on their calculation that President Reagan's $695 billion budget used an incorrect projection for inflation and that, when the Reagan budget is adjusted for higher inflation, the total is really $717.8 billion. The Democrats also endorsed a smaller tax cut than the one proposed by the President and urged that the Administration's proposed deficit, which the Administration calculates at $45 billion but which the Democrats estimate at $50.5 billion, be cut to $24.6 billion. They also projected a balanced budget by the fiscal year 1983, a year earlier than the Administration projected.
Saving Based on Barring Fraud
The House Democrats outbid the Administration in commitment to fiscal austerity by relying upon some budgetary strategms that will surely be questioned. In one case, a saving of $4.8 billion was ascribed to eliminating fraud, waste and abuse. This was in addition to a $4.3 billion reduction from the Democrats' estimate of the Reagan figure for military spending and a $1.5 billion reduction in money for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
The Democrats' economic assumptions put the inflation rate near 10 percent, compared with the Administration's projection of 8.3 percent. The House Democrats also assumed interest rates of 12 percent on Federal borrowing, compared with the 9 percent projected by the Administration. Stockman Counterattacks
Counterattacking within hours, David A. Stockman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, charged that the Democrats would cut military programs that were essential to national security and that their purported economies in other areas were ''questionable, soft or nonexistent.''
Mr. Stockman and Donald T. Regan, Secretary of the Treasury, objected to the Democrats' proposal for a smaller and apparently later tax cut than Mr. Reagan's. Mr. Stockman, harking back to a Reagan campaign theme, called that ''balancing the budget on the backs of the taxpayers.''
In a rare show of unity, 17 of the 18 Democrats on the House Budget Committee, ranging from urban liberals to rural conservatives, supported the package in the Democrats' caucus. The one holdout was Representative Phil Gramm of Texas. House Democratic leaders predicted that the package would have the overwhelming support of party members when it reached the floor after the Easter recess.
Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. said at a news conference that the Democratic alternative budget was ''designed to address the needs of the 'struggling class' of Americans who are unable to keep up with rising prices, and who find it harder and harder to get by.''
''It's a plan that's been well thought out, and reflects the art of compromise,'' the Speaker said. ''A lot of work went into it from every segment of our party.''
The Democrats said that they were not abandoning the needs of the poor. They proposed a reduction of 10 to 12 percent in money for many social programs, instead of the 25 percent reduction they calclate that the Administration has urged.
The Democrats sought $4.3 billion less than the $194 billion that they calculated the Reagan Administration recommended for military needs, although it is just under a billion dollars more than the $188.8 billion that Mr. Reagan said would be needed for the military. But Representative James R. Jones, Democrat of Oklahoma, chairman of the Budget Committee, said that even with what the Democrats calculate as a cut, ''This is the largest peacetime increase in defense spending in the history of our nation.'' The current military spending level is $173.9 billion.
The Democrats were able to cut the Reagan deficit by providing a tax cut of $38 billion for the fiscal year 1982, instead of the $54 billion proposed by the Administration. Mr. Jones said that the proposal was approved by Representative Daniel Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
''The minority has some real problems with the economic assumptions,'' said Representative Jack Kemp, Republican of upstate New York.
The House Democrats would save several programs marked for extinction, including the Economic Development Administration and the Legal Services Corporation, while restoring funds for dozens of programs, including food stamps, low income energy assistance, child nutrition and mass transit operating subsidies. Solarz Says New York Will Like It
''I think the people of New York City will be quite pleased with this budget, in contrast with the President's budget,'' said Representative Steven J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who is a member of the committee.
Some of the House Democrats' restorations, all of which are based on Administration figures as they have been adjusted by the Democrats, are these:
- For food stamps, $650 million would be restored of the $1.6 billion recommended cut by the Administration.
- For education, the cut would be 10 percent, compared with the 25 percent sought by the Administration in a $30 billion program.
- For low-income energy assistance, a reduction of $650 million is sought instead of the $1.6 billion recommended by the President.
- In Social Security, the $122 a month minimum benefit would be eliminated, but only for new beneficiaries in the fiscal year 1982, and for all beneficiaries the next year. The Administration would eliminate the minimum benefit in the fiscal year 1982.
- For Medicaid, the President's proposal to cap Medicaid expenses is rejected and Democrats would provides $1.15 billion to meet the additional cost.
- Child nutrition would be reduced by $1 billion, half of the $2 billion reduction proposed by the Administration. Stockman Details Criticism
Mr. Stockman said the Democrats' proposed economies, to offset roughly their increases in the Reagan nonmilitary budget, were ''questionable, soft or nonexistent.'' He took issue with purported economies for payments to veterans, revenue sharing and the strategic oil reserve. He labeled as ''absolutely artificial'' what he said was the Democrats' contemplated recovery of $1.3 billion from oil companies to settle charges of having violated price controls.
As for Democratic cuts in military spending, Mr. Stockman said they were unwise. He specifically criticized the Democrats' proposal to skip a July 1981 pay rise for the military and to delay the MX missile and the Democrats' contention that expansion of the Defense Department's civilian payroll was unnnecessary.

Abstract: At the heart of the problem of course, is inflation. But in many sectors the impact of high prices has been aggravated by the Government's determination to maintain the Mexican peso's parity with the dollar. Last year, for example, while prices rose by 29.8 percent, almost double the United States inflation rate, the peso "floated" downward by only 1.9 percent, to 23.25 pesos to the dollar from 22.8 pesos. This year, the "floating" downward has increased so that a dollar now costs 23.9 pesos. But foreign bankers estimate the peso's "real" value at around 30 units to the dollar. "Oil is being used to cover up all the cracks," said one Mexican economist who is critical of Government policy, "so we're becoming more and more dependent on oil to stay afloat at all. The currency policy is particularly harmful to the tourist industry, with Acapulco reporting its lowest winter season occupancy in 15 years. Officials argue publicly that this is the result of the economic recession in the United States, but many hotels, restaurants and nightclubs here have virtually priced themselves out of the market. A single room in a first-class hotel in Mexico City, for example, now costs around $100 a night, compared with about $35 four years ago.

Full text: A full-page advertisement for a jewelry sale in San Antonio looked strangely out of place in the pages of the Mexico City daily, Excelsior, a few days ago. But the Joske Department Store had made no mistake: its largest clientele is Mexican.
Attracted by prices that are frequently half those prevailing here, more and more middle-class Mexicans are flying to San Antonio and other United States cities near the Mexican border to shop.
In reality, the momentum of Mexico's economic boom - its gross domestic product grew by 7.4 percent in 1980 - is such that commerce here is still barely able to keep up with local demand. But the flight of consumers is nevertheless symptomatic of the economic imbalances that oil is bringing to Mexico.
At the heart of the problem of course, is inflation. But in many sectors the impact of high prices has been aggravated by the Government's determination to maintain the Mexican peso's parity with the dollar. Last year, for example, while prices rose by 29.8 percent, almost double the United States inflation rate, the peso "floated" downward by only 1.9 percent, to 23.25 pesos to the dollar from 22.8 pesos. This year, the "floating" downward has increased so that a dollar now costs 23.9 pesos. But foreign bankers estimate the peso's "real" value at around 30 units to the dollar.
The exchange rate situation encourages Mexicans to buy abroad and travel abroad, while it translates high domestic prices into high dollar prices for foreigners wanting to visit Mexico or buy its products. The bottom line last year was a current-account payments deficit of $6.6 billion, the highest in the country's history and a 36 percent increase over 1979.
"Oil is being used to cover up all the cracks," said one Mexican economist who is critical of Government policy, "so we're becoming more and more dependent on oil to stay afloat at all. The currency policy is particularly harmful to the tourist industry, with Acapulco reporting its lowest winter season occupancy in 15 years. Officials argue publicly that this is the result of the economic recession in the United States, but many hotels, restaurants and nightclubs here have virtually priced themselves out of the market. A single room in a first-class hotel in Mexico City, for example, now costs around $100 a night, compared with about $35 four years ago.
In contrast, Mexicans, who traditionally spend three times more per person abroad than visitors here, are being indirectly encouraged by the currency situation to spend vacations in the United States, Western Europe or even the Caribbean. Last year, while the number of visitors to Mexico remained unchanged and their spending grew by only 15 percent, Mexicans spent 41 percent more abroad than in 1979.
Not surprisingly, with the domestic prices of labor and raw materials rising annually by around 30 percent, Mexico's nonoil exports have also faltered against the products of countries with flexible exchange rates. Last year, the value of its manufactured exports rose by only 15 percent, which, at constant prices, implied a drop.
Calls by some industrialists for a devaluation of the peso, however, have been repeatedly rebuffed by the Government.
"If industrialists argue that it would give them a competitive edge in foreign markets," Industry Minister Jose Andres de Oteyza noted recently, "we should first analyze the fact that there are no products to export, that all of production is consumed on the domestic market and therefore a devaluation is in no way justified.
Fed by high Government expenditure, consumer spending has soared over the past three years and, after the slump in private investment that marked the controlversial administration of President Luis Echeverria Alvarez between 1970 and 1976, many factories are still struggling to expand their capacity to catch up with domestic demand.
Further, with both Government and the private sector importing a great deal for the industrial projects, some officials have said that a devaluation would merely increase the peso cost that must eventually be passed on to the public.
"The main political problem is inflation," one official noted, "so the Government is paying the economic price of holding it down." Oil Production Limits Imposed
Eager to avoid the pitfalls common to oil-exporting developing nations, such as foreign exchange revenues that the local economy cannot absorb, Mexico has in fact decided to level off oil production when a target "platform" of 2.75 million barrels a day is reached later this year. But the administration of President Jose Lopez Portillo has nevertheless decided on a policy of high economic growth, arguing that increased employment opportunities more than compensate for current inflation.
For ordinary Mexicans, though, the arrival of Mexico's oil boom has meant a reduction in their purchasing power, with the price of such basic products as corn, beans, eggs, milk, clothes and shoes all registering increases greater than the official inflation rate announced by the Government.
"A simple pair of shoes costs over 1,000 pesos ($42.50)," one young secretary said as she asked for a raise.
The "loaded gun" of the economy, as one financial analyst put it, remains the current exchange policy, with many officials privately recognizing the danger of a flight of capital as President Lopez Portillo approaches the end of his term in December 1982.
The last major devaluation of the peso took place Aug. 31 1976, just three months before President Echeverria left office, and was followed by economic chaos as the currency was allowed to float - or, in fact, sink - down from its fixed parity of 12.50 pesos to the dollar, reaching at one point 29 pesos to the dollar.
After President Lopez Portillo took power in December 1976, business confidence quickly returned and the peso stabilized around 22 pesos to the dollar, although the Government insisted at the time that the currency would continue to "float" to prevent the kind of economic convulsion provoked by the previous devaluation.

Abstract: Like the United States, after a long postwar period of growth, with relatively low inflation, we have seen serious inflation establish itself in our economy over the last decade or so. In Britain we have seen the inflationary paraphernalia of automatic indexation, wage claims at least in line with price movements, discussion of cost increases ''in real terms'' as if the general rise in the price level were unimportant, and so on. The task of defeating inflation is immeasurably easier if fiscal policy is consistent with the monetary stance. If the government's demand for credit is excessive, the result is high interest rates crowding out private investors, and proper monetary control itself becomes much more difficult. But again, reducing the government's borrowing requirement takes time. In Britain, we are sometimes constrained by our membership in the European Community; in the United States your administrations are sometimes constrained by the division of powers within the Congress. The difficulties of tackling these problems, particularly when the world outlook is so clouded, should not be underestimated. Yet, they are problems that must be tackled vigorously if we are to restore the health of our economies. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sir Geoffrey Howe is Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Full text: I N recent weeks I have been struck by a number of articles in the United States press advising President Reagan on the main problems that would face him on taking office and the main steps the authors felt he should take.
What was particularly interesting to me was the close parallel between the problems identified, and the prescriptions made, in some of those articles, and my own view of the British economy. Indeed, there are close parallels with many of the industrialized countries around the world. We are all suffering from the effects of the severe rise in oil prices since 1979, which has sent the world economy into recession and added to inflationary fires.
But the parallels went further than the joint experience of recession. The articles highlighted the problems of inflation and how to tackle it, government spending and borrowing, and government over-regulation of the private sector. On all these, the authors raised issues that are important to the British economy as well.
Like the United States, after a long postwar period of growth, with relatively low inflation, we have seen serious inflation establish itself in our economy over the last decade or so. In Britain we have seen the inflationary paraphernalia of automatic indexation, wage claims at least in line with price movements, discussion of cost increases ''in real terms'' as if the general rise in the price level were unimportant, and so on.
Successive governments have played a part in our inflationary process, through excessive spending and borrowing, and the pretense that they can solve problems that can only be mastered by changes in economic behavior. In some cases, they have taken over tasks better performed privately.
In others, the problem has been the establishment of a level of entitlement, or standard of provision, that assumes substantial economic growth, which it is then difficult to scale down if the growth does not materialize. Thus, public spending has acquired a momentum divorced from the realities of the productive economy, which has had to bear an increasing burden. The productive sector has been further hampered by levels of personal taxation frustrating to enterprise and effort, and by an excessive number of government regulations. I find echoes of all these phenomena in descriptions of American experience as well.
These are problems which have developed over many years, and they will not be solved overnight. But I now find near universal agreement among my fellow finance ministers that inflation must be cut to restore stable conditions for growth and new employment.
There is agreement, too, that monetary control is a necessary condition for the reduction of inflation, and that this control needs to be sustained. Indeed, a responsible attitude to the money supply needs to become a permanent feature if the deeply ingrained inflationary mentality is to be eradicated. The right method of monetary control will vary from country to country according to the nature of the financial institutions in each.
But no method of control, in our highly sophisticated modern economies, can work instant miracles. So far as Britain is concerned, I do not believe there can be any doubt that monetary conditions have been tight, despite the fact that the broader monetary aggregates have been growing rather faster than the Government's target would indicate. The narrower aggregates have been growing much slower than the rate of inflation.
We have succeeded in reducing our year-on-year inflation rate from a peak of 22 percent last May to just over 15 percent, while the annualized six-month rate is much lower - well below the rates in the United States and France, for example. Meanwhile, short-term interest rates have been reduced by 3 percent since last summer. And there is increasing evidence in the labor market of the sort of realism we need to insure adequate control over domestic costs. Many wage settlements have now come down to single-figure increases. And strikes have been at an all-time low.
The task of defeating inflation is immeasurably easier if fiscal policy is consistent with the monetary stance. If the government's demand for credit is excessive, the result is high interest rates crowding out private investors, and proper monetary control itself becomes much more difficult. But again, reducing the government's borrowing requirement takes time.
I HAVE already mentioned the built-in momentum of many spending programs. It takes time to reverse this. Further, at a time of recession there is upward pressure on the fiscal deficit from higher benefit payments and lower revenues. These are often regarded as automatic stabilizers, mitigating the effects of a recession, and we have judged that we should not try to counteract their effect altogether.
Nevertheless, we are reversing inexorable growth of public expenditure, and our plans now provide for a reduction in real terms of about 1 percent a year in 1981-82 and subsequent years as compared with the previous Government's plans for a 2 percent increase.
This has enabled us also to make a start on cutting the high personal taxes that were a uniquely foolish disincentive in the British economy. This objective of cutting personal taxes is potentially in short-run conflict, as a matter of simple arithmetic, with the objective of reducing Government borrowing. The long-term answer is planned cuts in spending, and extra revenue will be derived as the economy grows.
In the meantime, we have chosen to strike a prudent balance between the two goals, and have increased revenue from indirect taxation to offset reductions in income tax. But the fact remains that in my first budget I cut income taxes across the board and reduced the top rate of tax on earnings to 60 percent from 83 percent, thus substantially increasing the rewards successful managers are able to earn.
Reducing the burden of unnecessary regulation on industry and commerce is the other supply-side policy. The first stages have been quickly achieved. I have removed a battery of controls in Britain; on prices, pay, dividends and movements of capital across foreign exchanges. But not all deregulation is as simple as we should wish. We all have to take account of legitimate anxieties about such matters as health and safety, protection of the consumer and the environment. We need to allow for our institutional constraints.
In Britain, we are sometimes constrained by our membership in the European Community; in the United States your administrations are sometimes constrained by the division of powers within the Congress. The difficulties of tackling these problems, particularly when the world outlook is so clouded, should not be underestimated. Yet, they are problems that must be tackled vigorously if we are to restore the health of our economies. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sir Geoffrey Howe is Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Abstract: Nineteen states registered declines or only small increases in nonfarm income. The largest single factor was a drop in payrolls for industries making durable goods, especially cars, steel and lumber products. Eight states showed comparatively large increases in nonfarm income, attributed mainly to increases in mining, manufacturing and construction payrolls. The eight states - Oklahoma, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, California, Arizona, New Mexico and Wyoming - historically have been affected relatively little by national recessions, the report said. The Southwestern region led the nation with an overall 2.5 percent improvement in nonfarm income for the April-to-June quarter. The Far West was second, with an increase of 1.9 percent. The Middle Atlantic states had a 1.5 percent increase; New England, the Rocky Mountain states and the Southeast, a 1.3 percent increase; the Plains states, a 1 percent increase, and the Great Lakes states, a 0.6 percent increase.

Full text: American working men and women saw their personal income gains in the second quarter outstripped by prices that increased more than twice as fast, the Commerce Department said today.
Total personal income in the April-to-June period, including farm income, rose an average of 1.1 percent nationwide over the first three months of the year as a severe recession gripped the economy and choked off expansion that began in 1975.
At the same time, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said, inflation rose 2.6 percent, more than wiping out the improvement in income.
The most striking aspect of the report was the pervasiveness of inflation. Income increased in 34 states and the District of Columbia, but in every case was overcome by the increase in prices.
Two States Nearly Broke Even
Florida and Louisiana came closest to breaking even in the threemonth period, registering 2.4 percent increases in total personal income, including farm income.
Worst off was Michigan, with its depressed automobile industry, which registered a 1.1 percent decline in income. Idaho showed a 1 percent drop.
New York and New Jersey each showed an increase in income of 1.6 percent over the first quarter of the year, while Connecticut showed an increase of 1.5 percent.
Most of the report deals with nonfarm personal income, which department analysts view as a more stable measure of the economy because of the volatility of farm income.
Before adjustment for inflation, nonfarm income rose in 44 states and the District of Columbia in the second quarter. The nation as a whole showed a 1.4 percent increase after an improvement of 2.9 percent in the first three months.
Oklahoma Ahead After Adjustment
When farm income is taken into account and measured against the 2.6 percent inflation of the second quarter, only Oklahoma, with a 3 percent increase in income, stayed ahead of inflation. Florida stayed even.
Oklahoma's second-quarter increase in income matched its firstquarter rate. But in every other state, the second quarter - when the recession was at its worst - brought less growth than the first.
Nineteen states registered declines or only small increases in nonfarm income. The largest single factor was a drop in payrolls for industries making durable goods, especially cars, steel and lumber products.
Most of those 19 states, concentrated in the Great Lakes region, New England and the Southeast, also were severely affected by the 1974-5 recession.
Comparatively Large Increases
Eight states showed comparatively large increases in nonfarm income, attributed mainly to increases in mining, manufacturing and construction payrolls. The eight states - Oklahoma, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, California, Arizona, New Mexico and Wyoming - historically have been affected relatively little by national recessions, the report said.
The Southwestern region led the nation with an overall 2.5 percent improvement in nonfarm income for the April-to-June quarter. The Far West was second, with an increase of 1.9 percent. The Middle Atlantic states had a 1.5 percent increase; New England, the Rocky Mountain states and the Southeast, a 1.3 percent increase; the Plains states, a 1 percent increase, and the Great Lakes states, a 0.6 percent increase.
The nation's nonfarm income in the second quarter rose at a rate that, if continued for a full year, would result in a total of $2.057 trillion, up 10.8 percent from the same period in 1979.

Full text: Wall Street and the business community welcomed the election of Ronald Reagan yesterday, amid predictions that the President-elect would oversee the most pro-business administration since that of Dwight D. Eisenhower.
''This conservative landslide should provide considerable encouragement for the private sector, resulting in increased economic activity and increased business investment for plant and equipment in 1981,'' said Reginald H. Jones, chief executive of the General Electric Company and chairman of the Business Council, an organization of top corporate executives.
Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of business cycles, observed: ''The Reagan election is quite promising for business and the economy because it shows broad support for what is seen as a strong inflation-fighting program.''
Indeed, the consensus among economists, corporate managers and Wall Street executives is that a Reagan administration should strengthen the economy by improving the likelihood of controlling inflation and interest rates, cutting taxes and increasing incentives for saving and investment.
Defense and Nuclear Development
They expect sharply increased defense spending, with the nation's strategic weapons program receiving a strong push. In energy, fewer Federal restraints and a new impetus for the development of nuclear power is foreseen. The steel industry expects a Government posture that should enhance its profitability and productivity, as well as increase the chances for Congress to grant a two-year delay of pollution-control requirements.
In Detroit, auto executives say that regulatory and tax relief, begun under President Carter, should accelerate under Mr. Reagan. Wall Street analysts foresee continued strength in the stock market rally in response to the Reagan victory. The widely followed Dow Jones industrial average could pierce the 1000 barrier toward the end of this year, they say.
Bond traders, too, view a Reagan Presidency favorably, as one likely to install the conservative fiscal policies that they regard as long overdue.
Some Reservations Expressed
Still, those interviewed do not, by any means, expect the economy to show new vitality overnight, nor do they anticipate revolutionary policy shifts.
''The changes aren't going to be radical or violent,'' said Albert T. Sommers, chief economist of the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research group. ''Just about everyone in the business community recognizes that.''
Several business leaders and economists expressed reservations about some of Mr. Reagan's campaign positions, which they characterized as extreme or simplistic. In particular, they are concerned that his pledges to raise military spending significantly and slice personal income taxes sharply at the same time could worsen inflation.
But for the most part, those interviewed believe that, as President, Mr. Reagan will be more moderate and balanced than his campaign rhetoric might suggest; they think his extreme proposals will be reformulated both by his senior advisers and Congress.
In sum, the business community believes that, once in office, Mr. Reagan will be pragmatic, not dogmatic, and that the general drift of his conservative philosophy is precisely what the American business needs.
Bonds
''We're enjoying a Reagan rally right now,'' said James M. Davin, manager of corporate bond trading for the First Boston Corporation, yesterday. ''The market is and should be buoyed by the Reagan victory and the conservative sweep across the country.''
However, Mr. Davin and others speculated that after an initial period of euphoria, investors in fixed-income securities are likely to focus again on the prospect of higher interest rates as the economy comes out of recession. In addition, they point to the Federal Reserve Baord's willingness to raise short-term interest rates if necessary to slow the growth of money supply.
At present, it appears that a tight monetary policy is needed, since the money supply grew an alarming 15 1/2 percent annual rate in the latest quarter. In fact, some analysts expect a tightening move soon, probably an increase in the discount rate.
Still, if Mr. Reagan's programs include a hefty dose of tight-money fiscal conservatism, as Wall Street hopes, the long-term effect ''would be tremendously beneficial to the bond markets,'' said Richard Hoey, an economist at Bache Halsey Stuart.
Stocks
As yesterday's performance indicated, the stock market is advancing, at least in the short run. Historically, the market rallies after a Republican victory. Such rises can be sharp and generally last a month or two.
William M. LeFevre, investment strategist for Purcell, Graham & Company, said the Reagan rally would reach ''something on the order of 1000, or a shade more, between late November 1980 and mid-January 1981.''
According to analysts, industry categories most likely to advance are domestic oil, high technology, aerospace and other defense suppliers. The outlook for such basic industries as steel and autos also seem brighter.
Should the Reagan administration show signs of success in bringing down inflation, the interest-rate-sensitive sector, including home building, finance and retailing, will benefit, said Howard J. Abner, senior vice president of Laidlaw Adams & Peck.
However, the longer-term outlook for the market is uncertain, analysts acknowledge. And Mr. LeFevre noted: ''Not since Calvin Coolidge, in 1925, has the stock market advanced during the first year of any Republican administration.''
Defense
Mr. Reagan has committed his administration to a major rearmament of America. Yesterday, investors certainly took him at his word, with the buying demand for defense stocks so heavy that several issues could not open until after noon.
According to Michael Derchin, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, the election of many conservative candidates in Congress is also seen as crucial to the defense industry. ''Recent Congresses have tilted toward butter when they weighed the guns-or-butter issue,'' said Mr. Derchin. ''But this one will tilt toward guns.''
Under the Reagan Administration, the defense industry expects a major buildup of strategic weapons, including a speedup of the MX missile program, which is expected to cost $60 billion to $70 billion over several years.
A replacement for the 20-year-old B-52 bomber, either the so-called Stealth bomber or a derivative of the canceled B-1, is likely to have high priority. And production of cruise missiles and Trident submarines is expected to be stepped up.
Defense experts say that the aerospace industry should get a lift from the export of sophisticated fighter aircraft, reversing the ban of the Carter years.
Boeing and Martin Marietta are considered likely to be among the leading beneficiaries of the defense buildup. Boeing is the prime contractor for the air-launched cruise missile and would also likely be the lead concern for the Stealth bomber. Martin Marietta would get nearly a third of the revenues from the MX missile program.
Among the other companies expected to reap handsome rewards from the Reagan arms buildup: General Dynamics, maker of the Trident, and Northrup, which builds fighter planes that should be popular exports.
Steel
''I see the election results as the start of a whole new era of greater productivity and profitability for the steel industry,'' said William J. DeLancey, chief executive of the Republic Steel Corporation and chairman of the American Iron and Steel Institute, the industry trade group.
Yet the new era, in Mr. DeLancey's view, is a gradual, long-term proposition, resulting from an expected shift in Government policy toward less regulation and more encouragement for investment in capital-intensive industries, such as steel.
''There won't be instantaneous results,'' he said, ''but in time the steel industry will benefit.'' Specifically, steel executives expect that a recommended two-year delay on some pollution strictures will be approved. Moreover, they anticipate the continuation of the trigger-price system, reinstituted last month, which provides the domestic industry with some protection from dumping of low-cost foreign production.
David M. Roderick, chairman of the United States Steel Corporation, said that he expected the new Reagan appointees to maintain the policies already in place and ''continue to broaden our support.''
Autos
It is the antiregulatory and tax-cutting side of the Reagan agenda that is most attractive to Detroit executives. Thus, in a Reagan Administration, they see lower costs and incentives for raising the huge amounts of capital the industry needs to convert its production to the smaller, fuel-thrifty cars. The total cost of that retooling is estimated at $80 billion through 1985.
Perhaps the most immediate advantage of a Reagan Administration for car and truck makers, executives say, should be a change in attitude at such regulatory agencies as the Department of Trade and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Mr. Reagan has proposed relief on the Federal fuel economy standards and eliminating requirements for ''passive restraints'' - air bags or automatic seat belts. Dropping the passive restraint requirement alone could save the industry hundreds of millions of dollars, estimates a legislative analyst for one of the Big Three auto makers.
One point of uncertainty among Detroit executives is what Mr. Reagan will do about car shipments from Japan. Mr. Reagan has said he would talk to the Japanese about voluntary restraint but expressed reservations about imposing definite import restrictions.
Moreover, Chrysler executives take comfort from Mr. Reagan's complete turnabout on legislation to aid the auto maker. A year ago, when asked about Chrysler, Mr. Reagan replied, ''What's wrong with bankruptcy?'' But last September, standing in the humming assembly plant where renovation was financed by Government-guaranteed loans, he characterized the rescue program as the ''proper answer.'' Energy
With Mr. Reagan in the White House and a more conservative Congress, energy executives and analysts foresee a much greater emphasis on energy production and the development of nuclear power, with the breeder reactor pushed harder.
On the other hand, less emphasis will be placed on conservation, energy-related environmental issues, developing renewable resources and equity for consumer groups, according to energy experts.
In some respects, they say, much of the fundamental energy debate will now change. No longer will the basic dynamic of energy politics be consumer states versus producer states. Consumer-oriented liberals were battered in this election.
''This is cataclysmic for energy policy,'' said James Bishop Jr., an aide to former Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger and now a consultant and writer. ''The production ethic will now be predominant, and the debates over price control and equity questions will be gone.''
Despite Mr. Reagan's campaign threats to scrap the Department of Energy, some observers say the department may actually be enlarged since two-thirds of its budget is related to national security. ''Those weapons labs have got to be pouring champagne right now,'' Mr. Bishop said.
An early test for the Reagan team will be in its treatment of smaller producers in the face of ultimate price decontrol next October. Without special Federal provisions, these smaller producers are expected to be endangered. If the Reagan team allows that to occur, it will be viewed by analysts as an indication that the new administration is taking an ideological course in energy. If it somehow shields the smaller producers, it will be taken as a sign of a more pragmatic, moderate approach.
Still, energy development is a long-term endeavor, cautioned Douglas Perry, a Gulf executive. ''It takes years to get out, do your studies and get oil onto the market,'' said Mr. Perry.
Moreover, while a more favorable climate for energy development may well increase supply somewhat, industry analysts stress that it will not eradicate ''the energy problem'' by any means.
Trade
There should be ''relatively minor changes'' in international economic policy under a Reagan administration, said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States.
One of the real strengths of American trade policy is that it traditionally has been bipartisan, observed Robert D. Hormats, a United States trade representative who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations. And Mr. Hormats, like others, foresees no major changes in trade policy under the Reagan team.
''Mr. Reagan will continue to embrace the general principles of free trade,'' said Leif H. Olsen, chairman of Citibank's economic policy committee. ''He will also place a high priority on counteracting dumping and other violations of fair trade.''

Abstract: Australia's national election campaign entered its final week today with Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's coalition trailing slightly in the polls. He also has offered a naval base at Cockburn Sound near Perth in Western Australia to the United States Navy as a home port. The Labor Party has said it would allow the United States to use Australia for a staging area for the B-52 bombers provided they did not carry nuclear weapons. Mr. [William Hayden]'s party is opposing American use of the Cockburn Sound facility because many of the warships in the United States Navy are nuclear powered.

Full text: Australia's national election campaign entered its final week today with Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's coalition trailing slightly in the polls.
About 9 million people are eligible to vote in the elections next Saturday in which Australia's military relationship with the United States has become an important issue.
In the latest Gallup poll, published yesterday, Mr. Fraser's conservative coalition, consisting of the Liberal and National Country parties, trailed Labor by 2 percentage points, 49 to 51. This represented a gain for the 50-year-old Prime Minister, who was behind by a wider margin earlier.
Mr. Fraser's coalition, in its campaign, has emphasized tight economic management and lowering of the current 10-percent inflation rate.
Labor Party Favors Tax Cut
The Labor Party, led by William Hayden, 47, says that if it is elected it will spend federal money to reduce the current 6 percent unemployment rate, immediately cut income taxes and freeze the price of gasoline for 12 months.
Mr. Fraser, who was first elected in 1975, has been an outspoken critic of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and nearly ordered Australian athletes to boycott the Moscow Olympic Games.
His Government has increased defense spending nearly 18 percent to $4.1 billion for the current fiscal year and has committed the nation to providing bases for United States military planes and warships in Australia.
The Prime Minister said he would allow American B-52 bombers, which have been flying over northern Australia on training missions from Guam, to use the Royal Australian Air Force base at Darwin as a refueling and staging area.
Use of Naval Base Offered
He also has offered a naval base at Cockburn Sound near Perth in Western Australia to the United States Navy as a home port. The Labor Party has said it would allow the United States to use Australia for a staging area for the B-52 bombers provided they did not carry nuclear weapons. Mr. Hayden's party is opposing American use of the Cockburn Sound facility because many of the warships in the United States Navy are nuclear powered.
In the current Parliament, Mr. Fraser's coalition has a majority of 48 in the 124-seat House of Representatives and an overall 6-seat majority in the Senate.

THE SCHMIDT FACTOR

Abstract: The West Germans, and Mr. [Helmut Schmidt] foremost among them, have never really made up their minds about how strong they are, and this makes it very difficult for both to define what they can and want to do. When Mr. Schmidt talked about West Germany's growing leadership role this summer, he quickly added that his country is not a world power and will never become one. ''It's in the middle category,'' he says, not enhancing his reputation for precision. But when Mr. Schmidt is in an expansive mood, or an electioneering one, he likes to remind listeners that West Germany has the world's greatest currency reserves, the second greatest gold reserves, the world's biggest exports per capita and the hardest currency of any major industrial country. During the oil crises and recessions of the last six years, he says West Germany has shown in comparison with other industrial societies that it has ''come out relatively well, indeed, the best.'' West German per capita annual income has climbed to a level where it is ahead of the United States ($9,278 in 1978 compared to $7,572), and its citizens are the world's greatest travelers. When Mr. Schmidt is really rolling, he tells his countrymen they are living in the best, fairest and freest Germany ever. History says he's probably right. At the same time, it is a rare exchange student, visiting businessman or member of an official delegation who has not heard ''Do not ask too much of us, do not overrate us.'' Up until two years ago, West German foreign-aid contributions in relation to gross national product had been at a very low level, and even now the Government is reluctant to issue a timetable showing how it plans to meet the United Nations' aid target of 0.7 percent for industrial countries. By United States Defense Department measurements, the German armed forces, though undoubtedly the best in Western Europe, have not been developing at the rate NATO set up as a goal to meet Soviet military expansion. When West Germany was pressed once again last winter for additional help to smooth out the Common Market's payments and agricultural problems, the Government's answer was, ''We aren't Europe's paymaster.'' The country's economy is only one-third the size of that of the United States, Mr. Schmidt reminds people when they press him too hard for help, and his aides will stress that West Germany's capacity for expansion is relatively limited, given the high costs of social security to industry and the problems of productivity it faces. It seems a distant memory now, in light of the easy victory Mr. Schmidt is expected to win, but it is not insignificant to note, in assessing the Chancellor's strength and possible scope as a world leader, that just four years ago he was a politician in trouble. In the October 1976 elections, for the first time since 1953, his party failed to achieve national gains in the popular vote, and his coalition's lead in seats in the Bundestag fell from 46 to eight. After the election, Mr. Schmidt could not make good on a campaign promise to increase pensions by 10 percent, a bitter personal embarrassment after a race decided totally on domestic issues by voters who consider a platform plank a kind of signed dealer's warranty. The Government just did not have the cash. Almost at the same time, a wave of antinuclearly destabilize the country's economic situation.

When the Bundestag voted on his nomination as Chancellor, two coalition members deserted him, and he passed with just one more vote than the required 249. He appeared grim, drawn and seriously depressed. His Labor Minister resigned. Looking back, an aide acknowledged that the Chancellor was ''talking about quitting.''

Full text: AuthorAffiliation John Vinocur is the chief of The New York Times bureau in Bonn.
One of Helmut Schmidt's old Social Democratic buddies in Hamburg was asked recently to describe the man. He made a list of characteristics: lightning intelligence, vast technical expertise, pragmatism and tirelessness. The accounting also included permanent irritability, a tendency to depression, know-it-allism and arrogance. ''Oh, yeah,'' he said, remembering something. ''He's convinced most of the time that he's the only real leader in the Western world. He's also probably right. The problem is he's German.''
Five years ago, the notion of a West German world leader would have seemed a bit of local boosterism. Now it is a time for taking oneself very seriously in Bonn. A kind of institutionalized awe has set in. It has taken increasing hold over the last three years, a period in which West Germany and Mr. Schmidt, partly through American leadership troubles, partly through their own strengths, have been carried forward into a place where they have a considerable say about how the world is run. The vocabu-lary of caution that was always the shapeless garment of West German postwar policy seems to be falling away. These days, the summit meeting in Guadeloupe in January 1979, which brought West Germany and Mr. Schmidt into the Western Big Four for the first time, sometimes gets referred to in Government circles in Bonn as the ''deflowering'' that allowed a German return to the highest levels of international politics. Although the idea still comes wrapped in conditions and provisos and references to the country's Nazi past, Mr. Schmidt began this summer to talk for the first time about West Germany's ''leadership role,'' a phrase that had always been scrupulously avoided.
Last year, Mr. Schmidt insisted in an interview that West Germany really was not an economic giant. Now he says that, with the exception of the United States, his country's financial and commercial strength is the greatest in the world. Without West German leadership, he goes on, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear modernization program would never have been approved. He was the prime force behind the creation of the European Monetary System. This summer, Mr. Schmidt claims, his exercise of independent leadership - his insistence on talking to Leonid Brezhnev at a time when the United States was trying to punish the Soviet Union for the invasion of Afghanistan - reintroduced the East-West dialogue and, in his words, pulled the world ''back, thank God, from a terrible phase.'' The time is past, the Chancellor says, when West Germany considers as right everything that the United States wants to accomplish.
But the question is, Where does Mr. Schmidt want to take West Germany and the Europeans who see him as a leader? The man running against him in national elections on Oct. 5, Franz Josef Strauss, says that direction is toward ''self-neutralization,'' away from the United States and away from the Atlantic alliance. A polling organization, which, like all the other public-opinion surveyors in Germany, says that Mr. Schmidt can't lose against Mr. Strauss, also reports that most Social Democrats prefer a course between the two superpowers rather than alongside the United States. Mr. Schmidt continues to proclaim his loyalty to the United States, but the temptation to fill what he considers a leadership vacuum may increase if the next American President, regardless of who wins, continues the policies that have made Europe doubtful of American leadership.
A number of Europeans have encouraged Mr. Schmidt to assert himself. ''You've got to do even more leading, Helmut,'' James Callaghan, the former British Prime Minister, has told him. The same kind of prodding has been heard from Edward Heath, Mr. Callaghan's Conservative predecessor, and from Constantine Caramanlis, the Greek Prime Minister. This advice apparently comes, too, from a long trail of others who sit at the Chancellor's office desk with its miniature statue of Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher, or at the bar in his house on Neubergerweg in Langenhorn, a bland, middle-class Hamburg suburb.
But more international leadership involves taking on new burdens and, until now, Mr. Schmidt's standard answer to such urgings has been a catalogue of West German weaknesses and vulnerabilities. As the Chancellor outlines them, his country is susceptible to blackmail because of Berlin and its long eastern border with the Communist world, and limited in its exercise of power because it refuses to have nuclear weapons and will not send its troops out of the NATO area.
This talk of vulnerability fascinates and sometimes irritates people coming to West Germany for the first time, their heads full of the remarkable statistics of economic yield and production and accomplishment, their eyes skimming from the grass that always seems trimmed to the garbage cans that seem never to lose their covers, along streets where everything seems to function. Even the faces, much like Mr. Schmidt's, look back offering, if no embrace, a willfulness, a readiness to get on with things. But the Germans' conviction about their vulnerability, the fragility of the life they have gotten so attached to, is profound, and their desire not to take risks is equal to it, coloring everything Helmut Schmidt does.
The West Germans, and Mr. Schmidt foremost among them, have never really made up their minds about how strong they are, and this makes it very difficult for both to define what they can and want to do. When Mr. Schmidt talked about West Germany's growing leadership role this summer, he quickly added that his country is not a world power and will never become one. ''It's in the middle category,'' he says, not enhancing his reputation for precision. But when Mr. Schmidt is in an expansive mood, or an electioneering one, he likes to remind listeners that West Germany has the world's greatest currency reserves, the second greatest gold reserves, the world's biggest exports per capita and the hardest currency of any major industrial country. During the oil crises and recessions of the last six years, he says West Germany has shown in comparison with other industrial societies that it has ''come out relatively well, indeed, the best.'' West German per capita annual income has climbed to a level where it is ahead of the United States ($9,278 in 1978 compared to $7,572), and its citizens are the world's greatest travelers. When Mr. Schmidt is really rolling, he tells his countrymen they are living in the best, fairest and freest Germany ever. History says he's probably right.
At the same time, it is a rare exchange student, visiting businessman or member of an official delegation who has not heard ''Do not ask too much of us, do not overrate us.'' Up until two years ago, West German foreign-aid contributions in relation to gross national product had been at a very low level, and even now the Government is reluctant to issue a timetable showing how it plans to meet the United Nations' aid target of 0.7 percent for industrial countries. By United States Defense Department measurements, the German armed forces, though undoubtedly the best in Western Europe, have not been developing at the rate NATO set up as a goal to meet Soviet military expansion. When West Germany was pressed once again last winter for additional help to smooth out the Common Market's payments and agricultural problems, the Government's answer was, ''We aren't Europe's paymaster.'' The country's economy is only one-third the size of that of the United States, Mr. Schmidt reminds people when they press him too hard for help, and his aides will stress that West Germany's capacity for expansion is relatively limited, given the high costs of social security to industry and the problems of productivity it faces.
It is possible to argue that this yes-no-yes attitude about itself is a kind of adolescent identity struggle on the road to the country's inevitable consecration as leader of Western Europe and, perhaps, a role as a kind of associate superpower. There are the obvious reservations about pushing too hard because of the past - Mr. Schmidt said last year that ''the greater the relative success of Germany, the longer the memory of Auschwitz will last.'' There is also a resistance to responsibility that comes from the 35-year habit of being able to concentrate on business and on welfare programs at home while the British were dissolving an empire, the French were fighting two colonial wars and dealing with their own left, and the Americans were struggling through race problems and the Vietnam War. And beyond the Germans' personal hesitations, there are aspects of modern Germany that might give proponents of a greater German leadership role pause.
Mr. Schmidt congratulated himself and the nation for weathering without convulsion the 1976-77 terrorist onslaught, an attempt to shake the state by a group of middle-class young people who, among other things, hated Germany's very palpable materialism and premium on order. But there have been troubling moments for democracy, too. A law was passed that permitted judges to read letters between lawyers and individuals jailed as terrorists, contacts that are privileged under American law. Mr. Schmidt, before he changed his mind, had himself called for legislation that would have allowed magistrates to monitor private conversations between lawyers and suspects, and it was later disclosed that the Government had bugged many such conversations.
West Germany is relatively free of the class afflictions of Britain or France, but the social fabric is not without strain. Sociologists have worked hard trying to figure out why drug addiction is rising rapidly and why a word had to be coined (''kinderfeindlichkeit'') to describe the dislike of children, a phenomenon painfully acknowledged by members of Mr. Schmidt's Government and underscored by statistics that show West Germany as Europe's leader in auto accidents involving children. Some attribute the attitude to a repressed aggression meted out against something smaller and weaker, others suggest that it reflects a kind of self-centeredness that has contributed to a 50 percent cut in the birth rate since 1964.
At the same time, the birth rate among the foreigners who have come to take menial industrial jobs in Germany is twice that of native Germans. Out of a population of 61 million, there are now about 4.1 million foreigners. A quarter of them are Turks, and most are concentrated in the big cities, so that the foreign population in some places reaches 20 percent. A poll this summer of young foreigners, many of them born in West Germany, showed that two-thirds considered themselves as ''unwelcome guests'' who had almost nothing to do with Germans of their own age. They are often alienated, unemployed and inadequately schooled. Already this situation is reflected in a high crime rate, and the problem and the potential for immense social tension are only expected to grow.
Even the prospect for Germany's economic performance, which has inspired so much of the admiration for Mr. Schmidt, is less than perfectly secure over the next 10 or 15 years. The Economics Minister, Otto Lambsdorff, suggested this summer that, contrary to what foreigners suppose, the West Germans just may not work hard enough anymore and, compared to the Japanese, may spend too much time on vacation and sick leave. Over the period of a decade, with no one willing to lower his standard of living, West Germany could find itself in a situation like the one already gripping Sweden, where the cost of elaborate and ever-growing welfare programs has cut into industrial competitiveness and made the state a permanent borrower. The pressure on Mr. Schmidt in a second term, particularly from the strengthened left wing of his party, would not be for austerity but for new social reforms.
Because of the country's deep concern with personal financial security -the average German, for example, saves 13 percent of his income compared to 4 percent for the average American - relatively small changes in inflation and unemployment rates can create great public upset. These days, the unemployment rolls are relatively low, though they have been held down, in part, by means of such artifices as Government-subsidized 24-month training programs for prospective bakery clerks. But Mr. Schmidt must confront the reality of a Government-commissioned report this summer that projects a doubling in the current 3.7 jobless rate by 1985.
The official inflation rate was 5.5 percent in July, what would be a welcome figure in the United States, but the system for computing the rise in consumer prices is different in the two countries. If an opponent of the Chancellor had the credibility to make the accusation stick, and there are experts who support it, he could argue that when the world was admiring West Germany's reported inflation rate of 5.6 percent in February, it would have been registered as 14 percent if the Government had been using American measurements.
Franz Josef Strauss has had none of that credibility. In spite of his high intelligence, remarkable sense of humor and great speaking skills, he has been unable to shake his decades-old reputation at home as a cold warrior, confrontationist and potential wild man. Mr. Schmidt has played to those feelings in the electorate (describing Mr. Strauss as ''unpredictable,'' the same word he has used in private about Jimmy Carter) while successfully portraying himself as a man of reason and peace.
In an election campaign in which foreign-policy issues have dominated, Mr. Strauss has struck out at the Chancellor again and again as being a poor and reluctant ally of the United States in the year of Afghanistan and Poland, a man who would sell out the Atlantic alliance. The events in Poland, Mr. Strauss said, exposed the folly of the German Government's policy of supporting loans to the Polish authorities and of Mr. Schmidt's personal friendship with the ousted Communist leader, Edward Gierek. Mr. Schmidt was ''betting on both a politically and economically bankrupt regime,'' he insisted.
Mr. Strauss also warned of growing West German indebtedness, domestic budget deficits, a current accounts deficit and the continuing need for foreign borrowing - all of which, he says, will eventually destabilize the country's economic situation.
It seems a distant memory now, in light of the easy victory Mr. Schmidt is expected to win, but it is not insignificant to note, in assessing the Chancellor's strength and possible scope as a world leader, that just four years ago he was a politician in trouble. In the October 1976 elections, for the first time since 1953, his party failed to achieve national gains in the popular vote, and his coalition's lead in seats in the Bundestag fell from 46 to eight. After the election, Mr. Schmidt could not make good on a campaign promise to increase pensions by 10 percent, a bitter personal embarrassment after a race decided totally on domestic issues by voters who consider a platform plank a kind of signed dealer's warranty. The Government just did not have the cash. Almost at the same time, a wave of antinuclearly destabilize the country's economic situation.

The Government just did not have the cash. Almost at the same time, a wave of antinuclear demonstrations broke out, and Mr. Schmidt seemed unable to deal with them. When the Bundestag voted on his nomination as Chancellor, two coalition members deserted him, and he passed with just one more vote than the required 249. He appeared grim, drawn and seriously depressed. His Labor Minister resigned. Looking back, an aide acknowledged that the Chancellor was ''talking about quitting.''
These long months of doubt, indecisiveness and passivity do not figure among the vulnerabilities that Mr. Schmidt finds politically handy, that he manipulates to make domestic policy or to deal with pressure from allies, such as the do-more-for-defense Americans, or from the third world aid-seekers. In any case, such periods of uncertainty provide a curious psychological counterpoint to Mr. Schmidt's sudden moments of flushness. When he was running for election four years ago, Mr. Schmidt was quoted by a friend as saying he thinks he saved New York City, since he believed he talked President Ford into giving it Federal financial aid. This year, he said, again at election time, that West Germany was in better financial order, with fewer debts, than it was under Kaiser Wilhelm in 1913. The talk intrigues some people and provokes others. With the cocky reference to the Kaiser, some editorialists said, it didn't take much of a historian to notice that 1914 was a year of death and disaster.
Helmut Schmidt was born in Hamburg on Dec. 23, 1918, just about a month after the Kaiser ran out on the Reich to then-neutral Holland. His father, now in his 90's and a resident of an old people's home in a Hamburg suburb, was a schoolteacher, and his paternal grandfather, a stevedore. Mr. Schmidt's coolness and his capacity for hard work are those of his background - a northern port city and the mists between the proletariat and the lower middle class. He is a marvelous actor, able to terrify with his iciness or win over with a look of enraptured attention, and to keep people from coming too close.
He is known to be relatively tight, a non-sufferer of fools who serve no immediate purpose, and his own best public-relations man. In a country whose press, like most in Europe, keeps a respectful distance from its leaders, he has been able to spoon out what he thinks people should know about him - his modest house, his serious tastes in books and music, his attention to business. No pictures are printed of Mr. Schmidt, his jacket off, his waistline thick, his eyes swollen, sitting in his Luftwaffe 707 jetliner after a state visit. And there are no lay psychiatrists on television or in the newspapers to discuss the significance of Mr. Schmidt's nervousness before meetings with other leaders, or to seize upon an admission in an interview that his father, a Prussian type, did not tolerate talking back or crying or any show of feelings and never once offered a word of praise.
His friends admit that his moods can swoop and that he struggles with his anger -calling the country ''ungovernable,'' for example, and then fighting to regain control of himself. The heat of his personality, the pull of his dark moods, his difficulties in keeping control are there, but not spoken of - though he does acknowledge that El Greco, an artist who lived with despair, is his favorite painter. There are no documents on this struggle with himself, only the Chancellor's acknowledged passion for the teachings of Marcus Aurelius and his endure-and-abjure philosophy of leadership. ''Begin each day,'' Marcus Aurelius writes, ''by telling yourself - today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill will and selfishness.''
Ah, yes, ingratitude, insolence - they're everywhere. And the Chancellor responds with a kind of insecurity that has resulted in quick telephone calls to the American Ambassador for a Schmidt lecture on world events or in the dressing down of someone who expresses an errant opinion.
The scene is the Chancellor's personal 707, en route to Washington last March for a meeting with President Carter. A group of reporters is called into Mr. Schmidt's compartment to get the word on the next three days. ''Where's what's-his-name?'' the Chancellor asks, peering around, looking for and then finding an American reporter. He had written an article about West Germany's perception of the United States, and now Mr. Schmidt was reading it out loud. The idea of the story was that sometimes the West German leadership tried to inflict its very structured method for dealing with world events on a superpower that, because of its history of strength and distance from Europe, had an ad hoc, day-to-day approach. The Chancellor scoffed. He knew America, he had been to America 40 or 41 times (''You could check that,'' he said to an aide) and he knew more Congressmen, diplomats, business leaders and labor chiefs than the reporter did. In fact, more than almost any American he could think of. He grinned in triumph.
Yet, there is also a deep current of compassion in the man. An aide, who loves him dearly, told about a left-wing member of the Chancellor's party who had greatly irritated him with a series of critical comments. Though galling, the arguments were also intelligent, the aide said. The critic fell sick and entered a hospital. By the aide's account, the Chancellor wrote the man an unusually warm and deeply personal letter. ''There was no memo on his desk telling him to do it,'' the aide said. ''He just cared. He cares very deeply, he feels very deeply - but he holds it down.''
Nobody disputes Mr. Schmidt's quickness of mind, his powers of persuasion. An adviser, whose authority involves areas of immense technical complexity, says the Chancellor has the most ''extraordinary range of intelligence I have ever seen.''
The Chancellor gave a few peeks at himself by filling in the blanks on a likes-and-dislikes sheet published by a German magazine. His favorite bird, we learn, is a sea parrot. Golda Meir, he says, is his most cherished real-life woman hero. Frankness stands as the quality he seeks most in friends. If Mr. Schmidt is perceived to be a frank man himself, then we will have to believe his assertion that the biggest mistake he ever made was not pushing ahead with his original goal of becoming an architect and city planner.
He got good marks in school in drawing, English and history. He joined the Hitler Youth, advanced to the rank of pack leader and then, he says, was ''suspended,'' apparently because he was considered a bit of a complainer. By 1937, he was in the army, an antiaircraft lieutenant who during the war served in the Soviet Union and in Berlin and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. Eventually he was captured by the British. People who don't like Mr. Schmidt, on both the left and the right, have tried to make something out of his attendance in 1944 at a Nazi show trial of the plotters who tried to kill Hitler. But he has said he was forced to attend, and the British, in any case, found Helmut Schmidt to be clean and quickly let him out of prison camp in 1945, r uling that he was not a Nazi.
In a moment of ironic bitterness, Herbert Wehner, the party whip in the Bundestag, once said that Mr. Schmidt seemed to have learned his progressive politics in officers' clubs. As soon as the young lieutenant went back to Hamburg and into the university, he became a Social Democratic student leader and got a degree in economics. Other than preparing income tax returns, he never had a job outside politics. He reached Parliament in 1953 and became quickly useful as a clever but abrasive speaker who did much of the verbal softening up for his party. His reputation became that of Schmidt-the-lip, the big mouth, the know-it-all, the knife thrower - a part of his character that as Chancellor he has tried to subdue. The speechmaking brought him national attention, but it took a flood in Hamburg, a near catastrophe, to bring him to real prominence in 1962 as that state's Senator for the Interior who brilliantly organized the rescue efforts, standing alongside squad cars with emergency phone in hand for photographers and telling the confused Mayor to buzz off, that Helmut Schmidt was in charge.
In the 60's, Mr. Schmidt wrote two books on defense policy. They showed his immense seriousness, his strong analytical powers and an ability for making wide-ranging political syntheses. (Never much concerned about being called immodest, Mr. Schmidt announced that his summer reading list this year included his own ''Balance of Power,'' written in 1969.) The books probably widened Mr. Schmidt's public image beyond that of energetic doer; now he was a politician of real intellectual and theoretical competence. He had none of the inspirational force field that seemed to surround Willy Brandt, who was also moving toward power in the mid-60's. But in a less obvious, longer-term way, Mr. Schmidt may have been an easier figure for many young German men to identify with - people who saw themselves as competent and aggressive and were probably convinced that they were smarter and better prepared than the Americans or Englishmen they were doing business with. Unlike Mr. Brandt, Helmut Schmidt was not throwing morals or perfect worlds at them. He stood only 5 feet 6 inches tall, and he had thyroid problems. He had a wife who had been a school teacher and a daughter who works for a bank. Like many of them, he owned a middle-of-the-line car, an Opel, drank Coca-Cola and had a little brick house that he bought from a mass developer. He believed mostly, it seemed, in getting things done. By 1972, Mr. Schmidt had been both Defense Minister and Finance Minister, impressing everyone he met in Washington, London and Paris with his unusual capabilities. When Willy Brandt's better world fell apart in 1974, Helmut Schmidt was there, a man who seemed to have a grip on things.
The notion of Mr. Schmidt as a world leader is about three years old. It seems to coincide with the dollar's shriveling against the mark, and the month-in, month-out comparison of Mr. Schmidt's policies with those of President Jimmy Carter. Whenever the two men disagreed, the American President did not seem to win and everybody noticed.
A significant pattern seemed to develop during their first meeting at the economic summit of the Western industrial countries in London in the spring of 1977. The United States went to the summit with the notion that the West German economy could stimulate world trade by expanding more, a concept that became known as the locomotive theory. To the Germans, this meant more inflation, and Mr. Schmidt resisted; inflation, he said, was the biggest cause of the world's economic troubles. Next to the inexperience of Mr. Carter, his expertise at the summit meeting, according to the other leaders, seemed brilliant. ''We were the first to understand that you cannot cure the world's economic and structural crisis by printing money,'' Mr. Schmidt bragged. And in the end, he won; talk about the locomotive theory lingered in the mouths of the Carter Administration economists for another eight or nine months, and then drifted away.
Mr. Schmidt soon found out that it was possible to resist American pressure in other areas where he felt West German national interests were at stake. He could win the arguments, either by means of his own doggedness or because of the inconsistency, as he saw it, of the other side, and at the same time increase the esteem he was held in at home. Mr. Schmidt felt that Mr. Carter's human-rights program was too frontally antagonistic to the Soviet Union, and could possibly endanger his own success in bringing hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans out of countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia and Rumania. He said so. In time, Mr. Schmidt was able to observe the demise of the human-rights offensive, much as he had seen the locomotive theory disappear.
Mr. Schmidt did not think very much, either, of Carter Administration attempts to tell him to whom he could sell nuclear plants. He went ahead with a controversial deal with Brazil. He also resisted a Carter Administration plan that would have allowed United States airlines to challenge Lufthansa's price-setting role by offering their cheap trans-Atlantic fares to travelers in West Germany.
The sum of the conflicts through 1979 seemed to reinforce Mr. Schmidt's conviction that he could increasingly steer his own course. The European Monetary System he and French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing devised that year succeeded in large part in immunizing European currencies from the unsettling fluctuations of the dollar and what Mr. Schmidt saw as American monetary irresponsibility. Although Mr. Schmidt has never said it in so many words, he began to see - as it has been relayed by Kurt Becker, a Hamburg journalist with a close relationship to the Chancellor - that he must, when possible with the French, try to fill the leadership vacuum. Perhaps the hardest blow to Mr. Schmidt's confidence in Mr. Carter was the President's shelving of development of the neutron weapon after the Chancellor had coaxed his party into agreeing to allow the deployment of the weapon in West Germany. He had given Mr. Carter what he asked for, but Mr. Carter didn't want it any more.
By the time of the invasion of Afghanistan last winter, Mr. Schmidt felt he could get his own way on vital kinds of East-West matters. The United States, in essence, wanted the Soviet Union to pay a price for the adventure, to isolate the Russians sufficiently so that withdrawal would have been the only logical way to re-establish the detente it counts on for economic viability. But Mr. Schmidt saw things differently: American leadership seemed erratic to him, uninterested in providing the Russians with a means to save face. The proposed sanctions, including interruption of major industrial contracts, could lead, he feared, to strong political reactions by the Soviet Union against West Germany. It was no way for his country to proceed.
The Chancellor's plan seemed to be that West Germany could offer the Americans an Olympic boycott, a cosmetic kind of solidarity that would wash away as an obstacle to continuing good relations with the Soviet Union by the end of August, at the end of the summer games. At the same time, the Chancellor refused to go along with any of the economic restrictions, and West Germany signed a new trade agreement during his Moscow visit in June. The Christian Democratic opposition called the policy weak-kneed and lacking in solidarity with the United States, but to Mr. Schmidt's eyes, it was protecting peace insofar as it concerned West Germany. His electorate, with the Social Democrats winning an unexpectedly big victory in state elections in May, supported this approach. From the Chancellor's point of view, he had won again and even preserved detente. He may have also convinced himself that, short of a war-within-the-next-week situation, he could increasingly go his own way.
Yet his victories might be considered more a result of Mr. Carter's incoherence than of Mr. Schmidt's own logic. In fact, there were consistent signs of questionable judgment in what Mr. Schmidt was doing, underscoring the limits and fragility that were his own rather than West Germany's.
The most remarkable example was his continual talking down in private of Mr. Carter. It became a feature of Bonn life - every visitor to the Chancellor got a dose. But the attitude spread into semipublic areas as well, and infected much of Mr. Schmidt's party. At two off-the-record seminars, attended by international policy makers, including the United States Ambassador to Bonn, Mr. Schmidt denigrated the American President and his capabilities. Beyond any consideration of whether Mr. Schmidt was right, the attacks seemed ill-considered for the leader of a country still ultimately dependent on the United States for its security. The Chancellor's friends later explained the remarks as a reflection of his distress about the state of Western leadership in general, but many Germans asked if a bigger, more confident man would have given up so easily in trying to offer wise counsel to the American President.
The seminars in Mr. Carter's weakness eventually stopped, but there were other fragile moments for Mr. Schmidt when his judgment appeared faulty. On a spring weekend this year, he seemed again in one of his deeply pessimistic phases. The world, because of the Afghanistan invasion, had became a very dangerous place, the Chancellor said. He indicated that there seemed to be some points of comparison with the situation in 1914 when Europe was marching inexorably toward war without knowing how to stop. That same weekend, Mr. Schmidt made some ambiguous remarks that suggested he was open to discussion of a freeze involving nuclear weapons in Europe, which would presumably have included the same middle-range missiles that NATO had approved with his urging. If the Russians had taken Mr. Schmidt's speech more seriously, a high American official said later, they could have sought to use it to unravel support for NATO's nuclear modernization program. But Mr. Schmidt soon backpedaled, and the proposal, in which the Chancellor seemed to be trying to make nuclear policy for Europe and NATO without a mandate, was not heard from again.
Mr. Schmidt was accused of seeming to take the Soviet Union's interests into consideration with a bit too much energy. His critics also thought the reference to 1914 was panicky and historically overdone. The United States and the Soviet Union in the spring of 1980 really did not seem out of control or blindly groping toward war. The critics also found another flaw in his policy this year: He resisted the economic sanctions against the Soviet Union urged by the United States, but he had agreed to go along with those called for against Iran. There was also a bit of mechanistic clangor in his constant recommendations on crisis management, including a speech in New York in March at the Foreign Policy Association. The United States, Mr. Schmidt said in substance, must be predictable and make all its intentions known in order to avoid world crisis. Wasn't this a kind of middle-sized, limited, very European view of things in that it ignored the deterrent weight for a super power in not being perfectly predictable?
In the end, his harshest critics said, it appeared that Mr. Schmidt was happy to continue having American nuclear protection, but mainly in order to gain time; his real goal, they charge, is to win enough independence from the United States so that West Germany and Europe would eventually be more or less exempt from the rivalries and tensions between the superpowers.
Again and again, Mr. Schmidt's closest advisers stress that this is not what the Chancellor wants; indeed, they say, he is heartsick about the lack of strong American leadership and feels he must do all he can to protect peace. He believes, one aide said, that the United States is the world's most vigorous society, with the most unlimited potential. When it comes to Mr. Schmidt's loyalty to the West, Alois Mertes, a leading Christian Democrat expert on defense and foreign policy, who continually questions Mr. Schmidt's assessment of the Soviet Union and occasionally his resolve to deal with them, says, ''I'd put my hand in the fire for the man.'' Rather than turning his back on the United States, said a former adviser to the Chancellor, Mr. Schmidt thinks he could use his friendship with Mr. Giscard so that after the French Presidential elections next spring, the French would be able to move toward some kind of reinforced association with NATO.
But logic does not really point to a sudden reassertion of an American leadership role in a sense that would suit Mr. Schmidt. A new four-year term for Mr. Carter would carry forward all the ill will and mistrust of the first term, as well as the Chancellor's inclination to save his version of detente by operating at cross purposes with American policy. An aide has suggested that the Chancellor is deeply concerned that if the United States does not control its inflation soon, it will be crippled by it, and increasingly unable to exert its influence. If the Democratic platform, with its emphasis on jobs rather than inflation, is taken seriously, then Mr. Schmidt would have an additional reason for trying to insulate Europe. The Soviet Union, which has sought to exploit the differences between West Germany and the United States, will probably attempt to make it increasingly attractive for Mr. Schmidt to think that he can guarantee West German security, markets and jobs by increased cooperation.
If Ronald Reagan is elected and there is an attempt to implement the Republican plank to return the United States to military superiority, then Mr. Schmidt would be placed in a situation of even deeper concern to him. His whole philosophy of maintaining peace is based on a balance of power between East and West. The Russians, he believes, could never again accept a feeling of military inferiority, and new American arms programs would trigger a Soviet response - an arms race that would crash down on detente, creating a new cold war.
It is in these circumstances that Mr. Schmidt might be pushed to a very hard decision involving his leadership. If detente appeared to be dying, then Mr. Schmidt, according to some of his aides, might attempt to form a broad front of resistance. He would not only try to enlist Western Europe, but the allies of the Soviet Union as well, notably Poland and Hungary, with whom he has established strong ties. None of these Soviet allies want to see a return to the cold war; none want an end to the trade relations developed over the last 10 years that have raised living standards in many places in the East. Such a broad front might be able to dissuade the superpowers from an arms race and to work within Europe to create new disarmament arrangements that would limit the possibility of a Soviet-American conflict - or let Western Europe, at least, steer clear of it.
It has long been assumed that Mr. Schmidt's real gifts, his pragmatism and his ability to judge reality, would counsel him against turning his back on his ultimate protector and trying to convert Western Europe into an independent third force, an arbiter between East and West, which could jump in and out of events where it saw advantage or reason for concern. It also appears that the force of events is likely to hold Mr. Schmidt on course. If he could outflank the implications of Afghanistan, a far-away and somewhat vague issue for Europeans, he has found it difficult to outrun Poland, a problem next door. The recent events in Poland make Mr.Schmidt's assumptions about continuing calm in central Europe much less certain. Any desire to steer a third course, one away from the Russians but also away from the Americans, requires this calm and stability. Without it, perhaps, some of the Helmut-lead-us urging seems a little hasty.
Now Edward Gierek is gone, a man Mr. Schmidt regarded highly, and the person he was counting on in Eastern Europe to anchor, to the extent that he could, what Mr. Schmidt's aides talk about as the effort to hold on to detente. The Polish situation also led to the cancellation of talks with Erich Honecker, the East German leader, and a new hard tone from East Berlin toward Bonn. Mr. Schmidt's hopes of bringing Mr. Honecker into his constellation are now sidetracked. After Poland, the time seems less fitting for leadership down new avenues. Rather, it may be a time when Mr. Schmidt's strengths may be best used in tightening the Western alliance, regardless of his obvious doubts about both Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan.
Whatever the appeals of striking out in a new direction for West Germany, Mr. Schmidt's intelligence and his ability to read reality point more now toward caution than adventure.
''I have always been doubtful about political leaders who promote visions,'' he has said. ''We have in this country seen at least two periods of, shall we say, 'visionism' in German leaders - Kaiser Wilhelm II and the second one much worse. ... I'm not a visionary and I'm skeptical of all the vi-sionaries. Germans have an enormous capability for idealism and the perversion of it.''
