Full text:   TOKYO -- Japan is opting for another round of shock treatment, in a stark admission that the country's economic revival plan is faltering.
After insisting for more than a year that its aggressive monetary action was sufficient, the Bank of Japan on Friday unexpectedly announced that it would buy larger quantities of government debt. By injecting more money into the economy, the central bank is trying keep borrowing costs low, encourage spending and, ultimately, stoke inflation and growth.
The bold move helped push stocks higher around the world. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.1 percent on Friday, and European equities ended the day up more than 2.5 percent.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225-stock index average hit fresh highs, jumping almost 5 percent for the day. The yen fell to its weakest level against the dollar in a month.
The central bank's stimulus has been the cornerstone of a nearly two-year effort by Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, to reinvigorate the economy and end the persistent consumer price declines that have weighed on growth since the 1990s. But that plan, collectively known as Abenomics, has shown signs of strain lately, as economic output contracted sharply in the second quarter.
With pressure mounting, the central bank said it wanted to act pre-emptively, rather than risk eroding the progress the country has made in changing the public's deflationary mind-set. The Bank of Japan said it would target asset purchases of 80 trillion yen a year, or $734 billion, up from a previous range of ¥60 trillion to ¥70 trillion.
The decision underscores Japan's divergent path with the United States. Citing the strength in the American economy, the Federal Reserve ended its six-year bond-buying campaign this week, an important milestone in the country's recovery.
The Bank of Japan is hardly alone in struggling to keep consumer prices rising at a rate considered desirable by central bankers -- typically about 2 percent, a level where increases are mild but still comfortably above deflation.
Prices have been falling in parts of crisis-stricken Europe. Even in the United States, where the economy is stronger and the Fed's bond-buying program had been criticized by some inflation hawks, the rate remains below the official 2 percent objective. In the last week, Sweden's central bank, considered one of the most inflation-phobic, cut its benchmark short-term interest rate to zero in an effort to ward off falling prices.
Japan's rate has been at zero for years, prompting it to explore such experimental measures as quantitative easing, in which the central bank buys huge quantities of government debt and other assets in an effort to hold down longer-term rates, lowering borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
Mr. Abe's handpicked central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, greatly expanded an existing bond-buying program at the central bank in April 2013. Mr. Kuroda has maintained that the new monetary settings would be enough to lift inflation to 2 percent by about mid-2015.
The strategy has provided a much-needed jolt to the economy, albeit one whose effects have been unevenly distributed. Cheap money and the depreciating effect it has had on the yen have encouraged investors to pile into shares of big manufacturing companies like Toyota and Hitachi. Those companies' profits have risen with the currency's fall because they do much of their business outside Japan in currencies like the dollar and the euro.
The markets are likely to get another lift next year, as the government's giant pension fund moves more aggressively into stocks. The Government Pension Investment Fund said on Friday that it would aim to hold 50 percent of its assets in stocks, up from 24 percent now.
The announcement by the central bank amounted to an acknowledgment that the economy needed even more help.
Consumer spending has slipped since the sales tax increase of three percentage points in April. Falling oil prices, too, have had an inflation-dampening effect. While prices have been rising, the Bank of Japan's favored measure of consumer inflation, which excludes the price of fresh food, has been stuck at just over 1 percent for months. The bank also said that its stimulus measures had had a smaller-than-expected effect on growth, cutting in half its estimate for expansion in gross domestic product in the fiscal year ending in April, to 0.5 percent.
Uncomfortably for policy makers, the recent bout of mild inflation has also been uneven. Exacerbated by the sales tax increase, prices have been going up faster than incomes, in effect making many people poorer. Adjusted for inflation, average incomes for working households were down 6 percent in September, according to government data released on Friday.
"If you're a small business, or if you're working a part-time job, you feel that nothing has come your way," Kathy M. Matsui, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said, though she added that she supported Mr. Abe's fight against deflation, as well as other goals like deregulation and corporate governance reform.
Beating deflation has long been a goal in Japan, one that has eluded successive prime ministers and central bank chiefs. Mr. Kuroda's efforts have been the most successful so far, yet not everyone is comfortable with his headlong approach to creating money.
As in the United States and elsewhere, critics in Japan have warned that quantitative easing encourages the government to pile up debt and could one day lead to runaway inflation. And in a country that still feels the effects of a disastrous land and stock bubble that burst more than 20 years ago, fears of undue asset-price surges remain.
The central bank's decision to ramp up its bond purchases was contentious. Four out of nine of the policy board members voted against it -- a far closer margin than for any other decision by the central bank since Mr. Kuroda took over.
But Mr. Kuroda, at a news conference, said that the central bank had an "unwavering commitment to escaping deflation." In addition to increasing the scale of its bond market intervention, the central bank backed away from its previously specific timetable. It said simply that it would keep its easing measures in place "as long as it is necessary to maintain that target" of 2 percent inflation "in a stable manner."
"We will do whatever it takes to achieve our price target," Mr. Kuroda said.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED"Be very, very careful what you put into that head, because you will never, ever get it out."
-- Cardinal Thomas Wolsey
on King Henry VIII
So it is with inflation. A generation of economists and central bankers who lived through the 1970s learned that there is a large risk from runaway inflation and that steps must be taken to stop it before it gets out of control.
In reality, the threat these days comes from inflation that is too low, or even from deflation. Many of the world's economic problems would be reduced if we could get more inflation than we have now.
Unfortunately, some central banks concluded after the first bit of revival from the Great Recession that it was time to tighten credit, lest superlow interest rates bring a burst of inflation pressure. They saw a need to confront the possibility of soaring prices before it was too late.
The Swedish central bank, which began to raise interest rates in 2010, in part because of worries about a housing price bubble, completed its reversal of policy on Tuesday, cutting its target interest rate to zero after raising it as high as 2 percent in 2011. But Lars E. O. Svensson, a noted economist who resigned from the Swedish central bank board last year, warned that more steps might be needed, including negative interest rates.
The Swedish blunder was not as great as the one committed by the European Central Bank when it raised rates in 2008 -- a worse time to do that is hard to imagine -- and then again in 2011. Mario Draghi, who became E.C.B. president in late 2011, has done yeoman work to offset the damage of that policy, but consumer price indexes in several eurozone countries are indicating deflation has arrived.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee sort of ended its program of buying long-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, known as Q.E. for quantitative easing. But it will not unwind those purchases, at least for the time being. As the securities it owns mature, the Fed will roll over the proceeds into new securities.
Now, with quantitative easing ending, what has the Fed accomplished?
It has helped the economy, although not nearly to the extent that might have been hoped. Inflation, far from accelerating as some conservative economists forecast, has been running consistently below the Fed's 2 percent target. The Fed's preferred measure, the index of personal consumption expenditures, is up 1.5 percent over the last 12 months, both overall and excluding volatile food and energy prices. It has been more than two years since either measure was up as much as 2 percent. Imagine the criticism hurled at the Fed if inflation had been running above its target for that long.
What we have not heard from the Fed is any clarification of what it will do if inflation does not pick up, let alone if it falls close to or below zero.
"The real question," said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, "is how the F.O.M.C. will express its commitment to getting inflation back to 2 percent." Until he left the Fed this summer, he was a special adviser to the last two Fed leaders, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen.
Mr. Faust was speaking before the Fed's statement on Wednesday. The answer was that the Fed did not have many words about the question, let alone the "words with teeth" that Mr. Faust believes are likely to become appropriate.
The only dissent at Wednesday's meeting came from Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who in a speech this month said, "In my view, inflation below 2 percent is just as much of a problem as inflation above 2 percent." He wanted a commitment to push inflation up to 2 percent.
"The likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year" was all the Fed statement had to say about the issue.
There is nothing magic about 2 percent, and some economists think that a 3 or 4 percent target might make more sense. But you don't have to favor a higher target to realize the current inflation rate is not helping the economy.
At the moment, the threat of deflation is clearly greater in Europe than it is in the United States, and presumably some of the factors forcing prices down, including falling agricultural commodity and energy prices and a strengthening dollar, will diminish as time goes on. But if those weakening commodity prices signal a coming decline in economic activity around the world, the picture could worsen.
What is needed is for Fed officials, and other economists, to make clear some of the damage that low inflation can inflict on an economy. They make adjustments harder for countries that need to become more competitive. Cutting nominal wages is difficult and can be devastating for workers facing fixed costs, like mortgage expenses. But if there is inflation, real wages can decline as nominal wages remain level.
It has become common for some economists to denounce the effect of low interest rates on fixed-income investors, but that is not the complete story. Certainly those with money to invest now face an unappealing set of choices. But those who bought long-term securities years ago -- when inflation was expected to be considerably higher than it now is -- are receiving more value than they expected.
The much discussed ratio of national debt to gross domestic product also suffers. Consider the 18 nations in the eurozone. Collectively, their national debts rose by 7.8 percent in 2012 and 2013, forcing up the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio by 5.2 percentage points. From 2004 to 2006, their debts rose nearly as rapidly, by 7.4 percent. But the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio actually fell by a percentage point. At the time, European economies were growing and inflation was also pushing up the nominal gross domestic product figures. Now there is little if any growth or inflation, and the result is to worsen the debt picture.
The markets inferred from the Fed's statement that credit tightening through higher interest rates would more likely arrive sooner than expected, and the dollar rose. If the economic growth and job figures continue to look good, and if inflation manages to rise at least a little, that forecast could be a good one.
But what will happen if inflation -- and inflation expectations -- do decline? So far, as can be seen in the Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted quarterly by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the 10-year inflation forecast has remained stable at 2 percent. If it began to fall, that would catch the attention of Fed officials.
But the bond market is not so confident. The market inflation forecast can be estimated by calculating the inflation rate at which a purchase of a normal Treasury security would be no better or worse than the purchase of an inflation-protected Treasury security of the same maturity. At the end of last year, the 10-year inflation forecast was 2.2 percent; now it is 1.9 percent. The one-year forecast then was 1.5 percent; now it is a forecast of deflation, negative 0.75 percent.
What could the Fed do if it turns out deflation is a real threat? In theory, it could resume quantitative easing. It could also jawbone Congress to provide more fiscal stimulus. If the Republicans win control of the Senate in next week's elections, the first alternative might bring angry denunciations from both sides of Capitol Hill. The second might simply be ignored.
As long as deflation is a possibility, the Fed would be well advised to explain, again and again, why inflation that is too low is also bad for the economy. The lesson that high inflation is a threat is well known to politicians and voters. There is a need, as Cardinal Wolsey might have said, to get something else into their heads.
Correction: November 1, 2014, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The High & Low Finance column on Friday, about the risks of deflation, misstated the market forecast for the 10-year inflation rate. It is 1.9 percent, not 1.7 percent.

Full text:   Unlike the seventh game of the World Series, the debate over the economy's strength sometimes seems like a playoff competition that goes on forever between skeptics and believers. But on Thursday, the boosters won at least a temporary victory with a government report that estimated the nation's economic output rose at a healthy 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter.
After an even faster pace of growth in the spring, the higher-than-expected advance in gross domestic product -- a measure of all the goods and services produced in the United States -- was driven by gains across the board, bolstered by an unusual burst of military spending and a more favorable trade balance.
"This is the strongest six-month interval we've had in 10 years," said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company. "The pace of the expansion has clearly increased."
While the G.D.P. report is mostly a look to the past, markets were generally cheered by the latest economic news, which also included an upswing in consumer confidence and further evidence from weekly unemployment claims that the labor market is on the mend. Bond prices barely moved as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.6 percent to 1,994.65 and the Dow Jones industrial average increased more than 221 points to close at 17,195.42.
The economy's performance during July, August and September followed the second quarter's 4.6 percent annualized growth rate. This sustained expansion was welcomed after a bitter winter that contributed to a 2.1 percent decrease for the first three months of the year.
"This is a pretty solid set of numbers," said John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial. "We're doing O.K. here."
Many forecasters expect the economy to continue to advance at a roughly similar pace, which should help the unemployment rate to keep falling.
"I don't think it's going to be hard to maintain a growth of 3 percent for the fourth quarter," Mr. Tannenbaum said.
Any conclusions about the economy's path, of course, are preliminary. Government statisticians will revise Thursday's figure twice, first in November and then in December. Based on experience, the final measure of growth could end up changing as much as a percentage point in either direction, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.
In the meantime, skeptics pointed to some troubling signs. Consumer spending, though up 1.8 percent, was weaker than some economists had hoped given the recent job growth. They had expected lower- and middle-income families to spend money they saved from falling gas prices and wealthier households to spread around their profits from the stock market.
"The components may not be as strong as the headline number shows," said Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds. The housing sector registered only a 1.8 percent gain, down from an 8.8 percent increase last quarter. And military spending, which jumped a whopping 16 percent, is notoriously volatile.
Still, for nearly two years, government austerity has been a drag on the economy, and the 10 percent growth in federal spending this quarter reversed that trend, at least for now.
A greater worry for many economists is how Europe's anemic growth affects the American economy. They fear that European policy makers and the European Central Bank are not doing enough to stimulate their sluggish economies. The E.C.B.'s announcement on Monday that it was buying 1.7 billion euros' worth of private assets was dismissed by some economists as too modest an effort given the region's economic problems.
Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS, predicted real growth for all of 2014 to be only 2.2 percent -- below the United States' long-term average growth rate of 3 percent.
And in a speech in Boston this month, Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve Board chairwoman, expressed concern about a decline in the number of new businesses, which are traditionally a vehicle for enterprising Americans to get ahead.
Lurking beneath all the statistics is the concern that the promising numbers are masking profound inequalities and stagnant incomes for most Americans, as Ms. Yellen indicated in her Boston speech.
"It is no secret that the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority," she said. "I think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation's history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity."
All in all, though, those who are upbeat about the economy could add several points to their scorecard this week. The Labor Department said on Thursday that new claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low. The four-week moving average was 281,000, a 14-year low and down from 352,500 a year ago.
And a report from the Conference Board showed that the consumer confidence index reached a seven-year high in October. That positive outlook combined with continued low gas prices could help push up consumer spending during the holiday season.
Steven Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research, saw encouraging signs that the economy was evolving toward more domestic production, even if next quarter's growth rate falls below 3 percent.
Investment in equipment, although down from its 11.2 percent growth in the second quarter, still posted a 7.2 percent increase. And Mr. Blitz was pleased by the 7.8 percent jump in net exports and the 5.5 percent rise in nonresidential fixed investments.
"That's a more realistic building block for the economy," he said, "than to have overleveraged consumers buying homes."

Abstract: [...]in some ways they look more relevant than ever now that much of the West has fallen into a prolonged slump very similar to Japan's experience.

Full text:   TOKYO -- For almost two decades, Japan has been held up as a cautionary tale, an object lesson on how not to run an advanced economy. After all, the island nation is the rising superpower that stumbled. One day, it seemed, it was on the road to high-tech domination of the world economy; the next it was suffering from seemingly endless stagnation and deflation. And Western economists were scathing in their criticisms of Japanese policy.
I was one of those critics; Ben Bernanke, who went on to become chairman of the Federal Reserve, was another. And these days, I often find myself thinking that we ought to apologize.
Now, I'm not saying that our economic analysis was wrong. The paper I published in 1998 about Japan's "liquidity trap," or the paper Mr. Bernanke published in 2000 urging Japanese policy makers to show "Rooseveltian resolve" in confronting their problems, have aged fairly well. In fact, in some ways they look more relevant than ever now that much of the West has fallen into a prolonged slump very similar to Japan's experience.
The point, however, is that the West has, in fact, fallen into a slump similar to Japan's -- but worse. And that wasn't supposed to happen. In the 1990s, we assumed that if the United States or Western Europe found themselves facing anything like Japan's problems, we would respond much more effectively than the Japanese had. But we didn't, even though we had Japan's experience to guide us. On the contrary, Western policies since 2008 have been so inadequate if not actively counterproductive that Japan's failings seem minor in comparison. And Western workers have experienced a level of suffering that Japan has managed to avoid.
What policy failures am I talking about? Start with government spending. Everyone knows that in the early 1990s Japan tried to boost its economy with a surge in public investment; it's less well-known that public investment fell rapidly after 1996 even as the government raised taxes, undermining progress toward recovery. This was a big mistake, but it pales by comparison with Europe's hugely destructive austerity policies, or the collapse in infrastructure spending in the United States after 2010. Japanese fiscal policy didn't do enough to help growth; Western fiscal policy actively destroyed growth.
Or consider monetary policy. The Bank of Japan, Japan's equivalent of the Federal Reserve, has received a lot of criticism for reacting too slowly to the slide into deflation, and then for being too eager to raise interest rates at the first hint of recovery. That criticism is fair, but Japan's central bank never did anything as wrongheaded as the European Central Bank's decision to raise rates in 2011, helping to send Europe back into recession. And even that mistake is trivial compared with the awesomely wrongheaded behavior of the Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, which raised rates despite below-target inflation and relatively high unemployment, and appears, at this point, to have pushed Sweden into outright deflation.
The Swedish case is especially striking because the Riksbank chose to ignore one of its own deputy governors: Lars Svensson, a world-class monetary economist who had worked extensively on Japan, and who had warned his colleagues that premature rate increases would have exactly the effects they did, in fact, have.
So there are really two questions here. First, why has everyone seemed to get this so wrong? Second, why has the West, with all its famous economists -- not to mention the ability to learn from Japan's woe -- made an even worse mess than Japan did?
The answer to the first question, I think, is that responding effectively to depression conditions requires abandoning conventional respectability. Policies that would ordinarily be prudent and virtuous, like balancing the budget or taking a firm stand against inflation, become recipes for a deeper slump. And it's very hard to persuade influential people to make that adjustment -- just look at the Washington establishment's inability to give up on its deficit obsession.
As for why the West has done even worse than Japan, I suspect that it's about the deep divisions within our societies. In America, conservatives have blocked efforts to fight unemployment out of a general hostility to government, especially a government that does anything to help Those People. In Europe, Germany has insisted on hard money and austerity largely because the German public is intensely hostile to anything that could be called a bailout of southern Europe.
I'll be writing more soon about what's happening in Japan now, and the new lessons the West should be learning. For now, here's what you should know: Japan used to be a cautionary tale, but the rest of us have messed up so badly that it almost looks like a role model instead.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- In a series of sweeping campaigns to revive the American economy, the Federal Reserve has spent much of the last six years purchasing trillions of dollars of bonds. Now it is done.
The Fed said on Wednesday that the economy no longer needed quite so much help. It is the third time since 2008 the Fed has announced such a move, but this time officials and analysts say the decision is more likely to stick, signaling an important milestone in the nation's painfully slow recovery from the Great Recession.
The central bank still plans to keep short-term interest rates near zero for a "considerable time," it said in a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. And it said it would replace maturing bonds to keep its holdings at about $4.5 trillion.
The bond-buying campaign has helped to fuel one of the longest bull markets in American history. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen 131 percent since the Fed started its first round of purchases in November 2008. The campaign has also helped to suppress borrowing costs. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury has declined from 2.96 percent to 2.32 percent over the same period, even as economic conditions have improved.
The impact on the rest of the economy is much harder to assess. The Fed and its supporters say the purchases have held down the cost of mortgage loans and corporate debt, contributing to faster job growth. Other economists dismiss the purchases as inconsequential. And some say the Fed has exacerbated economic inequalities by helping to lift financial markets while the rest of the economy languishes.
The Fed critics' dire predictions, however, have clearly failed to materialize. Some Fed officials and economists warned that the bond purchases, often referred to by experts as quantitative easing, or Q.E., would devalue the dollar and drive up inflation. So far the opposite has happened.
The American economy has outperformed other developed parts of the world, helping to strengthen the dollar, while inflation has remained so sluggish that the greater worry is now whether prices are rising too slowly.
Kim Schoenholtz, an economics professor at New York University, said the Fed's bond purchases were particularly effective and important in stabilizing the financial system and stimulating the broader economy in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. But he said that the impact of the purchases had diminished as conditions improved, and that it now made sense to end the program.
"I applaud the Fed's willingness to be aggressive, especially early on in the crisis, and it has made sense for the Fed to run a very accommodative policy," Mr. Schoenholtz said. "But we should not be surprised that monetary policy has diminishing returns."
Mr. Schoenholtz added that the Fed's quick and strong response helped to explain why the Fed was nearer to achieving its economic objectives than the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, both of which are now battling to avoid deflation.
On Monday, the E.C.B. disclosed the first purchases in a planned campaign to buy private sector assets, a kind of entry-level quantitative easing. But the amount the central bank bought -- 1.7 billion euros, or $2.16 billion, worth -- was considered a drop in the bucket by analysts and fueled speculation that the E.C.B. would soon be forced to take larger steps.
Many House Republicans regard the bond purchases as a form of reckless meddling, and they have passed legislation to constrain the Fed's flexibility during future downturns. "I'm afraid the long-term legacy of the policy will reflect the harm it has done to our nation's seniors, savers and all Americans faced with greater uncertainty and the possibility of a Q.E.-induced bubble," Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican, said on Wednesday.
Nonetheless, some experts say the economy remains weak, the purchases remain an effective medicine and the Fed is retreating prematurely. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, cast the sole dissenting vote on Wednesday, arguing that inflation was rising too slowly to stop buying bonds.
The Fed started buying bonds for the first time in modern times because it had run out of other options. Under Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed's chairman, the central bank cut its benchmark short-term interest rate to zero in December 2008, maxing out its primary means of influencing economic conditions.
Mr. Bernanke had argued years earlier that central banks could further reduce borrowing costs by purchasing long-term bonds. The idea was that reducing the supply would force investors to accept lower interest rates from borrowers.
Under Mr. Bernanke and then under his successor, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed proceeded to expand its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to $4.5 trillion, from less than $1 trillion.
Looking back on the results earlier this year, Mr. Bernanke, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, quipped, "Well, the problem with Q.E. is it works in practice, but it doesn't work in theory."
Michael Woodford, an economist at Columbia University and a leading monetary policy theorist, is among the doubters. "There seems little reason to believe that purchases of long-term Treasuries should be an effective way of lowering the kind of longer-term interest rates that matter most for stimulating economic activity," he said in 2012 at the Fed's annual economic policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. This was less a research finding than a statement of principles. Mr. Woodford is the creator of a widely used macroeconomic model that basically assumed the purchases would have no effect.
The consequences of ending the campaign are also in dispute.
Federal Reserve officials generally argue that the impact comes mostly from the size of the Fed's holdings. In this view, the end of purchases is a minor event. Much more important is the Fed's intention to maintain the portfolio at its current size until after it starts to raise rates.
Others, however, see the flow of purchases as more important.
A third view saw the purchases primarily as a means of reassuring markets that short-term rates would stay low.
So far, events have tended to support the Fed's view. The tapering of bond purchases has not shaken the conviction of investors that the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates before the middle of next year.
Barbara J. Cummings, director of fixed income at Boston Private Wealth Management, said the low rates highlighted the relative impotence of Fed policy. "I really believe that rates will continue to stay low because I think that there are other factors that are larger than what the Fed was doing," she said, citing concerns about Europe that are driving flows of money into Treasuries.
The Fed has not ruled out a resumption of bond purchases. But the progress of the economic recovery makes that seem increasingly unlikely. Through September, employers this year have added an average of 227,000 jobs a month, and the unemployment rate has fallen faster than expected, to 5.9 percent.
The Fed upgraded its appraisal of labor market conditions in its statement on Wednesday, saying that "underutilization of labor market resources is gradually diminishing." The Fed also sought to play down concerns about the slow pace of inflation, saying that the likelihood of persistently low inflation has actually diminished since earlier this year.
When the Fed first hinted that this day was coming in the summer of 2013, investors panicked and markets convulsed. But it avoided a repeat by loudly announcing a schedule for the retreat and then adhering to it with absolute fidelity. Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust, said he hoped the Fed would emulate the clarity of its retreat from bond-buying as it moved toward raising interest rates.
"I do think this has been a success story," he said. "I'm hoping that when the time comes to raise interest rates, that they'll do an equally clear job of foreshadowing that."
But a voice from the past, the former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, warned on Wednesday that the next phase of the Fed's retreat would not unfold so smoothly. Asked whether the Fed could avoid turmoil, he responded, "I don't think it's possible."

Full text:   TEHRAN -- Mohammad Heydarian, an Iranian contractor, still has work finishing off a single-family home. But things look bleak after that, he said. He has already fired his workers, and he is struggling to make ends meet, providing for his wife and two teenage children.
"My life became a fight trying to prevent regression, but I lost," said Mr. Heydarian, 46.
For more than a year, President Hassan Rouhani has been dangling the prospect of a bright economic future before the middle classes that elected him, promising to negotiate a deal with the West to limit Iran's nuclear program and in that way end the sanctions hobbling the Iranian economy.
With the deadline of Nov. 24 fast approaching, it is far from clear whether the two camps will agree on a pact that would meet the West's demands to extend the time it would take Iran to make a bomb, and fulfill Iran's demand that it have the nuclear rights other nations enjoy. But American and European officials say they think they have some new leverage: falling oil prices that are adding to Iran's pain at a time when its oil revenue has dropped by more than half because of sanctions.
With oil prices projected to fall even further, the oil-dependent government of Iran faces growing pressure to settle the nuclear standoff.
"This is a new wild card, and we don't know how it will play out," one of the senior Western negotiators said the other day, as officials mapped out a strategy that they hope can achieve a deal in less than a month's time.
Obama administration officials and the chief American negotiator, Wendy R. Sherman, were briefing lawmakers and allies last week on what has been agreed to and what issues remain in dispute, hoping to build support before an announcement.
The Iranians may be preparing the way as well. The Iranian news media reported in recent days that the United States had agreed to allow Iran to operate about 4,000 of its most basic centrifuges. American officials have not confirmed the figure, but they have said that if they permit a higher number of centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium, then Iran would have to blend down or change the form of its current stocks of nuclear fuel.
That would lengthen the time it would take to produce a weapon's worth of fuel, and after that it would take more time, months or years, to turn the fuel into a bomb. That would be a huge concession for Iran, which currently has 19,000 centrifuges, about 10,000 of which actually operate.
Iranian officials would never admit that sanctions or low oil prices have any effect on their bargaining position. But for a country that by some estimates needs an oil price of more than $140 a barrel to balance its budget, the roughly 25 percent drop in oil prices to around $80 a barrel since last summer has to be deeply concerning.
The precipitous decline could force the government to cut back popular benefits, like subsidies for gasoline and utilities and the $12 monthly cash benefit that many Iranians have come to consider a birthright. And it could have even broader effects, possibly sending the economy into recession.
"Oil prices are bound to go down even further, and already the government faces big financial shortcomings," said Jamshid Edalatian, an economist and member of the chamber of commerce in Tehran, which is close to the government. "We need this nuclear deal, or we will face very hard times."
Mr. Rouhani and his chief negotiator, the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, seem acutely attuned to the damage done by sanctions. In an interview in Vienna in July, and again in appearances in New York last month, Mr. Zarif talked about the cost to Iran -- while insisting that the country's reaction to pressure had been to build more centrifuges and a larger nuclear infrastructure.
"What has this accomplished for you?" he asked his largely American audiences.
But it is far from clear that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, shares that view. Traditionally, he has been less focused on Iran's economic future than on its status as a regional and world player. If Mr. Zarif goes home with a deal, American officials say, there is no guarantee that Ayatollah Khamenei will make a cost-benefit analysis about whether to approve it.
"The decision is the supreme leader's to make, and we still don't understand much about his calculus," one senior American official said, declining to speak on the record about the talks.
But the government has quietly begun to take measures to ease the losses in oil income, which are only now beginning to be felt since Iran typically sells its oil in three-month contracts.
To cover an expected shortfall of nearly $2.25 billion in the coming three months, Mr. Rouhani announced this week that his government would dip into strategic financial reserves -- which he said last year that the country did not have -- to pay for continuing civil engineering projects.
The hope all along for the West was that financial pressures would soften Tehran's negotiating stance, and they still might, particularly if the drop in oil prices proves to be more than transitory. However, most analysts here remain adamant that any such hopes are misplaced.
"They will remain focused on getting a deal, but not any deal," said Ali Khorram, a former Iranian ambassador to China who is close to the negotiating team.
He said that Iran had been taking lessons from Iraq and Libya: Iraq got stuck in the quagmire of sanctions by making halfhearted compromises; Libya, under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, ended its entire nuclear program in 2003, but the West's role in overthrowing Colonel Qaddafi made a deep impression on Tehran about the risks of giving up a potential nuclear capability.
"It is clear for us, we either want a comprehensive deal or no deal at all," Mr. Khorram said, referring to the Iranian demand to retain an enrichment program while forging a step-by-step plan to cancel all sanctions.
"I'm sure there is a Plan B if things go differently," he added.
If there is such a plan, it is a well-kept secret.
In Plan A, Mr. Rouhani's vision, a nuclear deal would lead to the lifting of all sanctions, and the Iranian economy would become a tempting prospect for foreign investors.
The pro-government news media churn out items about foreign companies' showing interest in Iran, one of the last untouched markets in the world. This week, they reported that General Motors was interested in cooperating with Iran Khodro, Iran's largest car manufacturer. Billboards advertise iPhones (sanctions on computers and cellphones were lifted in 2013). On Thursday, Boeing reported selling its first products to Iran in 35 years -- $120,000 worth of maps and information.
"We are already victorious in the nuclear talks," Mr. Rouhani said, smiling, on state television last week, "and will be triumphant with God's grace tomorrow, too, not only in this arena, but in many others."
Mr. Rouhani's insistence that a deal is inevitable is contagious, many Iranians say. "Our leaders repeat this over and over again on television," Mr. Heydarian said.
At Bahram's Barber Shop, near Tehran's busy Keshavarz Boulevard, all five seats were empty early Wednesday morning, so Isa, 35, had decided to polish a traditional teakettle. The television was switched to the news channel, but the barber was singing an Iranian song about hearts filled with love.
Isa, who was uncomfortable giving his family name for fear of reprisals, said he had voted for Mr. Rouhani because he was the only one who was not a hard-liner. "I believe in his promises," Isa said, "mainly because the reality is something I prefer not to think about."
The government misses no opportunity to point out its successes, like bringing inflation down to around 25 percent from more than 40 percent and halting the decline in the national currency, the rial.
The continuous injections of hope have led some Iranians to worry about a backlash of disappointment should the nuclear negotiations collapse.
"We could very well see some civil protests in some cities," said Hamid Reza Jalaeipour, a sociologist and former reformist politician. "But Iranians are like sheets of copper: They can be folded and bended, but they never fall apart. We can adapt to bad times."
In the state-dominated news media, it is the good news that gets most of the attention. A government spokesman recently announced that the economy had grown at a rate of 9.5 percent in the third quarter. But many Iranians dismiss such figures.
"I don't know much about the economy," said Mahin Ranjbaran, 37, who sometimes washes dishes in a restaurant. "But my husband and two children and I have to live in with my parents, and we still cannot afford to pay the bills. That is how I measure improvement or decline."

Abstract: The federal government could easily have provided aid to the states to help them spend -- in fact, the stimulus bill included such aid, which was one main reason public investment briefly increased.

Full text:   America used to be a country that built for the future. Sometimes the government built directly: Public projects, from the Erie Canal to the Interstate Highway System, provided the backbone for economic growth. Sometimes it provided incentives to the private sector, like land grants to spur railroad construction. Either way, there was broad support for spending that would make us richer.
But nowadays we simply won't invest, even when the need is obvious and the timing couldn't be better. And don't tell me that the problem is "political dysfunction" or some other weasel phrase that diffuses the blame. Our inability to invest doesn't reflect something wrong with "Washington"; it reflects the destructive ideology that has taken over the Republican Party.
Some background: More than seven years have passed since the housing bubble burst, and ever since, America has been awash in savings -- or more accurately, desired savings -- with nowhere to go. Borrowing to buy homes has recovered a bit, but remains low. Corporations are earning huge profits, but are reluctant to invest in the face of weak consumer demand, so they're accumulating cash or buying back their own stock. Banks are holding almost $2.7 trillion in excess reserves -- funds they could lend out, but choose instead to leave idle.
And the mismatch between desired saving and the willingness to invest has kept the economy depressed. Remember, your spending is my income and my spending is your income, so if everyone tries to spend less at the same time, everyone's income falls.
There's an obvious policy response to this situation: public investment. We have huge infrastructure needs, especially in water and transportation, and the federal government can borrow incredibly cheaply -- in fact, interest rates on inflation-protected bonds have been negative much of the time (they're currently just 0.4 percent). So borrowing to build roads, repair sewers and more seems like a no-brainer. But what has actually happened is the reverse. After briefly rising after the Obama stimulus went into effect, public construction spending has plunged. Why?
In a direct sense, much of the fall in public investment reflects the fiscal troubles of state and local governments, which account for the great bulk of public investment.
These governments generally must, by law, balance their budgets, but they saw revenues plunge and some expenses rise in a depressed economy. So they delayed or canceled a lot of construction to save cash.
Yet this didn't have to happen. The federal government could easily have provided aid to the states to help them spend -- in fact, the stimulus bill included such aid, which was one main reason public investment briefly increased. But once the G.O.P. took control of the House, any chance of more money for infrastructure vanished. Once in a while Republicans would talk about wanting to spend more, but they blocked every Obama administration initiative.
And it's all about ideology, an overwhelming hostility to government spending of any kind. This hostility began as an attack on social programs, especially those that aid the poor, but over time it has broadened into opposition to any kind of spending, no matter how necessary and no matter what the state of the economy.
You can get a sense of this ideology at work in some of the documents produced by House Republicans under the leadership of Paul Ryan, the chairman of the Budget Committee. For example, a 2011 manifesto titled "Spend Less, Owe Less, Grow the Economy" called for sharp spending cuts even in the face of high unemployment, and dismissed as "Keynesian" the notion that "decreasing government outlays for infrastructure lessens government investment." (I thought that was just arithmetic, but what do I know?) Or take a Wall Street Journal editorial from the same year titled "The Great Misallocators," asserting that any money the government spends diverts resources away from the private sector, which would always make better use of those resources.
Never mind that the economic models underlying such assertions have failed dramatically in practice, that the people who say such things have been predicting runaway inflation and soaring interest rates year after year and keep being wrong; these aren't the kind of people who reconsider their views in the light of evidence. Never mind the obvious point that the private sector doesn't and won't supply most kinds of infrastructure, from local roads to sewer systems; such distinctions have been lost amid the chants of private sector good, government bad.
And the result, as I said, is that America has turned its back on its own history. We need public investment; at a time of very low interest rates, we could easily afford it. But build we won't.

Abstract: In November 2010, a large group of conservative economists and investors, including Michael J. Boskin, who was chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers under George H. W. Bush, warned in a letter to the Fed that "the planned asset purchases risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed's objective of promoting employment."

Full text:   DEFLATION has become a reality in many European countries, at least in terms of the prices of goods, as opposed to services.
In the United States, prices for goods are still rising, but at a slow rate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this week that prices of goods were 0.4 percent higher in September than they were a year earlier, but that increase was largely due to a surprising increase in food prices -- something that seems unlikely to continue in the face of declines in prices for many agricultural commodities.
Over all, the Consumer Price Index in the United States rose 1.7 percent over the last 12 months. That is hardly a high number, and is below the 2 percent target rate used by the Federal Reserve. But as the accompanying charts show, the rate is higher than that of any of the 15 largest countries in the European Union.
Of those 15 European countries, prices of goods in 11 were lower in September than a year earlier. Only Germany, Britain, Austria and Finland experienced goods price inflation, and none of those rates were higher than half a percentage point.
The reasons for declining prices include weak economies -- some European economies appear to have fallen into new recessions -- and declining import prices brought on in part by weak demand. Over all, the United States reported that import prices for goods were nearly 1 percent lower in September than they had been a year earlier. Imports from China, the largest exporter into the American market, were just a tenth of 1 percent higher.
Deflation is less likely in prices for services, in part because it is difficult to reduce nominal wages and in part because overseas competition may be less of a factor. Those prices rose at a rate of 2.5 percent over the last year in the United States and they have shown smaller gains in most European countries, although there were declines in Spain and Greece. Inflation in service prices has offset deflation in the prices of goods, keeping overall inflation above zero in most of the European countries.
The charts also show rates of growth in gross domestic product since the third quarter of 2010, just before the United States Federal Reserve embarked on its program of asset purchases that became known as QE2, for quantitative easing.
In November 2010, a large group of conservative economists and investors, including Michael J. Boskin, who was chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers under George H. W. Bush, warned in a letter to the Fed that "the planned asset purchases risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed's objective of promoting employment."
Since then, inflation has been greater in the United States, and economic growth higher, than in much of Europe, but there has been no currency debasement -- the strong dollar has helped to hold down import prices -- and the unemployment rate has fallen by more than 3 percentage points.
Over all, the only one of the 15 European countries where G.D.P. grew more than in the United States was Poland. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank resolutely refused to follow the Fed's lead until after Jean-Claude Trichet retired as president in 2011, and growth has been weak. It appears that the Fed's quantitative easing did stimulate growth to at least some extent but did not increase inflation.
Of the 15 European countries, shown in the charts, only four -- Britain, Denmark and Sweden, as well as Poland -- remained out of the eurozone and thus in control of their own monetary policy. Three of those countries -- Denmark being the exception -- have grown more rapidly than any of the major countries in the eurozone. Five of the eurozone countries -- Finland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain -- now have smaller economies than they did in 2010.
Chart In Much of Europe, Goods Prices Are Falling: Physical Things -- As Opposed to Services -- Are Getting Cheaper in Most European Countries, and Are Rising at a Slow Rate in the United States. Overall Inflation Remains Positive in Many Countries, Because Service Prices Are Rising, but in None of the Countries Shown Is Inflation As High As 2 Percent. The Charts Show Inflation Rates in the 12 Months Through September for the United States, the Eurozone and the 15 Largest Countries in the European Union, As Well As the Average Annual Change in Gross Domestic Product Since the Third Quarter of 2010, When the Federal Reserve Board in the United States Began Its Program of Securities Purchases That Became Known As Qe2.

Full text:   Sunday's presidential election in Brazil may be too close to call, but investors have already voted with their reais and dollars -- and it's Aécio Neves in a landslide.
Rarely, if ever, has such a pro-growth, market-friendly candidate emerged as a serious presidential contender in a developing country, let alone one as large and influential as Brazil, which has the world's seventh-largest economy as measured by gross domestic product. With every twist in the polls, the Brazilian stock market surges (if Mr. Neves is ahead) or plunges (if not) while largely ignoring fundamentals like commodity prices, the faltering Brazilian economy or global crises.
Perhaps nothing has more endeared Mr. Neves to investors than his announcement on Oct. 5, right after qualifying for this weekend's presidential runoff, that he would name Arminio Fraga his finance minister. Mr. Fraga is an unabashed champion of market capitalism and pro-growth government policies. He has a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton and drew international praise as the head of Brazil's central bank from 1999 to 2002, steering the Brazilian economy through a difficult period that coincided with the implosion of the dot-com bubble and a recession in the United States. He was a managing director at George Soros's fund in New York, and after leaving Brazil's central bank, he helped start the hedge fund Gávea Investimentos. A unit of JPMorgan Chase acquired a controlling stake in 2010.
Putting a wealthy hedge fund manager like Mr. Fraga on the ticket might be risky even in an avowedly capitalist country like the United States, and in populist Brazil, "Arminio hasn't exactly been an electoral asset," said Mario Marconini of Teneo Intelligence and a former foreign trade secretary in Brazil. "All the people in my office in São Paulo love him. But the minute Neves named him, his momentum started to go down." Dilma Rousseff, the current president, who is running for re-election, has made Mr. Fraga a focus of her recent televised attacks on Mr. Neves.
Neither Mr. Neves nor Mr. Fraga is backing down. "By any standard, we represent a pro-market, pro-growth approach," Mr. Fraga told me when I spoke with him this week between campaign stops. That this would be resonating with voters in populist Latin America, a region better known for flamboyant leftists like Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Fidel Castro in Cuba, seems remarkable. But Mr. Fraga said the close race was less a verdict on economic ideology than a strong desire for change. "Most people aren't motivated by a deep knowledge of economics and what drives growth and productivity," he said. "But they know that Brazil needs to change to get back on the growth path or it can't sustain its employment levels and social benefits. And some people are just fed up with all the scandals."
No wonder investors are applauding Mr. Neves. As governor of Brazil's second-most-populous state from 2003 to 2010, Mr. Neves cut his own pay nearly in half, balanced the budget and turned years of mounting deficits into a surplus. The World Bank has extolled him as a model of fiscal responsibility and extended his state a billion-dollar loan in 2008. Although he alienated the state teachers union by linking their salaries to performance, Mr. Neves left office in 2010 with a 92 percent approval rating. His telegenic good looks, marriage to a glamorous former model and the birth of adorable twins last month haven't hurt his appeal.
In contrast, the incumbent, Ms. Rousseff, is a former Marxist guerrilla who praises Mr. Chávez as "a great Latin American." In the four years since she was elected, annual growth in G.D.P. has plunged from 7.5 percent to near zero, and Brazil may already be in recession. Inflation has jumped to 6.75 percent. During her tenure, the Brazilian stock market has dropped about a third after years of robust gains. In 2013, millions took to the streets to protest higher bus fares and government corruption. Ms. Rousseff has promised, if re-elected, to replace her minister of finance, Guido Mantega, but, according to Mr. Marconini, "everyone knows that the real minister of finance was Dilma herself."
Critics say Ms. Rousseff's shortcomings have been especially manifest at Petrobras, the giant oil company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government. Shares in Petrobras have been especially volatile during the campaign, and "are basically a call option on the election," said Allen Good, a research analyst who follows Petrobras for Morningstar.
Ms. Rousseff was chairwoman of Petrobras from 2003 to 2010, and as president of Brazil, appoints its chief executive and controls the board. "Petrobras was once highly respected and well run," Mr. Good said. "It was technically capable. But the government has pretty much destroyed the company in the past five years."
And that was before the company was engulfed by scandal, in which the company's huge revenue appears to have been treated like a giant slush fund to support Ms. Rousseff's candidacy, as my colleagues at The Times explained this week.
The short-seller James Chanos, who bet against Enron before its collapse, attacked Petrobras this week, calling it "a scheme, not a stock" on Bloomberg Television. "What I mean by that is that as an arm and ward of the state, decisions may not always be made to the benefit of creditors and shareholders," he told me this week. "Under Rousseff, the numbers are terrible, and if she's re-elected, they're going to get worse." Moody's downgraded the company's debt this week. Since Sept. 2, the stock has fallen to just above $12 a share, from more than $20.
Mr. Fraga said cleaning up Petrobras would be a top priority of a Neves presidency. Ms. Rousseff has imposed price controls on Petrobras to keep retail gas prices and inflation low, but Mr. Fraga said that would change if Mr. Neves were elected. "We don't believe in price controls, period," he said. "There's a widespread feeling that the company has been run by political appointees who aren't competent and are corrupt. There has to be an overhaul of Petrobras to make it well run and transparent. That's long overdue."
Mr. Fraga said Mr. Neves would bring his "shock management" approach to Brazil's sprawling federal bureaucracy. He would restore fiscal discipline, curb inflation and stop interfering with the central bank, which Mr. Fraga predicted would lead to lower interest rates and renewed economic growth. Mr. Neves has promised major investment in infrastructure, where "the needs are phenomenal" Mr. Fraga said. Tax reform is another priority.
"This is very doable," Mr. Fraga said. "It's not rocket science. We will have to deliver. We need a combination of a market-friendly approach and better execution. It's a mix of ideology and management."
Can Mr. Neves and Mr. Fraga pull off what would have to be considered a major political upset? In Latin America, incumbent presidents have almost never lost re-election bids, even in the middle of economic and political crises. The most recent polls are mixed.
But polls before the first round of voting grossly underestimated Mr. Neves's support, perhaps because many voters fear retaliation from Ms. Rousseff's ruling Workers Party should she be re-elected.
Still, if Mr. Neves loses, "it will be a crushing blow" to investors and business people in Brazil, Mr. Marconini of Teneo Intelligence said, and markets are likely to fall further. "It will be especially disappointing because he got their hopes up," he said. "It really looked like he could win."

Abstract: "From the point of view of the young man sitting at a hedge fund in London, it's a new frontier," he said. Because they are borrowing in a foreign currency, countries can quickly find that any cost advantage disappears if their own currency weakens. Federal Reserve policies after the financial crisis pushed interest rates to record lows, making American debt less appealing and the higher yields offered by emerging market debt more enticing.

Full text:   Five men in dark business suits gathered before Maria Kiwanuka in a semicircle. They were international bankers and they had a pitch to make.
Ms. Kiwanuka, the finance minister of Uganda, was sitting up on a small riser, her bright pink and gold dress a sharp contrast to the men's suits.
Bankers are jockeying for the next sovereign debt deal in Africa, a continent that foreign investors have long been wary of for its economic woes, rampant poverty and political instability. Now that narrative is changing, and one sub-Saharan nation after another is jumping into the debt market.
The Ebola outbreak, which is ravaging West Africa, could cost $33 billion, the World Bank estimated, prompting worries about the continent's growth prospects. But the sovereign debt market is booming, with sub-Saharan African countries raising nearly $7 billion so far this year, more than in all of 2013, according to Dealogic, a market research firm.
The yields on many of the new bonds in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria have dipped even as the Ebola crisis has intensified. That means that the market's outlook for those countries has improved, although that could change, particularly for West African countries, if health officials' warnings for the region turn increasingly dire.
The pitch to Ms. Kiwanuka took place at the London office of Standard Bank, based in Johannesburg, during an African investment conference the lender hosted this summer. Only a few days before, the bank was one of three to manage Kenya's $2 billion debut in the sovereign debt market. Now, it wanted to do the same for Uganda.
"They're about to make the hard sell," said an executive in the room, who was watching from a distance.
Uganda could use the money for power plants, rail lines, roads or similar projects it has planned. Countries around the continent are generally using proceeds from the bond sales to improve infrastructure, restructure debt and finance deficits.
Rwanda, for instance, is finishing a convention center and building a new hydropower plant. Senegal is fixing roads and the electric grid. Kenya is expanding its ports and railway system, as well as paying off a higher-cost loan.
After the meeting, Ms. Kiwanuka said such pitches had become routine.
"They do want us, and I am flattered that they are acknowledging our macroeconomic stability, because no one wants to get in bed with a basket case," she said. "I don't see the sovereign bond as the end of the story. It's just a tool to get things sorted."
African nations have been borrowing in a variety of ways over the years, issuing bonds on their domestic market and taking out loans directly from foreign banks, as well as relying on aid from foreign governments.
But they have also been known in the West for their inability to repay debts because of wars, political upheaval and economic tumult, leading the U2 singer Bono and the Live Aid founder Bob Geldof to campaign in years past for lenders to forgive African debts. Many sub-Saharan nations are still unrated by the major credit ratings agencies.
Sovereign bonds, which are typically denominated in dollars, can be a far cheaper way to raise money than local lending rates, though they are more expensive than direct aid or low-rate loans from government aid groups, which often come with oversight requirements. Before 2006, only South Africa had issued a sovereign bond. Now more than a dozen sub-Saharan countries have tested the market.
"It shows the opening up of Africa to private capital. It shows that private capital is replacing development aid as a source of capital flows to the continent, and that's good," said Kingsley Chiedu Moghalu, the deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, in an interview. He participated in Nigeria's promotional tour before it issued its first sovereign debt in 2011. "From the point of view of the young man sitting at a hedge fund in London, it's a new frontier," he said.
But it is not without pitfalls. Because they are borrowing in a foreign currency, countries can quickly find that any cost advantage disappears if their own currency weakens. And investors can become jittery, going suddenly cold on regions, as happened with emerging markets after the Federal Reserve started pulling back on its stimulus efforts.
The appeal to investors is clear enough. Federal Reserve policies after the financial crisis pushed interest rates to record lows, making American debt less appealing and the higher yields offered by emerging market debt more enticing. The yields on sub-Saharan debt can be more than three times as high as those on United States Treasury securities.
But investors, too, face risks. Among other concerns, many sub-Saharan countries have a history of fragile institutions and corruption, and some countries have defaulted on other forms of debt. Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, restructured its debt four times from 1986 to 2000 but defaulted on the agreements nonetheless, according to its debt management office.
"My belief is always that you're a successful participant in the international capital markets not when you've issued your first bond, but when you've repaid it, and that time is still to come for all of those large bond issuances," said Moritz Kraemer, the chief sovereign ratings officer at Standard & Poor's, in an interview.
Sometimes it is not always clear what the money will be used for. Mozambique's foray into the market last year was controversial. The country set up a tuna fishing company that raised $850 million through bond offerings, but the International Monetary Fund has raised questions about whether the proceeds were being used for more than tuna boats and asked for more transparency.
For now, bond investors seem relatively unfazed by the potential economic fallout from the Ebola epidemic. While the countries hardest hit -- Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone -- have not issued sovereign bonds, Ivory Coast, which borders both Liberia and Guinea, received a warm reception when it returned to the market in mid-July. Even now, the yields on its bonds are only modestly higher than when they came to market.
"Right now, market conditions are such that lowly rated sovereigns can get access," said Mr. Kraemer. For a while during the eurozone crisis investors could earn a higher interest rate from Spanish bonds than from those of Zambia, he said. "From our perspective, given what our ratings are, that makes no sense at all."
Many institutions and people, including the International Monetary Fund and Joseph Stiglitz, a winner of the Nobel in economic science, have urged caution.
Mark Roland Thomas, an economist and Africa expert at the World Bank, said the trend "does say something genuine and true about the progress Africa has made in the last couple of decades."
But he added: "Does it create more challenges and does it mean that macroeconomic management has become more complicated? Does it mean that relatively small economies are now more exposed to international economic conditions? Yes, and our clients are aware of that."
Demand remains strong, though prices vary.
Ghana returned to the sovereign debt market last month, even as it seeks help from the I.M.F. The country, which in the past has been seen as a beacon of stability, has looked shakier of late. Protesters took to the streets of Accra, Ghana's capital, this summer as its currency plummeted and inflation soared.
Mr. Kraemer of Standard & Poor's called Ghana "a cautionary tale."
Richard Segal, an analyst at Jefferies, said, "Typically, the idea is you would have discussions with the I.M.F. and have them be conclusive, have the I.M.F. make recommendations, have the loan program in place, and then go to the markets."
But investors flocked to the bond offering anyway, showing more faith than a leading opposition politician who warned that the proceeds would be squandered. Ghana raised about $1 billion with a coupon, or interest rate, of 8.125 percent on a bond coming due in 2026; it is now trading just below 8 percent, compared to about 2.3 percent for an analogous United States Treasury bond.
Ivory Coast priced a 10-year bond more favorably this summer at 5.6 percent, despite defaulting three years ago during a civil war. Investors have become more bullish since the fighting ended and political tensions have eased. The yield on the bond is now slightly above 6 percent.
Uganda, though, is remaining on the sidelines, at least for now.
"Our debt service is still below 10 percent of our total budget," Ms. Kiwanuka said. "We don't want it to spiral."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: With the American economy still operating below par, low interest rates would pose an inflation threat only after they had succeeded in spurring credit, strong growth and robust employment. Since those results have not yet been achieved, there is no inflationary pressure and no reason to raise rates in the near term.

Full text:   Barring unexpected bad economic news in the next several days, the Federal Reserve will finish its bond-buying program at the end of this month. In all, the program has pumped $3.5 trillion into the economy since 2008, helping to revive financial markets and stabilize the economy.
Now comes the hard part.
In its effort to wean the economy off of extraordinary monetary support, the Fed's next task is to decide when to raise interest rates from their prolonged ultralow levels.
Technically, the decision is straightforward. It is appropriate to raise rates when the economy shows signs of overheating, as measured by inflation in wages and prices. Currently, there are no such signs. Wages have long stagnated, even for college-educated workers. As for prices, the Fed's preferred annual inflation measure was recently 1.5 percent, well below its 2 percent target.
Politically, however, the decision is fraught. The Fed is not supposed to be swayed by elected officials or special interests. But bond holders -- a powerful political constituency that includes financial firms, investment funds and wealthy individuals -- generally want the Fed to raise rates sooner rather than later, and they have ample opportunity to dominate public discourse. Their aim is to pre-emptively attack inflation, which diminishes the value of their bonds.
But it is not the Fed's job to protect investors' bond portfolios. Its job is to foster both stable inflation and full employment. With the American economy still operating below par, low interest rates would pose an inflation threat only after they had succeeded in spurring credit, strong growth and robust employment. Since those results have not yet been achieved, there is no inflationary pressure and no reason to raise rates in the near term.
In fact, inflation has been so low for so long that the economy would not be in danger of overheating even if there were a period of inflation above the 2 percent target. That target is an average that the Fed would like to maintain over time, not a level that necessarily signals the need for a rate increase.
Similarly, wages can rise at a rate well above inflation without pushing up prices. That's because wage increases do not even begin to pose an inflation threat until they exceed the rate of inflation plus the rate of labor-productivity growth, roughly 3.5 percent currently.
Fed officials have indicated that they plan to start raising rates in mid-2015. They have stuck to that timetable, even as wage-and-price increases have failed to materialize. That policy consistency is understandable on one level: With many months to go before it has to either raise rates or admit that the economy is too weak to warrant an increase, the Fed rightly wants to project optimism.
It is crucial, however, for the Fed to keep rates low as long as inflation is in check. If rates are raised too soon, growth would be slowed before pay raises and adequate credit are restored to workers and consumers.
If that happens, the Fed effort to rescue the economy would, in the end, only further entrench inequality.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices rose marginally in the United States in September, painting a weak inflation picture that should give the Federal Reserve ample room to keep interest rates low for a while.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday that its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month as a rise in food and shelter costs offset a broad decline in energy prices. The index dropped 0.2 percent in August, and economists had expected a flat reading for September.
"This persistently weak inflation backdrop should continue to provide the key justification for the Fed to keep its policy stance accommodative," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The index dropped 0.2 percent in August, and economists expected a flat reading in September. In the 12 months through September, the index rose 1.7 percent after a similar gain in August. The Fed targets 2 percent inflation and tracks an index that is running even lower than the C.P.I. Inflation has waned in recent months after quickening in the second quarter, in part as slower economic growth in China and the eurozone, as well as a strengthening dollar, reduce imported price pressures.
That backdrop and a recent global equities market sell-off has led investors to push back their expectations for when the Fed will raise interest rates from near zero to late next year. Just a few weeks ago, they had looked for a rate hike in July. The Fed has kept benchmark overnight rates near zero since December 2008.
Fed officials meet next week and their statement at the end of the two-day meeting will be watched for changes in their assessment of the inflation environment.
Economists had expected consumer prices to hold steady last month, and Treasury debt prices slipped after the data was released, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
Underlying inflation pressures were also muted in September despite increases in shelter and medical care costs.
The so-called core Consumer Price Index, which strips out food and energy prices, ticked up 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in August. In the 12 months through September, the core index rose 1.7 percent after advancing by the same margin in August.
Energy prices fell for a third straight month in September, with gasoline costs slipping 1 percent after dropping 4.1 percent in August.
While declining gasoline prices frees up income for other spending, tepid wage growth is blunting the impact. Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.2 percent in September and were up just 0.3 percent over the past year.
"It is hard to have strong economic growth when spending power is largely flat," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
Food prices gained 0.3 percent in September and were up 3.0 percent from a year ago, the largest gain in nearly two and a half years.
In the core C.P.I., shelter costs increased 0.3 percent in September after rising 0.2 percent in August. The shelter index was up 3.0 percent in the 12 months through September, the largest gain since January 2008.
The medical care index increased 0.2 percent, with prices for nonprescription drugs increasing 1.5 percent and hospital services gaining 0.3 percent.
Airline fares declined for a third straight month, while prices for new motor vehicles and apparel were unchanged. Prices for used cars and trucks fell for the fifth straight month.

Wall Street Slips One Day After S.&P. 500's Biggest Gain of Year

Full text:   Stocks fell broadly on Wednesday, ending a four-day winning streak for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index as investors shaken by recent market swings sold some of their holdings.
A slide in the price of oil dragged down energy stocks. Eight of the 10 industry groups in the S.&P. 500 fell, led by a 1.7 percent drop in energy. Small-company stocks also fell as traders unloaded riskier assets.
"The market is still nervous," said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. "The extreme volatility of the last few weeks is on our minds."
The drop in the S.&P. 500 came a day after the index's biggest gain this year.
In the morning, stocks were higher on hopes that the European Central Bank would add to its stimulus program as well as news that inflation in the United States remained low last month. A batch of good earnings reports also helped. That mood evaporated in the afternoon as the price of crude oil began to drop.
"The market is taking a bit of breather," said J. J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. "People are reassessing what their expectations should be for the rest of the earnings season."
The S.&P. 500 dropped 14.17 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,927.11. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 153.49 points, or 0.9 percent, to 16,461.32. The Nasdaq fell 36.63 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,382.85.
The VIX index, a gauge of expected swings in stock prices, surged nearly two points to 18. That is above the recent average of 15, but far below last week's high of 30.
A big question hanging over stocks is just how good corporate earnings can get as Europe inches closer to recession and China's economy slows.
So far this earnings season, investors have been encouraged. With about a fifth of S.&P. 500 companies out with their results and outlooks, stocks look reasonably priced as measured by expectations of future earnings. The index is trading at 15.8 times expected earnings per share over the next 12 months, according to S&P Capital IQ, a research firm. That is not much lower, or cheaper, than the average since 2001 of 16.4.
But other measures, comparing stock prices with earnings over the last 10 years, for instance, suggest the market may be overvalued.
Investors will get a clearer view on Thursday, a big day for earnings across various industries. Those reporting include Microsoft, 3M, Amazon, Caterpillar and United Continental.
Frank Fantozzi, chief executive of the money management firm Planned Financial Services, says low inflation is one reason to resist selling when stocks are dropping. The government on Wednesday reported that consumer prices rose 1.7 percent in the year through September, below the 2 percent target set by the Federal Reserve.
"Energy prices are pretty low and wages have stayed pretty flat. You look at that, and G.D.P. growing pretty healthily, and there are too many good things," Mr. Fantozzi said. "The market should push through this."
Among stocks making news, Broadcom, a semiconductor company, rose 5.5 percent, the largest gain in the S.&P. 500, after reporting earnings late Tuesday that topped Wall Street estimates. The stock rose $2.04, to $39.37.
Biogen Idec fell 5 percent despite a strong quarter. The drug company said a patient who took its newest multiple sclerosis drug had brain inflammation and later died. The stock dropped $17.70, to $309.07.
Oil prices fell sharply after the Energy Department reported an increase in oil inventories that was far larger than analysts had expected. The benchmark United States crude contract fell $1.97, to $80.52 a barrel, in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, fell $1.51 to close at $84.71 on the ICE Futures exchange in London.
In other energy futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline fell 5.7 cents to close at $2.156 a gallon, heating oil fell 4.0 cents to close at $2.473 a gallon, and natural gas fell 5.2 cents to close at $3.659 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Bond prices didn't move much. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.22 percent from 2.24 percent late Tuesday.
Gold futures fell $6.20 to $1,244.80 an ounce, silver fell 32 cents to $17.23 an ounce and copper fell a penny to $3.02 a pound.

Abstract: According to the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, a trade association, homeowners 62 years and older "now have more equity in their homes than at any time since early 2008. According to the Local Market Monitor, which tracks housing prices in more than 300 markets in the United States, California had the best performance over the last 20 years and is projected to grow a cumulative 30 percent over the next three years.

Full text:   The initial good news for home-equity wealth building -- particularly for those who have managed to hold onto their homes -- is that in most of the country prices have generally recovered since the 2008 financial crisis.
But building home equity will largely depend on where you live, when you bought your home and if you tap that equity for retirement income. The wide regional differences in home appreciation are worth noting for those still trying to use real estate to increase their nest egg.
Homeowners who have been in their homes the longest will probably see the greatest increase in home equity. According to the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, a trade association, homeowners 62 years and older "now have more equity in their homes than at any time since early 2008. Home equity held by persons 62 and older has grown by more than 22 percent since the second quarter 2012, to a total of $3.73 trillion."
This means that if you're an older, longtime homeowner outside the Sun Belt, you've probably regained the equity you lost during the housing bust of 2007-9. You may be able to tap that equity for retirement or other purposes through a loan, refinancing or downsizing.
Yet is home equity a reliable piggy bank?
Home equity creation used to be seen as a forced savings plan. Whatever you invested in mortgage principal appreciated roughly at the rate of inflation.
The housing credit crisis changed that perception for several generations of Americans. The bust devastated home prices in some of the most desirable Sun Belt areas -- Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada.
Declines ranged from as severe as 69 percent in the Daytona Beach, Fla., area to less than 5 percent in the largest Texas cities, according to Homes.com.
The tide may have turned, though. Demographic changes in society -- especially baby boomers downsizing or moving to warmer places -- mean some coastal areas may once again prove to be good locations for building home equity, especially if building is restricted or climate change policies make development more expensive.
Some of the most robust growth projections for housing appreciation are for the coasts. According to the Local Market Monitor, which tracks housing prices in more than 300 markets in the United States, California had the best performance over the last 20 years and is projected to grow a cumulative 30 percent over the next three years.
Despite high taxes and the state's well-publicized budget and water woes, demand is still strong for the Bay Area and parts of Southern California. Technology start-ups and mature businesses want to be around Silicon Valley and Stanford University. And the Los Angeles area is a cultural and business mecca.
Elsewhere, the Local Market Monitor forecasts that prices are expected to rise 20 percent over the next three years in Florida, which in some areas suffered the most severe declines in the crash.
Another standout is Texas, which is attracting new residents from the Midwest and Northeast and is forecast to grow by 20 to 30 percent in most areas.
Besides California, Florida and Texas, the Local Market Monitor anticipates robust gains in Colorado and the Pacific Northwest, said Ingo Winzer, president of the service.
The key to home equity growth is a combination of strong local economies, building and jobs. People have to find an area desirable and want to move there from other places -- the kind of mobility that virtually came to a standstill during the recession years. And as land for development becomes scarcer and demand grows for new retirement housing, home prices will benefit.
"Those markets with the best expected home price appreciation have strong economies that attract in-migration," said Mr. Winzer. "It's population growth from migration that has the strongest effect on home prices, especially now. On the other hand, people are moving out of the Midwest, moving to Texas or the West and Northwest, and are leaving behind an excess of housing with depressed prices."
Other regions will not be as fortunate as retirees move to warmer locations with lower living costs. The Local Market Monitor projects mediocre to flat returns for Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and upstate New York. In the past, the worst performers in its survey have been in Ohio: Akron, Cleveland, Dayton and Toledo.
Because housing prices have proved to be volatile -- and may not return what they did in the past -- you may be better off concentrating on financial assets. As the financial crisis demonstrated, home appreciation is far from guaranteed. Areas can be overbuilt, and speculators can drive up prices with cheap financing.
"Are you better off in financial assets than housing assets?" asks Gary Painter, director of research at the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California. "Homes shouldn't be thought of as a way to save for retirement."
While reverse mortgages can be complex and expensive -- they leverage equity for current cash needs -- homeowners can also get access to home equity through a "cash out" sale, selling their home and buying or renting a less expensive dwelling.
Michelle Brennan Hall, president of Brennan Wealth Advisors in Addison, Tex., said, "For the most part, building home equity is a smart financial step for the overall net worth picture of individuals, yet it should not be a primary driver as a source for retirement income."
For most retirees, being debt-free can be a better financial strategy than using home equity for income or expenses. Having a mortgage in retirement reduces your monthly income, which is a growing problem. Nearly a third of those 65 and older had a mortgage in 2011. That's up from 22 percent in 2001, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
"Building equity in a home is another way of approaching a debt-free status for retirement, which should be the primary goal when it comes to homeownership," Ms. Brennan Hall said.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- Markets around the world have been jolted by fears that slowing growth and deflationary pressures in Europe, Japan and other major economies could derail the United States. But the health of China, for decades an engine of growth, has emerged as one of the most significant wild cards in the global economy.
It is hard to be certain just exactly how the Chinese economy is faring, given mixed signals in the data.
Chinese inflation is at its weakest levels in nearly five years. Commodity prices are plunging. New home sales are declining. Foreign investment is contracting.
The overall economy, though, continues to chug along at a steady, albeit more modest, pace. China's gross domestic product increased by 7.3 percent in the third quarter, compared with 7.5 percent in the previous quarter. While that was the lowest quarterly growth since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, the rate remains the envy of major economies. The economy also continues adding jobs at a good clip, and the currency is one of very few that are still rising against the dollar.
"The question or problem we are all facing at the moment is, 'What is right picture for the economy as a whole?' " said Louis Kuijs, the chief China economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong. "It's complicated by negative forces that show up very strongly in industry but not in the service sector."
Making sense of China's economic health is challenging because the slowdown is partly by design.
The Communist leadership has pledged to reduce China's dependence on credit-fueled growth and investment, to instead emphasize domestic consumption. It is a risky proposal, and leaders have signaled a willingness to live with slower growth, provided employment holds up and systemic risks are contained.
One figure that Chinese leaders study closely is the number of new jobs. Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, boasted in a speech at a World Economic Forum meeting last month that nearly 10 million urban jobs had been created in the first eight months of the year, up slightly from a year ago. As a result, he said, he would not mind if the growth of the gross domestic product fell short of this year's official target of 7.5 percent.
"An important goal of maintaining stable growth is to ensure employment, and the floor of the proper range is to ensure relatively adequate employment," he said at the meeting in Tianjin.
But even in the jobs figures, broad disparities exist across China. Employment has grown solidly in the services sector nearly every month in the last five years, according to the purchasing managers index compiled by HSBC and Markit. By contrast, manufacturing employment, which generally expanded from 2009 through 2011, has mostly contracted since.
At an employment fair for the medical appliance industry at a government-run career center near the Lama Temple in Beijing last week, more than a hundred job seekers bantered with recruiters and weighed their options. A 42-year-old man who gave only his surname, Mr. Lin, was applying for a job at Beijing Niubao Technology, a chemical equipment maker.
With 20 years of experience in a specialized industry, Mr. Lin expressed confidence about his prospects despite the overall outlook in the sector. "Manufacturing isn't doing so great in the past few years, but I think chemical equipment is still doing relatively O.K.," he said.
That somewhat positive outlook is a sharp contrast to most traditional industries. "We didn't have any new recruits this year," Huang Xinqun, 48, a manager at a large ocean-shipping company, said last week. "Usually when the manufacturing business is not doing so well, it would be directly reflected on us," he said.
"We're like a signal post on how the economy is doing," Mr. Huang said. "If companies don't have that many orders and products to transport, then we don't have as much work."
Despite the signs of malaise in China's manufacturing and industrial sectors, the government is wary of repeating the significant stimulus measures it undertook after the financial crisis. Leaders are worried that would add to China's ballooning debt, which rose to 250 percent of gross domestic product at the end of June, from 150 percent five years ago, according to estimates by Standard Chartered Bank.
Instead, policy makers in recent months have used targeted, behind-the-scenes stimulus measures, including extending limited amounts of short-term credit to large and medium-size banks. The government also has directed more financing to favored projects, like supporting agricultural efforts and redeveloping shantytowns.
"Things can be done to bolster activity for short periods of time, but I think the fundamental theme is a persistent ratcheting down in the measured rate of growth," said George Magnus, a financial consultant and a former chief economist at UBS. "China is in for an extended period of volatility."
Other major indicators offer similarly contradictory perspectives on the progress of China's economic transition.
Retail sales are rising at their slowest pace in nearly a decade, seemingly casting doubt on the ability of Chinese consumers to drive economic growth. But with an increase of about 12 percent in value this year, sales are hardly anemic.
What is more, official sales figures fail to capture the explosive growth of online shopping in China. The statistics bureau only began including the sales of some unnamed, large Internet retailers in its data this year. But Mark Williams, the chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, estimates that official retail sales figures only capture about one-sixth of the online purchases in China.
Trade figures, too, are somewhat unclear. Reported Chinese exports rose 15.3 percent last month, their biggest increase since 2013. But that was partly because of a 34 percent increase in exports to Hong Kong.
The dynamic has prompted some economists to question whether trade figures are again being distorted by so-called over-invoicing. The practice was rampant two years ago, when China's reported exports to Hong Kong surged when companies disguised speculative capital inflows as the proceeds from trade. Hong Kong's separately reported imports from China are much lower, which economists say is evidence of the practice.
The most problematic economic indicator in China may be gross domestic product itself. Though economists say the data broadly are improving, the numbers do not always seem to add up. For example, the combined G.D.P. reported by each of China's provinces still regularly exceeds the official total for the country.
Even Mr. Li, the prime minister, has at times expressed doubts over this benchmark measure of output. In 2007, when he was governor of Liaoning Province in northeastern China, Mr. Li privately acknowledged to a visiting American diplomat that China's G.D.P. figures were unreliable and "for reference only" because they were "man-made," according to a confidential diplomatic cable released in 2010 by WikiLeaks.
Since then, many economists have supplemented China's official figures with their own versions of a "Li Keqiang Index," alternative measures based on what Mr. Li said were his bellwethers of economic expansion. They include electricity consumption, rail cargo volumes and the value of loans disbursed.
"Certainly these data have the potential to be more reliable but there are complications there, too," said Carsten Holz, a professor of social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who has scrutinized China's economic data.
"It's a planned economy thing," Mr. Holz said of the Li Keqiang indexes, likening them to tallying apples on a tree but making no attempt to calculate their value.
"It is a very rudimentary measure, because you don't know how many of these apples are rotten, or measure how big they are," he said. "You are just counting apples."

Abstract: House Republican leadership aides have repeatedly said lawmakers are not calling for an actual ban of airline flights, even as the likes of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, have done just that. Because there are no direct flights from the countries afflicted with Ebola, a flight ban would have to ground connecting flights from Brussels, Amsterdam and other European cities.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Republican leaders, conceding the futility of a flight ban from Ebola-afflicted West Africa, are refining their response to the outbreak, pressing to suspend visas for travelers and create "no boarding" lists.
But a supercharged political atmosphere is making legislative nuance difficult two weeks before midterm elections and days before a hearing on Friday on the Ebola response called by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a panel riven by partisan division. Republicans on the campaign trail continue to goad Democrats to embrace a broad travel ban, although no direct flights to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea exist.
Democrats are slamming Republicans for slashing the budgets of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies charged with stopping the spread of Ebola, even after the White House circulated talking points to House Democrats in advance of a hearing last week that said funding had been adequate.
"Even within a constrained environment, the administration has prioritized C.D.C. funding over the years with significant increases for control of infectious diseases," the memo said. "The administration has also included significant increases for C.D.C. within the Prevention and Public Health Fund and other sources."
Days of news media fixation, mounting public concern and political pot-stirring have created an odd dichotomy in which leadership aides on Capitol Hill are urging caution while candidates on the campaign trail are pressing hot buttons. House Republican leadership aides have repeatedly said lawmakers are not calling for an actual ban of airline flights, even as the likes of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, have done just that.
Because there are no direct flights from the countries afflicted with Ebola, a flight ban would have to ground connecting flights from Brussels, Amsterdam and other European cities.
The Republican leaders of the House Homeland Security Committee, in a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, clarified that they would like a temporary suspension of visas to travelers from the Ebola-affected nations "while simultaneously permitting a robust effort by the U.S. government and global health agencies to combat this vicious disease in West Africa."
Mr. McConnell, said a spokesman, Don Stewart, was "using shorthand" last week when he said, "It would be a good idea to discontinue flights into the United States from that part of the world." He, too, supports a temporary suspension of visas, a position put into legislative language on Monday by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who vowed to press visa-suspension legislation when Congress returned in November.
In reality, Republicans are not planning a legislative response, at least for now, Republican leadership aides said Monday. They merely want their voices heard.
"The president has the authority to put a travel ban into effect right now," said Kevin Smith, spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. "The speaker has not ruled out bringing the House back to address the Ebola crisis if our oversight efforts demonstrate a need for legislation to help combat the spread of the disease."
Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, who signed the Homeland Security Committee letter, said he would like a "hard stop" to travel from the afflicted countries but added, "That's not going to happen."
Democratic leaders have kept largely quiet. Democratic leadership aides said Monday that they hoped the all-clear given on Sunday to Dallas residents who had been exposed to the one Ebola patient to die in the United States could defuse the latest political tempest, just as fears over the militant Islamic State and Mexican border breaches dissipated.
Most Democrats continue to adhere to the Obama administration's position on travel restrictions, which were laid out last week in the talking points. That document emphasized that travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea were already screened on departure, and again on arrival.
"Imposing a ban would give travelers an incentive to evade detection, conceal their travel history and, therefore, make it much harder for us to ensure they are screened before they enter the U.S.," the document stated. "In addition, the only way we can eliminate the risk of Ebola to the American public is to stop the outbreak at the source. That means we need to surge resources to West Africa, and imposing a travel ban would only make it harder to move critically needed personnel and supplies to these countries."
Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, took up the cause on Monday. "At the end of the day," he said, "election-year posturing about a travel ban wastes precious time that should be spent mobilizing to attack this disease at its source -- in Africa -- so it does not continue to end up on our shores."
On Nov. 6, two days after the midterm elections, the Senate Appropriations Committee will hold a hearing on the government's response. Aides released data on Monday showing the C.D.C.'s budget, at $6.8 billion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, was just shy of its 2009 peak of $6.9 billion and well above the $6.3 billion the agency received in the 2013 fiscal year, when across-the-board cuts pinched almost every government function.
But Democrats maintain that if the 2004 C.D.C. budget were adjusted for inflation, it would be above $7.5 billion. Republicans counter that funding for Ebola would be sufficient if the issue was prioritized, a position not far from that of the White House.

Abstract: In August, an article in The New York Times said that more than $13.3 billion was owed to people who had neglected to claim dormant bank accounts, back wages, dividend checks, utility and rent security deposits, rebates, safe deposit box contents and estate proceeds that had been surrendered to the state by banks, insurers, utility companies and others.

Full text:   William C. Thompson Jr., the former New York City comptroller, discovered that he was the beneficiary of a $2,500 life insurance policy bought by his grandfather, who died in 1978.
Michael B. Mukasey, who served as attorney general under President George W. Bush, collected $1,606.78 -- plus $3.34 in taxable interest -- in back pay, for teaching a course at Columbia Law School that covered "the importance of keeping track of things in preparing for trial."
New York State sent six tax refund checks totaling $2,789.43 to Tim Zagat, whose company publishes the popular guidebooks that bear his name.
Christmas came early this year for thousands of New Yorkers, and the State of New York was Santa.
In August, an article in The New York Times said that more than $13.3 billion was owed to people who had neglected to claim dormant bank accounts, back wages, dividend checks, utility and rent security deposits, rebates, safe deposit box contents and estate proceeds that had been surrendered to the state by banks, insurers, utility companies and others.
The article set off a stampede of people eager to find out if they were entitled to an unanticipated or forgotten windfall.
"I was absolutely floored," said Mr. Thompson, who was expecting to collect only a few dollars, left on a gift certificate for golf clubs.
"I always thought these things were nickels and dimes," Mr. Zagat said. "This was a big surprise to me."
Less than two months after the article was published, about 53,000 New Yorkers had filed claims with the office of Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, which had processed 40,000 of those by the end of September and paid out $14 million to those whose claims were verified. Several thousand more claimants filed than had during the comparable period the year before. There were 31 million unclaimed accounts.
New York's forgotten funds have ballooned to $13.3 billion, up from $9.9 billion five years ago as a result of gaps in the postal delivery system; the laxity of businesses, which pursue deadbeats more aggressively than creditors with dormant accounts; and inflation, which devalues the unclaimed money in relation to the bother of redeeming it.
Businesses are supposed to notify holders of dormant accounts by mail, then publish their names in local newspapers, before surrendering dormant accounts after two to five years to the comptroller's office.
Most of the money is transferred to the state's general fund, but can be claimed online without charge at any time. Inquiries can also be made by telephone during business hours at 1-800-221-9311; by mail to Office of the State Comptroller, Office of Unclaimed Funds, 110 State Street, Albany, NY 12236; or by email at nysouf@osc.state.ny.us.
Last year, over $700 million from abandoned and dormant accounts was surrendered to the state, while the comptroller paid out $422 million to people who filed claims.
Nationwide, states held over $62 billion in unclaimed accounts under names ranging from Madonna to President Obama, demonstrating that the rich and famous can be absent-minded about money, too.
You don't even have to be alive to be a creditor. In New York, unclaimed funds are due Leona and Harry Helmsley, Brooke Astor, former Mayor John V. Lindsay, George Plimpton, Mickey Mantle, Norman Mailer, Leonard Bernstein and Walter Cronkite.
Half of the accounts now held by New York State are for amounts of less than $100. The largest single account that remains unclaimed is worth $1.7 million. The Rev. Al Sharpton, United States Senator Al Franken and Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian, all declined to say if they had claimed the funds owed to them.
As for Mr. Obama, a White House spokesman said the president had no immediate plans to file a claim for over $100 from General Electric, for a "Barrack Obama Jr. at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.," because he was too busy to log in to a website and file forms affirming that the listing by the District of Columbia's Office of Finance and Treasury was legitimate.
Madonna, who was owed at least two paychecks, from the Walt Disney Company and Warner Music, has received one so far, her spokeswoman, Liz Rosenberg, said. "And now, like regular people, she runs to the mailbox each morning" awaiting the other one, Ms. Rosenberg added. She declined to say how much money Madonna has received.
Dr. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and author, collected an insurance refund of several hundred dollars. Richard LeFrak, the real estate executive, found about $50 in an account linked to his mother's estate. Patti LuPone, the actress, received what a spokesman described as "a minor amount" from a security deposit on an alarm system she had installed in her apartment. After filing a claim, the author Jonathan Lethem received several thousand dollars for teaching at Columbia "and a third check for $157.44 from a payee I honestly didn't recognize."
Some well-known figures complained that trying to file a claim was time-consuming and burdensome, though others said any amount was worth waiting for. "Getting any money back from a New York State taxing authority will put a smile on my face," said Ann Coulter, the television commentator.
Roger Ailes, the president of Fox News Channel, had not gotten around to submitting a claim, but had high expectations. "I'm hoping it's a Ferrari," he said. Not likely, since he appears to be owed a refund from an old insurance policy.
A car might be awaiting his boss, though. According to the unclaimed fund website, General Motors has been in debt to Rupert Murdoch for nearly a decade.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is watching carefully as financial markets bounce around, but the likely course of monetary policy remains the same, officials have said in recent public comments and interviews.
The Fed still intends to finish its bond-buying campaign at the end of the month. And it is still likely to start raising interest rates in mid-2015, although it now seems a little less likely that the Fed would act sooner, and more likely it would wait longer.
"Just based on a short period of volatility, that's not enough for me to make much of an adjustment," Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview on Saturday. "We need more time to evaluate whether we should be doing any updating. And I would say the financial market movements have not been triggered by very many real economic indicators."
Mr. Rosengren and other Fed officials say it is possible the market gyrations, and a downturn in inflation expectations, are early indications that they have once again overestimated the recovery. But the bulk of recent data has been more upbeat, and they see little harm in waiting for more information.
"The stock market is much more volatile than the economy," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research note to clients last week. "Sooner or later, then, the incoming data will calm the markets' apparent growth fears, and talk of the Fed not beginning to tighten until 2016 will fade away."
The Fed has methodically pulled back from bond-buying over the last nine months. It plans to add a final $15 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities during October. Officials have pointed to the steady decline of the unemployment rate as evidence the economy no longer needs quite as much help.
In recent weeks, however, market measures of inflation expectations have fallen sharply. On Friday, a measure called the break-even rate, which is derived from asset prices, implied annual inflation would run around 1.37 percent over the next five years.
The decline may show investors have growing doubts the Fed will meet its stated goal of 2 percent annual inflation. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told Bloomberg News last week that the Fed should consider delaying the end of its bond-buying program.
Such a decision would show that "we are watching and we're ready and we are willing to do things to defend our inflation target," Mr. Bullard said.
But that view appears to command little support among other Fed officials, in part because market-based measures are viewed as relatively foggy.
Mr. Rosengren noted that the measures, which compare Treasury securities with other assets, can also move because of changes in the perceived risks of those assets. Reminders of Europe's malaise have driven a "flight to safety" in recent weeks, as investors have piled into low-risk assets like Treasuries.
"Trying to draw inflation expectations from market prices is perilous," Mr. Rosengren said. "We need more time, and if it's a flight to safety that's a different story than if it's a story that inflation expectations are becoming unhinged."
John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview with Reuters last week that if the Fed did decide more stimulus was needed, he would prefer to respond first by delaying interest-rate increases.
That view is shared by most Fed officials, Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote last week. "We believe Williams' preference for communication about the expected path of the funds rate instead of more asset purchases is reflective of the majority attitude on the committee," he said.
Officials are similarly doubtful that recent market volatility reflects a change in the underlying economy -- or that it will have broad economic consequences.
"When risk assets dropped last summer, all financial conditions tightened sharply: credit spreads widened, equities fell and yields spiked," analysts at Barclays Capital pointed out in a note to clients last week. That has not happened this time.
Indeed, some Fed officials had suggested in recent months that a little more volatility would be a good thing, helping to discourage excessive risk-taking.
Concerns about persistently low inflation, however, may be reducing the chances that the Fed would start raising rates before the middle of the year. Mr. Williams, an influential centrist, told Reuters he still thought a midyear increase was most likely, but that the greater risk was now that the Fed would need to wait longer.
By the Fed's preferred measure, an index of personal consumption expenditures, inflation was just 1.5 percent over the 12 months that ended Aug. 31. Most of the 17 members of the Fed's policy-making committee predicted in September that inflation would not increase to 2 percent in either of the next two years.
And measures of inflation expectations based on consumer surveys are also drifting downward. The most prominent survey, conducted by the University of Michigan, reported on Friday that consumers expected 2.8 percent inflation over the next year -- the lowest forecast in the last four years. A survey created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also has drifted down since its introduction last year.
Some Fed officials are concerned that the Fed risks waiting for too long before beginning to raise interest rates. In a recent interview, Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, pointed to research by her staff that found unemployment had "almost" returned to a normal level, based on an analysis of five measures of labor market slack.
"They're all basically showing that we're getting close to our goal in terms of slack being reduced," she said. "That's significant."
Ms. Mester also said she was "not too disturbed" by the persistence of sluggish inflation. She said she still expected inflation to return to the Fed's 2 percent target, but that "inflation is a gradual process."
But other officials have argued with increasing vigor in recent weeks that the greater risk is premature retreat. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, is the most outspoken. He reiterated in a speech on Thursday that the Fed should forswear rate increases until officials were convinced inflation would reach their 2 percent target within two years. He said it was therefore "inappropriate" to raise rates in 2015 unless economic conditions changed.
Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has made a similar case less pointedly.
"I feel that before the Fed raises rates, we should have a great deal of confidence that we won't be forced to backtrack on our moves," Mr. Evans told an audience in Indianapolis last week. "We should be exceptionally patient in adjusting the stance of U.S. monetary policy."

Full text:   BOSTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, used her bully pulpit on Friday to sound the alarm about rising economic inequality.
Ms. Yellen did not mention recent market turmoil or monetary policy during her 30-minute speech. Instead, she painted a bleak picture of the increasingly unequal distribution of wealth and income, warning that Americans already have relatively little chance to advance economically, and that the problem may be worsening.
"I think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation's history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity," she said in her speech, which opened a conference on inequality at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Ms. Yellen, who took office in February, continues to put her stamp on the Fed by raising the profile of issues related to economic inequality.
Beyond the Fed's efforts to increase job growth through stimulative monetary policy, Ms. Yellen sees a role for the central bank as a source of research intended to provoke public debate.
Past Fed chiefs have also spoken about broader economic issues. Ms. Yellen's predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, devoted a speech to inequality in 2007. But Ms. Yellen's focus and her remarks still may be perceived as partisan, said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University.
Some Republicans in Congress argue the Fed's recent activism is harmful to the economy, and they are seeking to impose new legislative restraints.
"In today's highly partisan political environment, policy issues -- and the politicians who talk about them -- are inevitably perceived through partisan lenses," said Ms. Binder, who studies the central bank.
"I suppose that is the risk for Yellen speaking out on an issue that is more often framed as a Democratic issue."
But some audience members Friday welcomed what they saw as a change in tone.
"It shows you how she thinks of her role as Fed chair," said Nick Perna, an economist who heads Perna Associates, a consulting firm in Connecticut. "It's not only lip service to the dual mandate but an obligation to promote opportunity. And she's the first Fed chair that has really gone out of her way to emphasize it."
Ms. Yellen on Friday focused on four sources of economic opportunity: the means to raise children, access to education, owning a small business and inheritance.
She said recent Fed research showed the distribution of those opportunities to be increasingly unequal. For example, the share of wealth held by the lower half of households fell from 3 percent in 1989 to 1 percent in 2013, according to the Fed's triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, a survey of 6,000 households.
Government benefits and public programs offset some of that inequality, but Ms. Yellen noted that public financing for early education had not increased since the recession, while the cost of higher education continues to rise.
"I fear the large and growing burden of paying for it may make it harder for many young people to take advantage of the opportunity higher education offers," she said.
Similarly, she noted that the decline in small business creation suggested that it had become harder for people to build wealth through entrepreneurial risks, threatening "what I believe likely has been a significant source of economic opportunity."
Inheritances were the somewhat surprising bright spot in her bleak picture. Ms. Yellen said that wealth gains from inheritances were less concentrated than overall wealth. Large numbers of less affluent families continued to receive windfalls. The average age for receiving an inheritance is 40, the Fed found, a stage of life when people are often assessing their ability to pay for children's education or to start a business.
Ms. Yellen noted that inequality could contribute to economic growth by serving as an incentive. But it can also make things worse, she said. She pointed to a relationship she described as the "Great Gatsby curve" -- that in advanced economies with greater inequality, there is also less opportunity for intergenerational mobility. And mobility, she said, "is lower in the United States than in most other advanced countries."
Ms. Yellen offered few specific suggestions on addressing these problems.
She also did not discuss the view of some critics that the Fed's own policies are part of the problem. Before the recession, the Fed placed greater priority on reducing inflation than on reducing unemployment. More recently the Fed's stimulus campaign has raised the value of financial assets, which are primarily held by affluent households.
"Large-scale asset purchases seem to widen income inequality, although this is challenging to quantify," Yves Mersch, a member of the European Central Bank's executive board, said in a Friday speech that expressed a common view.
Fed officials have said any such impact is outweighed by the success of the stimulus program in creating new jobs, raising home values and increasing growth.

Abstract: Given recent strength in the United States economy, the decline in the unemployment rate and the Fed's repeated intention to tighten monetary policy over the next year, no wonder hardly anyone anticipated this year's bond market rally. Carlo Besenius, chief executive of the financial advisory firm Creative Global Investments, predicted in March that United States and European government bonds would rally, with 10-year Treasury yields falling to 1.8 percent and German bunds at 0.9 percent.

Full text:   This week's stock market drop and wild gyrations may have been wrenching for investors, but they can't really be called a surprise. After 27 months with no significant decline and with many valuation measures signaling caution, a chorus of pundits has been predicting a stock market pullback and higher volatility.
But along with the turmoil, there was a surprise: On Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note hit 1.85 percent, its lowest level since May 2013, extending a yearlong Treasury bond market rally that almost no one predicted.
European government bond rates are even lower. The 10-year German bund rates hit 0.715 percent this week, the lowest in at least 25 years. Ten-year Swiss government bonds fell just below a paltry 0.4 percent. Ten-year rates in Italy (2.6 percent) and Spain (2.2 percent) were only slightly higher than in the United States, which, given the relative weakness of their economies, seems incredible.
The recent volatility of stocks and the unpredictability of interest rates is a potent reminder to most investors to have a diversified mix of stocks and bonds and stick to a simple asset allocation plan. "What happened this week isn't unusual, and it isn't abnormal," said Francis Kinniry, a principal in Vanguard's investment strategy group. "Stocks are a high-risk, high-return asset."
Even though interest rates seem pretty close to rock bottom, some bond experts are saying they could drop even further. "We've been telling our investors for a decade, that just because bond yields are low doesn't mean the direction has to be up," Mr. Kinniry said. "A lot of people confuse the level with the direction. We agree the level is low, so return expectations are low. But it's not as simple as gravity, that just because they're low means they have to go up."
This week, some Federal Reserve Board members sounded as if the Fed might delay its long-anticipated rate rise expected in mid-2015. Some economists are even calling for a resumption of its quantitative easing program, the central bank's bond-buying program scheduled to end this month -- all moves that could cause rates to drop even further and prolong the bond rally.
Given recent strength in the United States economy, the decline in the unemployment rate and the Fed's repeated intention to tighten monetary policy over the next year, no wonder hardly anyone anticipated this year's bond market rally. But there were a few lonely voices. In his list of "15 Surprises for 2014," issued in January, Douglas Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management (and a widely followed market pundit), predicted "slowing global growth" (surprise No. 1); "stock prices decline" (surprise No. 3); and "bonds outperform stocks" (surprise No. 4).
Those have been remarkably accurate so far, though Mr. Kass readily acknowledges that he was far too bearish in 2013, when his forecasts were "way off the mark." When I reached him this week at his office in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Kass said he was sticking by his predictions that stocks would end the year at their lows and that bonds would show a 10 percent return.
"I think we're approaching an 'aha' moment," he said, "when investors realize that growth isn't going to emerge in the months ahead. The central banks have blunt tools, and they've reached the limit of what they can do. As Peggy Lee put it, 'Is that all there is?' "
Mr. Kass expects the bond rally to continue and is among those who suspect the Fed will delay raising rates. "People are losing sight of the fact that the Fed hasn't raised rates since June 2006," he said. "I don't see them raising rates for two or three more years. That will be another surprise for the markets."
Carlo Besenius, chief executive of the financial advisory firm Creative Global Investments, predicted in March that United States and European government bonds would rally, with 10-year Treasury yields falling to 1.8 percent and German bunds at 0.9 percent. Both pretty much hit their targets. Although he expects what he calls "a mini-correction" to intervene, he's lowering his target for the next six months even further, to 1.5 percent for Treasuries and 0.55 percent for bunds, and deduces the rally will continue.
A major factor in Mr. Besenius's forecast is low inflation expectations, even the possibility of deflation in Europe. That helps explains Europe's lower rates, since the real return -- the yield minus the inflation rate -- reflects very low inflation expectations there. And like Mr. Kass, he says he believes the Fed will resume quantitative easing in 2015 and put off any rate increases.
Unlike Mr. Kass, Mr. Besenius is optimistic about stocks, partly because low bond yields make stocks' expected returns more attractive by comparison. And low global interest rates and falling oil prices should stimulate investment and consumer spending. He sees buying opportunities emerging in the recent sell-off and is predicting a 15 percent rally from current levels by the end of the year. Investors "should be patient" and "buy into high-yielding sectors like energy, financials, industrials and materials," he said. He also recommends stocks in Brazil, China and India, countries with strong fundamental growth and a potential for monetary easing.
Mr. Kinniry said Vanguard had been fielding a surge of calls from investors worried about this week's volatility. Vanguard's two-word message: "Stay cool."
In keeping with its longstanding approach, Vanguard is urging investors to stick to a simple, low-cost asset allocation model divided between stocks and high-quality bonds and not try to time markets. "Many investors make the mistake of looking at bonds as stand-alone investments with low expected returns," he said. "But they're really there to complement the equity risk. We've looked at this in depth over long periods. And when equities are under stress, the only assets with positive returns have been very high-grade government bonds, high-quality municipals and high-grade corporate bonds. Everything else -- hedge funds, private equity, real estate, high-yield bonds -- has gone down."

Full text:   Updated, 8:10 p.m. | For a day at least, Wall Street was able to work through its worries about the world economy.
After Wednesday's mayhem, stock markets around the world mostly stabilized on Thursday. The Standard & Poor's 500 benchmark of American stocks recovered from an early slump to close ever so slightly higher, at 1,862.76.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.97 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,217.39, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.50 points, or 0.15 percent, to 15,117.24.
Most European markets, which were hit particularly hard on Wednesday, fell again, but ended up off their lows.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed after dipping below the psychologically important 2 percent mark for the second consecutive day.
In recent years, investors have piled into Treasuries during times of stress, so the small increase in the yield, to 2.15 percent, from 2.13 percent late Wednesday, was a sign that investors had shed some of their nerves. The price on the 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32, to 101 31/32.
As some calm settled on Wall Street, some executives wondered whether fears about the global economy -- which prompted some of the frantic selling in recent days -- might be overdone.
"In speaking with our economists only yesterday," Harvey M. Schwartz, chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, said on a conference call on Thursday, "they would argue that nothing has fundamentally changed in the past two weeks, or certainly the last 24 hours, regarding the long-term outlook for the global economy."
But it is not clear that the world's biggest economies have enough momentum to please markets.
The exception might be the United States economy. After a handful of uninspiring economic releases on Wednesday, two strong ones came out on Thursday, including a low number for people claiming unemployment benefits. In addition, James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, suggested that the Federal Reserve could consider delaying the end of its bond-buying stimulus program.
But investors' fears focus on Europe, where it is not clear that policy makers will reinvigorate the region's wheezing economy.
On Thursday, the European Union said that inflation in the 18 countries using the euro had fallen to 0.3 percent in September, its lowest level in five years. Spain, Italy and Greece actually had deflation.
Falling prices are considered troubling because they can feed on themselves and deepen an economic malaise.
"Europe faces the risk of a prolonged period of substantially below-target inflation or outright deflation," the United States Treasury Department warned on Thursday in a semiannual report to Congress.
Many economists believe an emphatic response is necessary to reverse deflation. The European Central Bank has two substantial stimulus programs in place to induce bank lending. But some economists want the central bank to go one big step further and print money to buy large amounts of government bonds, a policy that the Federal Reserve pursued in earnest in the United States.
While such stimulus has left trillions of dollars idling in American banks, it nevertheless seems to have the effect of sending a clear signal that the government is determined to bolster the economy, which can then persuade businesses and consumers to spend.
Even so, resistance in Germany to government bond buying is strong. That may delay the European Central Bank from doing it -- or prevent it altogether. The German skeptics say that aggressive monetary policies like bond buying simply cannot solve the impediments to growth that they perceive to exist in countries like Spain and Italy.
Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Germany, contends that wages in the peripheral European countries rose to unsustainably high levels in the years before the sovereign debt crisis and that while they have fallen, they still need to fall further. He noted that Spanish manufacturing wage costs are about 23 euros per hour, versus seven euros for Poland.
"They are more than three times as expensive," Mr. Sinn said.
The Germans have taken to the courts to stop the European Central Bank from carrying out government bond buying, asserting that it would fall afoul of a European Union treaty.
Some economists still believe that Europe can make it out of its difficult patch without government bond buying. They, for instance, expect a boost from the regulatory tests at European banks to determine whether they have sufficient capital.
The so-called stress tests, whose results are scheduled to come out later this month may have temporarily distracted and deterred European bankers from stepping up their lending. And if the tests are seen to be credible, they could bolster confidence in the region as a whole.
"The stress tests are a tool that worked in U.S. and they will work in Europe," said Markus Schomer, chief economist at PineBridge Investments.
But to others, Europe is not strong enough to wait to see if things like stress tests and efforts to bolster economic competitiveness can revive the region. At the very least, according to this view, government bond buying could significantly guard against the risk of deflationary slump.
"Yes, there is a belief that the E.C.B. will act if necessary, but the question is how bad things have to get before it does so," said Mark H. Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS's wealth management unit.

Full text:   By a lot of measures, the United States economy is looking pretty good right now. The unemployment rate has fallen below 6 percent for the first time in half a dozen years, and jobs are being added at the fastest rate since before the Great Recession.
Things are looking better, that is, unless you turn your eye to Wall Street. There, the stock market's main gauge, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, fell 0.8 percent on Wednesday after a wild ride during the day. It is off 7.4 percent since mid-September.
Moreover, longer-term interest rates are down sharply, which normally signals pessimism in the bond market about the nation's economic future. A measure of expected volatility hit its highest level since 2011 on Wednesday, signaling that more manic days could lie ahead.
This apparent contradiction -- and how it is resolved -- points to the basic question for the United States economy and for Federal Reserve policy makers right now. How powerful is that underlying economic strength? And will the recent market volatility prove ultimately inconsequential, or does it presage harder times ahead for a nation still trying to muddle its way out of a downturn that technically ended more than five years ago?
In other words, does Wall Street know something that the rest of us don't?
There are some reasons that, unnerving as these market moves have been, people who do not trade stocks and bonds for a living should still feel reasonably good about where things stand. Yes, the market sell-off on Wednesday was driven partly by a weak reading on United States retail sales, which fell 0.3 percent in September. But some of the most direct effects of the market action are actually positives for ordinary Americans.
The price of oil is down about 20 percent since summer, which is making a wide range of fuels less expensive. Gasoline now averages $3.18 a gallon, down 14 percent since the spring, according to data from AAA. A slump in the prices of agricultural commodities like corn, soybeans and wheat should, over time, make trips to the grocery store cheaper.
And with money gushing away from risky investments like stocks into safer bonds, long-term interest rates have fallen steeply; the yield on a 10-year Treasury note briefly dipped below 2 percent on Wednesday morning, the lowest it has been in more than a year. (It closed the day at 2.13 percent.)
Those lower rates are likely to be passed through in the form of lower home mortgage interest rates, which could bolster a still-struggling housing market. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 4.13 percent on Tuesday, according to Bankrate.com, a number that could tumble further as the latest bond market moves are priced into consumer mortgages.
But perhaps the overriding message is that this market sell-off, to the degree it is a sell-off at all (the S.&P. 500 decline of 7.4 percent was matched by a similar fall in late 2012), may be bringing market prices more in line with the brutal realities of the economy.
While job growth has been solid this year, wages are rising barely faster than inflation, and the United States economy is producing far below its economic potential by most official estimates. Yet the stock market and other risky investments have generally been on tears since early in 2009, soaring to relatively high valuations relative to earnings. The Fed's policies of printing trillions of dollars to buy bonds have been an important factor.
So the correction may not be about Wall Street knowing something about the outlook for the future that the rest of us do not, but rather about markets adjusting to more realistically reflect economic reality. Yes, things have improved, but maybe not enough to justify stock prices that are quite so high relative to corporate earnings.
"Due to excessive confidence in central banks, investors eagerly decoupled high market valuations from what was warranted by the sluggish fundamentals," said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser of Allianz, the financial services company. That disconnect, he said, has been undermined over the last few weeks by signs that the global economy's fundamentals are weaker than they seemed and concern that the European Central Bank will not adequately fight that continent's economic drift.
The renewed bout of volatility partly reverses a trend through the first half of the year in which almost all global assets -- both safe ones like Treasury bonds and risky ones like stocks and real estate -- were increasing in value. Now money is shifting out of risky assets and toward the safe ones, which is a more normal pattern.
There is a big question, though, as to what, if anything, global policy makers ought to do about it. Fed officials have been clear that they expect to start raising interest rates from their longstanding near-zero levels in the middle of 2015. Until this month, markets have believed them.
On Oct. 1, futures markets priced in only about 9 percent odds that the Fed would not raise rates by December 2015. By Wednesday, that had risen to about 40 percent. That means investors are now betting, given the recent declines in stock prices, bond yields and inflation expectations, that Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, and her colleagues at the central bank are quite a bit less likely to follow through with their plans to increase interest rates next year. There have even been some early rumblings of a new round of quantitative easing, or bond buying (the previous round is set to end in the weeks ahead).
The decision whether to increase interest rates next year will be Ms. Yellen's first big test in a tenure as chairwoman that began in February, but has thus far largely carried out policies shaped by her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke.
The quandary for Ms. Yellen, and for anyone reading scary headlines about the latest market moves, is this: Are these the kinds of routine gyrations on Wall Street that can be safely ignored? Or are they a signal that something is seriously wrong and the Fed needs to re-evaluate the path it has embarked on?

Full text:   MOSCOW -- A steep decline in oil prices is straining the budgets of major petroleum-exporting countries around the globe, raising a specter of spending cuts in Russia, where the economy is under pressure from Western sanctions, and posing a potentially grave security challenge for Iraq, which is already struggling to finance its fight against the Islamic State.
From Moscow to Caracas, Riyadh to Baghdad, in Tehran, Algiers, Kuwait City and Lagos, political leaders, finance ministers and central bankers have been scrambling to confront the plunge in prices -- roughly 25 percent since a peak in June -- driven by increased production in the United States and by projections of sustained cuts in demand in many developed countries, as well as decelerating growth in China.
The price drop is mostly welcome news in the developed world, and particularly in Washington. Countries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela that in recent years have sought to thwart America's influence could begin to moderate their behavior, as they come under growing financial pressure.
While Russia maintains reserves of hundreds of billions of dollars as a cushion for precisely this sort of price drop, there are already signs of tensions here.
At a meeting in Moscow this week with a government human rights council, President Vladimir V. Putin pointedly rebuffed a request for increased financing, citing the pinch from declining oil revenues.
"You know that energy prices have fallen as well as for some of our other traditional products," Mr. Putin said. "Due to that, would we not, on the contrary, reconsider the budget toward reducing some spending?"
It was a notable departure from the bravado that Mr. Putin has shown in responding to Western economic sanctions over Ukraine, dismissing them as little more than an annoyance.
In another sign of mounting pressure, a spokesman for the Russian state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, accused Saudi Arabia of secretly manipulating prices -- an echo of conspiracy theories about American and Saudi collusion against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Last week, Venezuela, which depends on oil for 95 percent of its export revenues, called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to address the steep slide in prices, a move that other members rebuffed in favor of a regular meeting next month.
The price of a barrel of Brent crude, a global benchmark, was $83.78 on Wednesday, down from about $115 per barrel since its high in June.
Experts on energy policy say that prices are nearly certain to rebound in response to normal market forces and continued strong demand, particularly in the developing world.
And some of the surplus that is dragging down oil markets is a result of production increases in Iraq and Libya, both struggling with instability that could shut down their oil fields at any time and send prices soaring.
But in the near term, the big producers will probably face budget problems in varying degrees of severity, with an array of economic, strategic and political ramifications.
"It depends how long and how sharp the decline, but if oil prices stay around 20 percent lower, that is going to be very challenging for countries that depend heavily on oil to meet their budget requirements," said Jason Bordoff, the director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York. "Many of these countries have implicitly high break-even numbers."
Professor Bordoff said that Russia and Iraq faced particularly difficult circumstances, partly because of broader geopolitical tensions in each region. Russia, already squeezed by inflation and a drastic decline in the ruble, has found its ability to borrow money severely constrained by the sanctions. Iraq is facing a costly, and potentially open-ended, military conflict against the Islamic State.
"If oil prices were to stay in the range they are in now, we'll see the Russian budget fall into deficit next year; that's on top of the economic challenges they are already facing from sanctions and the decline in the value of their currency," Professor Bordoff said. "Iraq has its own set of challenges with skyrocketing public expenditure requirements, large public payroll, food and energy subsidies. They need to rebuild a dilapidated armed forces."
Some major oil producers are already experiencing substantially more budgetary pain from the decline in prices, particularly Venezuela, because of underlying economic problems, and Iran, which has faced years of Western economic sanctions over its nuclear energy program. Nigeria faces particular political uncertainty because it has a presidential election coming up early next year.
Venezuela has limited options in responding to the price decline, which leaves less money for social spending, government payrolls and subsidized imports of vital goods. The government could scale back on subsidized oil that it supplies to allies in South America and the Caribbean, including Nicaragua, Bolivia and Cuba. There is also some talk of raising the domestic price of gasoline, which is the cheapest in the world.
In demanding urgent action by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Venezuela's foreign minister, Rafael Ramírez, has also thrown around conspiracy allegations. According to a government news release, Mr. Ramírez demanded "some kind of action to stop the fall in the price of oil, especially since we are convinced that it does not result from fundamental market conditions but that there is price manipulation to create economic problems for the large oil-producing countries."
The major question now looming is if OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, will cut production and stabilize prices at a meeting next month.
Some analysts say that is a logical step, while others suggest that Saudi Arabia may allow lower prices to persist, in part to squeeze its main rivals -- Iran and Russia -- and in part to put pressure on shale oil producers in the United States, whose higher production costs make it harder for them to compete when prices are lower abroad.
Saudi Arabia's relatively low production costs and its domestic spending program allow for a balanced budget at a price of roughly $95 a barrel, compared with $100 or more for Russia and even more for Iran. Saudi Arabia also has huge cash reserves to prop up its budget while prices remain low.
"The question is how much are you willing to eat into your cash reserves and for how long until you adjust your production down," said Gal Luft, co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, a Washington research organization focused on energy issues. "In the November meeting of OPEC you are going to see some of their members saying, 'We cannot live with those kind of prices; we are going bankrupt; we want to cut down production.'
"Then you will have others, mainly Saudi Arabia, who might say, 'Well, we don't want to overreact.' In the short run, I think most of the players can survive," Mr. Luft said. "In the long run, beyond a year, I don't think they have the means."
For the United States and most of the developed world, a decline in oil prices is generally regarded as a macroeconomic plus, reducing costs for consumers and businesses and often lifting stock markets.
That classical view has begun to change, however, as the United States has increased its own oil production, particularly in states like Texas and North Dakota.
In Russia, the Kremlin and the Central Bank have insisted that there is no cause for panic. Official projections show oil prices rebounding to about $100 a barrel over the next three years, and government officials are adamant that the country's cash reserves are sufficient to weather temporarily low prices.
In testimony before the lower house of Parliament on Monday, the head of Russia's Central Bank, Elvira S. Nabiullina, said that despite the government's confidence, the bank was assessing the risks of a severe and prolonged decline in oil prices, to $60 per barrel.
"The central bank is currently working on a so-called stress scenario, emergency scenario so to say, which includes an abrupt, more noticeable oil price fall in a forecasted time span," Ms. Nabiullina said. "Nevertheless, I think there are low chances of this."
Mr. Luft, the Washington-based analyst, said it was hard to say whether the Saudis would eventually tighten the spigots in an effort to prop up prices, as they have in the past, or pursue a strategy of preserving market share, which means keeping prices relatively low.
"From them, what matters is how much money goes through the door," he said. "They don't care how many barrels they sold or pumped, but how much money in billions goes through the door. In the end, that's what it is all about. It's about staying alive, staying in power, making sure you don't end up like Mubarak."

Full text:   During the dozen years of Michael Bloomberg's mayoralty, he became well known for at least one public-private paradox: he wasn't particularly fond of the arts, but his administration did more than any in a generation to support them in city life. Now Mr. Bloomberg's charitable organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies, is preparing to spend millions to jump-start temporary public art projects in other cities.
On Monday, the organization announced a program, "Public Art Challenge," that will give at least three cities up to a million dollars each over two years to develop art projects that "celebrate creativity, enhance urban identity, encourage public-private partnerships and drive economic development." The money will be available to any city in the United States or its territories with more than 30,000 residents and is intended to serve as a catalyst to draw broad support to projects, not to pay for them entirely.
The grants come at a time of declining public support for the arts. A report by Grantmakers in the Arts in 2013 found that, after adjusting for inflation, government funding dedicated to the arts decreased by more than 30 percent from 1992 to 2013.
In a statement, Bloomberg Philanthropies said work from "all artistic disciplines" -- including the performing arts and multimedia projects -- would be considered. Applications are due by mid-December and the grant winners will be announced next May.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   DALLAS -- The transmission of the Ebola virus to a nurse here forced the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday to reconsider its approach to containing the disease, with state and federal officials re-examining whether equipment and procedures were adequate or too loosely followed, and whether more decontamination steps are necessary when health workers leave isolation units.
"We have to rethink the way we address Ebola infection control, because even a single infection is unacceptable," Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the C.D.C., told reporters.
Health officials still do not know how the nurse, who helped treat the Ebola victim at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and wore a gown, mask and other protective gear during her interactions with him, became infected.
A team of C.D.C. officials -- reinforcements sent to Dallas in the aftermath of the second Ebola case diagnosed in the United States -- worked through the night at the hospital to identify what was described as a "large group" of health care workers who might be at risk of infection because they treated the original Ebola victim, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, at the hospital from the time he was admitted on Sept. 28 until he died last Wednesday.
And they are now watching hospital personnel as they put on and take off their protective garb, retraining the staff and evaluating the type of protective equipment being used. They were considering using cleaning products that kill the virus to spray down workers who come out of the isolation unit where the nurse is being treated.
"There are a series of things that are already implemented in the past 24 hours," Dr. Frieden said. "If this one individual was infected, and we don't know how within the isolation unit, then it is possible that other individuals could have been infected as well."
The agency's acknowledgment that substantial changes were needed came in sharp contrast to its earlier tone of confidence. On Sept. 30, Dr. Frieden had declared about Ebola: "I have no doubt that we will stop it in its tracks in the U.S." He began Monday's press briefing by saying that "stopping Ebola is hard."
The additional precautions announced Monday were part of what Dr. Frieden described as a "doubling down" on the amount of training, education and support the C.D.C. provides to Texas Health Presbyterian and other hospitals around the country.
It came as the pool of people being monitored for potential exposure to the disease appeared to more than double, from 48 to perhaps more than 100, none of whom had reported any symptoms of Ebola. All of those now being evaluated for the first time were workers at Presbyterian who cared for Mr. Duncan after he was admitted.
Though the precise number of workers remains unknown, questions were also being raised about why they had not been monitored previously.
Dr. Joseph McCormick, regional dean of the University of Texas School of Public Health in Brownsville, said he was shocked that none of those monitored by officials in recent days were the hospital workers caring for Mr. Duncan after he was put in isolation. Dr. McCormick worked for the C.D.C. in 1976, when he helped investigate the first epidemic of Ebola in Central Africa.
"You know that once this guy is really ill and he's hospitalized, there's going to be a lot of contact, manipulation of blood specimens, cleaning up if he's vomiting or if he's got diarrhea," Dr. McCormick said. "You certainly can't assume that because he's hospitalized and in this unit that everything is fine and everything that goes on will be without any risk. I mean, that's just ludicrous to think that."
The nurse -- Nina Pham, 26, a 2010 graduate of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth -- had extensive contact with Mr. Duncan after he was admitted. A person who had contact with Ms. Pham was also being monitored, although health officials said the interaction came at the onset of Ms. Pham's symptoms, meaning it was unlikely that she was infectious at the time.
Dr. Frieden acknowledged that officials "have not identified a specific problem that led to this infection," which left them operating partly in the dark.
Officials are considering imposing a requirement that workers at Presbyterian be sprayed with a disinfectant, like chlorine, after they leave an infected patient, often in a side room that is connected to the patient's room. The procedure, which is used in Africa, is rarely used in American hospitals.
"Every option is on the table at this moment," said Abbigail Tumpey, a C.D.C. spokeswoman.
Additionally, someone will be assigned to monitor health workers as they put on their protective gear and take it off, to reduce the risk that they infect themselves, for example, from fluid on gowns or gloves. And the authorities are weighing whether procedures like intubation and dialysis are worth the grave risks they pose to the medical workers who perform them. Such modern medical procedures can extend life, but are complex, and are not part of regular care in the African countries hardest hit by Ebola.
The procedures would be tested as a pilot in Dallas, Ms. Tumpey said, and those that are deemed most useful will be used to update the C.D.C.'s infection control guidance document, most likely next week. The agency would then send alerts via email and news flash updates to clinicians and hospitals. The agency does not have the authority to compel hospitals to change procedures.
The health agency has also sent new experts to Dallas, including Dr. Michael Bell, an epidemiologist who has worked on Ebola for the C.D.C., and hospital infection control experts. No decisions have been made on whether Ebola patients should be transferred to one of four specialty hospitals around the country.
State and federal health officials seemed to be, in a sense, starting over, two weeks after Mr. Duncan's diagnosis of Ebola on Sept. 30. They were now identifying, assessing and learning more about a group of health care workers they had largely ignored, to the point that they spent more than 24 hours simply trying to identify who they were.
Dr. Frieden described the process as casting the net wider, but on Monday did not address whether he thought officials had made a mistake in not monitoring all the hospital workers initially.
Dr. Robert L. Murphy, director of the Center for Global Health at Northwestern University, said the missteps in Texas underscored the need to create a national "Ebola czar" with centralized authority to respond to the crisis, an idea proposed Sunday by Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican.
Dr. Murphy said that the American public health system is a "state-oriented" one, in which state public health departments have the primary responsibility for fighting the outbreak of an infectious disease like Ebola. The C.D.C., he said, acts as "a central clearinghouse and a reference center, and can provide guidelines and recommendations and assist the states in implementing these policies. But it's strictly up to the states as to whether they follow those guidelines or not."
Dr. Frieden and other officials briefed President Obama in the Oval Office on the latest in the Ebola situation, aides said. Mr. Obama met with Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services; Susan Rice, his national security adviser; Dr. Frieden; and Lisa Monaco, the president's homeland security adviser.
As health officials struggle to contain the disease in Texas, the political fight in Washington over funding levels for public health agencies -- and whether reductions have left the country unprepared for a public-health crisis -- has reached a fever pitch.
The C.D.C.'s overall budget of $6.8 billion in the 2014 fiscal year was roughly similar to what it was four years earlier -- a substantial cut, when one factors in inflation, said Sherri Berger, the agency's chief operating officer. The National Institutes of Health saw its budget decrease to $30.1 billion in the 2014 fiscal year from $31.2 billion in the 2010 fiscal year.
The worry over Ebola spread to Kansas City, Kan., where a medic who had worked on a boat along the African coast showed up at the University of Kansas Hospital saying he had previously had a high fever. The man, in his 40s, was isolated in an infectious-disease unit, was undergoing tests and was considered a low to moderate risk for Ebola, said Dr. Lee Norman, the hospital's chief medical officer.
Concern was also evident in Louisiana, where a state judge granted the state attorney general, Buddy Caldwell, a temporary restraining order on Monday blocking the dumping of Mr. Duncan's incinerated personal items in a hazardous-waste landfill in Calcasieu Parish.
According to the C.D.C., Ebola-associated waste that has been properly incinerated is not considered infectious. But Mr. Caldwell, a Republican, said in a statement Monday that Louisianans "just can't afford to take any risks when it comes to this deadly virus." In his petition before the court, Mr. Caldwell said that the agencies in his state that regulate medical waste learned about its coming to Louisiana from news media reports, and that no permits for the transportation of the waste had been applied for.

Abstract: More often, debt relief takes place implicitly, through "financial repression": government policies hold interest rates down, while inflation erodes the real value of debt. In Europe, austerity policies have been driven less by economic analysis than by Germany's moral indignation over the notion that irresponsible borrowers might not face the full consequences of their actions.\n

Full text:   Stop me if you've heard this before: The world economy appears to be stumbling. For a while, things seemed to be looking up, and there was talk about green shoots of recovery. But now growth is stalling, and the specter of deflation looms.
If this story sounds familiar, it should; it has played out repeatedly since 2008. As in previous episodes, the worst news is coming from Europe, but this time there is also a clear slowdown in emerging markets -- and there are even warning signs in the United States, despite pretty good job growth at the moment.
Why does this keep happening? After all, the events that brought on the Great Recession -- the housing bust, the banking crisis -- took place a long time ago. Why can't we escape their legacy?
The proximate answer lies in a series of policy mistakes: Austerity when economies needed stimulus, paranoia about inflation when the real risk is deflation, and so on. But why do governments keep making these mistakes? In particular, why do they keep making the same mistakes, year after year?
The answer, I'd suggest, is an excess of virtue. Righteousness is killing the world economy.
What, after all, is our fundamental economic problem? A simplified but broadly correct account of what went wrong goes like this: In the years leading up to the Great Recession, we had an explosion of credit (mainly to the private sector). Old notions of prudence, for both lenders and borrowers, were cast aside; debt levels that would once have been considered deeply unsound became the norm.
Then the music stopped, the money stopped flowing, and everyone began trying to "deleverage," to reduce the level of debt. For each individual, this was prudent. But my spending is your income and your spending is my income, so when everyone tries to pay down debt at the same time, you get a depressed economy.
So what can be done? Historically, the solution to high levels of debt has often involved writing off and forgiving much of that debt. Sometimes this happens explicitly: In the 1930s F.D.R. helped borrowers refinance with much cheaper mortgages, while in this crisis Iceland is outright canceling a significant part of the debt households ran up during the bubble years. More often, debt relief takes place implicitly, through "financial repression": government policies hold interest rates down, while inflation erodes the real value of debt.
What's striking about the past few years, however, is how little debt relief has actually taken place. Yes, there's Iceland -- but it's tiny. Yes, Greek creditors took a significant "haircut" -- but Greece is still a small player (and still hopelessly in debt). In major economies, very few debtors have received a break. And far from being inflated away, the burden of debt has been aggravated by falling inflation, which is running well below target in America and near zero in Europe.
Why are debtors receiving so little relief? As I said, it's about righteousness -- the sense that any kind of debt forgiveness would involve rewarding bad behavior. In America, the famous Rick Santelli rant that gave birth to the Tea Party wasn't about taxes or spending -- it was a furious denunciation of proposals to help troubled homeowners. In Europe, austerity policies have been driven less by economic analysis than by Germany's moral indignation over the notion that irresponsible borrowers might not face the full consequences of their actions.
So the policy response to a crisis of excessive debt has, in effect, been a demand that debtors pay off their debts in full. What does history say about that strategy? That's easy: It doesn't work. Whatever progress debtors make through suffering and saving is more than offset through depression and deflation. That is, for example, what happened to Britain after World War I, when it tried to pay off its debt with huge budget surpluses while returning to the gold standard: Despite years of sacrifice, it made almost no progress in bringing down the ratio of debt to G.D.P.
And that's what is happening now. A recent comprehensive report on debt is titled "Deleveraging, what deleveraging?"; despite private cutbacks and public austerity, debt levels are rising thanks to poor economic performance. And we are arguably no closer to escaping our debt trap than we were five years ago.
But it has been very hard to get either the policy elite or the public to understand that sometimes debt relief is in everyone's interest. Instead, the response to poor economic performance has essentially been that the beatings will continue until morale improves.
Maybe, just maybe, bad news -- say, a recession in Germany -- will finally bring an end to this destructive reign of virtue. But don't count on it.

Abstract: The chairman of United Shipbuilding at the time was Igor Sechin, one of Putin's closest associates and the head of Rosneft, the state oil company. Just a few days ago, the Russian Parliament began the process of passing a law that would allow the government to seize assets owned by foreign companies -- and use them to reimburse oligarchs and others who have been financially hurt by the sanctions.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDA few days ago, The Financial Times published an interview with a Russian businessman named Sergei Pugachev. Once an ally of President Vladimir Putin, Pugachev owned shipbuilding and construction interests, as well as a bank. Indeed, he was once known as "the Kremlin's banker." But his bank collapsed a few years ago, and, in 2012, the government seized his two shipyards. Jointly valued at $3.5 billion by the accounting firm of BDO, they were sold to a competitor, the United Shipbuilding Corporation, for $422.5 million, according to the paper.
The chairman of United Shipbuilding at the time was Igor Sechin, one of Putin's closest associates and the head of Rosneft, the state oil company. Russian businessmen, Pugachev complained to The Financial Times, had become nothing more than "serfs" in Russia. "Today in Russia, there is no private property," he added. "There are only serfs who belong to Putin."
And so it goes in Putin's Russia.
I had been making inquiries, hoping to find out whether the sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe in the wake of Russia's takeover of Crimea were working. The answer, I believe, is yes, but not necessarily in the way you'd think.
The first point to make is that the Russian economy has been in a downturn ever since Putin returned to power in May 2012. In recent months, that slide accelerated. Economic growth has flat-lined. The ruble is in free fall. Inflation is rising. More than $100 billion of capital is expected to flee the country this year. Most ominous of all, the price of oil -- Russia's primary asset, upon which the government depends to finance itself -- has been dropping.
Although the mounting problems have been coincident with the sanctions, it is impossible to say for sure whether there is a direct correlation. (One thing that is making a difference, I should note, is the boom in American oil and gas, which has produced a glut of fossil fuel and has helped depress prices.) The direct effect will more likely be felt in the near future, when, for instance, Russian companies have to refinance their debt despite being locked out of Western capital markets.
What the sanctions have done, though, is bring out the worst tendencies of Putin and his close associates, putting them on display for all to see. The rule of law has long been a fiction in Russia, but, for years, Western businessmen -- and Russian businessmen as well -- made excuses. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former oligarch who spent 10 years in the Russian prison system, had foolishly decided to take Putin on politically, they would say.
But since the sanctions have been put in place, McDonald's restaurants, which had never had any problems before in Russia, are suddenly being closely inspected and a handful shut down. Other Western companies are having similar troubles.
Or take the case of Vladimir Yevtushenkov, a Russian billionaire who ran Sistema, a big conglomerate. One of Sistema's assets was Bashneft, Russia's sixth-largest oil company by output. Last month, Yevtushenkov was placed under house arrest, accused of money laundering. After a court hearing, his shares in Bashneft were seized by the government.
Yevtushenkov was not politically active like Khodorkovsky. He was no threat to Putin. But it is widely believed that Bashneft's assets will eventually find their way to Sechin and become part of Rosneft. Rosneft had asked the government for a $40 billion bailout to help it withstand Western sanctions; handing it cheap assets is certainly one way to help.
"Rule No. 1 for Putin is that his people will be protected, and he is signaling that," said Karen Dawisha, a Russia expert at Miami University of Ohio and the author of a new book, "Putin's Kleptocracy." "They have started to dip into the pension funds. There are double-digit cuts in the health budget. His people will always be served before the people."
In imposing the sanctions, the Obama administration and its counterparts in Europe have targeted precisely the men and the companies that are closest to Putin. By reacting the way he has, Putin is scaring away not just foreign investors but Russian businessmen as well. Not that he seems to care.
Just a few days ago, the Russian Parliament began the process of passing a law that would allow the government to seize assets owned by foreign companies -- and use them to reimburse oligarchs and others who have been financially hurt by the sanctions. They are calling it the "Rotenberg villa law," named for Arkady Rotenberg, an oligarch who had four luxury villas in Italy frozen because of the sanctions. This is such a foolishly counterproductive measure that even some inside the government protested it. Nonetheless, it will almost surely pass.
Thus, in the face of sanctions, does Russia cut off its nose to spite its face.
Correction: October 18, 2014, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this column incorrectly described the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. His 10-year imprisonment took place in the Russian prison system, not a Soviet penal colony. Khodorkovsky spent time in several prisons in Russia; the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.

Full text:   Financial markets have been priced for perfection. And this week, the world economy looked far from perfect.
That was the unnerving reality behind a whipsaw week on Wall Street that caused dramatic swings in the global markets for stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities like oil. The pattern continued on Friday with a 1.2 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, with all the losses concentrated in the last two hours of the trading day.
The overall results for the week were hardly disastrous: The S.&P. closed the week down only 3.1 percent, and it is still up for the year. Oil prices closed the week at a four-year low, which, if anything, should prove welcome news for American consumers. A measure of how much stock market volatility investors expect in the future is still below its January level.
But the week's zigs and zags were a reminder that, after several years of strong gains, the prices for stocks and a wide range of other assets, like junk bonds and commercial real estate, are at the high end of their historical levels, relative to fundamentals. Those valuations will prove justified only as long as the global economy continues to improve steadily. And the week was filled with suggestions that such may not be the case, especially outside the United States.
Evidence that the global economy may be unexpectedly stalling has jarred prominent economists and policy makers gathered in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. At a conference on Thursday, Lawrence H. Summers, the former United States Treasury secretary who now teaches at Harvard, highlighted this concern.
"The defining challenge of our time, economically, is secular stagnation," he said. "It is the risk of inadequate growth, leading to inadequate potential, leading to inadequate growth."
Perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of the turbulence in the markets is that it was not driven by some single piece of surprising news, but rather by a slow gathering of evidence that the global economic outlook was gloomier than it had seemed.
The International Monetary Fund this week marked down its forecast for economic growth and said there was an increased chance of a European recession over the next year. The fund sharply lowered its projection for 2014 economic growth in Japan, the world's third-largest economy, from July's estimate. And German industrial production fell 4 percent in August, the biggest monthly drop in five years, according to data released this week.
"When you get such subpar growth, it doesn't take much to push individual economies -- and the global economy -- back into a downturn," said Stephen S. Roach of Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. "That's what investors are grappling with right now."
The situation that seems to concern investors the most is the threat of deflation -- falling prices -- which central banks are still struggling to avert after years of extraordinary efforts to grease the wheels of global commerce. While many of the headlines this week focused on the ups and downs of the stock market, the real action was in a wide range of indicators that pointed to falling prices and weakening demand.
On commodity markets, the selling was furious for much of the week. Oil is now 19 percent cheaper than on June 30 and corn is down 35 percent since the spring. United States Treasury bonds now yield a mere 2.3 percent, down from 3 percent at the start of the year -- even though the Federal Reserve is winding down its program of buying trillions of dollars in bonds and intends to raise interest rates next year.
Based on bond prices, investors now expect inflation in the United States of only 1.6 percent annually over the next five years; German inflation is now priced in at only 0.4 percent. Both are well below the target of about 2 percent that central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic aim for.
It is a reversal of the problems that have haunted the world economy over decades past.
After years of economic policy focused on ensuring that inflation and budget deficits did not become too high, now policy makers are grappling with a situation in which they are at risk of becoming too low.
Central banks, after years of ultralow interest rates, are finding themselves with limited tools to do much to encourage higher inflation. This week, the leaders of both the International Monetary Fund and of the European Central Bank -- known for their commitment to fiscal caution -- encouraged Germany and other countries with the room to do so to spend more money to help encourage growth.
In part thanks to the efforts of the global central banks, prices for stocks and other financial assets have been on an upward tear for more than five years, with the S.&P. 500 index up 182 percent since March 2009. But valuations of many assets are now relatively high, even as the global economy remains somewhat shaky.
Further economic weakening could prompt more slides in the stock and bond markets, which in turn could undermine economic confidence at a fragile time. And investors may be all the more jittery after riding the markets to giddy heights. Some financial experts have long argued that aggressive monetary stimulus has done a lot to drive securities markets higher but that its has not induced robust growth in the real economy.
A pressing question is whether the American stock market and its economy can remain insulated if other parts of the world stall badly. Many economists contend that, in theory, there is enough strength within the United States to sustain the recovery.
Falling oil prices, while they contribute to the deflationary force in the global economy, give American consumers more money to spend elsewhere. On Friday, the national average price for regular gasoline was $3.24, eight cents lower than a week ago and 19 cents lower than a month ago. A year ago, the price was $3.35.
"It's been a wild two weeks for oil prices, that's for sure," said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at GasBuddy.com. "We have nearly 20,000 stations in the nation now selling gasoline for $3 a gallon or less. We are looking at billions of dollars of savings for consumers compared to last year."
This is not the first time in the last few years that sluggishness in Europe and Japan has weighed on global growth. In the recent past, European and Japanese policy makers have done just enough to avoid a steep decline in economic activity -- and they appear ready to continue, or even step up, their stimulus policies. The European Central Bank, for instance, has started two programs that are intended to increase bank lending.
Even so, some investors fear that Europe and Japan may yet act too slowly -- or may simply fail to do enough. "I am making the heroic assumption that people there are smart enough and responsible enough to do the right thing," Philip J. Orlando, a senior portfolio manager at Federated, a mutual fund firm, said. "But clearly that is a heroic assumption."

Full text:   As evidence grows that the German economy, the largest in Europe, is beginning to stall, Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed a growing willingness on Thursday to use government spending to stimulate growth, a possible shift in position that could ripple across the entire eurozone.
Ms. Merkel's new tack, signaled in a Berlin news conference, may be partly a response to increasingly clamorous criticism from the International Monetary Fund, independent economists and fellow Europeans that her longstanding emphasis on balancing the federal budget needs to give way to pumping more money into the lethargic German economy.
If Germany in fact gives itself a bit more spending latitude, it would no doubt fuel the demands from its eurozone neighbors, most notably France, to have more budgetary flexibility to stimulate their own economies.
Mainly, though, its neighbors are counting on Germany to lead by example.
As the biggest economy in the 18-member eurozone and the one that in recent years was growing enough to at least partly offset economic softness elsewhere in the region, Germany drives demand in the bloc. Other countries in the region have watched with growing alarm as indicators have suggested that the standard-bearer might be stumbling. International economists have repeatedly called for Germany to stop worrying about balancing its budget and instead invest in economic stimulus.
On Thursday, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said in effect that eurozone countries that have enough money should spend it -- a clear reference to Germany.
"For governments that have fiscal space, then of course it makes sense to use it," Mr. Draghi said during an appearance at the Brookings Institution in Washington. He drew laughter when he added, "You decide to which country this sentence applies."
His comments echoed remarks this week from Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund.
Discouraging data in recent days, as well as a warning on Thursday by the nation's leading economic institutes that German growth was slowing, also seem to have increased Ms. Merkel's willingness to listen to the advice of Mr. Draghi and Ms. Lagarde.
Faced with what she acknowledged were "somewhat worsened" forecasts for the German economy, Ms. Merkel said her government was examining how to encourage investment, particularly in the "digital sphere" and the energy sector.
Ms. Merkel did not elaborate, but she could have been referring to ways the government could encourage more Internet start-ups. Germany, like Europe in general, has never produced anywhere near as much digital innovation as the United States or South Korea.
The reference to energy suggested a new push to Germany's program to abandon nuclear power and expand renewable energy sources. It might be a recognition, too, that lower energy costs in the United States have been luring away investment by German companies. While energy prices in Europe have fallen recently, the region is highly dependent on imported gas and oil, often from countries like Russia or in the Middle East that are unstable partners.
The German national statistics office said on Thursday that exports slumped 5.8 percent in August compared with July, more than expected. It was the sharpest drop since 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. And it was the latest in a series of indications that Germany's export-driven economy was losing momentum, in part because the conflict in Ukraine has made businesses cautious and unwilling to invest.
American policy makers and economists increasingly are worried that Europe's economic problems will weigh on domestic growth by reducing demand for exports from the United States and by suppressing price inflation.
Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Thursday that the Fed was watching closely, but it was premature to consider policy adjustments.
"We have to take into account the impact on aggregate demand," Mr. Fischer said at the Brookings Institution, where he shared the stage with Mr. Draghi. "We'll be judging what's happening to output and inflation, and acting on that basis."
In Berlin, Ms. Merkel said her government, a grand coalition of the political center-right and center-left, had discussed the economy at a meeting late on Tuesday.
"This course we will now pursue very decisively, and also discuss within Europe," she added, apparently referring to a meeting of European Union leaders later this month in Brussels.
Ms. Merkel's remarks may have been less a declaration of policy change than a signal that her thinking on stimulus was evolving.
Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, speaking in Washington on Thursday, insisted that "writing checks" was no way for the eurozone to increase growth, according to Reuters. Mr. Schäuble urged France and Italy to do more to overhaul their economies instead.
His statement could indicate that Germany's willingness to deploy fiscal stimulus might depend on whether its eurozone partners did their part by deregulating their labor markets and making other politically painful changes to encourage entrepreneurship.
It is clear in any case that the debate in Europe has shifted away from single-minded emphasis on budgetary austerity. Mr. Draghi has also become increasingly frank in expressing the European Central Bank's determination to use all the powers at its disposal to reverse a slide in inflation to levels considered dangerously low.
In his remarks in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Draghi said he was optimistic that eurozone political leaders would undertake difficult economic changes, because their survival depended on it.
"It seems to me that now all of these governments have a very powerful incentive to do the right things," he said. "And that is: If they don't do the right things, they will disappear forever from the political scene because they will not be re-elected."
Ms. Merkel's remarks in Berlin came after four of Germany's most respected economic institutes revised their projections for growth sharply downward. Gross domestic product this year is expected to expand 1.3 percent, compared with a forecast of 1.9 percent six months ago, the institutes said in a joint statement. Next year, growth is forecast at 1.2 percent instead of a previous 2 percent, they added. Along the way, they predicted, the German economy will show zero growth for the current quarter and will barely eke out 0.1 percent growth in the fourth quarter.
Separately, some economists are predicting a quarter or two of contraction before German growth resumes.
German leaders have faced criticism for their obsession with reducing the budget deficit at a time when the country is able to borrow money at record low rates, and when roads, bridges and university campuses are deteriorating. At times, German bonds have carried negative interest rates, meaning investors are effectively willing to pay the government to keep their money safe.
Ms. Merkel and Mr. Schäuble have a habit of hinting at policy shifts almost in asides before announcing action. The chancellor's remarks on Thursday came in response to a question about economic prospects, at a news conference with the new prime minister of Poland, Ewa Kopacz.

Full text:   Large parts of the world seem to be on the verge of a recession. In many countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America, economic growth has already stalled.
Yet many finance ministers and central bankers who are meeting in Washington this week are unwilling or ill prepared to respond. In Europe, for example, officials from Germany continue to insist that countries that use the euro meet restrictive fiscal rules, and they are trying to prevent the European Central Bank from buying government bonds. Officials in Japan, meanwhile, have hurt that economy by raising a sales tax too fast.
Some countries, including the United States and Britain, are growing modestly, for now. But even these economies are not enjoying the kind of robust recovery that creates millions of jobs for the unemployed. And growth in the United States and Britain could slow down, too, if a lot of their major trading partners in Europe and Asia fall into a recession.
The International Monetary Fund said this week that the world economy, much of which never fully recovered from the financial crisis, would grow at 3.3 percent in 2014, down from its April forecast of 3.7 percent. There is now a 38 percent chance of a recession in the 18-country euro area in the next year, the fund estimates.
There is a lot governments and central banks could do to avoid another recession. For example, a recent I.M.F. report showed that increasing government spending on public investments like roads, ports and railways can help stimulate the economy immediately and for several more years. If done right, such spending could generate benefits that more than offset the costs, particularly in developing nations like Brazil and India, which suffer from high inflation in part because of the high cost of transporting food and other goods on traffic-clogged roads.
In Europe, German officials need to play a more constructive role by encouraging the European Central Bank to buy government bonds to pump money into the economy and lower interest rates. Such policies are certainly in Germany's self-interest, because its economy, which previously bucked the downtrend in the rest of the eurozone, contracted in the second quarter and remains weak.
Other European countries, like Italy and Spain, need to do more to encourage companies to invest and create jobs, in part by reforming laws that make it hard for entrepreneurs to set up new businesses.
Earlier this year, the International Labor Organization estimated that there were 202 million unemployed people in the world in 2013, up five million from 2012. The I.L.O. forecasts that the number will grow to more than 215 million by 2018 if political leaders and central bankers keep failing to revive their economies.

Abstract: Few women are on the list of doctors paid the most money by drug and medical device companies last year, according to a ProPublica analysis of new data released by the federal government. While current medical school classes are close to evenly split between male and female students (men still have a slight edge), many subspecialties are still dominated by men, as are the leadership ranks of medicine.

Full text:   Few women are on the list of doctors paid the most money by drug and medical device companies last year, according to a ProPublica analysis of new data released by the federal government.
More than 90 percent of the 300 doctors who collected the most money for speaking and consulting are men, based on information from the new government database, called Open Payments. By comparison, men accounted for about 68 percent of active physicians in the United States in 2012, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
What we found adds to a growing body of evidence that male and female doctors are paid differently and may in fact practice medicine differently, though the reasons for the discrepancy are not completely clear. It's possible that men are more willing to accept payments from drug companies than women. It's possible that drug companies are more likely to make offers to male doctors. Or it's possible that male doctors are simply much more likely to be in the senior positions or medical specialties that appeal to drug companies.
But even in primary care fields, men dominated the list of the 300 highest-paid speakers and consultants in Open Payments. Of the 91 internists, just 12 percent were women. Nationally, women made up 34 percent of internists in 2010. There were five obstetrician-gynecologists on the list; all were men.
There are plenty of caveats regarding the new federal data. It covers only the last five months of 2013, and more than one-third of speaking and consulting payments are missing the names of those who received them. (The government redacted the names, citing data inconsistencies.)
That said, the broad finding is consistent with Dollars for Docs, ProPublica's online search tool that reflects payments made by 17 drug companies over four years. The overwhelming majority of large payments for speaking and consulting went to men. In an analysis we performed last year, 21 of the 22 doctors who earned more than $500,000 in speaking and consulting fees were men.
The federal data set covers all drug and device companies -- more than 1,000 in all.
The data doesn't explain why the gender disparity exists. While current medical school classes are close to evenly split between male and female students (men still have a slight edge), many subspecialties are still dominated by men, as are the leadership ranks of medicine.
"I don't perceive any gender bias from my colleagues, the people I work with," said Alison Tendler, a South Dakota ophthalmologist who was among the top-paid women, primarily because she serves as the TV advertising spokeswoman for the eye drug Restasis, made by Allergan.
"I do feel that we can be potentially overlooked from an industry standpoint for being leaders and innovators in our likely professions," Dr. Tendler said. "I'm not sure if they perceive us as not as assertive. I'm not sure why."
Dr. Tendler said she sees a gender divide, although not in her interactions with Allergen. "In general, you have to raise your hand a little higher," she said.
Some of the other female doctors on the top-paid list are well-known academics and researchers. Nesli Basgoz, a leader at Massachusetts General Hospital, is on the board of directors of the drugmaker Actavis and was on the board of Forest Labs, which Actavis acquired this year. Alessia Fornoni is the director of the Peggy and Harold Katz Family Drug Discovery Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.
Dr. Basgoz could not be reached for comment. The Miller School of Medicine declined to comment on Dr. Fornoni's behalf.
What's clear from research is that women in medicine earn less than men. A study last year in JAMA Internal Medicine found that the median earnings of male physicians exceeded those of female ones by more than $56,000 between 2006 and 2010, a bigger gap than in prior years, even after factoring in inflation. The data was adjusted for hours worked and for years of experience, but not for physician specialty. Some specialties, like dermatology or orthopedic surgery, pay better than general practice.
A 2011 report in the journal Health Affairs also found a gender disparity among doctors who recently completed their residency training programs. It persisted even after taking into account doctors' choice of specialty.
Gender differences were once again on display in data released earlier this year on Medicare's payments to physicians. An analysis by the website Nerd Wallet found that men, on average, were paid 88 percent more than women in Medicare reimbursements in 2012. Men saw more Medicare patients, performed more services per patient, and were paid more money per patient. This gap persisted within specialties in which women have a larger presence, including obstetrics and gynecology.
Roberta Gebhard, national secretary of the American Medical Women's Association and chairwoman of its gender equity task force, said the dearth of women among the industry's top-paid list was "not a surprise."
"In my experience, women are less likely to be in the specialty that's going to be tapped," she said. "They're less likely to be asked if they're in that specialty. And then if they are asked, they are less likely to accept" payments from drug and device makers. Dr. Gebhard said her female colleagues don't want to be unduly influenced by such relationships.
Anthony T. Lo Sasso, a professor of public health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was the lead author on the 2011 Health Affairs article. He said women have tended to work in primary care fields, such as internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics-gynecology, which provide fewer opportunities for consulting and speaking work.
In 2010, for example, women made up just 4 percent of orthopedic surgeons in the United States. (Thirty-nine male orthopedic surgeons -- and no women -- were among the 300 top speakers and consultants.)
"The notion that women physicians may be willing to trade off some income for greater flexibility" to improve the work-life balance may be a consideration, he said. Consulting and speaking engagements take even more time after work hours. "If they're willing to forgo some salary in order to get some predictability and to balance work and nonwork life, it wouldn't necessarily be surprising to see them not take up these additional consulting gigs," he said.
Anupam B. Jena, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the proliferation of data on gender disparities among physicians was ripe for further study. Dr. Jena, an author of the 2013 JAMA Internal Medicine report, suggested that physicians' ages and specialization would reduce the extent of the disparity in the Open Payments data, but may not eliminate it entirely.
"I wouldn't be surprised to see that even when you adjust for all these things, you still see more payments going to men than to women," he said.

Full text:   Federal Reserve officials are looking for a new way to reassure investors that they are not ready to start raising interest rates, according to an account of the most recent meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee released on Wednesday.
The Fed, pleased that the economy is improving and more Americans are finding jobs, plans to finish its latest bond-buying campaign at the end of October. But most officials at the September meeting said that they were far from satisfied with the economy's progress. And the account said some officials expressed concern that the slow growth of other major economies would start to weigh on the United States.
The Fed sees a need to replace its guidance that it plans to keep short-term rates near zero for a "considerable time" after the end of its bond-buying campaign. The account suggests that officials are trying to find a new way to say the same thing. Most officials want to preserve the general perception that a first increase is most likely around the middle of the year. But they also are going out of their way to emphasize that the timing could change if job growth either exceeds or disappoints their expectations.
"The consensus view is that liftoff will take place around the middle of next year," William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the influential vice chairman of the Fed's policy-making committee, said on Tuesday. "That seems like a reasonable view to me. But, again, it is just a forecast. What we do will depend on the flow of economic news and how that affects the economic outlook."
Investors appeared to welcome the cautious tone. Stocks rose sharply after the Fed released the account at 2 p.m. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,968.89, up 1.8 percent for the day. The interest rate on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell to its lowest level in more than a year, closing at 2.32 percent.
The account, along with speeches by Fed officials in the three weeks since the meeting, show that the central bank is playing for time as it seeks greater clarity about the economy. Patience has become the Fed's new watchword.
Job growth has been relatively strong this year, and the unemployment rate is fast falling toward what the Fed regards as a normal level. The economy added 248,000 jobs in September as the unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent. But inflation has been relatively weak. That's a problem in its own right; moderate inflation would encourage borrowing and spending and facilitates economic adjustments. The absence of wage inflation also suggests that the labor market is still slack and that most workers have little leverage to demand higher pay.
The growth of other large economies is also lagging that of the United States, and some of those countries are pushing to devalue their currencies. Some Fed officials at the meeting expressed concerns these trends could undercut exporters and further suppress inflation. The Fed's staff reported it did not expect inflation to rise to the Fed's preferred 2 percent annual pace within the next several years.
"Some participants expressed concern that the persistent shortfall of economic growth and inflation in the euro area could lead to a further appreciation of the dollar and have adverse effects on the U.S. external sector," the account said. "Several participants added that slower economic growth in China or Japan or unanticipated events in the Middle East or Ukraine might pose a similar risk."
Most officials also agreed that problems in the labor market remain "significant," citing the depressed rate of labor force participation and the unusually large proportion of part-time workers, along with the low rate of wage inflation.
The Fed appears to be moving closer to dropping its "considerable time" language, which is widely interpreted as meaning at least six months; most officials at the September meeting said they wanted to eliminate any reference to a timeline, and instead describe the decision as dependent on progress in increasing employment and raising the sluggish pace of inflation.
This steady course has frustrated Fed officials who say the Fed should retreat more quickly, two of whom dissented at the committee's September meeting.
More recently, however, frustrations have appeared greatest among the group of Fed officials who worry the central bank may retreat too soon. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said on Tuesday that if the economy maintained its present trajectory, it would be "inappropriate" to raise rates at any point during 2015. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, spoke in the same key on Wednesday, warning that, "I believe that the biggest risk we face today is prematurely engineering restrictive monetary conditions."
An important unknown is the extent of slack remaining in the labor market. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her supporters appear inclined to wait in the hopes that the data will help clarify the issue. Historically, wages and prices start to rise as the unemployment rate falls below 6 percent, as it has now done. If inflation instead remains sluggish, that would suggest a need for maintaining the Fed's stimulus.
The willingness to wait is fortified by a sense that the risk of pulling back too soon, and leaving people without jobs, is greater than the risk of pressing too hard even if that means pushing inflation temporarily past the optimal level.
Furthermore, Mr. Dudley said on Tuesday that he saw relatively little chance that economic growth would accelerate. The economy may be improving, but even the best case remains disappointing.

Abstract: [...]the college graduation rates of America's young are growing at nearly the slowest pace in the industrial world, the third from the bottom among 30 nations tracked by the O.E.C.D. In 2012, 44 percent of 25- to 34-year-old Americans had a college degree, whether from a community college or an ivy league university, 6 percentage points more than in 2000. According to O.E.C.D. data, socioeconomic status has a bigger impact on college attainment in the United States than in most nations at a similar level of development. Scholars working at Harvard, the University of California, Berkeley and the National Bureau for Economic Research found that a student with a degree in business from an online-only college, the fastest-growing segment of the for-profit sector, was 22 percent less likely to receive a callback from a prospective employer than one with a similar degree from a community college.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDIn 1987, when he was Ronald Reagan's education secretary, the conservative culture warrior William J. Bennett wrote a famous essay denouncing federal aid for higher education because it allowed colleges "blithely to raise their tuitions," at little benefit to students.
Nearly two decades later, it seems, he was broadly right. Indeed, he didn't know the half of it.
It's not just that many colleges and universities are bleeding taxpayers. The government's overall strategy to subsidize higher education is failing at its core task: providing less privileged Americans with a real shot at a college degree. Alarmingly, it is burdening low-income students with risks they cannot bear and steering them into low-quality educations.
"Institutions of higher education in the United States extract a lot of money without delivering value but the government has no way of influencing that," said Andreas Schleicher, the top education expert at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the research organization for the world's major industrial powers. "It has very few levers of control over equity-related issues."
Take the "Bennett hypothesis." There are many studies suggesting that a lot of colleges pocket part of the aid via higher tuition. Among the most recent studies, Lesley J. Turner of the University of Maryland finds that every additional dollar of Pell Grant money -- the main federal aid program -- leads to a 17-cent cut in institutional aid, on average.
But the most problematic analysis comes in research by Claudia Goldin of Harvard and Stephanie Riegg Cellini of George Washington University, who looked into the most controversial corner of higher education: private, for-profit colleges, which today receive nearly a quarter of all federal aid for higher education.
They found that for-profits that get federal subsidies charge, on average, 78 percent more than for-profit institutions that are not eligible for aid. The price difference is almost identical to the value of the subsidy. "It's hard not to infer that federal student aid system is kind of allowing that to happen," Professor Cellini told me.
The United States shares two dubious distinctions. It has the most expensive higher education in the world: $26,000 a year, on average. And the college graduation rates of America's young are growing at nearly the slowest pace in the industrial world, the third from the bottom among 30 nations tracked by the O.E.C.D.
In 2012, 44 percent of 25- to 34-year-old Americans had a college degree, whether from a community college or an ivy league university, 6 percentage points more than in 2000. By contrast, the college graduation rate of young Britons rose by 19 percentage points over the period, to 49 percent. In the O.E.C.D. as a whole it increased to 40 percent, 14 percentage points more than in 2000.
Poor youths are the ones being left out. According to O.E.C.D. data, socioeconomic status has a bigger impact on college attainment in the United States than in most nations at a similar level of development. College enrollment after the first year is five times as high for high-income students as for low-income youths, studies show.
Low-income students in the United States often end up with the short straw: no degree, no job and a bundle of debt that they must pay anyway.
American underperformance reflects underlying inequities that are deeper than in any other rich country. But what is even more disturbing is that government support sometimes contributes to the nation's educational disparities.
Consider, again, for-profit colleges. There are legitimate arguments in their favor, including the fact that they are the only part of higher education that is growing to meet the rising demand from low-income Americans. They also can be nimbler than public schools, able to develop new curriculums quickly to adapt to changes in the job market.
Still many for-profits provide a less valuable education. Scholars working at Harvard, the University of California, Berkeley and the National Bureau for Economic Research found that a student with a degree in business from an online-only college, the fastest-growing segment of the for-profit sector, was 22 percent less likely to receive a callback from a prospective employer than one with a similar degree from a community college.
And they are more expensive. Professor Cellini calculated that while community college costs taxpayers $11,400 a year per student, almost $4,000 more than a for-profit college, for-profits cost students much more: $51,600 a year in tuition, forgone earnings and loan interest, almost $20,000 more than community colleges.
"Some for-profits provide value for students," Professor Cellini told me. "But on average they are slightly worse than community college in terms of earnings after graduation and they are way more expensive." Given this, she said, "Why would you go?"
The bigger question is why the American government finances them, even as public education is shriveling from a lack of cash.
State and local financing for public higher education fell to some $76 billion last year, nearly 10 percent less than in 2003 after inflation. On a per-student basis it is 30 percent less than it was a decade ago.
But that doesn't mean there is less government money in the system. Federal aid to college students more than doubled over the period, to some $172 billion last year. Of that, nearly 25 percent went to private, for-profit colleges.
There are better ways to finance higher education. In Norway, where the state picks up the bill and students pay no tuition, 44 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds have a degree from a four-year college, compared to 34 percent of Americans.
But the United States needn't become Scandinavian. British universities also charge fairly high tuition, but Britain manages to provide universal public funding while avoiding many of the pitfalls of the American system of college finance.
Like the United States, Britain relies heavily on loans, available to every college-bound student. That is where the similarities end. The British government imposes tight quality controls to ensure higher education is up to scratch. What's more, graduates pay back only what they can afford: 9 percent of their annual earnings over £21,000 ($34,000). Any unpaid balance is forgiven after 30 years.
Most controversially, the government controls prices: Tuition can be no more than £9,000 ($15,000). The government will directly finance the extra costs of expensive careers like engineering or medicine. But colleges can charge no more.
The Obama administration is moving, timidly, in this direction, introducing income-contingent loans to the federal aid portfolio. But there is a long way to go.
The argument is not, as Mr. Bennett might have had it in 1987, that federal aid should be pared back or eliminated. The case for government financing of college is as strong as ever.
A college education is not only immensely valuable to graduates, it produces huge value to the rest of society.
But the way we subsidize college today, we are wasting both money and opportunity.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund, showing heightened concern over a slowing world economy, said on Tuesday that cash-rich countries like Germany needed to step up large public investments to help keep the flagging global recovery on track.
The comments -- from the fund's managing director and its lead economist -- reflect growing concerns within the I.M.F. that Germany, which recently passed China as the country with the largest trade surplus in the world, is not doing enough to spur growth in Europe.
At a news conference at the start of its semiannual meeting, an event that attracts financiers, policy makers and central bankers from around the globe, the fund's top economists highlighted a shift in the global economy in which many major nations are failing to keep up with what is still a relatively modest recovery in the United States.
In an interview on Friday, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the fund, said global growth risked being stuck in a rut for a long time. "If nothing gets done in a bold way, there is a risk of a new mediocre" level of growth for the global economy, she said.
And she took note that Germany could do more to stoke growth in Europe. "Given Germany's current position, it could certainly spend more on infrastructure," she said.
The fund's growth worries were underscored on Tuesday when Germany said that orders for industrial goods in August shrank by the largest amount since 2009, plunging 4 percent on a month-over-month basis.
For investors, the warnings in the I.M.F. forecast and the report from Germany helped send the broad stock market down sharply on Tuesday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index falling 1.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq each fell about 1.6 percent.
The I.M.F. brought its estimate for global growth this year down to 3.3 percent from 3.7 percent and reduced its forecast for 2015 to 3.8 percent. The fund pointed to weaker growth in China, Europe, Japan and Latin America -- Brazil in particular -- as the main culprits behind the broad retrenchment.
Germany's growth forecast for 2014 was cut sharply to 1.4 percent from 1.9 percent.
Its estimate for United States growth in 2015, 3.1 percent, outpaces all major industrialized countries and exceeds as well a number of emerging markets, which in theory are supposed to grow at a substantially more rapid clip.
The assessment reflected a broad acceptance by global investors that, at least for the near future, the United States economy was set to advance ahead of many large economies, not just in terms of growth but also in corporate profitability and international competitiveness.
As a result, large investors and central banks have become aggressive purchasers of the dollar, betting that the currency will keep rising in value against the euro, the yen and the wobbly currencies of countries like Russia, Brazil and Turkey.
Economists have been warning for some time now that a situation in which the American economy becomes the prime engine for the global recovery brings with it significant risks by creating financial uncertainty in emerging markets as currencies weaken and capital flows reverse.
"At this stage, the question is, can the U.S. continue to power along while the rest of the world acts as a drag on global growth," said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international finance at Cornell University and the author of a recent book on the dollar. "This is a very unbalanced recovery."
Fund economists expect annual growth in the eurozone of just 0.8 percent, with inflation coming in at 0.9 percent -- a figure that Ms. Lagarde raised pointed concerns about.
"We've been warning for over a year now about persistent low inflation, and frankly we faced a bit of denial -- everyone said we don't need to think about it," she said. "But now it's there."
The fund unveiled this week a paper arguing that large-scale infrastructure investments, if properly undertaken, could bring relatively quick growth benefits -- a message that seemed to be directed at deficit-obsessed eurozone governments, including Germany.
"Infrastructure investment, even if debt-financed, may well be justified," Olivier Blanchard, the fund's senior economist, said at the news conference on Tuesday.
And while he did not mention Germany by name, he left little doubt to whom he was broadly referring. "Eurozone countries should be ready to do more," Mr. Blanchard said.
Mr. Blanchard pointed out that with interest rates at modern-day lows -- Germany can borrow money for 10 years at below 1 percent -- taking on extra debt to stimulate the economy need not be seen as profligacy.
He offered up a brief economic primer to underscore his point. "It is an irony of macroeconomics," he said with a small smile, "that for countries with too much debt, sometimes the solution is to create more debt."
Mr. Blanchard, who oversees economic research at the I.M.F., was behind the fund's public recognition two years ago that heavy-handed austerity policies in Europe had a larger-than-expected impact on economic growth.
Now, it seems, the global watchdog seems to be going one step further by urging eurozone officials to relax their rigid austerity measures.
Both Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Blanchard also made it clear that they had their doubts about the two-year bull run in eurozone government bonds.
Ms. Lagarde, in the interview, said that there was a "disconnect between what's happening in markets and, on the other hand, progress in the real economy."
Mr. Blanchard said that the markets "were too complacent" and that policy makers should be especially watchful.
"The risk is there," he cautioned.
The tough tone may well reflect a sense within the fund that this time around it needs to be more forceful in warning of financial trouble spots before it is too late.
The I.M.F. was criticized for not spotting the last financial crisis. It has responded by recently publishing a series of papers outlining how it might improve on its watchdog capabilities.
The fund has repeatedly cautioned that investors have become too reliant on very loose monetary policies on the part of global central banks to bolster their returns.
Wholesale purchases of bonds by monetary authorities have inflated equity and bond markets in countries around the world where investments were minimal and growth subpar, economists for the fund said in the report.
The warning echoes a rising chorus from economists and regulators who say that when the Federal Reserve in the United States starts raising interest rates -- expected to begin in 2015 -- so-called hot money flows that sought out high-yielding but risky returns in Europe and in emerging markets, including China, will head for safer shores.
A consequence could be a broad disruption in financial markets, similar to but greater in scope than the market spasm that hit markets in the developing world earlier this year.

Abstract: [...]the college graduation rates of America's young are growing at nearly the slowest pace in the industrial world, the third from the bottom among 30 nations tracked by the O.E.C.D. In 2012, 44 percent of 25- to 34-year-old Americans had a college degree, whether from a community college or an ivy league university, 6 percentage points more than in 2000. According to O.E.C.D. data, socioeconomic status has a bigger impact on college attainment in the United States than in most nations at a similar level of development. Scholars working at Harvard, the University of California, Berkeley and the National Bureau for Economic Research found that a student with a degree in business from an online-only college, the fastest-growing segment of the for-profit sector, was 22 percent less likely to receive a callback from a prospective employer than one with a similar degree from a community college.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDIn 1987, when he was Ronald Reagan's education secretary, the conservative culture warrior William J. Bennett wrote a famous essay denouncing federal aid for higher education because it allowed colleges "blithely to raise their tuitions," at little benefit to students.
Nearly two decades later, it seems, he was broadly right. Indeed, he didn't know the half of it.
It's not just that many colleges and universities are bleeding taxpayers. The government's overall strategy to subsidize higher education is failing at its core task: providing less privileged Americans with a real shot at a college degree. Alarmingly, it is burdening low-income students with risks they cannot bear and steering them into low-quality educations.
"Institutions of higher education in the United States extract a lot of money without delivering value but the government has no way of influencing that," said Andreas Schleicher, the top education expert at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the research organization for the world's major industrial powers. "It has very few levers of control over equity-related issues."
Take the "Bennett hypothesis." There are many studies suggesting that a lot of colleges pocket part of the aid via higher tuition. Among the most recent studies, Lesley J. Turner of the University of Maryland finds that every additional dollar of Pell Grant money -- the main federal aid program -- leads to a 17-cent cut in institutional aid, on average.
But the most problematic analysis comes in research by Claudia Goldin of Harvard and Stephanie Riegg Cellini of George Washington University, who looked into the most controversial corner of higher education: private, for-profit colleges, which today receive nearly a quarter of all federal aid for higher education.
They found that for-profits that get federal subsidies charge, on average, 78 percent more than for-profit institutions that are not eligible for aid. The price difference is almost identical to the value of the subsidy. "It's hard not to infer that federal student aid system is kind of allowing that to happen," Professor Cellini told me.
The United States shares two dubious distinctions. It has the most expensive higher education in the world: $26,000 a year, on average. And the college graduation rates of America's young are growing at nearly the slowest pace in the industrial world, the third from the bottom among 30 nations tracked by the O.E.C.D.
In 2012, 44 percent of 25- to 34-year-old Americans had a college degree, whether from a community college or an ivy league university, 6 percentage points more than in 2000. By contrast, the college graduation rate of young Britons rose by 19 percentage points over the period, to 49 percent. In the O.E.C.D. as a whole it increased to 40 percent, 14 percentage points more than in 2000.
Poor youths are the ones being left out. According to O.E.C.D. data, socioeconomic status has a bigger impact on college attainment in the United States than in most nations at a similar level of development. College enrollment after the first year is five times as high for high-income students as for low-income youths, studies show.
Low-income students in the United States often end up with the short straw: no degree, no job and a bundle of debt that they must pay anyway.
American underperformance reflects underlying inequities that are deeper than in any other rich country. But what is even more disturbing is that government support sometimes contributes to the nation's educational disparities.
Consider, again, for-profit colleges. There are legitimate arguments in their favor, including the fact that they are the only part of higher education that is growing to meet the rising demand from low-income Americans. They also can be nimbler than public schools, able to develop new curriculums quickly to adapt to changes in the job market.
Still many for-profits provide a less valuable education. Scholars working at Harvard, the University of California, Berkeley and the National Bureau for Economic Research found that a student with a degree in business from an online-only college, the fastest-growing segment of the for-profit sector, was 22 percent less likely to receive a callback from a prospective employer than one with a similar degree from a community college.
And they are more expensive. Professor Cellini calculated that while community college costs taxpayers $11,400 a year per student, almost $4,000 more than a for-profit college, for-profits cost students much more: $51,600 a year in tuition, forgone earnings and loan interest, almost $20,000 more than community colleges.
"Some for-profits provide value for students," Professor Cellini told me. "But on average they are slightly worse than community college in terms of earnings after graduation and they are way more expensive." Given this, she said, "Why would you go?"
The bigger question is why the American government finances them, even as public education is shriveling from a lack of cash.
State and local financing for public higher education fell to some $76 billion last year, nearly 10 percent less than in 2003 after inflation. On a per-student basis it is 30 percent less than it was a decade ago.
But that doesn't mean there is less government money in the system. Federal aid to college students more than doubled over the period, to some $172 billion last year. Of that, nearly 25 percent went to private, for-profit colleges.
There are better ways to finance higher education. In Norway, where the state picks up the bill and students pay no tuition, 44 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds have a degree from a four-year college, compared to 34 percent of Americans.
But the United States needn't become Scandinavian. British universities also charge fairly high tuition, but Britain manages to provide universal public funding while avoiding many of the pitfalls of the American system of college finance.
Like the United States, Britain relies heavily on loans, available to every college-bound student. That is where the similarities end. The British government imposes tight quality controls to ensure higher education is up to scratch. What's more, graduates pay back only what they can afford: 9 percent of their annual earnings over £21,000 ($34,000). Any unpaid balance is forgiven after 30 years.
Most controversially, the government controls prices: Tuition can be no more than £9,000 ($15,000). The government will directly finance the extra costs of expensive careers like engineering or medicine. But colleges can charge no more.
The Obama administration is moving, timidly, in this direction, introducing income-contingent loans to the federal aid portfolio. But there is a long way to go.
The argument is not, as Mr. Bennett might have had it in 1987, that federal aid should be pared back or eliminated. The case for government financing of college is as strong as ever.
A college education is not only immensely valuable to graduates, it produces huge value to the rest of society.
But the way we subsidize college today, we are wasting both money and opportunity.

Abstract: The cost of energy, after temporarily falling in the 1990s, returned to its post-1970s norm in recent years and acted like a tax on the rest of the economy. Last year, 33.6 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds had a four-year college degree, up from 30.8 percent in 2008, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Full text:   American workers have been receiving meager pay increases for so long now that it's reasonable to talk in sweeping terms about the trend. It is the great wage slowdown of the 21st century.
The typical American family makes less than the typical family did 15 years ago, a statement that hadn't previously been true since the Great Depression. Even as the unemployment rate has fallen in the last few years, wage growth has remained mediocre. Last week's jobs report offered the latest evidence: The jobless rate fell below 6 percent, yet hourly pay has risen just 2 percent over the last year, not much faster than inflation. The combination has puzzled economists and frustrated workers.
Of course, there is a long history of pessimistic predictions about dark new economic eras, and those predictions are generally wrong. But things have been disappointing for long enough now that we should take the pessimistic case seriously. In some fundamental way, the economy seems broken.
I probably don't need to persuade most readers of this view, so the better way to think about the issue may be to consider the optimistic case. And last week, in his most substantive speech on domestic policy in months, President Obama laid out that case.
It included the usual set of glass-half-full statistics and wishful-thinking proposals that officeholders talk about during political campaigns. More notable, though, was that Mr. Obama -- speaking at Northwestern University -- explained why he thought wage growth was likely to pick up.
"If we take the necessary steps to build on the foundation," he said, after a litany of the good news, "I promise you, over the next 10 years we'll build an economy where wage growth is stronger than it was in the past three decades."
He may or may not be right about that. But the speech laid out the issues in unusually clear terms. And by any definition, the great wage slowdown -- or its end -- is one of the most important subjects in the country today.
You can think of Mr. Obama's argument as falling into two categories (even if he didn't say so): the reasons that overall economic growth may accelerate, and the reasons that middle- and low-income workers may benefit more from that growth than they have lately. Both factors have contributed to the wage slowdown. The size of the pie hasn't been growing very fast, and most of the increases have gone to a small share of already well-fed families.
On the growth side of the ledger, both energy and education have been problems. The cost of energy, after temporarily falling in the 1990s, returned to its post-1970s norm in recent years and acted like a tax on the rest of the economy. Education, meanwhile, is the lifeblood of economic growth, allowing people to do entirely new tasks (cure a disease, invent the Internet) or to do old ones with less time and expense. Yet educational attainment has slowed so much that the United States has lost its once-enormous global lead.
On both fronts, the country has been making progress, Mr. Obama rightly noted. The fracking boom and a more modest clean-energy boom have increased this country's share of energy production and held down costs worldwide. The price of oil has been mostly flat for three years.
And the number of high-school and college graduates is rising. The financial crisis deserves some perverse credit, because it sent people fleeing back to school, much as the Great Depression did. But some of the efforts to improve school performance -- by raising standards and accountability -- are also playing a role.
Last year, 33.6 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds had a four-year college degree, up from 30.8 percent in 2008, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That leaves a lot of room for further improvement, but it's more progress than in prior years. In 2000, the share was 29.1 percent.
Mr. Obama didn't mention her in the speech, but another reason for optimism at the White House is Janet Yellen, who took over the Federal Reserve this year. Under Ben Bernanke, her predecessor, the Fed was heroically creative in fighting the financial crisis. After the crisis, though, Fed officials made the same mistake repeatedly: overestimating the health of the economy. Ms. Yellen has suggested that she's learned that lesson and will be even more aggressive about trying to lift growth with low interest rates.
As far the other entry in the ledger, the biggest reason to think economic growth may translate more directly into wage gains is the turnabout in health costs. After years of rapid increases, they have slowed sharply in the last three years. Mr. Obama likes to give more credit to the 2010 health care law than most observers do, but he's not wrong about the trend's significance.
Health costs take a direct bite out of paychecks. Employers don't have some secret stash of money to pay for health insurance; when it becomes more expensive, there is less money left for salaries. It's no accident that the best period of wage growth in the last 40 years -- the late 1990s -- was also a period of quiescent health inflation.
If you're skeptical that these trends are actually encouraging, take a minute to play an alternate-history game. Imagine someone had come to you a few years ago and predicted that health inflation would slow sharply, that the cost of oil would be flat, that the United States would soon produce more oil than it imports and that both the high-school and college graduation rates would rise. Most of us would not have replied: Yeah, that all sounds right.
But here's where I become less optimistic than the president. Imagine that same prognosticator had added one more bit of clairvoyance: Despite all those positive trends, the real median weekly pay of full-time workers in mid-2014 would be slightly lower than in it was mid-2011. Or than it was in mid-2008, the year before Mr. Obama took office. Or in mid-2000.
It's certainly possible that we're on the verge of a pay surge, much as we were in the mid-1990s, when the situation also seemed bleak. It's also possible that the forces behind the great wage slowdown -- from globalization to our often-sclerotic government to (at least for many workers) technological change -- are still more powerful than the positive forces. In that case, the wage slowdown won't end until the country makes much more progress in improving education, cutting medical waste and energy costs and creating a more responsive, nimble government.
Either way, the great wage slowdown, or the end of it, will help set the tone for American life in the coming decade. It has already done so in the century's first 15 years, causing widespread unhappiness with the country's direction and leading voters to shift partisan directions multiple times. The political turmoil isn't likely to end until the economic reality changes.

Abstract: The Chronicle of Philanthropy, in a study released Monday, examined $180 billion in donations to charity in 2012 by taxpayers who itemized their deductions and found that the share of income donated to charity by Americans who earned $200,000 or more decreased by 4.6 percent since 2006.

Full text:   Between 2006 and 2012, the wealthiest Americans became less generous with charitable donations, as a share of their total income, while lower- and middle-income Americans reached farther into their pockets as they witnessed the need for charity in their communities, a study says.
The Chronicle of Philanthropy, in a study released Monday, examined $180 billion in donations to charity in 2012 by taxpayers who itemized their deductions and found that the share of income donated to charity by Americans who earned $200,000 or more decreased by 4.6 percent since 2006. Those earning less than $100,000 gave 4.5 percent more of their income to charity.
"The wealthiest aren't being persuaded to up their share of giving in the same kind of way the poor are," said Stacy Palmer, the editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
She added, "It makes it clear that the competition for dollars is really intense."
But the total amount donated by the wealthy grew by $4.6 billion, accounting for inflation, to $77.5 billion between 2006 and 2012, she said.
"In some ways, because the ranks of the wealthy are growing, that means that more people are giving," Ms. Palmer said.
That $77.5 billion was 2.8 percent of the income of Americans who made $200,000 or more that year. Americans who earned between $50,000 and $75,000 donated 3.5 percent of their income to charity.
Rates of giving fell in many of the biggest cities, but there were some marked increases. In Las Vegas, the share of income donated grew by 14.9 percent, which the study's authors attributed in part to a rise in smaller donations from people concerned about the economic downturn there.
Charity officials told the study's authors that giving rates among lower-income donors appeared to increase elsewhere for the same reason.
"They really felt close to the kinds of problems charities were trying to deal with," Ms. Palmer said. "They were feeling like, 'That could be me.' "
In Jacksonville, Fla., the share of income donated to charity increased by 8.7 percent, amid a sustained effort to improve the area's public schools, which suggests that concentrated campaigns can increase charity even during times of economic hardship.
"People felt so strongly about the campaign for the schools that people gave as much as they could at different income levels," Ms. Palmer said.
The share of income donated fell by more than 10 percent in Philadelphia and in Buffalo, but the drop did not necessarily spell disaster for all charities in those cities. Philabundance, a hunger relief organization in Philadelphia, said it had experienced an increase in giving in recent years. Lindsay Hughes, a public relations manager for the agency, said hunger had been a prominent topic in the news over the last few years because of such issues as a decline in government food assistance.
Religion appeared to play a role in promoting higher giving rates. Residents of Utah, where the Mormon Church encourages members to give significantly to charity, gave the highest share of their income to charity, 6.6 percent. Nine of the 10 cities where the giving rate was highest are in the so-called Bible Belt. Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire had the lowest rates.

Full text:   On a Friday afternoon last spring, Dennis D'Amelio, an artist and teacher in late middle age was presiding over a class in color theory at LaGuardia Community College, whose location in the immigrant hub of western Queens makes it one of the most ethnically diverse colleges in the country. It was the end of the semester and the students were tackling a challenging assignment -- a test of the reactive properties of color, which required the meticulous rendering of small sequential blocks of paint, an exercise that would serve as a lesson in deductive reasoning and consume hours.
Vladimir de Jesus, a child of Puerto Rican parentage and Soviet enthusiasms, had arrived early with various supplies and considerable energy. At 23, he had been at LaGuardia sporadically over six years, amassing fewer than half of the credits he needed to progress to a four-year college.
For all of that time, and really for so long before it, he had known that he wanted to pursue a life in the arts. In an essay he wrote in March, he talked about painting and drawing pastels as a young boy, and the link that art provided to his mother, who had also painted and who died in the early 1990s of AIDS, a disease that also claimed his younger sister.
After the deaths, the family moved to Puerto Rico, living for several years in cars or in shelters, before returning to New York, where Mr. de Jesus attended Washington Irving High School, which has a long record of dismal performance. He eventually dropped out and earned an equivalency diploma.
Mr. de Jesus is tall, with an angular face and long hair he often wears in braids, and much of his skin is covered in tattoos -- of Che Guevara and roses and the words of Bob Marley.
"All I cared about was art and global history," he told me one afternoon in the apartment he shares with his father and stepmother in subsidized housing on Roosevelt Island. "I was really rebellious, and I was cutting classes all the time." At 17, he had a child.
As a community college student, Mr. de Jesus is both prototype and outlier. The majority of community college students come from low-income families, and many arrive at school, as he did, with competing obligations (29 percent of community college students in the United States are parents), as well as the need for extensive remediation. The widely held impression that community colleges are essentially vocational is inaccurate. Data released by the American Association of Community Colleges in September indicated that most of the associate degrees awarded in 2012 were given in the liberal arts and sciences, outnumbering those for nursing, say, or marketing.
In recent years, mounting concerns about inequality have fixated on the need for greater economic diversity at elite colleges, but the interest has tended to obscure the fact that the vast majority of high school students -- including the wealthiest -- will never go to Stanford or the University of Chicago or Yale. Even if each of U.S. News and World Report's 25 top-ranked universities committed to turning over all of its spots to poor students, the effort would serve fewer than 218,000 of them. Community colleges have 7.7 million students enrolled, 45 percent of all undergraduates in the country.
LaGuardia was founded in 1971 out of the struggles for a more egalitarian world that had characterized the previous decade. At any time, it has approximately 50,000 students from 150 countries who among them speak 129 languages. In February, Mayor Bill de Blasio chose the college as the site of his first State of the City address. Gail O. Mellow, the president of LaGuardia and a community college graduate who went on to get her doctorate, has been an entrepreneurial and enlightened leader, forging relationships with Goldman Sachs, for instance, and the Japanese government. The school recently won a $2.9 million grant from the United States Department of Education for a proposal to enhance student engagement; it was one of 24 colleges to be awarded money, in a competition that drew 500 applicants.
And still its challenges, like those of nearly every other community college, can appear insurmountable. More than 70 percent of LaGuardia students come from families with incomes of less than $25,000 a year. The college reports that 70 percent of its full-time students who graduated after six years transferred to four-year colleges, compared with just 18 percent nationally, but only a quarter of LaGuardia students received an associate degree within six years.
Over the past decade, while the amount of money going to community college students in the form of federal Pell grants has risen significantly, financing for the colleges themselves, which rely to a great extent on government appropriations and foundation grants, has risen only modestly. In 2010, Congress rejected plans for an $8.8 billion aid package that would have been directed toward helping community colleges raise graduation rates.
Among individual donors, community colleges ignite little charitable impulse. An endowment fund begun at LaGuardia in 2003 has raised $11 million, of which $8 million has been spent. To put those sums in perspective, Prep for Prep, the organization started in the 1970s to help channel bright, disadvantaged New York City children into top private schools and ultimately the Ivy League, raised $3 million on a single night in June when it held its annual gala.
Disturbed by the grievous imbalances in higher education, Dr. Mellow has written and spoken frequently about the problems that community colleges face. As she and others have repeatedly pointed out, although community colleges serve the most vulnerable students in the country, private research colleges spend three times as much per student as community colleges do. Community colleges represent the only sector in higher education where over the past five years, revenues per student have actually declined when adjusted for inflation.
Vladimir de Jesus started taking classes at LaGuardia in September 2008 but left after his first semester. When he returned to the college in the fall of 2012, he had already declared a major in fine arts, with the goal of transferring to Hunter College to earn a bachelor's degree and, eventually, getting a master's and teaching studio art and art history. From a certain vantage point on Roosevelt Island he can see Hunter across the river on Manhattan's East Side. But getting there has proved more difficult than he had envisioned.
I first met him late last winter in an English composition class taught by Noam Scheindlin, a young scholar of Proust and Georges Perec who displayed a dazzling talent for making complex literary ideas relevant to students' lives. Mr. Scheindlin will be eligible for tenure in two years, which makes him unusual at LaGuardia, where only 39 percent of the classes are taught by instructors who are full-time members of the faculty.
In Mr. Scheindlin's class, many of the students were foreign born, having come from Ecuador, Yemen, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan. Almost all struggled with aspects of vocabulary (words including "stable" and "infelicitous") or analyzing texts. One morning, during a discussion of a Julio Cortázar short story that centered on the idea of a narrator, a young woman paused to ask, "When it's not true, it's fiction, right?"
Mr. de Jesus began the winter semester auspiciously; he received an A for an early personal essay. In addition to his English and art classes, he was taking a remedial course, Math 96, which is algebra-based and focuses on linear and quadratic equations.
Passing this class, which teaches math that most affluent children study in eighth or ninth grade, is required for graduation and the ascent to four-year programs. But at community colleges across the country, the basic math requirement has been a notorious hindrance to advancement. More than 60 percent of all students entering community colleges must take what are called developmental math courses, according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, but more than 70 percent of those students never complete the classes, leaving them unable to obtain their degrees.
Mr. de Jesus was taking Math 96 for the third time last spring, having failed it twice. On one attempt he had fallen short by just a few points on the final exam; on another, he did not bother to show up for the exam at all because he was already failing. But in math, too, he had started the spring semester well, with grades in the 80s and 90s on the initial exams, his professor, Yelba Gutierrez, an adjunct at the time, told me.
When Mr. de Jesus came to school, he was present and engaged. In his English class, he typically offered observations that were sharper than those of the other students. But as the semester wore on, he had trouble getting to his classes on time -- or at all.
In this habit, he was like many others. "You'll see them come the first few weeks and then they disappear," Ms. Gutierrez said. One morning in May, 10 of 28 students in her class were absent. One woman who had come explained that she hadn't completed a particular assignment because in addition to school, she had a full-time job and slept only four hours a night.
Among community college students, work and child rearing present the biggest barriers to consistent attendance. Relative to their peers, LaGuardia students face some of the longest commuting times in the country. Mr. Scheindlin's class, for example, met twice a week at 9:15 a.m., and on some of those mornings Mr. de Jesus had to take his 6-year-old daughter, Svetlana, to school, traveling from Roosevelt Island to the Tremont section of the Bronx by way of the F and D trains and then the B42 bus, before he could get to LaGuardia's campus, more than an hour away.
In March, he suffered further distraction when he learned that two close childhood friends had been shot in a house in Pennsylvania, in a drug-related crime. "That really put me in a depression," Mr. de Jesus told me a few months later. "They were my homies and I loved them so much. Wrong is wrong but they were supporting their families. They messed up their lives and they couldn't get good-paying jobs."
On some occasions, Mr. de Jesus didn't make it to class, he told me, because of flare-ups from the ulcers that had afflicted him for a few years and, he said, had caused him to be hospitalized at 21 and lose 30 pounds. He attributed his illness to the constant anxiety he felt about money and life. In addition to caring for Svetlana, he worked when he could as a freelance tattoo artist, though the money was uncertain.
"In a week you can make $500 or no hundred dollars," he said. In a good month he might make about $700. Although he receives financial aid, he is responsible for a portion of his tuition (which for a degree student is approximately $4,500 a year) as well as his daughter's fees at a Catholic school. He also gives his father $200 a month toward household expenses. Not much is left. "You don't just want to waste all of your money on transportation and food," Mr. de Jesus said. "You want to buy a shirt. You want to pay your phone bill."
When Mr. de Jesus told his father that he was going to have a baby with his high school girlfriend, the announcement was not met favorably. "I was against him having children at such a young age," Frank de Jesus, a former tool and die maker and bus driver told me one afternoon as he sat in his living room, where a wall of bookshelves included the works of Wilhelm Reich, Friedrich Engels and at least 14 volumes of Joseph Stalin's writing. "I thought his life would be ruined. I didn't make it difficult for them to stay together but I didn't make it easy," he said of his son's relationship. The couple broke up not long after Svetlana was born; Vladimir shares custody of his daughter.
Named for Lenin, the younger Mr. de Jesus did not grow up in a house distinguished by an impoverishment of words; education was paramount. As a young man, Frank de Jesus had wanted to be a doctor. His mother was a teacher and his father was a waiter at the Carlyle Hotel. A rejection from the Bronx High School of Science was dispiriting, Mr. de Jesus told me, but he went on to take classes at Columbia University and the City College of New York before falling away, into the political movements of the late 1960s when he joined the Young Lords, the Puerto Rican civil rights group, in East Harlem.
He read mightily to his children -- "The Hobbit," works of Taoism -- and his son has taken the same approach with Svetlana, accompanying her frequently to Barnes & Noble. One day when I was visiting the family, she emerged from her room, pulled the Bible off the shelf, sat on the floor of the living room and began reading it.
There are times when regardless of personal circumstance, parenthood can feel like a series of quotidian decisions that amount to a crude choice between your own success and the sparkling future you wish for your child. In a sense, any time someone in Mr. de Jesus' position sits down with his child to help her understand addition, for instance, he is neglecting the work that will, in his own life, propel him forward.
Unlike the students at private universities, who are offered an array of supports -- academic, social, psychological -- community college students rarely get the help they need from their chronically underfunded institutions. Many students come to community college struggling with how to navigate bureaucracies, and battling issues with executive function and time management. They arrive, in effect, having little understanding of how to be students.
"People will say, 'How come these kids can't get their act together?' " Melinda Karp, assistant director of the Community College Research Center at Columbia University's Teachers College, told me. "And part of it is structural, obviously, the result of growing up in chaotic environments." A recent examination of studies on student support services conducted by the center showed that students given individual "coaches" for two semesters or more -- coaches who actively helped them address various challenges in their lives while keeping watch on their academic performance -- were more likely to remain in college and finish.
Toward the end of last semester, Mr. de Jesus had fallen behind on his math homework. There were domestic complications: the death of his grandfather, and the stresses of a college student's typically strained romantic life. At one point he lost the lab work that he had done in class, which would make up 5 percent of his total grade. Not having a computer of his own, he had been checking laptops in and out of the library. In the process of returning one, he had left the lab work behind. When he went back to retrieve the papers, they were gone.
The final exam for Math 96 would make up 35 percent of the total grade, and as the day of the test approached, Mr. de Jesus knew that with the demerits he would face for his poor attendance and his unfinished homework, there was little chance he would pass. On the morning of the exam, he didn't show up, and he failed the class for the third time. As it happened, more than 40 percent of the students in the class also failed.
"This whole thing with math just hits your spirit in the wrong way," Mr. de Jesus remarked recently. "It demolishes your spirit. You become lazy."
When I conveyed his sentiment to Dr. Mellow, LaGuardia's president, she agreed and praised his wording. Dr. Mellow stands on one side of an intense debate among educators about the necessity of algebra for students who do not plan to pursue concentrated study in math- or science-related fields.
"I once got a note from a student who said, 'This developmental algebra is a stainless-steel wall and there's no way up it, around it or under it,' " she told me in her office one afternoon recently.
What makes algebra so hard for community college students? One factor is that many have been taught so poorly before they arrive. They have developed a debilitating reliance on calculators, Abderrazak I. Belkharraz, the chairman of the LaGuardia math department, told me, "for things as simple as what is the cosine of pi over two." And the pedagogy tends to focus on computation rather than the underlying concepts, leaving the practice of math to seem far removed from the students' experiences.
A few years ago, the Carnegie Foundation decided to tackle the algebra problem, believing that if developmental math were reconceived, the overall effect on graduation rates could be tremendous. The foundation devised two curriculums, one in quantitative reasoning and another that was more statistics-based; both were aimed at imparting the kind of mathematical knowledge more useful to students in their daily lives. "You want to be able to understand risk. If you smoke, what is the probability of getting cancer?" Dr. Mellow explained. "If you have unprotected sex, what are the chances of getting pregnant?"
LaGuardia is one of more than 20 colleges around the country experimenting with these curriculums. Nationally, the program is in its third year and the results have been impressive, with students passing the classes at a much higher rate than students who took the standard, algebraically based remedial math courses.
To move on to Hunter, Mr. de Jesus needs to accumulate 60 credits, in addition to passing Math 96, a course that confers no credit. In his six semesters at LaGuardia, he has acquired 27 credits.
In the spring, he decided that he would not take algebra again this fall and would instead postpone it for a time when he could focus on it exclusively. He ended the term with an A-minus in art and a C in English. Mr. Scheindlin said that when the papers in English composition became more research-intensive, Mr. de Jesus seemed to produce them hastily. "Here's a very, very intelligent student, with an intelligence of the best kind, an intelligence guided by an intuitive sense of how to make connections," Mr. Scheindlin said. "There's no question in my mind that had he had the time to do the work, he would have written really wonderful work."
Over the spring, Mr. de Jesus looked for additional work in art galleries in Manhattan and Brooklyn to supplement his income, but he had not found anything and he remained conflicted about the wisdom of taking a full-time job. "If I had a regular job I'd have such a hard time staying in school," he explained one afternoon over the summer. "I see people leave all the time for jobs that pay $15 an hour."
When he first started at LaGuardia in 2008, he worked at a clothing store, the Children's Place, while attending classes and helping to care for his infant daughter. But the schedule became too overwhelming, and he dropped out that December. It took him four years to return.
During his time at LaGuardia, Mr. de Jesus has been particularly moved by his art teacher, Mr. D'Amelio, who inspires his students to believe that art is not inimical to making a living and that a career born of passion is not simply a right of the privileged. Twice over the past few months Mr. de Jesus has shown his paintings at a gallery on Roosevelt Island. In February his work was selected for inclusion in an exhibition at LaGuardia about race in the 20th century.
This semester he is taking a class in the philosophy of art and another in design. He began the fall term with a 3.49 G.P.A., but he has been unable to shake his despondency. His worries about money have escalated to the point that he has recently begun to think about a job with the Sanitation Department.
"I don't just want to be in school. I want to learn in school," he said. "I know that I can pass these classes, but my mind is always elsewhere. I'm thinking all the time of the future, the future, the future, but I'm stuck here in this present."

Abstract: Many economists dismiss these attitudes as the griping of people on the losing end of globalization, but they would do better to look inward, at the flaws in their models and theories. Since the 1970s, economic orthodoxy has argued for low tariffs, free capital flows, elimination of industrial subsidies, deregulation of labor markets, balanced budgets and low inflation. In reality, high growth in those years resulted from many factors: pent-up demand from the war; the Marshall Plan; Cold War military spending; investments in universities, highways and scientific research; and falling oil prices.

Full text:   Trade is one of the few areas on which mainstream economists firmly agree: More is better. But as the Obama administration pursues two huge new trade deals -- one with countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the other with the European Union -- Americans are skeptical. Only 17 percent believe that more trade leads to higher wages, according to a Pew Research Center survey released last month. Just 20 percent think trade creates jobs; 50 percent say it destroys them.
The skeptics are on to something. Free trade creates winners and losers -- and American workers have been among the losers. Free trade has been a major (but not the only) factor behind the erosion in wages and job security among American workers. It has created tremendous prosperity -- but mostly for those at the top.
Little wonder, then, that Americans, in another Pew survey, last winter, ranked protecting jobs as the second-most-important goal for foreign policy, barely below protecting us from terrorism.
Many economists dismiss these attitudes as the griping of people on the losing end of globalization, but they would do better to look inward, at the flaws in their models and theories. Since the 1970s, economic orthodoxy has argued for low tariffs, free capital flows, elimination of industrial subsidies, deregulation of labor markets, balanced budgets and low inflation. This philosophy -- later known as the Washington Consensus -- was the basis of advice the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank gave to developing countries in return for financial help.
The irony is that during the Industrial Revolution, today's rich countries -- Britain, France and the United States -- pursued the very opposite policies: high tariffs, government investment in industry, financial regulations and fixed values for currencies. Trade expanded, and capital flowed anyway.
World War II changed everything. Tariffs were seen as having exacerbated the Depression, and inadequate globalization as one cause of the two world wars. So, through the late 1970s, the United States and Europe cut tariffs, though currencies were fixed and capital was still highly controlled. Astonishing American prosperity in the three decades after 1945 led economists to overestimate the impact of free trade. In reality, high growth in those years resulted from many factors: pent-up demand from the war; the Marshall Plan; Cold War military spending; investments in universities, highways and scientific research; and falling oil prices.
Starting in the 1970s, however, under the influence of free-market enthusiasts like Milton Friedman, economists urged further removal of barriers to trade and capital flows, hoping to turn the world into one highly efficient market, unobstructed by government.
The results were often disastrous. The lowering of protective tariffs did not lead to rapid growth in Latin America, which stagnated in the 1980s.
Mr. Friedman's acolytes also urged the reduction or elimination of capital controls -- starting in the 1970s in the United States, and in the 1980s in Europe -- along with lower tariffs. This, too, was ruinous. An exodus of short-term investments contributed to financial crises in East Asia, Russia, Argentina and Turkey in the mid-1990s, and to the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 (a prelude to the 2008 crisis).
Though these mistakes were recognized, the World Trade Organization continued to push one-size-fits-all rules, premised more on ideology than experience, that hurt developing countries.
In 1995, it demanded that members substantially reduce subsidies for export industries. Imagine what would have happened if South Korea, Japan and Taiwan had had to follow this guidance; they became economic powerhouses in the 1960s and 1970s by nurturing their export sectors. (To join the W.T.O., in 2001, China was forced to slash industrial subsidies, but it resorted to currency manipulation to boost its export sector.)
Also that year, the W.T.O. adopted a rule obliging members to abide by rich nations' patent laws. (Never mind that Americans stole technologies from Europe throughout the 1800s.) These laws typically enabled investors in rich countries to reap substantial rewards, while poor nations like India were forced to pay the same price for patented drugs as the rich West, because they were not allowed to make generic substitutes.
But the consensus was flawed. Even free-trade advocates now admit that American wages have been reduced as a result of outsourcing, the erosion of manufacturing and an ever-increasing reliance on imports. Middle-income countries, meanwhile, have been blocked from adopting policies that might make them world-class competitors. Nations that have ignored the nostrums of the Washington Consensus -- China, India and Brazil -- have grown rapidly and raised their standards of living. Improvements in poverty and inequality occurred in Latin America only in the 2000s, after the I.M.F. and the World Bank reduced their grip on those nations.
Expanding global markets is a worthy goal, but history offers lessons that can lead to more constructive trade, capital and currency policies.
The first is that gradual reform is more effective than a sudden turn to free markets, deregulation and privatization. Shock therapy in Russia was a failure, and nations from Argentina to Thailand paid a dear price for liberalizing capital markets too quickly. The historical models of sustained growth are clear: gradual development of core industries; economic diversification; improvements in literacy and education, especially for women; slow, deliberate opening of capital markets; and the protection of labor from abusive pay and working conditions.
A second lesson is that nations should be left space for experimentation. Some spend too much on social programs, others too little; some need transportation infrastructure, others improved banking; some require literacy programs, others advanced education; some need to subsidize emerging industries, others to privatize bloated state industries; some need worker protections like unemployment insurance, others need labor mobility. Most have too few regulations to protect the environment, finance and consumers.
A third lesson is that models of growth that depend indefinitely on exports are not sustainable. The large imbalances in trade between China and the United States distort economies. The same is true of Germany's huge trade surpluses, which are based on a fixed euro and restrained domestic wages.
Finally -- and this is especially true for rich nations -- every free-trade agreement should come with a plan to strengthen the social safety net, through job training, help for displaced workers, and longer-term and higher unemployment benefits. Free-trade deals must also be accompanied by policies to stimulate growth through infrastructure investments, subsidies for clean energy and, perhaps, other industries, as well as loans to small businesses, and even wage subsidies.
Free trade has been a priority for the Obama administration, but Congress, wisely, has not given it "fast track" authority, as it gave Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, to negotiate new trade deals without its approval.
Any trans-Pacific agreement, its terms still a secret, should be discussed in the open with ample protection of worker rights and healthy debate over regulatory changes requested by developing countries or big business. A trade agreement with the European Union makes more sense, but the danger is that environmental, financial and product-safety regulations will be watered down to meet the demands of corporate interests.
Economists are correct that free trade need not be a zero-sum game. But the genuine gains in prosperity from free trade can be maximized, and broadly shared, only if the policy errors of the past 40 years are properly understood.

Full text:   Investors seem to think that the economy is at the perfect temperature for stocks: not too hot and not too cold.
The latest evidence came on Friday in a jobs report that showed a pickup in hiring last month that could mean more people with paychecks, more spending and higher corporate profits. But the report also showed that wages were stagnant, which cheered investors concerned that anything that pushes up inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon and end the market rally.
All the major stock indexes rose sharply. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 208.64, or 1.2 percent, to 17,009.69. It was the third 200-point move in a little over a week as the markets turn more volatile. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 21.73 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,967.90. The Nasdaq composite index rose 45.43 points, or 1 percent, to 4,445.62.
The rally started from the opening and swept up nearly every kind of stock, small and large, and in almost every industry. All 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 rose.
"The solid payroll report is great for economic growth and stock prices," said Anastasia V. Amoroso, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds.
The good news pushed up the value of the dollar against other major currencies to the highest level in more than four years. Bonds and gold fell as investors fled traditional safe-haven assets.
Employers added 248,000 jobs in September, beating expectations of 215,000, the Labor Department reported. The hiring helped drive down the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent, the lowest point since July 2008. Still, average hourly wages fell 1 cent last month, the Labor Department reported.
"Wage inflation essentially came in zero, and that tells you that the Fed won't be in any rush to raise interest rates," said James Abate, managing director of Centre Asset Management.
The good news in the United States contrasts with troubling signs elsewhere. The Chinese economy is slowing, and the 18-country eurozone is teetering on the brink of another recession. On Thursday, the European Central Bank disappointed investors by not announcing details of more stimulus measures. All the major European indexes ended the week sharply lower.
The prospect of a two-speed global economy drove up the value of the dollar on Friday. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against six other major currencies, surged 1.2 percent. The euro fell 1.2 percent to $1.25, while the dollar gained 1.2 percent against the Japanese yen, to 109.76.
Investors will get a better sense of how much the improving economy is helping corporate profits next week when the aluminum maker Alcoa kicks off the unofficial start to earnings season. Financial analysts expect earnings per share for the S.&P. 500 to rise 6.8 percent from a year earlier, then surge 12 percent the next quarter and for all of next year, according to S&P Capital IQ, a research firm.
Shares of Mylan, the generic-drug maker, jumped after it raised its outlook for the third quarter and year. The stock rose $3.73, or 8 percent, to $50.23.
Salix Pharmaceuticals gained on news that it was scrapping its merger with the subsidiary of an Italian drug maker after the United States created new limits on the tax benefits of incorporating overseas. The stock rose $1.78, or 1.2 percent, to $152.87.
Prices for gold and United States Treasuries fell as traders moved money out of assets that are considered safer. Gold fell $22, or 1.8 percent, to $1,192.20 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.44 percent, from 2.43 percent on Thursday, and the price remained unchanged at 99 15/32.

Abstract: Mario Draghi, the central bank president, said it could draw on a pool of 1 trillion euros, or about $1.26 trillion, of securities tied to bank loans, known as asset-backed securities and covered bonds. Many economists fear that the eurozone economy is in danger of officially tipping into deflation, a condition in which falling prices prompt consumers to delay purchases, undercutting sales by businesses and leading to increased unemployment. Because of limits on the supply of private sector assets that meet central bank quality standards, many analysts expect the bank to eventually resort to purchases of government bonds, emulating the so-called quantitative easing used by the Federal Reserve in the United States.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank said on Thursday that a plan to begin buying private sector assets this month would have a "significant impact" on the eurozone economy. But European stocks slumped after the bank left open questions about how big the program would be.
Mario Draghi, the central bank president, said it could draw on a pool of 1 trillion euros, or about $1.26 trillion, of securities tied to bank loans, known as asset-backed securities and covered bonds.
Analysts expect the central bank to buy perhaps a fifth of that amount, and they have expressed doubt about whether the sum will be enough to revive bank lending and prevent the eurozone from slipping back into recession.
Stocks in Europe fell, in investors' apparent frustration that the E.C.B. bond-buying program would not be more ambitious. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks eurozone blue-chip shares, dropped 2.77 percent, while the euro rose against the dollar.
"Investors are somewhat disappointed," Emmanuel Petit, director of fixed income at Rothschild & Cie in Paris, said in an email message.
Meeting in Naples, Italy, the central bank's Governing Council decided to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.05 percent. The decision was a foregone conclusion because the rate was already effectively as low as it could go. Instead, analysts and investors were focused on the asset purchase program.
In a news conference after the meeting, Mr. Draghi declined to say how big the purchases would be. The size will depend on how the economy reacts to bond buying and the effectiveness of other central bank stimulus measures, he said.
While there is a potential asset pool of Euro 1 trillion, he said, the central bank will not buy that much. In addition, it will not accept securities that it deems overly complex, he added.
The central bank said it would buy assets from throughout the eurozone, including Cyprus and Greece, despite their deeply troubled economies. But the quality standards imposed on assets by central bank may limit the amount it can buy.
The E.C.B. said it expected its purchases to stimulate the market and prompt banks to package more of their loans into asset-backed securities or covered bonds, increasing the supply.
The Governing Council's visit to Naples, one of its twice-yearly meetings outside Frankfurt, drew protests from people who blame the central bank for Italy's economic woes.
Mr. Draghi said it was wrong to fault the bank for problems in Europe. He was alluding to banners, mostly denouncing austerity measures, that were hoisted by protesters outside the meeting at the 18th-century Capodimonte Museum on a hill in the northern section of Naples.
One read: "Job insecurity, poverty, unemployment, speculation. Free us from the E.C.B.!" Another depicted Mr. Draghi as Caesar, with laurel leaves around his ears, and read "Block the E.C.B."
"Go back and ask yourself, where were you two years ago?" Mr. Draghi said, with a hint of annoyance in his voice. Listing measures that the central bank took to avert disaster, he said, "We fought a systemic crisis."
"I find the description of the E.C.B. as the guilty actor needs to be corrected," he said.
Many economists fear that the eurozone economy is in danger of officially tipping into deflation, a condition in which falling prices prompt consumers to delay purchases, undercutting sales by businesses and leading to increased unemployment.
Because of limits on the supply of private sector assets that meet central bank quality standards, many analysts expect the bank to eventually resort to purchases of government bonds, emulating the so-called quantitative easing used by the Federal Reserve in the United States.
Such action would inevitably provoke an outcry in Germany, and most analysts do not expect the central bank to begin buying government bonds until next year, if ever. In Germany, there is widespread fear that the central bank's buying of bonds would amount to a transfer of wealth from better-off countries to poorer ones. Many Germans believe they will have to pick up the bill if some countries default on bonds owned by the central bank.
There were immediate complaints from Germany on Thursday that E.C.B. purchases of private sector assets would allow banks to unload their bad loans.
"The E.C.B. will presumably buy junk paper and thus increase the burden on taxpayers should defaults occur," Hans-Werner Sinn, a prominent economist who is president of the Ifo Institute research group in Munich, said in a statement.
>
Recent economic data have added to fears that the eurozone is at risk of deflation. The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone is at a five-year low, having dropped to 0.3 percent in September, official data indicated this week. That is far from the central bank's target of slightly less than 2 percent, which was last reached nearly two years ago.
In addition, unemployment in the eurozone remained at 11.5 percent in August.
The central bank may take some comfort in the decline of the value of the euro, which despite edging up on Thursday, is near a two-year low against the dollar. A weak euro makes imported goods more expensive for residents of the eurozone and contributes to higher inflation.
Slumping energy prices were one reason for the decline in inflation in September, from 0.4 percent in August. But there was also a drop in the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes prices for food and energy because they tend to fluctuate more.
The decline in that rate is potentially more worrying for the central bank because it is a more direct reflection of slack demand and the poor health of the eurozone economy.
Recent surveys show that business managers have become more pessimistic, further increasing concern that the eurozone economy is suffering from the crisis in Ukraine and related sanctions against Russia.
Last month, the European Central Bank offered four-year loans to commercial banks in the eurozone that were nearly interest-free, in an effort to make more credit available to businesses and households.
But demand from banks for the loans was less than expected, and many economists say they believe the central bank will need to overcome its reluctance to buy government bonds to restore growth.
Mr. Draghi on Thursday left the door open to that option, saying the central bank was "unanimous in the commitment to use other unconventional instruments if we were to judge that the risks for inflation were to deteriorate."

Abstract: Appearing relaxed and joking with the financiers gathered for a banking conference, Mr. Putin tried to soothe worries that Russia is hemorrhaging money in capital flight, headed into a deep recession with rising inflation and a collapsing ruble and, according to stubborn rumors, preparing to impose capital controls if investors continue to take money out of the country.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin did his best to paint a rosy picture of the Russian economy in a speech to business leaders on Thursday, saying the country remains "open to the world" and has a plan for growth in spite of American and European sanctions.
Appearing relaxed and joking with the financiers gathered for a banking conference, Mr. Putin tried to soothe worries that Russia is hemorrhaging money in capital flight, headed into a deep recession with rising inflation and a collapsing ruble and, according to stubborn rumors, preparing to impose capital controls if investors continue to take money out of the country.
Russia is well prepared to hold out against hard times, he said, because of its still-sizable foreign currency reserves of about $460 billion. To attract investment, he said jokingly as he began a question-and-answer session, "all I have to do is smile and show the devil is not as frightening as he seems."
Russia will rely on its reserves to substitute for foreign lending, Mr. Putin said, while stimulating domestic agriculture to put food on the country's tables in place of Western grocery imports the Kremlin itself banned in tit-for-tat sanctions.
Money from one of Russia's sovereign wealth funds, the Direct Investment Fund, can be channeled into investment for businesses cut off from Western financing by the sanctions, he added.
He said Russia remained committed to an "open" economy, denied rumors about capital controls and accused the United States and Europe of violating the spirit of the World Trade Organization in imposing sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. Mr. Putin called the sanctions, which single out wealthy individuals and politically connected banks and businesses, "utter foolishness."
"Yes, we see strong fluctuations on the currency market," Mr. Putin said. "But I will underscore the most important thing: The fundamental factors supporting stability are very strong, very reliable. This is a nearly deficit-free budget, significant reserves and strong current account balance," he said.
Mr. Putin's assurances notwithstanding, most economists say Russia's macroeconomic underpinnings are shaky. The World Bank projects the economy will grow by only 0.5 percent this year and even less next year. Russia's former finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, said last month that $110 billion has left Russia in capital flight since the crisis in Ukraine erupted.
The ruble, wobbly in the best of times, dropped to its lowest level against the dollar since the hyperinflation of the early 1990s, before rallying a bit this week. And Russia's stock market is down about 3 percent this year, in contrast to about 9 percent growth in stock markets globally, according to an index of world equities compiled by Morgan Stanley.
Russia's economy is deeply dependent on oil and gas revenue, which accounts for about 50 percent of the budget and 60 percent of exports. But oil prices have plunged lately, reaching their lowest level in two years and, according to most analysts, heading even lower, as American production surges.
Even senior Russian economic officials, in presentations just preceding Mr. Putin's, sounded notes that were jarringly different from their leader's.
The minister of the economy, Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, described a Russia mired in stagflation, with an inflation rate of 8 percent and growth of less than 1 percent. The chief economist of VTB, a state-owned bank, has estimated that the Western sanctions trimmed about 1 percent of growth from the gross domestic product, or about $20 billion.
Elvira S. Nabiullina, the head of the central bank, rued that after just completing an investor-friendly overhaul of the system for clearing stock market trades, there were currently few foreign investors to make use of it.
"For all this to work like a financial center," Russia also needs investors, Ms. Nabiullina said.
Most striking, German O. Gref, a former minister of the economy and the head of Russia's largest retail bank, Sberbank, delivered a scathing critique of the government's economic policies, wondering why the country was turning again to a state-led model of economic development.
The Soviet Union broke apart, he said, because of the "mind-boggling incompetence of the Soviet leadership. They did not respect the laws of economic development." Half the Russian economy is already in monopolized industries, Mr. Gref said. "You cannot motivate people through the gulag, like in the Soviet Union."

Abstract: A recent report by the Bank for International Settlements, essentially the bank for central banks, also questioned the global benefits of a stronger dollar, predicting it would tighten financial conditions because foreign banks rely heavily on dollar funding. On Thursday, after a board meeting Naples, Italy, the central bank outlined a two-year plan to buy private sector assets, including bank loans packaged into securities.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- As the growth of the United States economy outstrips the rest of the developed world, American policy makers are allowing Europe, Japan and even China to seek a little more prosperity -- at the expense of Americans.
The Obama administration and the Federal Reserve have watched quietly in recent years as foreign governments and central banks have chipped away at the dollar value of their currencies, strengthening their export industries in the hope of stimulating their economies.
The trend is likely to intensify over the next year as the Fed retreats from its own stimulus campaign while the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan expand their efforts. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, said on Thursday that it would begin a new round of bond purchases this month.
The United States has long argued that markets should determine the value of currencies and criticized nations that try to manipulate exchange rates. The current silence reflects both the simple reality that the American economy needs less help than the rest of the developed world and the judgment of officials that the United States would benefit greatly from stronger global growth. That, they say, would be true even if, in the short term, it makes the country's goods a little harder to sell and jobs a little harder to find.
"You're seeing American officials turn a blind eye to Mario Draghi talking down the euro, and turn a blind eye to interventions by the Chinese, because in both cases they're making the judgment that having a stabilized situation and decent growth prospects in these countries is far more important," said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "I tend to agree with that."
American leaders have embraced and celebrated a strong dollar as evidence of a strong economy. It lets Americans buy more foreign goods and borrow more cheaply from foreign countries. It also may draw foreign investors to American financial markets, supporting the rise of asset prices.
But the rise of the dollar carries large risks, too. It makes it harder for American companies to sell goods and services. It may be contributing to the sluggish pace of domestic inflation. And some economists warn that letting the dollar rise is not a sustainable method of encouraging growth.
"A strong dollar, fueled by higher U.S. interest rates, will likely expose vulnerabilities in other parts of the world," Stephen King, chief global economist at HSBC, wrote in a research note on Thursday. "Latin American countries already flirting with recession would certainly not welcome a tightening of U.S. monetary conditions." Some economists said the United States should seek to limit the dollar's rise through diplomacy and policy, and that the Fed should seek to limit its divergence from other central banks by extending its stimulus campaign.
A recent report by the Bank for International Settlements, essentially the bank for central banks, also questioned the global benefits of a stronger dollar, predicting it would tighten financial conditions because foreign banks rely heavily on dollar funding.
But Stephen Cecchetti, a professor at Brandeis University, said the world had a strong interest in Europe's health. "It's going to create some instability, but the alternative is worse," said Mr. Cecchetti, former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements. "You don't want to be around if there's a real depression in Europe."
The central bank still has not fully deployed the arsenal of a modern central bank to improve growth in Europe. It has refrained from the large-scale purchases of government debt undertaken by the Fed, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England.
But in recent months it has sought to push down the value of the euro through a variety of measures. In September, the central bank offered loans that were practically interest-free to commercial banks that promised to lend the money to businesses and consumers.
On Thursday, after a board meeting Naples, Italy, the central bank outlined a two-year plan to buy private sector assets, including bank loans packaged into securities. "These purchases will have a sizable impact," Mr. Draghi said at a news conference after the meeting.
One euro, which bought $1.39 in April, bought only $1.26 at the end of September. "We needed to bring the euro down and we still need to bring the euro down," Christian Noyer, a central bank board member from France, said in a recent interview with the French broadcaster Radio 1.
While such efforts are usually aimed at increasing exports, the central bank is focused on imports, too. A weaker euro raises the price of imported fuel and other products, which could help budge inflation. Prices in the eurozone last month increased at an annualized rate of just 0.3 percent, far below the 2 percent pace the central bank and other major central banks in the developed world regard as best for sustainable growth.
"This is a currency war where stealing inflation rather than growth is the goal," economists at the British bank HSBC wrote in a report published on Wednesday. The question, they said, "is whether the U.S. economy can generate sufficient inflation internally to tolerate the deflationary impact of a stronger dollar."
So far, American officials primarily seem frustrated that the European Central Bank continues to act slowly. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, last year became the rare official to call publicly for stronger action when he told an audience in Frankfurt that the central bank should buy government bonds.
Another question is whether the programs will provide a sufficient jolt. A similar lending program started by the Bank of England in 2012 has not reversed the decline in small-business lending in that country.
"Nobody's hiring, nobody's investing, nobody's spending," said Stefano Micossi, the director general of Assonime, an Italian business group. "There is no demand for credit. The system is not constrained by the funding side. The banks are awash in liquidity."
Japan, which has been grappling with the problems confronting Europe for more than two decades, is also seeking growth through currency moves. Under the "Abenomics" stimulus campaign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began in early 2013, the Bank of Japan has agreed to double the money supply, and the price of yen in dollars has dropped by about 24 percent.
The results have not met expectations. Japan's trade deficit has increased while inflation remains weak. The Japanese economy shrank by 7.1 percent in the second quarter after a sales tax increase.
The country's struggles may show the limits of devaluation, according to Mr. Posen of the Peterson Institute. He noted that demand was less sensitive to small changes in price for the kinds of high-end goods that dominate the exports of Japan and other developed countries.
The government remains publicly committed to its stimulus campaign. But some analysts see signs of tension between the head of the bank, Haruhiko Kuroda, and politicians who are wary that the rise in import prices will provoke consumer resistance.
"Kuroda is much more powerful than other board members for sure, but not necessarily than politicians," said Hiromichi Shirakawa, Japan economist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo and a former central bank official. "This is scary as the markets have been expecting additional easing by the bank within a couple of months."
China's economic rise was built on the suppression of its currency to support cheap exports at the expense of domestic consumption. Then, beginning in 2010, China let the renminbi rise about 20 percent against the dollar as part of its effort to encourage a transition away from export-led growth. But this year, with the economy growing at the slowest pace in more than a decade, China once again pressed down on the renminbi. Its value has fallen about 2 percent against the dollar so far this year.
"It was a way to stimulate the economy without resorting to full blown credit and investment-driven stimulus," said Diana Choyleva, the head of macroeconomic research at Lombard Street Research in London.
While that small change has prompted little criticism from the United States, the looming question is whether China will continue.
During the financial crisis, China's government-controlled banking system pumped money into the economy, doubling its assets over a five-year period. Many companies and local governments are now struggling to repay those debts, and authorities are reluctant to treat the pain with another major burst of lending.
Yu Yongding, a senior fellow of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing and a former member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, said it was imperative for the P.B.O.C. not to blink.
"China needs to adjust its economic structure urgently," Mr. Yu said. "The combination of the high leverage ratio, high financing costs and low profitability is a serious threat to China's financial stability."
But Mr. Yu said the bank might be required to take new steps if the outlook darkened. Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings at Fitch in Hong Kong, said further devaluation had obvious attractions. Noting the appreciation of the currency since 2010, Mr. Colquhoun said, "The authorities might think they could give some of that back through the renminbi in the event consumption faltered."

Full text:   By the end of the year, Congress will have appropriated more money for Afghanistan's reconstruction, when adjusted for inflation, than the United States spent rebuilding 16 European nations after World War II under the Marshall Plan.
A staggering portion of that money -- $104 billion -- has been mismanaged and stolen. Much of what was built is crumbling or will be unsustainable. Well-connected Afghans smuggled millions of stolen aid money in suitcases that were checked onto Dubai-bound flights. The Afghan government largely turned a blind eye to widespread malfeasance. Even as revelations of fraud and abuse stacked up, the United States continued shoveling money year after year because cutting off the financial spigot was seen as a sure way to doom the war effort.
As the Pentagon winds down its combat mission there at the end of the year, it's tempting to think of the Afghan war as a chapter that is coming to an end -- at least for American taxpayers. But, as things stand, the United States and its allies will continue paying Afghanistan's bills for the foreseeable future. That commitment was solidified Tuesday as the American ambassador in Kabul and Afghanistan's security adviser signed a bilateral security agreement that will keep a small contingent of NATO troops there for at least two years.
The United States and NATO partners recently agreed to spend $5.1 billion a year to pay for the army and police, until at least 2017. Western donors are expected to continue to give billions more for reconstruction and other initiatives, recognizing that Afghanistan won't be weaned off international aid anytime soon. In fact, the government appears to be broke.
A few weeks ago, Afghanistan's Finance Ministry made an urgent plea to the United States for a $537 million bailout, warning that it would otherwise not be able to make payroll. That's part of a broader, worrisome trend. The International Monetary Fund estimates that Afghanistan will face a financial gap of roughly $7.7 billion annually between now and 2018.
If the flow of money is to keep going, the Afghan government has to prove that it can be trusted. And, for its part, Congress should not hesitate to cut off the aid if corruption remains unabated.
Afghanistan's new president, Ashraf Ghani, who took office on Monday, has pledged to stamp out graft. "I am not corrupt, and I am not going to encourage corruption, tolerate it or become the instrument," the president, a former World Bank executive, told the BBC in an interview.
That will be easier said than done in a country where back-room deals are the norm. Mr. Ghani can show he is serious by appointing and empowering a new attorney general willing to take on unscrupulous officials. His proposal to lead a new procurement board is commendable because it would make him personally accountable.
Of the $104 billion that American lawmakers have appropriated for Afghan reconstruction, nearly $16 billion remains unspent, according to John Sopko, the inspector general who is overseeing the reconstruction effort. As one of the poorest nations on earth, Afghanistan clearly has plenty of needs. But the American agencies tasked with spending the money must do a better job identifying priorities, setting realistic goals and adopting stronger safeguards.
Delivering a speech at Georgetown University recently, Mr. Sopko marveled at the Marshall Plan comparison. "What have we gotten for the investment?" he asked.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The drop in eurozone inflation reported Tuesday was, in one sense, just a decimal point, another digit in the daily flow of depressing economic data. Yet it raised an increasingly urgent question: What will it take to arrest the Continent's slow-motion descent toward another recession and, possibly, a renewed existential crisis?
It has been almost two years since inflation in the eurozone was at 2 percent, right around the level that the European Central Bank considers optimal for stability and growth. In September, according to an official estimate published Tuesday, the annual rate of inflation fell to 0.3 percent from 0.4 percent the month before.
Inflation is at a five-year low, leading many economists to warn that the eurozone economy is in danger of officially tipping into deflation. But even the current low level of inflation can cause consumers to delay making purchases, companies to lose revenue and unemployment to soar from already high levels.
Joblessness in the 18 countries in the zone remained at 11.5 percent in August, the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, also reported on Tuesday. Nearly one out of four youths in the eurozone is jobless.
The figures came two days before the European Central Bank is scheduled to discuss monetary policy, and they are sure to increase calls for more aggressive stimulus action. But analysts are nearly unanimous that none will be coming when the central bank's governing council convenes in Naples on Thursday during one of its twice-yearly road trips outside Frankfurt.
The central bank faces an array of obstacles preventing it from undertaking the same kind of broad-based asset purchases that the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have used to revive their economies.
Since the financial crisis began in 2008, so-called quantitative easing has become a standard weapon in the central banking arsenal, except in the eurozone. That is true even though the central bank has consistently underestimated the severity of the decline in inflation.
Mario Draghi, the central bank president, remains constrained by divisions on its governing council, the fragmented structure of the eurozone financial system, and political resistance in Germany.
The central bank has offered banks four-year loans that are practically interest-free in an effort to restart lending, and it plans to begin buying private-sector assets in October. Mr. Draghi has promised to offer more details on the asset purchases on Thursday.
Purchases of government bonds, an essential component of full-blown quantitative easing, remains taboo for many Germans, who regard it as a way of transferring wealth from richer countries to poorer ones. They fear that, if any countries defaulted on their debts, the central bank would pass on the losses to other member countries.
"That's the big question -- if the E.C.B. can deliver something substantial," said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. "My theory is that they won't."
To be sure, inflation could pick up in the coming months because of the decline in the value of the euro, which on Tuesday sank below $1.26 for the first time since September 2012. A weak euro makes imported fuel and other goods more expensive for residents of the eurozone and contributes to higher inflation.
Slumping energy prices were one reason for the decline in inflation in September. But there was also a decline in the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes prices for food and energy because they tend to fluctuate often. Core inflation fell to 0.7 percent from 0.9 percent, Eurostat said.
The decline in that rate is potentially more worrying for the central bank because it is a more direct reflection of slack demand and the poor health of the eurozone economy.
"The E.C.B. will hardly be pleased at the outlook of very low inflation rate for a longer period of time," Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients.
The decline in the overall inflation rate to 0.3 percent was a preliminary estimate by Eurostat. The figure, which could be revised, was in line with analysts' expectations but still well below the bank's target of just under 2 percent.
The decline in consumer prices has been greater than the central bank expected. As recently as March, central bank economists forecast that inflation this year would average 1 percent. In June, they lowered the forecast to 0.7 percent, and in September, to 0.6 percent.
Gains in recent state elections by a conservative anti-euro party, the Alternative for Germany, could make the central bank even more cautious in the coming months. More aggressive monetary policy might nourish support for populist right-wing parties in Europe, which have fed on resentment toward European institutions like the bank.
"The E.C.B. is ready to do everything but buy government bonds," Joachim Fels, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley, said last week during a meeting with a small group of journalists. "That shows how great the resistance is to this normal and widely used measure."
To return to meaningful growth, economists say, the eurozone probably needs a combination of measures, including more-powerful stimulus from the central bank, like government bond buying; more government spending by countries that can afford it, like Germany; and deep changes in the regulations that govern business and labor in France and Italy.
The European Central Bank is preparing to buy so-called asset-backed securities, bank loans that have been bundled for resale on financial markets. It also plans to buy covered bonds, which are similar. The purchases are seen as a preliminary form of quantitative easing and a way to arrest a decline in bank lending.
By selling off existing loans, banks would raise money to issue new ones. But analysts doubt that the central bank would be able to find enough asset-backed securities and covered bonds that meet its quality standards and allow it to achieve the larger goal -- pumping more money into the eurozone economy.
The region registered zero growth in the second quarter, threatening to interrupt a tentative decline in joblessness.
Although the unemployment rate in the eurozone was unchanged at 11.5 percent, the absolute number of jobless people fell by 137,000 to 18.3 million, Eurostat said. The incremental decline suggests that unemployment will fall in the coming months but at a painfully slow pace.
"We continue to expect only a modest and gradual fall in unemployment rate in the coming quarters," analysts at Barclays said in a note to clients.
As in previous months, Greece and Spain had the highest unemployment rates, with 27 percent and 24.4 percent. In both countries, though, the rate has been edging slowly downward. The rate for Greece is from June, the most recent reported.
Austria, with 4.7 percent, and Germany, with 4.9 percent, had the lowest unemployment rates in August.
Unemployment among those under age 25 remained at 23.3 percent in the eurozone. In Greece and Spain, the jobless rate among youths remained above 50 percent, while in Italy and Croatia, it was over 40 percent.
Mr. Draghi has emphasized in recent weeks that he cannot solve such economic problems alone. He has pleaded with eurozone leaders to cut taxes and red tape and to remove impediments to entrepreneurship and hiring.
"No monetary -- and also no fiscal -- stimulus can ever have a meaningful effect without such structural reforms," he told members of the European Parliament on Sept. 22.
Indeed, there is evidence that bank lending is held back not by a shortage of credit but by a dearth of creditworthy borrowers who are confident enough about the future to want to invest in new employees and in expanding their businesses.
"There is no demand, because nobody is doing anything," said Stefano Micossi, director general of Assonime, an Italian business group. "Everybody is waiting."

Full text:   QUOGUE, N.Y. -- As the president of the Fire Island Association, Suzy Goldhirsch has a message she says she often offers property owners. "We are living on a sandbar in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean," she tells them. "We are in a high-risk environment. We on barrier islands are on the front lines of climate change."
The same could be said of many coastal areas around the world, which are threatened by rising sea levels as the planet warms. But the barrier islands that line the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, from Cape Cod to the Mexican border, are a special case.
A new report from the National Research Council finds that the effect of climate change is especially harsh on these islands. Population growth in much of this long coast "is nearly twice the national average," the report said. Meanwhile, "these same coasts are subject to impact by some of the most powerful storms on earth and the destruction potential of these events is increasing due to climate change and relative sea-level rise."
And so far, the report added, "as a compassionate nation, we rally each time a disaster strikes and provide resources for postdisaster recovery that far exceed those we are willing to provide to manage risk."
The panel calls for a regional or even national approach to managing coastal hazards -- a "proactive" effort to protect life, landscape and property, rather than the "disjointed and largely reactive approach" that has marked coastal protection efforts.
Until relatively recently, barrier islands defended themselves against rising seas by, in a sense, moving to higher ground: Storms washed beach sand to the islands' inland side; inlets formed and healed, usually leaving sand deposits behind the islands. This process worked well, as geologists noticed after the Ash Wednesday storm in 1962, a nor'easter that battered much of the East Coast through five high tides. Afterward, they reported that beach recovery was fastest and most robust in areas with the least development.
But today, Ms. Goldhirsch said, nature can no longer be left to take its course even as sea level rises. On many barrier islands, even federally designated national seashores like Fire Island, inlets are stabilized by rock jetties, beaches are routinely renourished with sand pumped from offshore, and miles of sea walls and other armor protect buildings.
"Let nature take its course -- I don't think that's good planning," she said. "That's not public policy. Public policy is you have to figure out what to do."
With the rapid development of the past few decades, the economic stakes have escalated drastically. The research council's report, "Reducing Coastal Risk on the East and Gulf Coasts," says that from 1980 to 2013, the United States had 33 coastal storms that each caused more than $1 billion in damage, sometimes far more.
While those storms represented about 22 percent of all the nation's billion-dollar-plus disasters over that period, they caused about 49 percent of the economic losses. Adjusted for inflation, losses from coastal storms have tripled since 1980.
Many losses result from storm surge, the bulge of water that storms push onshore. Even if storms do not increase in frequency or intensity, the sea level's rising will worsen damage from storm surge, which the report calls "the most destructive aspect of a hurricane."
Subsidies, emergency relief and ad hoc projects on the East and Gulf Coasts have encouraged development in the face of such danger, the report said. These can be "inappropriate incentives" according to the panel's head, Richard A. Luettich Jr., a professor of marine sciences at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
The report was commissioned by the Army Corps of Engineers, which, acting on the instructions of Congress, has had a large hand in this work. Among its other projects in response to Hurricane Sandy, the corps plans a Fire Island project that would pump seven million cubic yards of sand from offshore and construct new dunes and beaches along almost 20 miles of beachfront.
Supporters argue that the project will strengthen the island and that, in turn, will protect low-lying shore communities across Great South Bay. But opponents disagree, citing assessments from the United States Geological Survey; Fire Island's relative stability over time; and other factors. Left alone, they argue, it will eventually recover from the storm. And drawing sand from offshore deposits to build new dunes could actually harm the island, they say.
In September, the National Audubon Society won a temporary restraining order halting the project, saying that pumping sand onto the island would harm nesting sites for endangered shorebirds.
Private and publicly financed shoreline engineering projects are provoking similar arguments in places like Nantucket Island, Mass.; Harvey Cedars, on Long Beach Island, N.J.; and the Outer Banks of North Carolina. On many barrier islands, daily life becomes more complicated as sea level rises. Here in Quogue, east of Fire Island, people use caution when driving on the main beach road when the moon is full (when tides are unusually high) because that's when salt water from Quantuck Bay can flood across the road.
On the Outer Banks, the main road washes out routinely now, whenever "the tide is high and the wind is blowing," as some residents put it. And everywhere, people are raising their houses on pilings, sometimes 20 feet or more in the air.
Nevertheless, the expert panel said, it is hard to win support for safety measures that would require communities to "forgo revenue-generating potential by limiting development."
Robert S. Young, the director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University, said he was glad to see the expert panel emphasize the need for a long-term, large-scale, proactive approach because "managing the coast parcel by parcel is a bad idea."
"Every single problem we have today is only going to get worse in the future," he said. "The only uncertainty is how fast they are going to get worse."
But getting such a message across will be difficult, the panel said, adding that "assessing, communicating and managing risk in coastal areas are very challenging concepts even for a committee of experts in coastal science and engineering."
Ms. Goldhirsch said Fire Island could be a model for intelligent planning, in part because even though people would bring different interests and goals to the process, "we all love the place."
Her family has summered on Fire Island for more than 100 years, she said, and she understands its dangers. Hers is a modest house, where she keeps no valuables.
"I tell people, 'If you don't have the nervous system to live in a risky situation, it's O.K. to sell or stormproof your house, or live modestly,' " she said. "Don't try to get the federal government to pay for everything. They don't have enough money."

Full text:   Mayor Bill de Blasio plans to sign an executive order on Tuesday significantly expanding New York City's living wage law, covering thousands of previously exempt workers and raising the hourly wage itself, to $13.13 from $11.90, for workers who do not receive benefits.
The change is also intended to frame a looming debate in Albany, where Mr. de Blasio hopes to win the authority to set the citywide minimum wage at the same amount. If Mr. de Blasio succeeds in matching the minimum wage to the living wage, all hourly workers in the city would earn more than $15 by 2019, according to the city's projections.
The executive order will immediately cover employees of commercial tenants on projects that receive more than $1 million in city subsidies going forward. Workers who receive benefits such as health insurance will earn $11.50 an hour, compared with $10.30 before.
While cautioning that it was "notoriously difficult to develop projections related to economic development," the administration estimated that about 18,000 workers would be covered over the next five years, roughly 70 percent of all the jobs at businesses that will receive new financial assistance from the city's Economic Development Corporation.
The current living wage law, passed in 2012, has applied to about 1,200 jobs, officials say, excusing many retailers and companies that lease space as part of city-subsidized projects.
Administration officials cast the move as an extension of other policies aimed at reducing the wide gap between rich and poor, like the expansion of paid sick leave and the mayor's long-term plan to build more affordable housing.
"We cannot continue to allow rampant and growing income inequality," Mr. de Blasio said in an interview on Monday. "Every tool counts. If we reach 18,000 families with this tool and get them to a decent standard of living, that's a game-changer for those families."
The living wage law has long faced criticism for its limited reach: It has affected companies that directly receive city subsidies, but not those that are simply tenants in subsidized developments. It also specifically excluded part of the Hudson Yards development project on the Far West Side.
Mr. de Blasio's executive order will eliminate an exemption for future development at Hudson Yards. But some restrictions will still apply in other areas. The order will not affect businesses with gross income below $3 million, housing projects with more than 75 percent affordable units or manufacturers.
The city estimated that more than 4,000 workers to whom the law will apply over the next five years are employees in retail or fast-food businesses, earning close to the state's minimum wage of $8 an hour. For such workers, the change will increase annual income by about $10,000.
A more sweeping increase in the city's minimum wage, one of Mr. de Blasio's top goals in the coming months, will have to wait -- but perhaps not for long. Mr. de Blasio, whose administration is working to help Democrats capture a majority in the State Senate, said he hoped the Legislature would take up the issue early next year.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who in February said that allowing local governments to set their own minimum wages would yield "a chaotic situation," seemed to have reversed himself months later. He said he would support a plan, advocated by the Working Families Party, that allowed municipalities with higher costs of living to set their own minimum wages.
As a result, the governor has endorsed an increase to $10.10 in the statewide minimum wage, with a provision allowing New York City and other areas to raise their minimums as much as 30 percent higher, to $13.13.
The shift by Mr. Cuomo was among several highlights this year for advocates of a higher minimum wage, which began with President Obama's support for a national minimum wage of $10.10 an hour. In June, Seattle became the first large city in America to approve a minimum wage of $15 an hour. Other cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles, have also advanced plans to increase their minimums.
It was this national momentum, Mr. de Blasio said, that altered the administration's plan to expand the living wage law by the end of February. The administration said it had at first expected only to broaden the scope of the law to cover more workers, not raise the wage itself.
"We originally anticipated building more narrowly upon the previous legislation," Mr. de Blasio said. "When we looked closely, we decided we needed to do a bigger overhaul."
Under the terms of the 2012 law, the living wage, which remains tied to inflation, increased in April to $11.90 for those without benefits -- a figure Mr. de Blasio's team had expected to maintain in the near-term.
On Monday, groups who have long campaigned for a living wage expansion, like the New York City Central Labor Council and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, praised the planned executive order.
The measure also won the endorsement of the United States labor secretary, Thomas E. Perez, who predicted it would "make other cities take notice."
But the Real Estate Board of New York, which opposed the 2012 living wage law, sounded a note of caution. The group's president, Steven Spinola, said in a statement: "We hope the de Blasio administration will work with us on a number of concerns regarding this proposal's impact and implementation."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDIn a first deal of its kind, Netflix and the Weinstein Company said Monday that they planned to release next year's sequel to the movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" simultaneously across the globe on Netflix and a select number of Imax theaters.
The film, a follow-up to Ang Lee's Academy Award-winning martial arts drama, is the first major motion picture to make its debut on the streaming service and in movie theaters at the same time. It will be available on Aug. 28 at no additional fee to Netflix subscribers and is the first of several films that Netflix is backing that will follow this new model for release. Only Imax is involved; other theater chains will not screen the film.
Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, said he hoped this deal would show Hollywood that the time had come to respond to what movie fans wanted, and to change the traditional method for releasing films -- first in theaters then, typically several months later, for streaming.
"What I am hoping is that it will be a proof point that the sky doesn't fall," Mr. Sarandos said. "These are two different experiences, like going to a football game and watching a football game on TV."
The move underscores an eagerness at Netflix to shatter the traditional so-called windowing system for movies in the same way that it has rattled the structure of the television business, with TV shows now made available for streaming soon after they are broadcast on traditional networks. Netflix has also introduced entirely new models, releasing original series like "House of Cards" and "Orange Is the New Black" all at once.
"We fundamentally believe that the only way to attack the windowing system -- that is the centerpiece of the business model of the movie industry versus what consumers want -- requires an outsider," said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst with BTIG Research. "Netflix already changed the TV business in a very, very significant way. The movie business is teed up next."
Yet the deal also reflects the challenges that persist in breaking the system, particularly in film. The film, called "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend," is a production of the independent Weinstein Company, not a major movie studio, and has a relatively modest budget. The partnership with Imax avoids one big problem: that the major theater chains refuse to break the system.
For Imax, the deal to some degree reflects the manner in which it struggles to find marquee programming during lulls in Hollywood's release calendar. Late August is sort of a cinematic black hole, a time when big studios hold back new releases to avoid competing with back-to-school activities and end-of-summer vacations.
Three theater chains -- Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark -- control the majority of movie screens in the United States, and they have aggressively opposed any encroachment on their release window, maintaining that any shortening would encourage consumers to stay home. Under current contracts, theaters get to play movies for three months without competition.
Even so, major movie studios, eager to tap into the increasing popularity of video-on-demand systems at a time when domestic box office sales are declining, have experimented with making new releases more readily available in the home. In February, for instance, Warner Bros. simultaneously released "Veronica Mars" in only 270 theaters on the same day the film was made available to buy or rent online.
Warner had very limited theatrical options because Regal and Cinemark refused to play the film, and AMC forced Warner to buy out entire auditoriums in advance rather than splitting actual ticket sales after the fact, which is the typical practice.
With Imax, Netflix and the Weinstein Company have found a similar workaround. Although a lot of Imax theaters are now housed in multiplexes owned by one of the big three chains, Imax controls what goes on its screens. Netflix has been interested in breaking into the original film business for some time, and has worked with the Weinstein Company on several projects, including the forthcoming "Marco Polo" historical adventure series, which will be shown exclusively on Netflix.
The idea to kick off this new project came out of a conversation between Mr. Sarandos and Mr. Weinstein.
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" was very much an art house film. Made for about $23.5 million in 2000, after adjusting for inflation, it took audiences -- in Mandarin, with English subtitles -- on a martial arts romp. It was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won four, including best foreign film. The film catapulted its Taiwan-born director, Mr. Lee, to the forefront of Hollywood.
Despite its art house imprimatur, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" played more like a blockbuster, which helps explain Imax's interest in the sequel. Mr. Lee's film took in $176.8 million in North America, after adjusting for inflation, for Sony Pictures Classics in 2000. It ranks as the best-selling Chinese language film in domestic box office history.
The budget for the sequel, "The Green Legend," is a multiple of that for the 2000 film, according to one person familiar with the financing.
In the sequel, Michelle Yeoh reprises her role as the warrior Yu Shu Lien but Mr. Lee does not return. The Weinstein Company has instead given the directing reins to Woo-ping Yuen, a well-known director in China. "The Green Legend," set 20 years after the events of the first movie, follows four martial arts heroes trying to protect the Green Destiny sword.
Just because the first "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" was a smash does not guarantee similarly huge ticket sales for the sequel. The independent film surge that helped wash it into the mainstream has since receded and sequels made more than a couple years after the original tend to struggle.
But the more the Weinstein Company can make "The Green Legend" feel like a must-see event the more the sequel is likely to overcome that challenge.
In an interview, Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of the Weinstein Company, said that the industry needed to explore new ways to distribute his movies.
"There is a big world out there, and there are many ways to exhibit things," Mr. Weinstein said. "This is the wave of the future."
Correction: October 1, 2014, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about plans by Netflix and the Weinstein Company to release a sequel to the movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" used an outdated working title for the new film. It is "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend," not "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Destiny." The error was repeated in an accompanying caption with a picture of the actor Donnie Yen.

Full text:   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- Weeks after President Vladimir V. Putin annexed Crimea in March, an obscure regulatory board in Moscow known as the Market Council convened inside an office tower not far from the Kremlin to discuss the country's wholesale electricity market. It is a colossal business, worth 2 percent of Russia's gross domestic product, and a rich source of fees for the bank that had long held the exclusive right to service it.
With no advance notice or public debate, though, the board voted that day in April to shift that business to Bank Rossiya, a smaller institution that lacked the ability to immediately absorb the work. For Bank Rossiya, it was a tidy coup set to yield an estimated $100 million or more in annual commissions, yet it was hardly the only new business coming in. State corporations, local governments and even the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea were suddenly shifting their accounts to the bank, too.
In a matter of days, Bank Rossiya had received an enormous windfall, nearly all from different branches of the Russian state, which was delivering a pointed message. In late March, the United States had made Bank Rossiya a primary target of sanctions, effectively ostracizing it from the global financial system. Now the Kremlin was pushing back, steering lucrative accounts its way to reduce the pain.
The reason the Kremlin rushed to prop up Bank Rossiya is the same reason that the United States, and later its European allies, placed it on the sanctions list: its privileged status as what the Obama administration calls the "personal bank" of the Putin inner circle. Built and run by some of the president's closest friends and colleagues from his early days in St. Petersburg, Bank Rossiya is emblematic of the way Mr. Putin's brand of crony capitalism has turned loyalists into billionaires whose influence over strategic sectors of the economy has in turn helped him maintain his iron-fisted grip on power.
Now the sanctions are testing the resilience of his economic and political system. Even as President Obama argues that the measures aimed at Mr. Putin's inner circle are pinching Russia's economy and squeezing the tycoons who dominate it, many of them have mocked the sanctions as a mere nuisance, the economic equivalent of a shaving cut, while the Kremlin has moved rapidly to insulate them.
Woven deeply into the Putin system is Bank Rossiya. Founded as the tiniest of banks in the twilight of the Soviet era, Bank Rossiya, through staggering, stealthy expansion backed by the largess of the state, now has nearly $11 billion in assets. It controls a vast financial empire with tentacles across the economy, including a large stake in the country's most powerful private media conglomerate, a key instrument of the Kremlin's power to shape public opinion. How well the bank survives in a time of sanctions may ultimately be a barometer of whether economic pressure is enough to make Mr. Putin stand down at a time when neighboring countries, especially in the Baltics, are increasingly anxious about a newly aggressive Russia.
Mr. Putin came to power vowing to eliminate "as a class" the oligarchs who had amassed fortunes -- and, to the new president's mind, a dangerous quotient of political sway -- under his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, in the post-Communist chaos of the 1990s. Instead, a new class of tycoons have emerged, men of humble Soviet origins who owe their vast wealth to Mr. Putin, and offer unquestioning political fealty to him in return.
"These guys emerged from scratch and became billionaires under Putin," Sergei Aleksashenko, a former deputy finance minister and central banker, said in a recent interview.
If the modern Russian state is Kremlin Inc., Mr. Putin is its chief executive officer, rewarding his friends with control of state-owned companies and doling out lucrative government contracts in deals that provoke accusations of corruption but have the veneer of legality under the Putin system.
"He has given and he has taken away," said Mikhail M. Kasyanov, who served as prime minister during Mr. Putin's first term. "They depend on him, and he depends on them."
This inner circle coalesced around Mr. Putin as he began his unobtrusive rise, from a middling career as a K.G.B. intelligence officer to a midlevel functionary in the office of St. Petersburg's mayor.
One of these loyalists is Bank Rossiya's chairman and largest shareholder, Yuri V. Kovalchuk, a physicist by training, sometimes called the Rupert Murdoch of Russia for his role as architect of the bank's media interests. Other Bank Rossiya shareholders include several of the country's wealthiest men, the son of Mr. Putin's cousin and even an old St. Petersburg friend of his, a cellist who was formerly first chair at the fabled Mariinsky Theater.
The Kremlin has long denied giving Mr. Putin's friends preferential treatment. But in acquiring many of its holdings, the privately held Bank Rossiya benefited from Kremlin directives that allowed it to purchase prize state-owned assets at what critics have called cut-rate prices. Meanwhile the true extent of its holdings is obscured by shadowy corporate shell structures that nest like matryoshka dolls, one inside the next.
Records show that the ownership of one powerful television advertising company linked to Bank Rossiya, for example, is buried in offshore companies in Panama, in the British Virgin Islands and even at a simple concrete house on Karpathou Street in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, whose owner had no idea of the company registered there.
In the early days of the conflict over Ukraine, several European leaders expressed deep ambivalence about alienating a Russia that under Mr. Putin's rule has become immeasurably wealthier than it ever was under the Soviet system. Russia has been a sought-after partner in the globalized economy, a source of cheap natural gas for Europe, where wealthy Russians have also purchased billions of dollars in real estate in places like the Cote d'Azur and the Belgravia district of London.
But that resistance has to some extent eroded, especially since the downing of a commercial airliner over eastern Ukraine in July that killed 298 people. This month, despite an edgy truce between pro-Russian separatists and government forces in Ukraine, the West announced a new round of sanctions aimed not just at Mr. Putin's powerful cronies but at the Russian economy more broadly. Some argue, however, that this punitive strategy fundamentally misunderstands the way the Putin system works.
Gennady N. Timchenko, an oil trader and Bank Rossiya investor whose own holding company is also under sanctions, admitted in a recent interview with Itar-Tass to a measure of annoyance. He was unhappy that his Learjet had been grounded because of sanctions, and that he could not vacation in France with his family and dog, Romi, which happens to be the offspring of Mr. Putin's beloved black Labrador, Koni.
And yet, he said, he would never presume to question the Russian president's policies in Ukraine, whatever the cost to companies like his. "That would be impossible," he said, going on to refer to Mr. Putin formally by his first name and patronymic. "Vladimir Vladimirovich acts in the interest of Russia in any situation, period. No compromises. It would not even enter our minds to discuss that."
'A Bouquet of Friends'
In the Kolomna district of St. Petersburg, near the shipyards, is a 19th-century palace that belonged to Grand Duke Aleksei Aleksandrovich, a son of Czar Aleksandr II. Lately its elegant halls -- this one in Baroque style, this one English, this one Chinese -- have been repurposed as the House of Music, a training academy for classical musicians.
The academy's artistic director, Sergei P. Roldugin, has his own singular back story. He is an accomplished cellist and musical director. He is certainly not a businessman, he explained at the palace the other day. "I don't have millions," he said. And yet, on paper at least, he has a fortune that could be worth $350 million. That is because, years ago, he said, he acquired shares in a small bank run by men close to his old friend Mr. Putin.
He had met Mr. Putin in the 1970s, and is godfather to his eldest daughter, Maria. He opened the House of Music with Mr. Putin's patronage. Last year, he recalled, the president asked him for a favor: would he organize a private concert?
So Mr. Roldugin traveled to the president's official residence west of Moscow, Novo-Ogaryovo, with three young musicians: a violinist, a pianist and a clarinetist. They played Mozart, Weber and Tchaikovsky -- so well, he said, that Mr. Putin invited them to play again the next night for the same small group of friends who had gathered there.
They were "of course, very famous people," Mr. Roldugin said, without revealing any names. "Quite all," he said, "are under sanctions."
The concerts are a glimpse into the small, remarkably cohesive group of men who came together around Mr. Putin as the old order was crumbling and a new, post-Soviet Russia was taking form.
When the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, began to allow the first experiments in private enterprise in the 1980s, St. Petersburg was still Leningrad, an impoverished shadow of the czarist capital it had been.
An early adapter was Mr. Kovalchuk, a physicist at the Ioffe Physical Technical Institute, who founded an enterprise to turn its scientific work into commercially viable products. Another was Mr. Timchenko, a former Soviet trade official, who formed a cooperative to export products from an oil refinery on the Baltic Sea.
What brought Mr. Putin into their orbit was the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After five years as a K.G.B. officer in East Germany, Mr. Putin was part of a wave of embittered military and intelligence officers who withdrew from the Soviet satellites and returned with few prospects to a changing homeland.
Still with the K.G.B., Mr. Putin came into contact with one of his former law professors: Anatoly A. Sobchak, a reformer who had just become chairman of the Leningrad legislature (and would later become mayor of the renamed St. Petersburg). He asked Mr. Putin to become an adviser, to smooth relations with the still-powerful security services. And when the Soviet Union collapsed, Mr. Putin joined Mr. Sobchak full time, overseeing a new committee on foreign economic relations.
The committee worked closely with Russia's emerging entrepreneurs, regulating imports and exports and distributing city contracts. Some of the deals became controversial, notably one during the hungry winter of 1991-92, of a deal to barter oil, metal and other products for food. Virtually none of the food ever materialized, and a City Council committee unsuccessfully sought to have Mr. Putin fired for incompetence.
For all that, Mr. Putin was considered an efficient, unprepossessing administrator, helping businessmen cut through the bureaucracy. His fluency in German was useful with the many Germans seeking a foothold in the city. Among them was Matthias Warnig, formerly of the East German secret police, the Stasi, who opened one of the city's first foreign banks, Dresdner.
Mr. Putin was, in short, both collecting new friends and laying the foundation for what would evolve into the system of personalized, state-sponsored capitalism now at the heart of his power.
"It was a favorable environment for such a bouquet of friends to appear," explained Mikhail I. Amosov, who served on the City Council at the time.
In many cases, contracts and property were distributed through insider deals, often without open or transparent bidding. "Everything was decided through personal connections," Mr. Amosov said. "We didn't like it."
One enterprise that received an infusion of municipal aid was Bank Rossiya.
The bank had been founded in 1990 at the initiative of the city's branch of the Communist Party, with party funds as capital. It was also believed to handle the banking needs of the K.G.B. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was all but bust.
Mr. Kovalchuk stepped in. In December 1991, he and a group of friends secured a small loan from a local shoe manufacturer and bought the foundering bank. The investors included three other alumni of the Ioffe Technical Institute -- the physicists Victor Y. Myachin and Andrei A. Fursenko, and Vladimir I. Yakunin, the institute's former head of international relations.
The reconstituted Bank Rossiya quickly became a favored city institution. At the mayor's instruction, according to news reports, the city opened several large accounts there, fattening the bank's coffers and setting it on its way.
Business connections became deeply personal connections.
In 1996, Mr. Putin joined seven businessmen, most of them Bank Rossiya shareholders, in forming a cooperative of summer homes, or dachas, called Ozero, or "lake," in the northeast of St. Petersburg. The group has come to have an outsize influence on Russia's political and economic life. The cooperative included the homes of Mr. Putin, Mr. Yakunin, Mr. Kovalchuk, Mr. Fursenko and his brother Sergei, Mr. Myachin, and Nikolai T. Shamalov, who headed the St. Petersburg office of the German manufacturer Siemens and would also acquire a major stake in Bank Rossiya. Vladimir A. Smirnov, a St. Petersburg businessman with an exclusive contract to supply the city's gasoline retailers, served as Ozero's director.
Mr. Timchenko, the oil trader, entered the Bank Rossiya circle as an investor; according to the bank, his stake is owned by a company he controls. Mr. Warnig, the German banker, would later join Bank Rossiya's board. (When Mr. Putin's wife was badly injured in a car accident, Mr. Warnig's bank arranged to pay for her medical care in Germany.)
And there was Mr. Roldugin, the cellist. "The issue was that I needed to have some money," he said, adding, "There was no money for art anywhere." His investment, he said, involved "a lot of manipulations" and required him to take out a loan. Today the bank lists him as owner of 3.2 percent of its shares.
Mr. Putin's stint in St. Petersburg ended in 1996, when his boss lost his bid for re-election. Soon Mr. Putin had a new boss, President Yeltsin. And after Mr. Yeltsin unexpectedly elevated him to prime minister and then acting president on New Year's Eve in 1999, the fortunes of many of his friends -- and their little bank -- began to be transformed.
'Bank Rossiya, That's It'
He had arrived in Moscow as a midlevel apparatchik in ill-fitting suits, had ascended to power as a thoroughly unexpected president and won his first presidential election in 2000 on the crest of war to suppress separatists in Chechnya. By 2004, Mr. Putin had become the paramount figure in Russia, winning a second term with 72 percent of the vote, in a race tainted by allegations of strong-arm tactics and vote rigging. Yet Mr. Putin probably would have won a fair election easily, too. The Russian economy, buoyed by high oil prices, was booming, creating huge fortunes and also lifting the middle class. The long era of post-Soviet gloom seemed done.
Not many people yet understood that in the middle of Russia's prosperity, the men in the tight circle close to Mr. Putin were becoming fabulously wealthy, and increasingly powerful, in what critics now consider a case study in legalized kleptocracy.
Bank Rossiya, which reported less than $1 million in profits the year before Mr. Putin became president, had grown steadily, but figures like Mr. Kovalchuk and Mr. Timchenko remained in the shadows.
"I didn't even know such names -- Timchenko, Kovalchuk," said Mr. Kasyanov, whom Mr. Putin dismissed as prime minister shortly before the elections.
During the 2004 campaign, one of Mr. Putin's quixotic challengers, Ivan P. Rybkin, did raise the issue of corruption, accusing Mr. Kovalchuk and Mr. Timchenko of acting as the president's "cashiers." But few people were listening. (Mr. Rybkin disappeared soon after making his accusation, re-emerging several days later, saying he had been kidnapped and drugged in Ukraine's capital, Kiev.)
In sanctioning Bank Rossiya, the Obama administration would resurface the "cashier" allegation, though it offered no evidence that Mr. Putin has personally profited from the bank. Mr. Kovalchuk, who through a spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment, in the past has attributed his bank's success not to any special treatment but to sound investment and business decisions.
Either way, Bank Rossiya's holdings would increase tenfold during Mr. Putin's second term. Critical to this remarkable growth was the bank's ability to snap up assets, at knockdown prices, that had previously belonged to the state-owned energy company Gazprom.
Those deals were documented in a series of reports published at the end of Mr. Putin's second term by Boris Y. Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, Vladimir V. Milov, a former deputy energy minister, and others. "The total value of the assets exfiltrated from Gazprom," they estimated, was $60 billion.
An early deal involved one of the country's biggest insurers, Sogaz. Bank Rossiya bought a controlling stake in Sogaz by acquiring shares that had been held by Gazprom. The bank paid around $100 million, according to Mr. Nemtsov and Mr. Milov, who later valued Sogaz at $2 billion.
"Putin said, 'Bank Rossiya, that's it,' " Mr. Milov later told the Russian edition of Forbes.
Sogaz became the insurer of choice for major state companies like Russian Railways, headed by Mr. Yakunin, and the growing oil giant, Rosneft, by then led by Igor I. Sechin, who had been Mr. Putin's deputy in the St. Petersburg mayor's office. Sogaz also bought 75 percent of a company called Leader that managed Gazprom's $6 billion pension fund, Gazfond. The purchase price was $30 million, less than Leader's profits that year alone, according to Mr. Nemtsov and Mr. Milov.
It seemed to be a quintessential insider deal: The year before, Yuri Shamalov, son of the Bank Rossiya shareholder and Ozero member, had been appointed chairman of Gazfond. "Shamalov Jr., as head of Gazfond, sold shares in the company managing Russia's largest private pension fund at a fantastically low price to the bank owned by his father," Mr. Nemtsov asserted.
At the same time, Mr. Kovalchuk, the bank's chairman, began assembling a media empire that now controls some of Russia's largest television and radio stations and newspapers.
Bank Rossiya had already assumed management of the assets of Gazprombank, one of Russia's largest. Now, Gazprombank purchased Gazprom Media Group, which owns five television and several radio stations. The price: $166 million.
Two years later, Dmitri A. Medvedev, a Putin protégé and first deputy prime minister, put Gazprom Media's value at $7.5 billion, or 45 times the purchase price.
Not content merely to manage media assets, Bank Rossiya began buying up media companies of its own.
In 2005, a subsidiary of Bank Rossiya bought a stake in Channel 5, a local television network owned by the St. Petersburg government. The price was $25 million. There was no competition. Channel 5's value swelled in 2006, when regulators let it acquire frequencies in 30 regions across Russia.
Soon after, Mr. Putin designated it a national broadcaster, able to reach 91 cities and 53 million people. Today, it is the country's fifth-largest broadcaster.
A year later, a Bank Rossiya subsidiary bought a controlling stake in Ren TV, today the country's eighth-largest broadcaster.
Once known for investigating government corruption and airing opposition views that were never allowed on state television, Ren TV over time became noticeably less critical.
In August, amid the fervor over Ukraine, it canceled what was widely viewed as one of the last reasonably independent national political talk shows, "Nedelya," or "The Week."
"The first goal was political control of the media," said Roman Pivovarov, a leading analyst of the Russian media landscape. "But that was achieved relatively early on. So this was as much about money. The picture today is clear, in that the big media belongs to the small circle of people who control not only the politics but the economics of Russia."
By 2008, Mr. Putin's second term was ending and the Bank Rossiya media empire provided a supportive voice when, rather than recede from politics, he decided to serve as prime minister. Mr. Medvedev was elected president, while Mr. Putin largely retained control over the levers of government.
Two years later, Mr. Kovalchuk scored his biggest prize -- a 25 percent stake in Channel 1, a state-controlled network with the largest audience in Russia. The stake cost only $150 million, "an amazingly low price," according to the newspaper Novaya Gazeta. The next year, Channel 1 reported profits of nearly $100 million.
Then, in 2012, Mr. Putin announced he would seek a third term as president. Democracy activists were deeply alarmed but powerless. No one doubted he would win, though the economy had slowed and Mr. Putin's men were targets of rising criticism, no longer hidden.
'My Friends Get Everything'
To grasp how Bank Rossiya's holdings extend around the globe -- and how island tax havens and other tools of global finance may serve to obscure their true breadth -- one place to visit is 13A Karpathou Street in Nicosia. This is the registered address of Med Media Network Limited, a company listed in a corporate flow chart connecting Bank Rossiya to a company called Video International.
In a peculiarity of the Russian marketplace, broadcasters do not sell advertising time directly. They act through middlemen like Video International, which buy airtime wholesale, then sell to those who wish to advertise.
Med Media is a major shareholder, holding a 20 percent stake. Except that Med Media's address in Cyprus is hardly a corporate headquarters at all. It is a simple concrete home with a large ficus shading a small garden. The owner, Agathi Zinonos, has never heard of Med Media or any of the other companies registered there.
She regularly receives legal documents in the mail from Russia, Bulgaria, Romania and other countries. "Every day, there is a whole packet coming," she said, noting that the documents are addressed to her son, who recently moved out. "Whatever comes, I take to him, because it is a lot of companies."
Attempting to unwind Video International's convoluted corporate structure requires going back to 2011. That is when Bank Rossiya and a couple of partners purchased the company, according to an interview given by Video International's chief executive in 2013.
Video International had controlled 70 percent of the advertising-placement market. But in the months before the sale, the government hastily enacted a new antimonopoly law, prohibiting national television networks from using advertising shops that controlled more than 35 percent of the market. Video International would have to abandon many of its contracts.
But what looked like a debacle for Video International turned out to be a boon for Bank Rossiya. The new law depressed the company's value -- and thus its purchase price. And while Video International gave up many contracts, its new owners managed to profit from the "lost" business: Many of the networks simply brought the placement business in house -- while continuing to pay Video International consulting and software-licensing fees.
Reflecting on the way the government's antimonopoly office has looked the other way, Mr. Aleksashenko, the former deputy finance minister, invoked the saying "my friends get everything, while my enemies get the law."
Among those taking part in the new arrangement was CTC Media, a company with several television channels that was partially owned by a subsidiary of Bank Rossiya. CTC continues to pay Video International around $80 million a year -- but as a consultant.
Yet while the arrangement allowed Video International to maneuver around Russian law, it may actually have placed CTC at risk of violating American sanctions. For though CTC is a Russian broadcaster, its headquarters are in Delaware and it is traded on the Nasdaq. The sanctions prohibit American-headquartered companies like CTC from doing business with entities that are majority-owned by sanctioned companies like Bank Rossiya.
But whether Bank Rossiya retains a majority stake in Video International is impossible to ascertain. Records show that, on paper at least, its shares, held by a subsidiary, are down to 15 percent. Nearly all the rest of the shareholders are buried behind fronts like Med Media of Karpathou Street.
Cyprus is one of the world's busiest offshore financial-service centers, with one of Europe's lowest corporate tax rates and laws that enable foreigners to incorporate companies within days. Nearly 270,000 companies are registered there, and many are shells created to shelter income while obscuring the real owners.
Ms. Zinonos's son, Zinon, who is listed as a Med Media director, is an administrator at Scordis, Papapetrou & Co., a Nicosia law firm that not only represents Med Media but helped create it. A partner there, Makis Chrysomilas, said his firm typically uses its own address or those of employees when establishing residence for shell companies. "We are lawyers for 4,000 or 5,000 corporations," he said. Coming up with names for them can be a challenge, he explained. So he has taken names from a book listing the thoroughbred horses auctioned in the United States. He also has named companies after streets in London and other European cities.
Cypriot laws enable the true owners of shell companies to remain secret. Of the eight corporations with shares in Video International, at least five, with a combined stake of 69 percent, are incorporated in Cyprus: Med Media, Namiral Trading Limited, Devar Investments Limited, Reibruk Limited and Attalion Investments Limited. Delving into their ownership produces yet more corporate shells, headquartered in Panama and the British Virgin Islands, equally opaque jurisdictions.
Cari N. Stinebower, who advises clients on sanctions compliance at the law firm of Crowell & Moring, called the web of shell companies a "red flag." "The way the law works," she said, "it's incumbent on CTC to understand the beneficial ownership of the company they are doing business with" to ensure that there is not "some sanctioned entity at the end of the chain."
A Video International spokesman would not reveal who was behind the shell companies, and said only that they had not been sanctioned. "Why is the shareholder structure specifically like that?" he said. "Because the shareholders decided so." A CTC official declined to say what if any due diligence the company had done to determine if it was violating the sanctions. But he said CTC was working with the Treasury Department to ensure that it complied with the law.
'A Medium-Sized Bank'
The day after Mr. Obama blacklisted Bank Rossiya, Mr. Putin met with his national security council. Told that a total of 20 people had also been sanctioned -- including three security council members, Putin compatriots from St. Petersburg -- the president turned sarcastic. "We should distance ourselves from them," he said, deadpan. "They compromise us."
As for Bank Rossiya, he went on: "As far as I recall, this is a medium-sized bank. Personally, I did not have an account there, but I will definitely open one on Monday." He later directed the presidential administration to begin depositing his official salary -- roughly $7,500 a month -- into a Bank Rossiya account.
Mr. Kovalchuk later gave a rare television interview with Dmitry K. Kiselyov, a prominent news anchor and ardent defender of Mr. Putin's Russia. The president's public gesture, Mr. Kovalchuk said, had prompted a flood of new customers, including an old, impoverished woman who wanted to deposit her life savings. For a bank with billions in assets, "this old woman means nothing financially, but the fact is that is worth more than any financial investments," he said. "There is a Putin factor, and it is unconditional. The fact is that people intuitively feel which side of the barricades business stands on."
Mr. Putin's efforts to protect the bank were not just symbolic. He ordered the Central Bank to provide assistance if needed. State-owned energy companies transferred accounts to Bank Rossiya, and the governors of St. Petersburg and the surrounding Leningrad region told state institutions in their jurisdictions to do the same, according to Russian news reports. Additionally, in the lower house of Parliament, the main party loyal to Mr. Putin provided the margin needed to rescind the law effectively limiting Video International to just 35 percent of the advertising-placement market.
And on April 10, the Market Council stepped in. The council, which regulates Russia's $35 billion wholesale electricity market, is a nonprofit organization with 22 members representing government ministries as well as major producers and suppliers of electricity. One of the council's members is an executive at Inter RAO UES, a private enterprise spun off from the former state electricity monopoly. Its chief executive is Mr. Kovalchuk's son, Boris; its board chairman is Mr. Sechin, the president of the state-owned oil giant Rosneft and one of Mr. Putin's closest advisers.
The council met at its office in Moscow's World Trade Center. A spokeswoman declined to discuss the vote, except to say that a quorum attended, explaining that she did not want to contribute to an "anti-Russian" article. The decision to shift the business to Bank Rossiya, she said, was one of several routine actions taken during a regular meeting that day. In remarks published on the council's website in May, its director, Maksim S. Bystrov, said Bank Rossiya had "brought us" a proposal with lower commissions than those charged by the previous bank, Alfa. But he declined to provide details, and Alfa Bank declined to comment.
As the United States and Europe continue to ratchet up the economic pressure, it is an open question how long the government can continue to prop up the growing number of institutions faced with sanctions. Russia's economy had been struggling even before the annexation of Crimea. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently predicted that, with the added impact of Western sanctions and Mr. Putin's retaliatory embargo on Western goods, the economy could contract next year.
Other companies are lining up behind Bank Rossiya, hoping for bailouts. The government recently announced that it would pump $6.6 billion into two state-controlled banks whose access to foreign capital has been cut. And Mr. Sechin's Rosneft has requested a $42 billion loan.
For his part, Mr. Putin has denounced the sanctions as unfairly targeting people with no influence over Russia's policies on Crimea or Ukraine. "Yes, these people are my friends and I'm proud to have such friends," he said at an economic forum in St. Petersburg in May. "They are true patriots and their business is oriented towards Russia. Have these sanctions done damage to them? Yes, they have. If I'm being honest, they have. But they are seasoned entrepreneurs and brought all their money back to Russia, so don't worry about them too much."

Abstract: Pimco's flagship fund, the Total Return Fund, which Mr. Gross founded in 1987 and was still running at the time of his departure, became the largest actively managed mutual fund in the world, with about $222 billion in assets under management. Since the middle of last year, Mr. Gross's fund has bled close to $70 billion, as investors have taken out money for 16 consecutive months.

Full text:   For decades, the investor William H. Gross was celebrated as his mutual fund ballooned in size, drawing investors attracted by its excellent returns.
But Mr. Gross's forced departure on Friday from Pimco, following more recent lackluster performance, investor withdrawals and regulatory troubles, not only cast a spotlight on his own missteps but also highlighted just how precarious managing an enormous bond fund has become as investors around the world worry about higher interest rates.
His success came largely in a time of easy liquidity and low interest rates. Now, as the Federal Reserve moves to push rates higher, investing in the bond market has become more challenging.
And as the fund grew and Mr. Gross could not duplicate his earlier success, even as other bond funds prospered, it also became more complex and harder for smaller, retail investors -- among the core investors in the fund -- to figure out what Mr. Gross was doing.
"He was using all sorts of derivatives and swaps -- it was really tough for an outsider to grasp," said Jeff Tjornehoj, an analyst with the mutual fund research company Lipper.
That complexity may have seemed at odds with Mr. Gross's reputation as someone who was able to simplify the arcane workings of the bond market for a growing community of investors -- many of them disappointed with stocks -- who were looking to put their savings in high-performing bond funds.
Pimco's flagship fund, the Total Return Fund, which Mr. Gross founded in 1987 and was still running at the time of his departure, became the largest actively managed mutual fund in the world, with about $222 billion in assets under management.
It used to be a lot bigger, though.
Since the middle of last year, Mr. Gross's fund has bled close to $70 billion, as investors have taken out money for 16 consecutive months. This retreat is the result of period of subpar performance for the fund and, some analysts believe, the very public dispute that Mr. Gross had with his No. 2 executive, Mohamed A. El-Erian, who left Pimco in January.
Still, for those investors who have kept the faith, Mr. Gross had continued to be the face of the fund and the firm. On Friday, analysts from Sanford C. Bernstein & Company estimated that as much as 30 percent of all investor money at Pimco -- which manages an astonishing $2 trillion in assets -- could follow its co-founder out the door.
When it comes to bonds, Pimco fund managers own nearly everything: commanding positions in United States Treasuries, government-owned companies in Russia and Brazil and every variety of mortgage security.
Analysts believe that Pimco ultimately became too big to be managed by one man. The abrupt departure of Mr. Gross briefly rattled a few markets on Friday and could lead to additional turmoil.
Expecting a surge of outflows from Pimco funds, speculators may be able to take aim at major Pimco holdings and make bets that they will fall when Pimco fund managers are forced to sell them.
In a paper this month, the Bank of International Settlements, which calls itself a bank for central banks, warned of dangers in the tremendous growth of the asset management industry. Many of the larger managers, it turns out, were investing in the same securities, be they Italian government bonds or bonds of Petrobras, the Brazilian oil giant.
Especially vulnerable, the paper said, were funds with a large component of retail investors, who are prone to exit their positions more quickly than institutional funds are.
All it takes, the bank said in effect, is for one fund to start selling. If the selling is pronounced enough, others will follow.
Pimco, for example, has become one of the larger holders of Italian government bonds, and exposure to Italy in its Total Return Fund is 8 percent, the second-highest country position after the United States. That fund also holds a range of Spanish and Greek government bonds.
When news of Mr. Gross's departure was made public, the prices of Spanish and Italian bonds fell slightly, along with the Mexican peso. Mr. Gross has identified Mexico as an investment favorite.
For years, Mr. Gross had taken advantage of low interest rates, deploying sophisticated strategies and hiring smart managers to produce a streak of superior performance.
Then he made a prediction that interest rates would rise. When they did not, the fund suffered.
Pimco "thought interest rates would spike, and they were wrong," said Russel Kinnel, a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.
Prominent investors like Mr. Gross frequently make bad calls, and they usually recover. But concerns over the management turmoil and Mr. Gross's odd behavior -- in June, he wore sunglasses while giving an investor presentation -- apparently made investors less willing to stick with the fund.
Mr. Gross has recently said in speeches and investment letters that he expects interest rates to remain fairly low during a period of weak growth and negligible inflation throughout the world. In such an environment, investing in higher-yielding, riskier bonds and derivatives can be a way to increase returns, although the downside is that investors lose their sense of what their fund is trying to accomplish.
What remains uncertain is whether his successor shares this view -- and whether that person can stanch the flow of money out of Pimco's funds.
Still, in today's increasingly complex markets, it will be Pimco's gigantic size that will worry regulators concerned about financial stability and investors looking for better returns.
"I am not so sure that the challenge for Bill Gross was the large fund he managed," said Mr. Tjornehoj. "It was the challenge of the large company."
Bill Gross Leaves Pimco, Reportedly Under Pressure, to Join Janus

Full text:   PARIS -- The eurozone's economic expansion continued to lose traction in September, a private-sector report said on Tuesday, the latest indication that the stagnation of the second quarter might be taking hold.
A survey of purchasing managers conducted by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm, showed that output in services and manufacturing was barely positive in September. Markit's composite output index for the 18-nation currency area fell to 52.3, the lowest level this year, from 52.5 in August.
While a number above 50 still signals expansion, Markit said that at that level, the eurozone's gross domestic product was likely to grow "at best" at a 0.3 percent quarterly rate in the third quarter, equivalent to a 1.2 percent annual rate. The eurozone economy stagnated in the second quarter, as Germany and Italy contracted and France did not grow.
By contrast, the United States economy grew an annualized 4.2 percent in the second quarter after a poor start to 2014, and is expected to grow more than 2 percent in the third quarter.
The eurozone's inability to attain escape velocity has become a matter of increasing concern for policy makers at a time when some 18 million people across the bloc are unable to find work and households are reluctant to spend.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, warned on Monday that the recovery "is losing momentum," and chastised governments for not taking advantage of the grace provided by low borrowing costs to carry out structural reforms.
Alarmed at the potential for Europe to pull down its global trading partners at a time of uncertainty about geopolitical risks in Russia and Ukraine, and worried that the eurozone's low inflation might tip into deflation, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week urged the European Central Bank to undertake large-scale bond-buying to provide more monetary stimulus.
Speaking on Monday at the European Parliament, Mr. Draghi said the central bank was "ready to use additional unconventional instruments within our mandate," an indication that quantitative easing remains an option.
The Markit survey of purchasing managers gives economists and policy makers a nearly real-time view of trends. A 2011 study by the European Central Bank described it as providing "a 'low-tech,' fairly accurate way of projecting G.D.P. for both the euro area and national economies."
Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the latest surveys indicated the fourth quarter might also be weaker than previously anticipated, as manufacturing companies' new orders are decreasing for the first time in more than a year, "and business expectations about the year ahead turned down in the services sector, led down by a slump in confidence in Germany."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Two Federal Reserve officials who have warned loudly and persistently that the Fed is overreaching in its economic stimulus campaign plan to retire next year after completing terms on the Fed's policy-making committee.
Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia since 2006, said on Monday that he would retire in March. Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas since 2005, is required to step down by the end of April.
Both men dissented at the committee's most recent meeting, last week, arguing that the central bank is not retreating fast enough from its support program as the economy gains strength.
The departures are unlikely to have a large influence on policy. The two men, and a handful of like-minded officials, have been marginalized in recent years as their warnings that inflation would accelerate have failed to materialize. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, have chosen to press ahead with majority support rather than seeking unanimity.
Still, the turnover is part of a gradual generational shift at the Fed as policy makers trained in the 1970s, who tend to fear inflation above all else, are gradually replaced by younger officials more comfortable with pursuing broader policy goals.
Annual inflation in the United States has averaged 3.8 percent during Mr. Plosser's adult life. By contrast, inflation has averaged just 2.5 percent during the adult life of Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who at 50 is the youngest member of the policy-making committee and who has become the most outspoken proponent of expanding the Fed's stimulus campaign.
The influence of recent events, rather than the 1970s, was also evident in the advocacy of Jeremy C. Stein, 54, who recently completed a brief stint on the Fed's board, for policy makers to consider potential threats to the stability of financial markets in setting policy.
Successors for Mr. Fisher and Mr. Plosser will be selected by the boards of their reserve banks, made up of local business and community leaders, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve's board of governors in Washington. Their eventual successors will not vote on policy until 2017.
The presidents of the 12 regional reserve banks hold rotating votes on the Fed's open market committee, which sets monetary policy. They also oversee the work of the reserve banks, including financial regulation, operating parts of the nation's financial plumbing, and directing large staffs of economic researchers.
Mr. Plosser, 66, was an economics professor at the University of Rochester before joining the Philadelphia Fed in 2006. He has embraced a role as a policy advocate for the idea -- prevalent among many academic economists -- that the Fed tends to overestimate its power. Central banks, in this view, are largely limited to the ability to control inflation, and they should focus on doing so.
In 2008, he voted reluctantly in favor of the Fed's efforts to arrest the financial crisis, and then almost immediately began to express misgivings about its efforts to revive growth, including the Fed's expansive bond-buying campaigns.
As a member of the committee in 2011 and again this year, he has dissented frequently, but he has not been able to shift the Fed's course. During Mr. Plosser's tenure, the Fed has never moved in the direction of tighter policy.
He has had greater success in promoting a related view that the Fed should conduct policy on the basis of predictable rules. He worked with Ms. Yellen, during her term as vice chairwoman, on a 2012 document that for the first time formalized 2 percent annual inflation as a primary goal of the Fed's monetary policy.
Ms. Yellen praised Mr. Plosser's work on that policy statement on Monday, adding: "My colleagues and I will miss his keen insights, deep analysis and good humor."
Under Fed rules, Mr. Plosser could have served until August 2016. The Philadelphia Fed's statement did not explain the timing of his departure and a spokeswoman said that Mr. Plosser had decided not to speak with the news media on Monday.
Mr. Plosser said in a statement that it was "a unique opportunity and privilege to serve" during "an extraordinary period in this nation's economic history."
Mr. Fisher, who has frequently joined Mr. Plosser in dissent, is regarded by his colleagues as something of a maverick. Most of them are trained economists; he is an investor who made a fortune in private equity deals before joining the Dallas Fed in 2005.
He is among the most frequently quoted Fed officials, opining on television and giving colorful speeches with even more colorful titles like the recent, "Comments on Tailored Regulation and Forward Guidance (With Reference to Dr. Seuss, Strother Martin in Cool Hand Luke and Other Serious Economists)."
In 2008, he repeatedly played down evidence of economic collapse. With the crisis in full swing, Mr. Fisher initially dissented from the Fed's interventions in December 2008 before changing his vote to preserve the appearance of unity.
More recently, he has warned that the Fed was encouraging excessive speculation in financial markets, risking a new round of bubbles.
"We are at risk of doing what the Fed has too often done: overstaying our welcome by staying too loose too long," Mr. Fisher said in July. "We risk not only doing damage to the economy but also being viewed as politically pliant."
Mr. Fisher, 64, has not set a departure date, but Fed policy requires reserve bank presidents appointed after the age of 50 to step down after 10 years. A spokesman said he would pick a date between January and April.

Abstract: The Census Bureau said last week that the inflation-adjusted median household income -- pay for people at the exact midpoint of the income distribution -- was $51,939 in 2013, up just $180 from 2012 and still 8 percent below 2007 levels.

Full text:   In Scotland this week, a measure to become an independent country and end the United Kingdom as we know it failed, but it would have succeeded with a swing of just 5 percent of the vote. Earlier in the week, a right-wing anti-immigration party in Sweden claimed its largest-ever share of parliamentary votes. And in the United States, new census data released this week showed that middle-income American families made 8 percent less last year, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 2007.
What these stories have in common is this: They lay bare a crisis of faith in the global elite.
There has been an implicit agreement in modern democracies: It is fine for the wealthy and powerful to enjoy private jets and outlandishly expensive homes so long as the mass of people also see steadily rising standards of living. Only the first part of that bargain has been met, and voters are expressing their frustration in ways that vary depending on the country but that have in common a sense that the established order isn't serving them.
It was evident not just in last week's votes in Scotland and Sweden, but also in a wave of votes for parties of the far left and the far right in European parliamentary elections earlier this year, in the rise of the Tea Party in the United States and in instability in Japanese politics that led to six prime ministers since 2007.
The details of Scotland's grievances with the English ruling class are almost the diametrical opposite of those, say, of the Tea Party or Swedish right-wingers. The Scots want more social welfare spending rather than less, and they have a strong antinuclear environmental streak. (Scotland's threatened secession was less the equivalent of Texas pulling out of the United States than of Massachusetts or Oregon doing the same.)
But there are always people who have disagreements with the direction of policy in their nation; the whole point of a state is to have an apparatus that channels disparate preferences into one sound set of policy choices. What distinguishes the current moment is that discontent with the way things are going is so high as to test many people's tolerance for governing institutions as they now exist.
There is simple economic math behind it. Consider the United States, which has had stronger growth than Britain, Japan or Continental Europe since the financial crisis and the deep recession it spawned. The United States economy is now 6.7 percent bigger than it was at the end of 2007.
But that masks what has been a miserable last several years for most working Americans. The Census Bureau said last week that the inflation-adjusted median household income -- pay for people at the exact midpoint of the income distribution -- was $51,939 in 2013, up just $180 from 2012 and still 8 percent below 2007 levels.
It gets worse. The 2007 peak in real median household income was slightly below the 1999 peak. In other words, a middle-class American family is worse off financially today than it was 15 years ago.
Discussion of the economy generally focuses on things like job creation and the growth of the gross domestic product. But you can't eat G.D.P. Median income is the rubber-meets-the-road measure of how the mass of Americans are living, and the results aren't good.
The sense that the system isn't working for most American workers pervades public opinion polling, including a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll. Seventy percent of respondents disapproved of congressional Republicans, but congressional Democrats fared barely better, with 61 percent disapproval. Fifty-three percent disapproved of President Obama's handling of the economy; similar numbers disapproved of President George W. Bush at this point in his presidency.
Or, instead of polls, you can look at results, where every election seems to have the potential to be a wave election, in which one side makes major gains. The idea of overwhelmingly electing President Obama and congressional Democrats in 2008 and turning around and overwhelmingly favoring Tea Party Republicans in 2010 may not seem consistent, but it's what you might expect in a world where the political mainstream has delivered consistently mediocre results.
In Britain, a Labour government led by a Scottish prime minister (Gordon Brown) and his Scottish finance minister (Alistair Darling) supported the so-called financialization of the British economy, with the rise of global megabanks in an increasingly cosmopolitan London as the center of the economic strategy.
Then, in 2008, the banks nearly collapsed and were bailed out, and the British economy hasn't been the same. That economic failure ushered in a coalition government in 2010 that is even less aligned with the Scots' preferred policies, bringing an age of austerity when the Scots would prefer to widen the social safety net.
But it is in Continental Europe that the consequences of bungling by mainstream elites are perhaps the most damaging, and the most dangerous.
The decades-long march toward a united continent, led by the parties of the center-right and center-left, created a Western Europe in which there was a single currency and monetary authority. But that authority did not have the political, fiscal and banking union that would make it possible for imbalances among those countries to work themselves out without the benefit of currency fluctuations. When it all came to a head from 2008 to 2012, national leaders were alarmed enough by the risks of budget deficits that they responded by cutting spending and raising taxes.
As such, the imbalances that built up over the years in Europe are now working themselves out through astronomical unemployment levels and falling wages in countries like Spain and Greece. Even the Northern European economies, including Germany's, are experiencing little or no growth. While the Great Depression of the 1930s brought an initially sharper contraction in economic activity, the European economy is performing worse six years after the 2008 crisis than it was at the comparable point in the 1930s.
In European Parliament elections in May this year, major inroads were made by parties of the extreme right and left. The entire post-World War II effort to build a united Europe will now include parties that use Nazi imagery and those that consider themselves communist. When The Huffington Post can post something called "9 Scariest Far-Right Parties Now in the European Parliament" and not be accused of exaggeration, something has gone wrong in the European project.
The details of the policy mistakes differ, as do the political movements that have arisen in protest. But together, they are a reminder that power is not a right, it is a responsibility. And no matter how entrenched our governmental institutions may seem, they rest on a bedrock assumption: that the leaders entrusted with power will deliver the goods.

Abstract: [...]Wyoming charges $14,000 for out-of-state students, which makes it cheaper for the Illinois resident to stay home. The bottom line is that better-informed consumers can't do much to hold down prices in public colleges, because those prices are not set in a competitive market.

Full text:   College costs have been rising for decades. Slowing -- or even better, reversing -- that trend would get more people into college and help reduce student debt. The Obama administration is working on an ambitious plan intended to rein in college costs, and it deserves credit for tackling this tough job.
Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to work, at least not in controlling tuition at public colleges, which enroll a vast majority of students. The plan might dampen prices at expensive private colleges, but some of them may close if they can't survive on lower tuition.
The program is an attempt to rate colleges according to practical measures like dropout rates, earnings of graduates and affordability. The aim is to improve the quality of higher education while also bringing down costs.
First, consider public colleges (attended by about 80 percent of undergraduates), where tuition has grown faster than inflation for decades. From 1988 to 2013, average tuition at four-year public colleges more than doubled, even after adjusting for inflation.
Yet here is a surprising fact: Public colleges are collecting about the same revenue per student today as they were 25 years ago. In 1988, educational revenue per full-time-equivalent student at public colleges was $11,300; in 2013, it was $11,500. (These amounts are adjusted for inflation and are expressed in 2013 dollars.)
That's just a 3 percent increase. How can this be? If tuition has doubled, shouldn't public colleges be getting double the revenue?
To reconcile this paradox, we need some background on college finances. Public colleges depend on two sources of revenue for educating undergraduates: tuition from students and appropriations from their state legislatures. Top research institutions, like the University of Michigan and University of Virginia, also get revenue from endowments, research grants and teaching hospitals. But most students attend public schools where tuition and state funds pay for almost everything.
In 1988, state legislatures gave their public colleges an average of $8,600 a student. Students contributed an additional $2,700 in tuition, which gets us to a total of $11,300. By 2013, states were kicking in just $6,100, while students were contributing $5,400; this gets us to a total of $11,500.
As far as students are concerned, public tuition has doubled. As far as public colleges are concerned, funding is flat.
At public colleges, then, the explanation for rising tuition prices isn't spiraling costs. The costs are the same, but the burden of paying those costs has shifted from state taxpayers to students.
Given this structure, can a ratings system affect tuition prices at public colleges? Not really.
Economic theory predicts that in a competitive market, informed consumers will choose the cheapest option that meets their needs. This puts competitive pressure on businesses to hold prices down.
But consumers cannot do much when they learn that their state's colleges are expensive. For example, public four-year colleges are much more expensive in Illinois (averaging about $12,000 a year for state residents) than in Wyoming ($4,400). But the two states don't compete with each other for students at these prices, which are restricted to residents. In fact, Wyoming charges $14,000 for out-of-state students, which makes it cheaper for the Illinois resident to stay home.
Of course, Illinois residents could vote with their feet by moving to Wyoming. But mass migration was probably not the mechanism the Obama administration had in mind for reducing college costs.
The bottom line is that better-informed consumers can't do much to hold down prices in public colleges, because those prices are not set in a competitive market. Instead, they are determined through a political process, so it is only through the ballot box that people can affect them. Perhaps one of the quiet goals of the proposed rating system is to rally voter support for increased funding for public colleges.
When it comes to private colleges, I am more optimistic that the rating system could affect consumer choices and college prices.
Many private, four-year colleges compete nationally for students. A transparent rating could help a student who is wavering among several such schools to pick the least expensive one. And many private colleges have close substitutes in the public sector, where tuition prices are much lower. In particular, community colleges and two-year, for-profit colleges (known as proprietary schools) offer many of the same training programs -- but the proprietary schools almost always charge much higher tuition, and their students take on larger loans. A rating system could nudge these students toward the cheaper community colleges.
The proposed rating system also includes an accountability program: Colleges judged to be high performers would get bonuses, and their students would receive larger federal grants.
Yet I don't see how this program could reduce tuition. If a college cares about this financial incentive, it must be hungry for revenue. But why would such a college hold down tuition -- resulting in substantial and certain loss of revenue -- for a relatively small, uncertain bonus?
The federal government already uses pay-for-performance in other settings -- for example, in worker training and health insurance. As I noted in an earlier Upshot column, Medicare ties reimbursements to hospital performance, and its experience is particularly relevant for the proposed college rating system.
There are common challenges in rating colleges and hospitals. A hospital that treats elderly patients will tend to have higher mortality rates, just as a college teaching poorly prepared students will tend to have higher dropout rates.
"Risk adjusted" performance ratings take these population differences into account. In deciding how to calculate the ratings, the administration could benefit from the insights of those who have worked on similar efforts in health care.
But here's a caution: If this system of ratings and incentives works as intended, it will do so by causing pain. Some private colleges -- particularly those that lack endowments and rely heavily on tuition -- may be forced to close their doors if they lose too many students. The colleges will do everything they can to avoid this, including lobbying to tweak the ratings.
That kind of political interference, however, would undo the entire effort. While the details of how the ratings will be calculated -- and who will do the calculating -- have yet to be released, it would make sense to assign the task to a nongovernmental institute. A college rating system will work only if it can be trusted by the consumers it is intended to help, and that means shielding the ratings from political manipulation.
The Obama administration seems intent on putting the ratings in place in short order. Along with many others, I advise slowing down to get it right. A hastily executed system that relies on faulty data and ill-conceived measures will be not a proud legacy of this administration but a lasting liability.

Full text:   The Venezuelan government early this year responded to a wave of street protests by jailing opposition leaders, deploying the army against unarmed protesters and tightening control of the media. The deplorable tactics have largely driven an inspiring opposition movement underground, depriving Venezuelans of the right to challenge a leader who has put a once-prosperous nation on a perilous track.
The imprisonment and trial of an opposition leader, Leopoldo López, show how far President Nicolás Maduro is willing to go to stave off legitimate grievances in a country he and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, mismanaged. Mr. López, a 43-year-old Harvard-educated politician, has been jailed since Feb. 18, when the authorities accused him of instigating violent demonstrations. Some 1,700 demonstrators are awaiting trial and more than 70 remain jailed.
Mr. López's trial, which began in July, is a travesty. The indictment bizarrely contends that Mr. López, who peacefully called for Mr. Maduro's resignation, incited violence through "subliminal" messages conveyed during public speeches demanding change that won him strong public support. The judge in the case approved more than 100 witnesses for the prosecution and rejected all but two defense witnesses. Mr. Maduro, who has called Mr. López an American pawn, has told reporters, "He has to pay, and he's going to pay," all but determining the outcome.
The human rights abuses and Venezuela's ailing economy are an outgrowth of the political crisis that has gripped the country in the past decade. The socialist policies Mr. Chávez adopted after taking office in 1999 markedly reduced poverty and expanded opportunities in a country with a long history of entrenched inequality. But his despotic governing style led the country down a dark path. And he drove out capital and talent by nationalizing key industries and asserting greater government control of the oil sector, the country's economic engine. Insecurity and inflation soared during his years in power.
Mr. Maduro, lacking Mr. Chávez's charisma and shrewd political instincts, has proved to be an even more dangerous and divisive leader. Venezuelans now suffer from shortages of basic commodities, including milk. Inflation surpassed 60 percent this summer. Leading economists have suggested that Venezuela, which has the world's largest oil reserves, could default on its foreign debt this fall. Unable to reverse the decline, Mr. Maduro rails about foreign conspiracies and has throttled a once-free press. Several news organizations that used to be critical of the government have been forced by mysterious new owners to take pro-government stances.
Venezuela's dismal state has alarmed its neighbors, but those with influence over Caracas have not wanted to appear to interfere with the internal affairs of others. The Maduro government's abuses are dangerous for the region and certainly warrant strong criticism from Latin American leaders.
Next year, Venezuela is expected to get a seat for a two-year term on the United Nations Security Council, based on a rotation that countries from the region negotiated several years ago. This would give the Maduro government an important and prestigious appointment on a body that is expected to tackle critical issues, including the global response against fighters of the Islamic State. Colombia, Brazil and other Latin American countries should lead an effort to prevent Caracas from representing the region when it is fast becoming an embarrassment on the continent.

Full text:   THE net worth of American households is now 20 percent higher than it was before it began to decline in 2007, the Federal Reserve reported this week. It said the households together were worth $81.5 trillion at the end of the second quarter, higher than ever and up 10 percent from a year earlier.
By another measure, household net worth is a little short of the record highs reached before the recession. It amounted to 471 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in the second quarter, just short of the record 473 percent set in early 2007.
Those figures are not adjusted for inflation. But adjusted for the change in the Consumer Price Index, household wealth is also at a record high, 4 percent above the 2007 level.
The recovery in household wealth has come in ways that favor the wealthiest households. The Fed estimated that real estate owned by households is worth $22.9 trillion, 6 percent less than seven years earlier but 27 percent more than at the bottom of the real estate market in 2011.
The biggest gains for households came in the equity markets. The Fed said households now owned $21 trillion in stock and mutual fund shares, 37 percent more than seven years earlier and almost 160 percent more than they owned at the bottom of the bear market in 2009.
While many people own stocks and mutual fund shares, by far the largest holdings are among those who are the wealthiest. In 2012, more than a third of dividends reported on tax returns went to taxpayers earning at least $2 million a year. That is more than double the share of dividends that went to those with taxable incomes of $100,000 or less.
During the recession, many households moved into safer fixed-income assets, including bonds issued by companies and governments. But with speculation that interest rates will rise, reducing the value of outstanding bonds, households have reduced their holdings to $3.5 trillion, a few billion less than in 2007. Total debt for households and nonprofit organizations equaled 77 percent of G.D.P., the lowest level since 2002. That figure peaked at 96 percent in early 2009.
Debt has also fallen for other sectors of the economy. The financial sector, including banks, had total debt at the end of the second quarter equal to 81 percent of G.D.P., the lowest level since 2000 and down from a peak of 119 percent. Loans to nonfinancial businesses have been rising in recent quarters, and now equal 67 percent of G.D.P., but that is lower than the peak of 74 percent reached in 2009.
The decline in household debt is largely due to lower mortgage debt, particularly home equity loans. But consumer credit has continued to rise and now equals a record 19 percent of G.D.P.
That is largely because of the continued surge in student loan debt -- an obligation concentrated in younger households and among those who are far from wealthy. It has more than doubled since 2007. In 2006, when the Fed began to report on student loan debt as a separate category, the debt totaled $509 billion, or 22 percent of total consumer debt. Now, it equals $1.3 trillion, a 40 percent share of consumer debt.
That is more than Americans owe either on credit card debts ($839 billion) or auto loans ($919 billion).
Auto debt, however, has recovered and is now 17 percent higher than it was before the recession. That is 5.3 percent of G.D.P., well below the 6.5 percent record set in 2003.
While private sector debt has generally declined, at least relative to the size of the economy, government debt has been rising. But with the federal budget deficit falling, the ratio of federal government debt to G.D.P. slipped to 72.9 percent in the second quarter from 73.6 percent three months earlier.
Chart Richer Households, Thanks to Wall Street: Seven Years After Households' Financial Conditions Began to Deteriorate in 2007, Their Net Worth Is 20 Percent Higher Than the Prerecession Peak. Real Estate Values Have Not Completely Recovered, but Households Have a Lot More Money in the Bank and Have Profited From Rising Stock Prices. Their Total Debt Is Little Changed From Prerecession Levels, but the Makeup of That Debt has Changed. Households Owe Less in Mortgage and Credit Card Debts, but Auto Loans Are Up and Student Loan Debt has Doubled. (Source: Federal Reserve Board, Via Haver Analytics)

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- FOR the last six years, Federal Reserve policy has been sexy, or at least as sexy as monetary policy can ever be.
Leaders of the central bank have had to improvise answers to tremendously consequential questions.
What should the Fed do to combat a severe financial crisis? (Pretty much anything they could think of, and then some, was the answer.)
What should the Fed do to stimulate a depressed economy when interest rates are already near zero? (Buy trillions of dollars in securities and pledge to keep interest rates at zero for a really long time.)
Should it consider more radical measures like lifting its target for inflation? (No.)
But now, the big questions of Fed policy have mostly been answered, all the more so after this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the news conference on Wednesday by Janet L. Yellen, its chairwoman. And that is terrific news.
Want to know what Fed policy makers will do in the next couple of years? It's all laid out.
At their October policy meeting, they are going to end their program of buying bonds to try to stimulate growth.
Sometime next year, they will raise their target for short-term interest rates, which has been at zero since the end of 2008. They will gradually increase that rate until it gets to somewhere in the 3 to 4 percent range in 2017. They will hold on to most of the securities they have acquired as part of their quantitative easing programs for quite a long time; it could take until the end of the decade for the Fed balance sheet to get back to normal.
If the economy does better than they expect -- growing faster than the roughly 3 percent pace they expect in 2014, for example -- they will do all those things faster than they now forecast, and move more slowly if they underperform.
Want more detail on how they will exit from their era of extraordinary support for the economy? Or the range of expectations of future interest rates, and the economic forecast that supports that outlook? All that is addressed in documents released Wednesday.
There are open questions on exactly how far the Yellen Fed will move to end its era of extraordinary support for the economy. But they are either minor ones in the scheme of things (does it first raise interest rates in March 2015, or June, or September?) or ones dependent on much bigger questions that nobody can answer for sure (has the long-term potential of the United States economy been permanently damaged by the downturn?).
You may not like the Fed's policy strategy. But the problems with it now are not a lack of clarity or transparency. Yes, something could come along to throw an unexpected wrench into all this, but if the American economy proceeds pretty much the way it has the last couple of years, with steady and gradually improving growth and few inflationary signs, we know what Ms. Yellen's policy will look like.
There is an entire world of people, small as it may be, who are paid -- often very well, indeed -- to parse the finer points of Federal Reserve policy to advise people who buy and sell bonds, currencies and the like. They spent Wednesday afternoon doing things like counting how many blue dots had been moved slightly higher or lower in a table revealing Fed officials' forecasts of interest rates in 2017, and pondering why the 2015 projection for gross domestic product growth might have been reduced by two-tenths of a percent. Life isn't very exciting for them anymore.
But because it's fun and intellectually interesting to parse the small differences between the last Fed statement and the new one and so on, we can sometimes miss the big picture. The economy may not be going gangbusters, but it is now far removed from crisis mode. And the Fed, after years of improvising a response to an unprecedented crisis, is going back to its usual self: slow-moving, deliberate and more than a little bit boring.
That may be less exciting for those of us who make a career out of parsing the words that emanate from the Marriner S. Eccles Building, the Fed's headquarters here. But it's better for everybody else.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise interest rates.
The economic recovery has stayed on course in recent months, and the Fed's policy-making committee said on Wednesday that it saw no reason to change its own plans, rejecting calls for a faster retreat from its long-running stimulus campaign.
"There are still too many people who want jobs but cannot find them, too many who are working part time but would prefer full-time work, and too many who are not searching for a job but would be if the labor market were stronger," the central bank's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said at a news conference.
As expected, the Fed said it would move to end its most recent bond-buying campaign after adding a final $15 billion in October to its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, according to a statement published after a two-day meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee.
The Fed also on Wednesday published a description of the plans for the next phase in its slow retreat from its policy to encourage economic growth, including some expected changes in the mechanics of monetary policy.
But it added that it planned to continue the mainstay of its campaign, holding short-term interest rates near zero, for a "considerable time." The phrase is generally understood to mean that the Fed does not intend to raise rates before the middle of next year. Walking a tightrope, Ms. Yellen emphasized both that a rate increase was not imminent and that the Fed could act sooner. The timing, she said repeatedly, would be determined by data on the actual course of the economy in the coming months.
"That really is so important for market participants to keep in mind," she said.
Bond investors, the Fed's primary audience, drove up yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond to 2.6 percent. Stock markets fell sharply in the moments after the Fed released its various statements, then rose sharply, then called the whole thing off. The S.&P. 500-stock index ended the day up 0.13 percent at 2,001.57.
The Fed appeared to be playing for time, delaying decisions about its next steps for as long as possible as it grapples with the limits of its ability to improve economic conditions. Fed officials downgraded their expectations for growth in 2015 in forecasts published at the same time as the policy statement, suggesting that they had once again overestimated the strength of the recovery.
Officials now expect the economy to grow from 2.6 to 3 percent next year, compared with June forecasts for growth of 3 to 3.2 percent.
Despite the disappointing results, officials have generally concluded this is not a reason for the Fed to increase its efforts, but instead evidence that the potential output of the American economy has been permanently reduced by the Great Recession and by long-term problems like an aging population and reduced innovation.
If the Fed pushes too hard, unsustainable growth could eventually generate faster inflation. If it stops pushing too soon, however, damage that could have been repaired by additional stimulus may last indefinitely: Many people who could have found jobs might never return to the work force.
Ms. Yellen spent much of her news conference on Wednesday avoiding questions about this balance, often taking considerable time to say very little.
Still, simply by holding steady, the Fed is prolonging its effort to improve economic conditions, and supporters of the campaign applauded.
"Kudos to the Yellen Fed for not signaling a more hawkish stance in an economy that still needs their support," wrote Jared Bernstein, a fellow at the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. "When it comes to economic policy makers still trying to do something big to help the macroeconomy, the Fed's the only game in town."
Critics warned -- as they have for several years -- that the Fed was doing too much, with potential consequences including inflation and financial instability. The House on Wednesday passed a Republican bill intended to limit the Fed's flexibility by requiring it to adopt a rule for making monetary policy, and to explain its deviations. The measure was not expected to progress in the Democrat-controlled Senate.
The Fed committee acted by a vote of 8 to 2. Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, argued that economic conditions had improved sufficiently for the Fed to signal it could begin to retreat more quickly.
"The growing dissent in voting reflects the increasing disagreement amongst the F.O.M.C. that the Fed chair has been trying to iron out, regarding how much more accommodation the economy still needs to a sustain a robust recovery," said Michael Dolega, senior economist at the TD Bank Group.
Yet the dissent also obscures the extent of broad agreement within the committee about the course of monetary policy. Of the 17 officials who participate in the policy-making meetings (some of whom do not hold votes this year), all but two predicted that the Fed would raise rates before the end of 2015.
The forecasts also showed relatively little change in the level officials expect interest rates to reach by the end of 2015, although comparisons were muddled by a change in methodology and in the committee's membership.
A series of long meetings led by Ms. Yellen has produced an agreement on the mechanics of the eventual retreat.
The Fed in recent decades has influenced economic conditions primarily by raising and lowering an interest rate called the federal funds rate. Banks must hold reserves in proportion to their loans, and they sometimes must borrow reserves to remain in compliance. By adjusting the supply of reserves, the Fed controls the price of these loans -- and influences a broad range of other interest rates.
But the Fed has flooded the banking system with excess reserves as it buys bonds from banks and credits their reserve accounts. The Fed said on Wednesday that when it came time to tighten financial conditions, it would continue to describe its actions in terms of the familiar funds rate. It will primarily seek to discourage lending, however, by raising the interest rate that banks are paid on excess reserves. In effect, instead of punishing lending, it will reward abstinence.
The Fed said that it also would seek to suppress economic activity when the time came by borrowing money from other kinds of financial companies under a new program it has been testing for the last several years.
Some Fed officials have concerns about broadening the Fed's role in financial markets, however, and the Fed said it would keep the use of the new program to a minimum.
The central bank also affirmed that it planned to maintain its bond holdings, by replacing matured bonds, until after it starts to raise interest rates. It said that it then planned to allow its holdings to dwindle naturally, without asset sales.
The Fed issued a similar exit plan in 2011, only to find that the economy disappointed its expectations. A government report on Wednesday offered a reminder that the economy remains weak. The Fed regards 2 percent annual inflation as the healthiest pace for the economy, but inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index rose just 1.7 percent in the 12 months ended in August -- and the Fed prefers a separate measure that shows even less inflation than the price index.
Moreover, the forecasts of Fed officials published on Wednesday showed that most now expect inflation to remain below 2 percent during 2015.
Nonetheless, Ms. Yellen suggested the Fed had done what it could.
"We have been at zero for a very long time," she said. "In a general sense I think we have been lower for longer than many standard policy rules would suggest."
The internal debate is now between officials, led by Ms. Yellen, still willing to wait a considerable time before raising interest rates, and those who want to move sooner.

Abstract: A draft Security Council resolution, proposed by the United States, calls on member states to provide assistance, including medical personnel and field hospitals, and urges countries in the region to lift travel restrictions and keep borders open.

Full text:   The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said on Wednesday that he planned to establish a new on-the-ground mission in West Africa to coordinate the struggle against Ebola, a move that signaled his concern with the response so far and the limitations of the World Health Organization's abilities.
In an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times, Mr. Ban said that he intended to ask the General Assembly to support his plan in order to demonstrate the unanimous global concern about Ebola, the deadly virus that is spreading at exponential rates in three Western African countries.
Mr. Ban is scheduled to address a Security Council meeting devoted to Ebola on Thursday afternoon and said he was hoping to convene a special General Assembly session on Friday.
"We don't need all this time-consuming, so-called consultation, or consensus building," Mr. Ban said. "There is a consensus already that this is very serious and urgent. This spreads and doubles in three weeks' time. So it's a matter of take action. We have to save the people."
"That's the main purpose, to take immediate action," he said.
A draft Security Council resolution, proposed by the United States, calls on member states to provide assistance, including medical personnel and field hospitals, and urges countries in the region to lift travel restrictions and keep borders open. The resolution says the spread of Ebola in Africa "constitutes a threat to international peace and security," and follows President Obama's announcement on Tuesday that the United States was preparing to offer medicine, equipment and up to 3,000 military personnel as part of the effort to curb the virus.
It was not immediately clear how an increased United Nations presence in the most afflicted countries -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- would give the organization more power to contain the crisis. But Mr. Ban said it would emphatically signal that places ravaged by Ebola are not pariahs to be shunned and avoided -- a message he has sought to reinforce in his conversations with other world leaders.
"There is a huge psychological panic and fear that nobody wants to go in," he said. "So we have to give some sense of assurance that there is full protection and support by the international community."
Asked when the new mission would start, he said. "It should not take a couple of months, it should take a couple of weeks."
The W.H.O. said that as of Tuesday, Ebola cases in the three most affected countries totaled 4,963, with 2,453 deaths. The organization has predicted that many more thousands of people will be infected.
Mr. Ban spoke as the forecast for the most afflicted countries appeared to worsen. The World Bank Group reported on Wednesday that those countries could experience a "potentially catastrophic blow" to their economies.
The outbreak could cut gross domestic product by nearly 12 percent in Liberia and nearly 9 percent in Sierra Leone in 2015 if it is not curbed, according to the report, which acknowledged considerable uncertainty in its estimates. The impact in Guinea would be less severe, at around 2 percent.
A fear of contagion and what the bank referred to as "aversion behavior" is driving most of the economic losses. Panic is closing places of employment, disrupting transportation and severing air and sea links with other nations, the analysis found.
The pattern is consistent with infectious disease outbreaks elsewhere, including SARS and H1N1 flu, during which behavioral changes accounted for 80 percent to 90 percent of economic losses, according to bank estimates.
"The fear of contagion has helped fuel an economic crisis," Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the bank's president, said in a news conference. If the virus spreads significantly to other African nations, the costs could reach, "depending on the scenario, we think potentially many billions of dollars," Dr. Kim said. "The best-case scenario is still not in sight."
Decreased labor supply is a smaller factor in the losses in West Africa, stemming from illnesses, deaths and caregiving. These are related not only to Ebola, but also to other diseases left untreated because health systems have collapsed as medical workers fell ill or refused to work because of the risks and a lack of protective supplies.
Hazard pay for health workers is needed to help reopen the services, but is still not provided, Amara Konneh, Liberia's finance minister, said in a telephone interview. He said the country was working with donors, including the World Bank and the United States government, to support roughly $60 million for the additional pay. "We appreciate the response to date but we need more assistance quite frankly," he said.
The World Bank's prediction, Mr. Konneh said, "is not new to us, but rather it confirms what we have been saying since the onset of the outbreak."
The bank said that both food prices and inflation were rising as a result of "shortages, panic buying and speculation."
Dr. Kim said that most of the economic impact could be blunted "if we get an effective response on the ground in the next few months."

Full text:   The government said Wednesday that it would seek to revoke the citizenship of the actress Maria Conchita Alonso, left, a fervent critic of its socialist-inspired policies. Ms. Alonso was born in Cuba and moved to Venezuela as a child, becoming a naturalized citizen. She has lived for years in the United States. The Interior Ministry will take judicial action to revoke her citizenship, according to the Information Ministry website. In May, Ms. Alonso said in an interview with the Voice of America, "I wish that the United States would invade with bullets to remove all those wretched communists from Venezuela." Venezuela is mired in an economic crisis, with inflation of 63 percent a year and shortages of basic goods, problems for which the government frequently blames its opponents. Ms. Alonso competed in the Miss Venezuela pageant in 1975 and has appeared in many films, including "Predator 2."

Full text:   The economy has been on the road to recovery since mid-2009, when the Great Recession officially ended. But, for most Americans, recovery is not there yet, and, at the recent rate of progress, it won't be for a long time, if ever.
New census data on income and poverty, released on Tuesday, show that median household income barely budged in 2013 for the second year in a row, following two consecutive annual declines. At nearly $52,000, it is still 8 percent below its level in 2007 before the recession. To make matters worse, the income declines from the recession came on top of losses carried over from the prior business cycle from 2000 to 2007. In all, median household income in America is 8.6 percent below its peak in 2000.
The situation is even bleaker for households led by people under age 65. Unlike older households, their income is not usually cushioned by steady Social Security payments; instead, they rely largely on paychecks in an era of flat or falling wages. For them, median income from 2000 to 2013 declined 11.2 percent, from nearly $65,800 to $58,450.
Even positive news in the report is overwhelmed by dismaying longer-term trends. The poverty rate fell from 15 percent in 2012 to 14.5 percent in 2013, the first meaningful year-to-year decline in seven years. (The poverty threshold for a family of four in 2013 was $23,834.) But the rate is still well above its levels of 12.5 percent in 2007 and 11.3 in 2000. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has calculated that, at the recent pace of poverty reduction, it would take until 2020 for the rate to fall below the level in 2000.
Similarly, poverty among children fell from 2012 to 2013, but remains above its levels in 2007 and 2000. The improvement, such as it is, appears to stem from a rise in the employment and earnings of low-income parents. That is, of course, a positive sign in any recovery: When jobs begin to grow, low-income groups hit the hardest in the bad times should show clear signs of a rebound.
It also means, however, that further economic progress will depend on even more jobs at even higher pay. But several policy makers in Congress and at the Federal Reserve believe it is time to back off from remaining stimulus policies. Federal spending already has been cut, and safety-net programs like federal jobless benefits have ended. The push now is for the Fed to raise interest rates -- using monetary policy not to combat joblessness, which is real, but to combat inflation, which is not.
Progress toward economic health has been and continues to be slow and unreliable. That's because the policy response never was and probably never will be commensurate with the damage caused by the serial recessions and poor recoveries since 2000.

Abstract: "The typical family has still not seen its income recover from the deep recession, which came on top of a decade in which incomes stagnated for the middle class, itself part of a longer-term trend of increasing income inequality," said Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said congressional Republicans were partly responsible because, he said, they were "blocking legislation that would raise the minimum wage, ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work and help Americans repay college loans."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The poverty rate declined last year for the first time since 2006, the Census Bureau reported on Tuesday. But at the same time, it said, there was no statistically significant change in the number of poor people or in income for the typical American household.
The report showed significant improvements for children. The poverty rate for children under 18 declined last year for the first time since 2000, the bureau said, and the number of children in poverty fell by 1.4 million, to 14.7 million.
Over all, the bureau said, 14.5 percent of Americans were living in poverty last year, down from 15 percent in 2012.
Charles T. Nelson, a Census Bureau official, said the decline in the poverty rate resulted partly from an increase in the number of people working full time year-round. In particular, he said, the numbers show an increase in employment and earnings for parents with dependent children.
The bureau estimated that 45.3 million people were living below the poverty level in 2013. This was not a statistically significant change from the estimate for 2012, the bureau said in its annual report on income and poverty.
Poverty thresholds vary with the size and composition of a family. A family of four was classified as poor if its income was less than $23,830 last year; for one person, the threshold was $11,890.
The official poverty levels are updated each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. The income figures do not reflect the value of noncash benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, Medicare and public housing. Nor do they include capital gains or the effects of taxes and tax credits.
The official poverty rate indicates the number of poor people as a share of the total population. The rate can decline without a significant change in the number of poor people if the total population has grown.
Census officials said that income inequality did not change in a statistically significant way from 2012 to 2013. However, they said, inequality has increased substantially in the last two decades, and the most common measure of household income inequality, known as the Gini index, is up 4.9 percent since 1993.
Median household income in the United States was $51,940 last year, the bureau said. This was not statistically different from median income in 2012, after adjustment for inflation. The number of households with income above the median is the same as the number below it.
Many households have not regained the purchasing power they had before the recession that began in December 2007. Median household income was 8 percent lower last year than in 2007, and the poverty rate was two percentage points higher.
"The typical family has still not seen its income recover from the deep recession, which came on top of a decade in which incomes stagnated for the middle class, itself part of a longer-term trend of increasing income inequality," said Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.
The poverty rate is much lower than the 19 percent of 50 years ago, when President Lyndon B. Johnson declared "unconditional war on poverty." But it is higher than it was in the 1970s, when the rate dropped as low as 11.1 percent.
"If this report tells us anything, it's that we can do better," said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee. "The status quo simply isn't good enough."
Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said congressional Republicans were partly responsible because, he said, they were "blocking legislation that would raise the minimum wage, ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work and help Americans repay college loans."
One-fifth of all American households had incomes of $105,910 or more last year, the Census Bureau said, and the top 5 percent had incomes of $196,000 or more. But median household income was still 8.7 percent below its peak in 1999.
The Census Bureau adopted a new set of questions in an effort to measure health insurance coverage more accurately. Using the new method, the bureau estimated that 42 million people, accounting for 13.4 percent of the population, were uninsured for all of 2013.
These figures are not directly comparable with prior years' data on health insurance, or with estimates in surveys by other federal agencies. The National Center for Health Statistics, for example, said the number of Americans without health insurance had declined substantially in the first quarter of this year, in part because of the expansion of coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
The center said that the number of uninsured Americans had fallen by about 8 percent, to 41 million people, in the first quarter of this year compared with 2013, a drop that represented about 3.8 million people.
The Census Bureau report was based on interviews with 68,000 households chosen to be representative of the country. It also included these findings:
â-  The number of men working full time year-round increased by 1.8 million last year, and the number of women working full time throughout the year increased by one million.
â-  Households headed by women with no husband present had less than half the income of married couples' households: $35,150 versus $76,500.
â-  For Hispanic households, median income increased 3.5 percent, to $40,960. This was the first increase for Hispanics since 2000. However, for non-Hispanic white, black and Asian households, income showed no significant change in 2013.
â-  Among major racial and ethnic groups, only Hispanics experienced a significant change in their poverty rate (down two percentage points, to 23.5 percent last year). The number of Hispanics in poverty fell to 12.7 million, a reduction of 870,000.
â-  Median income for households headed by noncitizens rose 6 percent last year, to $40,580. There was no significant change in income for households headed by United States citizens, whether native-born ($52,780) or naturalized ($54,970).
In addition, the bureau said, nearly 20 million people lived in families with incomes below half the poverty level. One-third of them were children.
Data in the report showed the powerful effects of government benefit programs. In the absence of Social Security, it said, the number of people 65 and older in poverty would have been nearly 15 million higher last year. If food stamps had been counted as income, 3.7 million fewer people would have been classified as poor.

Abstract: Returns in the first of the cellar years, ended in June 2009, were weighed down by the need to sell illiquid assets at a discount to produce cash for the university, as well as a decline of more than 50 percent in the endowment's real estate holdings -- roughly double the decline of the United States stock market.\n

Full text:   The chief investment officer of the Yale endowment, David F. Swensen, set the bar for universities starting in 1988 when he created a widely imitated blueprint for high-octane investment returns with heavy doses of private equity and other alternatives to stocks and bonds.
Then from 1990 to 2005, Jack Meyer of Harvard gave Yale a run for its money with a streak of returns almost as sizzling, achieved by a team of swashbuckling in-house traders whose sky-high pay eventually led to their departures after an outcry from faculty and alumni.
But over the last decade, miscues by university management and more tepid investment returns have pulled down Harvard's results, culminating in the June resignation of Jane L. Mendillo, the chief executive of the Harvard Management Company, who started just before the market collapse in July 2008.
The performance of Ms. Mendillo, who is leaving at the end of the year, illustrates not only the vicissitudes of investing but also the revolving-door aspect of an operation like the Harvard endowment, where retaining top talent can be difficult because of the intense scrutiny and the availability of bigger paychecks elsewhere.
"The pressure on people in that kind of institution is tremendous from people who want to see good results all the time," said Keith Ambachtsheer, who runs an education program for nonprofit board members at the University of Toronto. "There's no patience for the fact that managing endowments is a long-horizon enterprise that naturally involves occasional periods of disappointing results."
Harvard officials defend Ms. Mendillo's record, saying that over the five years ended in June, the university's endowment, the nation's largest at $32.7 billion, matched its long-term record of 11 to 12 percent annual returns. They add that Ms. Mendillo coped well with multiple challenges during the financial crisis and stabilized the organization. And this month, Harvard is expected to report a return of about 15 percent for the year ended in June, the second-best of Ms. Mendillo's term.
In three of the five Mendillo years for which Harvard and its Ivy League rivals have reported detailed results, however, as well as for the five years ended in June 2013, its endowment trailed all seven other Ivies. Including a steep 27.3 percent decline during the market collapse year, its five-year return was just 1.7 percent, compared with an average of 4.2 percent for the others.
"Their performance was not very good," said Charles Skorina, a San Francisco endowment recruiter who calculated the five-year Ivy returns.
Results were all the more disappointing, he added, because Harvard pays "top dollar" for an in-house staff that invests about 40 percent of the assets, including $4.8 million for Ms. Mendillo in 2012, and $7.9 million and $6.6 million for her two highest-earning deputies. Other Ivies farm out most of their investments to outside managers and do not generally award such lavish paychecks.
In a letter sent last month to Harvard's president, Drew Faust, a group of nine Harvard alumni renewed its past criticism of the pay for the endowment's staff, noting that the total for 2013 of $132.8 million had doubled in the previous four years. "
Harvard officials say the higher pay levels reflect Ms. Mendillo's efforts to rebuild the staff, which had been depleted by the departures of numerous top traders, and the exceeding of certain benchmarks.
Some associates of Ms. Mendillo, who came up through the ranks at Harvard and then led both the Wellesley and Harvard endowments, say she acknowledged unhappiness with the scrutiny on Harvard's returns. "She didn't like it; she is a very private person and doesn't seek the spotlight. So the negative focus on absolute returns did bother her," said Verne O. Sedlacek, chief executive of Commonfund, which manages $25 billion for nonprofit groups. Mr. Sedlacek worked with Ms. Mendillo, 56, at the Harvard endowment for a decade. Harvard officials declined to comment beyond a brief statement applauding the latest five-year returns as a "strong recovery."
One former official of Harvard Management compared the endowment's cautious, defensive style in the Mendillo years to a soccer team that tries to keep possession of the ball instead of taking shots on goal. Many of the company's alumni called Ms. Mendillo more of a steady, capable manager than a visionary investor.
Returns in the first of the cellar years, ended in June 2009, were weighed down by the need to sell illiquid assets at a discount to produce cash for the university, as well as a decline of more than 50 percent in the endowment's real estate holdings -- roughly double the decline of the United States stock market. But former Harvard endowment employees say returns in the other bottom-ranked years ended in June 2012 and 2013 were held back by less obvious factors like holding too few publicly traded United States stocks, which shot up 12.2 percent annually in those two years, and placing too big a bet on emerging stock markets, where Harvard underperformed market indexes that themselves produced annual losses of 6.7 percent.
Another drag during the five-year period ended June 2013 were "real assets," including real estate, natural resources and commodities, where Ms. Mendillo kept the weighting at as much as 25 percent -- higher than most other Ivies -- which produced losses of 3.6 percent annually, held back by low inflation.
Her best sector was fixed income. As initially reported, it returned an average annual 4.8 percent, beating Harvard's own benchmark of 2.8 percent, while trailing a more widely used index, Barclays U.S. Aggregate, which gained 5.2 percent. Harvard says it actually beat the Barclays index with a 6.1 percent return because it retroactively removed high-yield securities from the category after it incurred steep losses in 2009.
Mr. Meyer's successor, Mohamed A. El-Erian, who arrived in February 2006 and left after only 21 months for what he said were family reasons, posted a return of 23 percent during his lone full year ended June 2007, aided by a 44 percent bounce in emerging markets and a surge in commodities.
Friends say Ms. Mendillo is looking forward to escaping the pressure cooker, where criticism of the recent results may have made it tougher for her to lead and retain top talent. For example, after the longtime head of private equity, Peter Dolan, resigned last year, his successor, Lane MacDonald, abruptly departed in February after just a few months in the job to manage a family office for the Johnson family, which owns a stake in Fidelity Investments.
Lawrence E. Golub, a Harvard alumnus whose Golub Capital lends to midsize companies, said Ms. Mendillo did "a great job" steering Harvard through the crisis and revamping its risk and liquidity profile. But he noted that the job required three separate skills in investing, managing and dealing with Harvard's various "constituents and interest groups." He added, "Any job with those challenges, that's a very tiring job."

Full text:   HUTCHINSON, Kan. -- In his 40 years living in Kansas, Konrad Hastings cannot remember voting for a Democrat. He is the type who agonizes over big purchases, trying to save as much money as possible. He is against stricter gun laws, opposes abortion in most cases and prefers less government involvement in his life.
But when he casts his ballot for governor in November, he plans to shun the leader of this state's conservative movement, the Republican incumbent, Sam Brownback, and vote for the Democratic challenger.
"He's leading Kansas down," said Mr. Hastings, 68, who said he voted for Mr. Brownback four years ago, when he easily won his first term. "We're going to be bankrupt in two or three years if we keep going his way."
Voters like Mr. Hastings are at the heart of Mr. Brownback's surprising fight for political survival.
Although every statewide elected official in Kansas is a Republican and President Obama lost the state by more than 20 points in the last election, Mr. Brownback's proudly conservative policies have turned out to be so divisive and his tax cuts have generated such a drop in state revenue that they have caused even many Republicans to revolt. Projections put state budget shortfalls in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, raising questions of whether the state can adequately fund education in particular.
This has boosted the hopes of the Democratic candidate, Paul Davis, the State House minority leader, who has shot up in the polls even though he has offered few specifics about how he would run the state. Many disaffected Republicans might give Mr. Davis their vote because, if nothing else, he is not Mr. Brownback.
"There's just a lot of negative momentum behind Brownback, and Davis has been hammering that home," said Chapman Rackaway, a political-science professor at Fort Hays State University.
The governor's campaign has appeared so worried about his weak poll numbers that it took the unusual step last month of releasing an internal poll that showed the race to be essentially tied, hardly something that would usually be showcased.
In some ways, it is unsurprising that many Kansas Republicans have turned on Mr. Brownback. This is a state that once had a tradition of centrist Republicans, like former Senator Bob Dole, and has had five Democratic governors over the past half-century.
But much of this moderation went by the wayside as Mr. Brownback and conservative majorities in the Legislature turned the state into a laboratory for the policies they had run on. In addition to passing the largest income tax cuts in state history, they have made it easier to carry guns in public buildings, turned over management of Medicaid to private insurance companies, made it more difficult to get an abortion, and made it harder to qualify for public assistance.
Even some of Kansas' staunchest Republicans have found some of these measures to be too far to the right. More than 100 current and former Republican elected officials have endorsed Mr. Davis.
Mr. Brownback, 58, a former United States senator who grew up on a Kansas farm, has defended his record and is trying to force Mr. Davis, who is from Lawrence, home of the University of Kansas in one of the state's most liberal regions, to define himself.
"He's been mostly just hiding as a candidate," Mr. Brownback said in an interview. "All his statements have been basically against me, and none of it has been what he would do."
The governor has painted Mr. Davis as a supporter of President Obama who wants to raise taxes and force the president's health care law on Kansans.
Mr. Davis has hammered away at the "governor's economic experiment," as he put it in a debate held at the State Fair, saying it had left Kansas with a vast budget deficit. "It's damaging our schools. It's hurting our economy. It's jeopardizing our future," he said.
Mr. Brownback has also been set back by matters unrelated to lawmaking. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported in April that federal authorities were investigating the fund-raising and lobbying activities of some of his associates.
As Election Day draws closer, both sides can expect an even tighter, and perhaps rougher, clash, with outside groups stepping up their involvement.
The Republican Governors Association has run television ads attacking Mr. Davis and linking him to Mr. Obama. The Brownback campaign's ads have sought to paint a rosy financial picture for the state. Political analysts expect Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group founded by the Koch brothers, the Wichita-based billionaires, to step in, too.
The Kansas Values Institute, a left-leaning advocacy organization, has run negative ads about Mr. Brownback. Mr. Davis has run an ad that said Mr. Brownback was taking the state in the wrong direction. But he also had to pull one of his television ads after it was revealed that one of the actors had been arrested on charges of soliciting a prostitute.
Most criticism of Mr. Brownback has centered on the tax cuts, which slashed individual income tax rates and eliminated taxes on nonwage earnings for nearly 200,000 small businesses. The most recent fiscal year ended with state revenues more than $300 million short of expectations.
Based on decreased revenue from the tax cuts, the state's nonpartisan legislative research department estimates that the budget will have to be adjusted by $1.3 billion, either through spending cuts or additional revenue, over the next five years in order to remain balanced.
Opponents of the governor have used this to stoke fears that he would cut vital services. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have downgraded Kansas' credit rating.
Mr. Brownback said that the steps he had taken on Medicaid, on bolstering the teachers' pension system and on cutting taxes had been needed to stabilize state finances, and that revenue growth would resume. The tax cuts will attract new businesses and residents -- and, in turn, cash -- to the state, he said. And because he has reduced the size of government and made it more efficient, he said, state revenues do not need to grow that much to fulfill budget obligations.
As promising signs, the governor and his allies point to an increase in the number of private-sector jobs since the tax cuts went into effect in January 2013. They also promote a record number of new business filings -- more than 15,000 -- in the state last year as a sign that businesses were attracted to Kansas.
Spending is also an issue. Mr. Brownback said he would not cut funding for education or other essential services, and since taking office he has increased the total state dollars that go toward primary and secondary schools by more than $200 million. He has put tens of millions of dollars toward new programs for technical education and reading initiatives.
But most of the increase has gone toward things like teacher pensions and building maintenance. When adjusted for inflation, state spending on classroom-related expenses has remained flat, if not decreased slightly, each year, according to an analysis by Mark Tallman of the Kansas Association of School Boards.
So far, Mr. Davis, 42, the son of two teachers, has spoken mostly in broad terms about his priorities -- improving public schools and investing in work force training and higher education. "We know that if we have a highly skilled work force, industry will come," he said.
The only specific plan he has put forward is to freeze Mr. Brownback's tax cuts next year and to appoint a commission to address tax issues.
"I'm not giving people the illusion that this is the magic bullet that's going to fix the very, very deep financial problems that Governor Brownback has caused," said Mr. Davis, a lawyer who joined the House in 2003 and has been minority leader since 2008. "But I think it is a good first step."
Ray Merrick, the Republican speaker of the House, called freezing the tax cuts a nonstarter. "Right now, the Legislature on both sides, House and Senate, are on the side of the governor," he said.
The question is whether most voters will stand with the governor. "I'm not sure that some of the tax policies have been as effective as we'd like them to be," said Dianne Blick, a 58-year-old development officer from Hutchinson, who has usually voted for Republicans but is undecided in this race. "Either candidate has to really convince me that they can create positive change and can work across the aisle."

Full text:   YOUNG families are better educated than ever before, but they are earning lower real incomes.
The Federal Reserve Board's newly released 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances indicates that the median family headed by someone under 35 years of age earned $35,509 in 2013 dollars. Adjusted for inflation, that is 6 percent less than similar families reported in the first such survey, in 1989.
Since 1989, the Fed has conducted extensive interviews of consumers every three years. Respondents are asked about their family's income in the previous year, as well as about wealth, debt, education and attitudes toward financial issues. The results are released by family, not by individual, so the median family income may include the income of both spouses. Single-person households are included in the family calculations.
As can be seen in the charts, younger families have fallen further and further behind older families as time has passed. Nearly a quarter-century after the first survey was taken, families headed by people over 55 generally have higher incomes, after adjusting for inflation, than their predecessors did. But those in groups under 55 generally earn less than their predecessors.
In the first survey, the younger group included families headed by people born after 1954, and so was dominated by baby boomers. The latest group includes families headed by people born after 1984, and they seem not to have done nearly as well early in their careers. The earlier group came of age in a stronger economy and its members were generally not burdened by education loans as many of the latter group are.
The largest declines have come since the 2007 survey -- the last one in which participants discussed their income in a year before the Great Recession began. The following survey covered income earned during the recession, and it was not easy to know how much of the falloff was a cyclical phenomenon that would disappear when the economy recovered.
But the newest survey covered income in 2012, three years after the recession ended, and shows that most of the lost ground has not been recovered. In fact, the real median income for all of the age groups except those in the 35-to-44 group declined from 2010 to 2013.
Among families of all ages, those with more education tend to earn more than those with less. But that differential appears to be shrinking. at least for younger families. In 1989, the median income of families headed by young college graduates was twice that of similar families headed by high school graduates who never attended college. Now, the difference is only 52 percent. There are more college graduates in the group, but those graduates have a lower real median income than their predecessors.
Median incomes tell only part of the story, of course. But the relative decline of the young can also be seen in the distribution of high-income families. In the first survey, nearly a third of younger families had incomes that put them in the top 40 percent of all families. That figure has been steadily falling, and in the latest report just over a quarter of young families are in that group.
The age group whose real income has grown the most over the last quarter-century covers those age 65 to 74. The median income of that group used to be lower than that of younger families. Now it is higher. People past the traditional retirement age of 65 are much more likely to be working now than they used to be, but higher pension income may also be a factor.
Chart Declining Earnings, Particularly for the Young: Younger Families Had Lower Median Income, Adjusted for Inflation, in the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, Conducted Every Three Years by the Federal Reserve, Than in Any Previous Survey, Going Back to 1989. That Occurred Despite the Fact the Heads of Such Families Now Are More Likely Than Ever to Be College Graduates. (Source: Federal Reserve Board Survey of Consumer Finances)

Full text:   JANET LEE DUPREE, 72, was surprised when she received her first Social Security benefits seven years ago. About one-fifth of her monthly payment was being withheld and she called the federal government to find out why.
The woman, who is from Citra, Fla., discovered that the deduction from her benefits was to repay $3,000 in loans she took out in the early 1970s to pay for her undergraduate degree.
"I didn't pay it back, and I'm not saying I shouldn't," she said. "I was an alcoholic, and later diagnosed with H.I.V., but I've turned my life around. I've been paying some of the loan back but that never seems to lower the amount, which is now $15,000 because of interest.
"I don't know if I can ever pay it back."
She is among an estimated two million Americans age 60 and older who are in debt from unpaid student loans, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Its August "Household Debt and Credit Report" said the number of aging Americans with outstanding student loans had almost tripled from about 700,000 in 2005, whether from long-ago loans for their own educations or more recent borrowing to pay for college degrees for family members.
The debt among older people is up substantially, to $43 billion from $8 billion in 2005, according to the report, which is based on data from Equifax, the credit reporting agency. As of July 31, money was being deducted from Social Security payments to almost 140,000 individuals to pay down their outstanding student loans, according to Treasury Department data. That is up from just under 38,000 people in 2004. Over the decade, the amounts withheld more than tripled, to nearly $101 million for the first seven months of this year from over $32 million in 2004.
While older debtors account for a small fraction of student loan borrowers, who have accumulated nearly $1 trillion in such debt, the effect of owing a constantly ballooning amount of debt but having a fixed income can be onerous, said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.
"Those in default on their loans can see their Social Security checks garnished, leaving them with retirement income that leaves them well below the poverty line," he said at a committee hearing this week to examine the issue.
"Some may think of student loan debt as a young person's problem," he said, "but, as it turns out, that is increasingly not the case."
That is the problem that Rosemary Anderson, 57, described to the committee. The woman, who is from Watsonville, Calif., has a home mortgage that is under water, as well as health and other problems, and $64,000 in unpaid student loans. She borrowed the money in her 30s to fund her bachelor's and master's degrees, but fell behind on her student loan payments eight years ago.
As a result of compound interest, her debt has risen to $126,000. With her $526 monthly payment, at an 8.25 percent rate, she estimates that she "will be 81" by the time it is paid, and will have laid out $87,487 more than she originally borrowed.
Mrs. Dupree, in a telephone interview, said she, too, needed some relief. As a part-time substance abuse counselor for a nonprofit based in Ocala, she said she could barely afford the $50 each month that she negotiated with the federal government as payment for her growing debt.
She is supporting a measure introduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and a committee member, that would allow people who borrowed money for education before July 2013 to refinance at current, lower interest rates.
A person who took out an unsubsidized loan before July of last year "is locked into an interest rate of nearly 7 percent and older loans run 8 percent to 9 percent and even higher," Ms. Warren said. The measure would lower the interest rate to 3.86 percent for undergraduate loans and a little higher for graduate and parent loans.
But the future of the bill is unclear. It was stalled in the Senate in June by Republican senators, like Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee, who said college students didn't need a taxpayer subsidy to help pay off a student loan. "They need a good job."
The measure would help 25 million people refinance their student loans, but impose a tax increase on people making over $1 million -- which Senator Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, the majority leader, labeled a "tax increase bill styled as a student loan bill."
Adam Brandon, executive vice president of the conservative organization FreedomWorks, which opposed Senator Warren's bill, said such legislation "only makes the current student loan bubble worse by continuing to encourage people to take out more loans than they can afford.
"The market needs to work out who can afford these loans. We shouldn't be trying to game the market and have people end up with so much debt they can't afford their car payments."
Even though the number of retiree debtors is small, $1,000 deducted from their Social Security payments "can make a real difference for affected senior citizens or disabled adults surviving on Social Security," said Sandy Baum, a professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Education and Human Development, and a researcher at the Urban Institute.
For most beneficiaries, she said, "the average monthly payment of $1,200 is the primary source of income." While the government should be holding student borrowers to account for their debt, "and there may be some who just decide not to pay," she said "most are people who are not earning money so it doesn't make sense to ask them to pay."
As the ranks of retirees grow, more attention is being focused on the education debt incurred by the next group of people approaching retirement, those 50 to 64 years old. A 2013 AARP study of middle-class families found that aging households were carrying increasing amounts of debt.
While mortgages account for most of that debt, education debt levels have been rising for the preretiree group, noted Lori A. Trawinski, a director at the AARP Public Policy Institute.
"As of 2010, 11 percent of preretiree families had education debt with an average balance of $28,000. Growing debt burdens pose a threat to financial security of Americans approaching retirement, since increasing debt threatens their ability to save for retirement or to accumulate other assets, and may end up leading them to delay retirement," she said.
The Government Accountability Office warned this week about the growth of educational debt among seniors. It released a report that relied on different data from that used by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, but nonetheless painted an ominous picture of lingering debt burden.
"As the baby boomers continue to move into retirement, the number of older Americans with defaulted loans will only continue to increase," Charles A. Jeszeck, the G.A.O. director of education, work force and income security, testified at the hearing. "This creates the potential for an unpleasant surprises for some, as their benefits are offset and they face the possibility of a less secure retirement."
More than 80 percent of the outstanding balances are from seniors who financed their own education, the G.A.O. report concluded, and only 18 percent were attributed to loans used to finance the studies of a spouse, child or grandchild.
But the default rate for these loans is 31 percent -- a rate that is double that of the default rate for loans taken out by borrowers between the ages of 25 and 49 years old, according to agency data.
"Such debt reduces net worth and income and can erode retirement security," Mr. Jeszeck said. "The effect of rising debt can be more profound for those who have accumulated few or no financial assets."
And such student loan debt "can be especially problematic because unlike other types of debt, it generally cannot be discharged in bankruptcy," he added.
As a result of unpaid student debt, Social Security payments can be reduced to $750 a month, which is a floor Congress set in 1998. Senator Susan M. Collins, Republican of Maine, and a member of the committee on aging, said she was planning to introduce a measure to adjust the amount for inflation "to make sure garnishment does not force seniors into poverty."
For people like Ms. Anderson, help cannot come too soon.
"I incurred this debt to improve my life," she told the committee, "but the debt has become my undoing."

Full text:   The United States job market has been improving. But is it close to being good?
That is one of the chief issues likely to be debated next week at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. If it is close, and one traditional indicator seems to show that it is, then the time is near when the Federal Reserve should begin to tighten monetary policy. To not do so would be to risk a return of rising inflation.
But if it is not close, such a tightening could do serious damage to the recovery, hurting the prospects for employment of many who have been out of work for years.
Perhaps the most puzzling feature of the Great Recession and its aftermath was the sharp decline in the percentage of working-age people in the labor force. You have to be either working or looking for work to be in the labor force. People who are not looking are ignored when the government calculates the unemployment rate, which has fallen to 6.1 percent from a peak of 10 percent.
"This is involving millions of prime-age Americans who have dropped out of the work force," says Andrew T. Levin, a research fellow at the International Monetary Fund who spent 22 years at the Fed, the last two years as a special adviser to Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who were chairman and vice chairwoman at the time. "The question is, Do we give up on those people?"
The percentage of prime-working-age Americans, those between 25 and 54, who are in the labor force fell to a 30-year low of 80.7 in July. In April, the percentage of prime-working-age men in the labor force fell to 87.9, the lowest figure reported since the government began computing the figure in 1948.
At issue is why all those people are not in the labor force. If it is some sort of structural problem -- most of them either do not want to work or do not have the appropriate skills to obtain jobs -- then monetary and fiscal policy are not going to help.
Last year, Mr. Levin and Christopher J. Erceg, a Fed economist, published a paper concluding that a large part of the decline in the participation rate was a result of the recession and that by keeping monetary policy easy for a sustained period of time the Fed could get most of those people back into the labor force. Both Ms. Yellen, now the Fed chairwoman, and Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman, cited the paper in recent speeches.
But now a different group of Fed economists have published a paper that directly challenges the conclusions of the earlier paper. It is to be discussed Friday at a Brookings Institution conference in Washington.
"Our overall assessment is that much, but not all, of the decline in the labor force participation rate since 2007 is structural in nature," states the paper by Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith and William Wascher.
"As a result," they added, "while policy makers can view some of the current low level of the participation rate as indicative of labor market slack beyond that indicated by the unemployment rate alone, they should not expect the participation rate to show a substantial increase from current levels as labor market conditions continue to improve." Their model says the rate will continue to fall.
Economists are taught something called "Nairu," for "nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment." If the unemployment rate goes below that level, it is supposed to lead to rising inflation. Some people think that figure could be as high as 6 percent -- meaning that the time to tighten is virtually here -- while others put it at 5.5 percent or less.
But Mr. Levin argues that it is misleading to look only at the unemployment rate. He points to the large number of workers who say they work part time only because they cannot find full-time work, as well as to the decline in the labor force. He thinks there are a lot of people who would take jobs but have not looked for one recently.
"Labor market conditions have improved substantially over the past several years, and the conventional measure of unemployment is now close to its longer-run normal rate," he said. "However, the participation gap and the underemployment gap remain substantial." After adjusting for those factors, he says, labor market conditions are "roughly equivalent to a level of around 8 percent for the conventional unemployment rate."
If that is correct, there is every reason for the Fed to keep interest rates low for a substantial period of time.
One noted labor market economist, the Nobel laureate Peter A. Diamond, has looked at the recent data and concluded that much of what he and others have written previously is misleading because the unemployment rate is no longer an accurate labor market gauge.
"This is a very soft labor market, with a great deal of slack in it," Mr. Diamond said in a recent lecture.
Who is right?
If the paper by Ms. Aaronson and her colleagues is correct, and the Fed nevertheless fails to tighten credit, we can expect that clear signs of wage inflation will emerge as employers are forced to pay more to lure workers from the limited available pool. Given the decline in median real income in recent years, some such inflation would be welcome, but Fed tightening would still make sense.
But if Mr. Levin is correct, and the Fed listens to those who disagree with him and tightens credit too soon, the risk is that a lot of people who could eventually find jobs will not do so.
The wiser course seems to be to wait for the inflation -- not just for a model that says something is likely to happen -- before we give up on all those people who might rejoin the labor force.
In the summer of 2000, when the economy was booming, there were articles about employers who were seeking out people being released from prison in hopes of filling low-level jobs. Then, more than half the people questioned by the Conference Board for its consumer confidence survey said jobs were plentiful, and only about a tenth thought jobs were hard to get.
Now, the good news is that the percentage of respondents who believe jobs are plentiful has risen to a six-year high -- 18 percent. That compares with 31 percent who think jobs remain hard to get.
You don't need to be an economist to know when jobs are easy to get. The members of the F.O.M.C. would be better advised to watch the consumer confidence survey than to focus on the unemployment rate.

Full text:   Wish I'd said that! Earlier this week, Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica, writing on The Times's DealBook blog, compared people who keep predicting runaway inflation to "true believers whose faith in a predicted apocalypse persists even after it fails to materialize." Indeed.
Economic forecasters are often wrong. Me, too! If an economist never makes an incorrect prediction, he or she isn't taking enough risks. But it's less common for supposed experts to keep making the same wrong prediction year after year, never admitting or trying to explain their past errors. And the remarkable thing is that these always-wrong, never-in-doubt pundits continue to have large public and political influence.
There's something happening here. What it is ain't exactly clear. But as regular readers know, I've been trying to figure it out, because I think it's important to understand the persistence and power of the inflation cult.
Whom are we talking about? Not just the shouting heads on CNBC, although they're certainly part of it. Rick Santelli, famous for his 2009 Tea Party rant, also spent much of that year yelling that runaway inflation was coming. It wasn't, but his line never changed. Just two months ago, he told viewers that the Federal Reserve is "preparing for hyperinflation."
You might dismiss the likes of Mr. Santelli, saying that they're basically in the entertainment business. But many investors didn't get that memo. I've had money managers -- that is, professional investors -- tell me that the quiescence of inflation surprised them, because "all the experts" predicted that it would surge.
And it's not as easy to dismiss the phenomenon of obsessive attachment to a failed economic doctrine when you see it in major political figures. In 2009, Representative Paul Ryan warned about "inflation's looming shadow." Did he reconsider when inflation stayed low? No, he kept warning, year after year, about the coming "debasement" of the dollar.
Wait, there's more: You find the same Groundhog Day story when you look at the pronouncements of seemingly reputable economists. In May 2009, Allan Meltzer, a well-known monetary economist and historian of the Federal Reserve, had an Op-Ed article published in The Times warning that a sharp rise in inflation was imminent unless the Fed changed course. Over the next five years, Mr. Meltzer's preferred measure of prices rose at an annual rate of only 1.6 percent, and his response was published in another op-ed article, this time in The Wall Street Journal. The title? "How the Fed Fuels the Coming Inflation."
So what's going on here?
I've written before about how the wealthy tend to oppose easy money, perceiving it as being against their interests. But that doesn't explain the broad appeal of prophets whose prophecies keep failing.
Part of that appeal is clearly political; there's a reason why Mr. Santelli yells about both inflation and how President Obama is giving money away to "losers," why Mr. Ryan warns about both a debased currency and a government that redistributes from "makers" to "takers." Inflation cultists almost always link the Fed's policies to complaints about government spending. They're completely wrong about the details -- no, the Fed isn't printing money to cover the budget deficit -- but it's true that governments whose debt is denominated in a currency they can issue have more fiscal flexibility, and hence more ability to maintain aid to those in need, than governments that don't.
And anger against "takers" -- anger that is very much tied up with ethnic and cultural divisions -- runs deep. Many people, therefore, feel an affinity with those who rant about looming inflation; Mr. Santelli is their kind of guy. In an important sense, I'd argue, the persistence of the inflation cult is an example of the "affinity fraud" crucial to many swindles, in which investors trust a con man because he seems to be part of their tribe. In this case, the con men may be conning themselves as well as their followers, but that hardly matters.
This tribal interpretation of the inflation cult helps explain the sheer rage you encounter when pointing out that the promised hyperinflation is nowhere to be seen. It's comparable to the reaction you get when pointing out that Obamacare seems to be working, and probably has the same roots.
But what about the economists who go along with the cult? They're all conservatives, but aren't they also professionals who put evidence above political convenience? Apparently not.
The persistence of the inflation cult is, therefore, an indicator of just how polarized our society has become, of how everything is political, even among those who are supposed to rise above such things. And that reality, unlike the supposed risk of runaway inflation, is something that should scare you.

Draghi Says Government Spending Could Help

Full text:   Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, on Thursday stepped up pressure on countries like Italy to improve the climate for business. But he also said there was room for governments to use public spending to reinvigorate the stalled eurozone economy.
Speaking in English in Milan, Mr. Draghi both amplified and clarified themes he raised last month during a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in which he surprised many Europeans by appearing to step back from the E.C.B.'s longtime insistence that countries focus above all on reducing budget deficits and debt.
According to a text of the speech, Mr. Draghi said government stimulus should come in the form of lower taxes, financed by cuts in "unproductive" government spending. Countries should remain within the deficit and spending limits that are a condition for eurozone membership, Mr. Draghi said. He made no mention of the French government's admission this week that it will not meet its budget targets until 2017.
But Mr. Draghi also suggested that countries that can afford it should consider higher spending. "It may be useful to have a discussion on the overall fiscal stance of the euro area," he said, "with the view to raising public investment where there is fiscal space to do so."
The call for more spending was probably aimed at Germany, which has a balanced government budget but which critics say has not invested enough in transportation networks and other public infrastructure.
In addition, Mr. Draghi said, governments should consider offering guarantees to encourage lending to small businesses. Specifically, he said, they should consider support for asset-backed securities, bundles of bank loans that are resold to investors. By packaging and selling their loans, banks free up money for more lending.
Last week, the E.C.B. said it would begin buying asset-backed securities in an aggressive new effort to pump money into the eurozone economy. But the market for such securities is relatively small, and the E.C.B. has been trying to encourage banks to issue more. Government guarantees would serve as an incentive for them to do so.
In recent weeks Mr. Draghi has increasingly pushed for countries to roll back work rules and other regulations that he said stymie business investment and job creation. Monetary policy, he has stressed, will not be effective unless it is accompanied by such changes.
The pressure from Mr. Draghi on Thursday may have had extra significance because it was delivered in Italy, his home country, often regarded as one of the eurozone's most sclerotic economies.
Mr. Draghi, who rarely criticizes countries explicitly, cited France and Italy as examples of how government red tape throttles growth. Estonia regulates just 45 professions, he said, quoting European Union figures, but Italy regulates 170 and France regulates 219. (Slovakia, which regulates 304 professions, is the most extreme.)
"Such barriers to entry limit competition and employment, creating undue rents for a select few to the detriment of customers," he said.
Mr. Draghi said business investment had bounced back in the United States since the financial crisis but had improved only slightly in the eurozone. Investment will recover only when there is ample bank lending, better conditions for entrepreneurs and government stimulus, he said.
"We are currently facing a set of conditions -- low growth and low inflation, high debt and high unemployment -- that can only be addressed by concerted action on both the demand and supply sides of the economy," Mr. Draghi said. "This requires all actors -- both at national and European level -- to play their parts."

Abstract: On Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released its annual collection of education statistics from around the industrialized world showing that the United States trails nearly all other industrialized nations when it comes to educational equality. More than a century ago a consensus emerged that Americans needed at least a high school education to meet the growing demand for skilled workers.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDImagine if the United States government taxed the nation's one-percenters so that their post-tax share of the nation's income remained at 10 percent, roughly where it was in 1979. If the excess money were distributed equally among the rest of the population, in 2012 every family below that very top tier would have gotten a $7,105 check.
This is hardly trivial money. But it pales compared to the gap between the wages of a family of two college graduates and a family of high school graduates. Between 1979 and 2012, that gap grew by some $30,000, after inflation.
This clever calculation by Lawrence Katz, a labor economist from Harvard, amounts to a powerful counterargument to anybody who doubts the importance of education in the battle against the nation's entrenched inequality.
But in the American education system, inequality is winning, gumming up the mobility that broad-based prosperity requires. On Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released its annual collection of education statistics from around the industrialized world showing that the United States trails nearly all other industrialized nations when it comes to educational equality.
Barely 30 percent of American adults have achieved a higher level of education than their parents did. Only Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic do worse. In Finland more than 50 percent of adults are more educated than their parents.
And matters are getting worse, not better. Among 25- to 34-year olds, only 20 percent of men and 27 percent of women, both out of school, have achieved a higher level of education than their parents.
It's even bleaker at the bottom: Only one in 20 Americans aged 25 to 34 whose parents didn't finish high school has a college degree. The average across 20 rich countries in the O.E.C.D. analysis is almost one in four.
This particularly hurts the poor. Two economists, Martha J. Bailey and Susan M. Dynarski from the University of Michigan, document a growing income gap between the graduation rate of teenagers from the mid-1970s and those from the mid-1990s. The graduation rate of youths in the poorest fourth of the distribution increased to 9 percent from 5 percent; among the richest fourth it rose to 54 percent from 36 percent.
In a study comparing teenagers in the early 1980s and the early 2000s, Philippe Belley from Kansas State University and Lance Lochner from the University of Western Ontario noted a sharp increase in the impact of family income on college attendance. For all but the most able students, by the early 2000s the college attendance rate for children from the richest fourth of American families was 15 to 30 percentage points higher than that of the poorest fourth.
This pattern of stagnant mobility and rising inequality of education adds up to a dumbfounding paradox. American workers with a college degree are paid 74 percent more than those with only a high school degree, on average, nearly the biggest premium in the O.E.C.D.
Given the payoff, the fact that many of those who would benefit most are not investing in a college education suggests an epic failure. And the growing cadre of countries that outperform the United States suggests failure is hardly inevitable.
The greatest paradox is that the United States knows how to provide broad-based education to all. More than a century ago a consensus emerged that Americans needed at least a high school education to meet the growing demand for skilled workers. And the nation provided.
Between 1900 and 1950, the high school enrollment of Americans aged 14 to 17 increased to 75 percent, from about 11 percent.
To European nations happy educating their elites, that was not only unheard-of, it was downright stupid. By the mid-1950s, the full-time enrollment rate of American 15- to 19-year-olds in secondary school was more than double that of any European country.
The momentum carried into college. In 1944, when Britain's government was signing the Education Act, guaranteeing British children a public education up to secondary school, most Americans already had that. In 1944 President Roosevelt was signing the G.I. Bill, which paid the tuition for any veterans attending college.
"Historically, education in the United State was the great equalizer," conceded Andreas Schleicher, an education expert at the O.E.C.D. who heads its Program for International Student Assessment.
Something slipped over the last generation, however. In the 1970s, graduation rates from four-year colleges slowed sharply and even went into reverse for men.
And the world caught up. For those Americans between 55 to 64, 42 percent have a college degree, a rate surpassed only by Canada and Israel in the O.E.C.D. But among people aged 25 to 34, the United States is in 11th place, with a college graduation rate only slightly greater, at 44 percent.
"We were the first out of the gate with high school, with coed education, with early access to college," noted Professor Katz. "Something went wrong."
Today, the demand for more highly educated workers remains intense. Globalization and fast-paced technical change have wiped out many of the manufacturing jobs with which a worker with only a high school degree could support a middle-class life.
What explains America's educational stagnation? One cause is certainly the high cost of college, which -- unlike high school costs -- families must bear largely on their own and is higher than in any other advanced nation.
"In the U.S., more so than in other countries, you as a family are making a larger and riskier investment in your own future," said David Deming, a professor at Harvard. "College pays off on average but it has a ton of risk. Lower-income families can't buffer that shock."
Another factor is the inability of the educational system -- whether because of poverty and segregation or to unfit and underpaid teachers -- to prepare underprivileged Americans for college.
Even the big high school push of the 20th century, decentralized as it was, left many out. Blacks and Hispanics lagged the educational attainment of whites. "We had a great system but we left pockets behind," Mr. Katz said. "These have become more important."
But there is another critical factor that is more intangible, and that is a loss of faith in what might be called a national project.
In the mid-1960s, government in the United States took about 25 percent of the economy in taxes, roughly the same as in the rest of the O.E.C.D. Today, the share in the rest of the O.E.C.D. has grown by 10 percentage points. In the United States it remains about the same.
As the demand for pensions and health care from an aging population grew, limited budgets did not have the space to engage in a broad effort to fund higher education for all. The ethnic gap between shrinking populations of aging whites and growing populations of younger minorities with school-age children further weakened education's political base.
In their book "The Race Between Education and Technology" (Belknap Press, 2010), Mr. Katz and Claudia Goldin of Harvard suggest that in the early 20th-century. states with more elderly residents had higher graduation rates because they had more stable communities in which the old could understand the benefits of educating the young.
These days the elderly no longer live in that once-stable community where they grew up. As James Poterba from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has noted, places with bigger elderly populations now spend less on public education. This is especially true when the elderly and the youths are of different races.
Growing inequality of income could become the last nail in public education's coffin. It contributes to the residential segregation that cordons off rich school districts from the poor and reduces support for public education among the wealthy Americans who can opt out.
Mr. Schleicher told me that, while places like Japan, Singapore and Canada have learned how to educate socially disadvantaged children, in the United States social background plays an outsize role in the educational outcomes.
"It's harder and harder for education systems to counterbalance those tendencies," Mr. Schleicher told me. "But a lot depends on policy. There is a lot we can do."
Decimating public education is not to anyone's advantage, though. If all America manages to do is provide sterling education for the elite, those Robin Hood arrangements of $7,105 per family will start looking like the better deal to everyone else.

Correction: September 12, 2014, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic Scene column on Thursday, about the correlation between higher levels of education and greater income, misidentified the party in power when Britain signed its Education Act in 1944. It was a unity government led by Winston Churchill, not a Labour Party government.

Full text:   Central bankers have been attacked, justifiably, for having done little to quash the great credit bubble that led to the 2008 financial crisis.
They could have raised rates sooner, more quickly and higher (though that's a blunt instrument). They could have used their bully pulpits more (though that's a weak instrument). They and fellow banking regulators could have tightened rules (but that's a fantasy if you are captured by industry).
Now things look quite effervescent if not completely bubbly. Measures of systemic risk, according to the Stern School of Business Volatility Lab, are down from their mid-2008 peaks but still high.
Central bankers are trying to show they have learned the lessons. In a recent speech, Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 at the Fed, examined what worked and didn't work in confronting Israel's housing bubble in the mid-2000s. Mr. Fischer headed that country's central bank from 2005 to 2013.
And in a July report accompanying her testimony to Congress, the chairwoman of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, called out the junk bond sector and biotechnology and social media stocks as overheated. More seriously, the Bank of England took steps in June to tighten lending standards out of mounting concern over Britain's housing bubble.
Given how few lessons from the financial crisis actually seem to have sunk in, this is good news. The conventional wisdom before the crisis was the Greenspanian notion that no one could identify bubbles in time to act. All that was possible was to clean up the wreckage after they burst.
An opposing camp among mainstream economists contended that central banks should indeed worry about bubbles. Stephen G. Cecchetti, an economist at Brandeis, was a bubble-burster at that time, but by his own admission, his camp erred as well. They focused too much on stock prices, and not enough on either property prices or the turbocharging effect of borrowing on the risks taken by investment banks like Lehman Brothers.
"The bubbles to watch out for are the ones have effect on real economic activity," he said.
Unfortunately, some economists remain skeptical about bubble-fighting exhortations. Why crash the markets today to avoid a crash tomorrow? The economy is still suffering from underemployment, wage stagnation, a lack of investment and income and wealth inequality. Premature central bank tightening could be damaging.
What has happened is that bubble-fighting has become a collateral victim of the bigger fight in monetary policy circles over whether the Fed's loose-money policies are debasing the dollar and igniting inflation. They're not.
Predictors of inflation look more and more like Dorothy Martin's acolytes, the subjects of the groundbreaking study "When Prophecy Fails," about true believers whose faith in a predicted apocalypse persists even after it fails to materialize.
Just because there is significant overlap between the inflationista and bubble-popper camps doesn't mean bubble-popping is wrong. Burst bubbles hurt the poor and disenfranchised more than the wealthy, whose savings cushion them from temporary downturns. On the other hand, loose monetary policy bolsters asset prices, which helps the wealthy more than the middle class and the poor.
Jeremy Stein, an economist at Harvard who just left the Federal Reserve board of governors this summer, told me, "I'm broadly sympathetic to the argument that central bankers should be attentive to financial stability ex ante. You can't just look at unemployment and inflation and little else." Translation: Yes, central bankers should watch for bubbles and excess leverage and try to do something about it.
So, are the efforts to rein in the markets working? There are some modestly positive signs. Ms. Yellen's jawboning may have had some effect -- or her timing was just good. Investors pulled out of junk bond funds after she highlighted the elevated prices. But the Fed's lending oversight hasn't demonstrated much grit.
In Britain, if you squint, you can see that house prices ever so slightly cooled off in August. They rose at 9.7 percent year-over-year, a lower rate of growth than July's rise of 10.2 percent.
A one-time bite of the jawbone almost certainly won't be enough. Ms. Yellen and the Fed will need a sustained campaign. This raises two problems with the fight in the United States: One, the Fed may not have sufficient power, and two, it's still too afraid of the markets.
Post-crisis, the Bank of England handles almost all financial regulatory oversight in Britain. Post Dodd-Frank, the United States still has its balkanized and turf-conscious architecture.
Britain has one of most streamlined systems on the planet, said Kermit Schoenholtz, Mr. Cecchetti's blogging partner and an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. "We have one of the most chaotic."
The greater problem is exit strategy. It's easier to loosen than to tighten. Central banks face a conundrum. Any sudden movements, and twitchy investors will sell quickly, crashing markets.
This, in turn, creates a trap within the trap. If investors come to believe that central bankers are reluctant to spook the markets, they become even more complacent, pushing volatility lower. That makes the markets even more likely to overreact to central bank tightening. It's a bad feedback loop.
"If the market is in a complacent state, and volatility is low, it can be harder to execute on the normalization plan," Professor Stein said. ("Normalization" means raising rates and pulling back on bond purchases as the economic recovery gains momentum.) When the Fed merely hinted in late spring last year that it would pull back on its bond purchasing, the markets threw what became known as the Taper Tantrum. The Fed retreated the moment it saw investors' faces turn blue.
Is the Fed cautiousness an effort to protect the investing class? Mr. Stein says no. "It's not because the F.O.M.C. cares about people in the market and is trying to backstop them," he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. "It's because they care about their mandate," which is to help the labor markets and preserve price stability. Sudden market movements tighten credit, which hurts the economy.
A solution, in Mr. Stein's words, is that "over the longer run, it might be helpful to try to build some institutional resolve and reputational capital around the proposition that policy should not be overly reactive to asset-price declines." Translation: The Fed needs to set a tightening course it cannot deviate from even if markets freak out.
Unfortunately, the Fed has made it pretty clear over the last few decades that it lacks the nerve to do this. More recently, this long bull market has been one of the smoothest and steadiest in history. The Fed has reinforced investor complacency and recklessness. The lack of volatility creates a volatile mix. If there's a price to be paid, and many think there will be, it will be borne less by the wealthy than by the rest of us.

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood has long known that women are better customers than men. It's right there in the annual reports from the Motion Picture Association of America: Moviegoing in the United States and Canada was 52 percent female last year. Just as it was five years earlier.
So why are studios only now pumping out female-focused megamovies?
Over the past year, "Gravity," "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," "Frozen" and "Maleficent" have taken in a combined $3.6 billion worldwide, according to the database Box Office Mojo. Coming up, Warner Bros. is finally taking a flier on Wonder Woman, and Columbia Pictures is hot on an all-female remake of "Ghostbusters." Disney has enormous hopes for a live-action "Cinderella," arriving March 13.
Lionsgate, meanwhile, has decided to turn its fledgling "Divergent" series, which stars Shailene Woodley, into at least four films. More modest coming examples of female-aimed movies include the male stripper sequel "Magic Mike 2," the musical comedy "Pitch Perfect 2," an action extravaganza called "Expendabelles" and the bondage romance "Fifty Shades of Grey." (One notable outlier: Marvel has not yet responded to fan clamor for a movie anchored by a female protagonist.)
All of this estrogen is not rolling through Hollywood because there are more women than ever in senior studio jobs, even though there are. And studios are not spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make event movies with female protagonists because cries of neglect have finally soaked in. "I wish that was the case," said Catherine Paura, the movie industry market researcher. "I've been pointing to the potency of the female moviegoer since the 1980s."
No, the shift is happening because female ticket buyers -- finally given the opportunity -- have shown studios the big money, producers say. Women have finally proved to Hollywood's satisfaction that they can power not just a single film (with the occasional sequel) but an entire world-dominating film series. The five "Twilight" action romances took in $3.6 billion, after adjusting for inflation. The first two "Hunger Games" movies, which star Jennifer Lawrence as the archer Katniss Everdeen, took in $1.6 billion; two more are ahead, starting with "Mockingjay -- Part 1," which opens Nov. 21.
Even Paramount's light-horror "Paranormal Activity" series, which has taken in $867 million across five microbudgeted installments, has been primarily supported by female fans. That was not true of the gorier horror franchises ("Saw") of the past. A sixth "Paranormal Activity" is scheduled for 2016.
Hollywood prizes these kinds of franchises above anything else, noted Lynda Obst, a producer whose credits include "Adventures in Babysitting" (1987) and Christopher Nolan's coming "Interstellar." Not only are franchise films easier to market and thus less risky, she said, but they also tend to throw off profits in the form of merchandise and other tie-ins. "Everyone is trying to find a formula here, and right now, 'The Hunger Games' is an awfully compelling one," Ms. Obst added.
Aside from the films, Lionsgate has a "Hunger Games" video game and a traveling exhibition of costumes and is working on theme-park rides. Oh, yes: "We're deep into conversations with prospective partners on four continents," Jon Feltheimer, Lionsgate's chief executive, told Wall Street analysts in mid-August.
"Frozen" may not get a sequel -- at least not anytime soon, given the long gestation time for animation -- but the film, a musical about a pair of fearless princesses, is nonetheless showering Disney in franchise cash. A traveling ice show has just opened, a huge Christmas merchandising push is planned, and a Broadway version is on a fast track.
Over the years, underserved female ticket buyers have occasionally grabbed Hollywood by the throat by turning a "Mamma Mia!" (2008) or a "Titanic" (1997) or a "Clueless" (1995) into a juggernaut. But these hits were easy for studio bosses to dismiss as anomalies. They turned on a special circumstance: an adaptation of a Broadway musical, an epic love story, a witty contemporization of a classic novel.
Or they were not optimal sequel candidates, executives would explain, because their audience was too skewed toward one gender. In 2001, Disney released "The Princess Diaries," which took in $222.4 million worldwide, after adjusting for inflation, and led to "The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement" in 2004. Grand total: $392.3 million. Not bad for two movies that drew a minuscule number of men.
Also in 2001, by comparison, Universal released a testosterone-fueled movie called "The Fast and the Furious." Five sequels and $3 billion in ticket sales later -- and an audience almost evenly split between men and women, according to the studio -- the franchise is still going. Universal is getting a seventh installment ready for an April release.
Better to concentrate on that testosterone.
"Women will go to a male-oriented movie, but men have to be dragged to a female-oriented one," said Ms. Paura, chief executive of Capstone Global Marketing & Research. That old industry saw is a huge generalization that makes some people angry to hear, Ms. Paura noted, "but it has been true more often than not."
A swing started to occur in 2008, with the first "Twilight" movie, which notably came from a small movie company, Summit Entertainment, after major studios had held their noses. A big-screen "Sex and the City" also arrived in 2008, generating roughly $460 million in ticket sales. But both "Twilight" and "Sex and the City" were dismissed by many studio executives as flashes in the pan. One sprouted from a popular book and the other from a popular TV show; both had opening-weekend audiences that were 75 percent or more female, according to studio exit polls.
"Sex and the City 2" wilted -- no gender expansion, partly because it was a terrible movie -- but turnout for the second "Twilight" movie was surprisingly balanced between male and female ticket buyers, and the grosses grew accordingly. The second chapter, "New Moon," took in $788.3 million, 81 percent more than the first one. Maybe that old theory about men avoiding "girl" movies needed to be retired? Maybe moviegoing was starting to reflect a shifting definition of masculinity? (This was the dawn of the era of "manscaping," after all.) And what about changing female tastes in entertainment?
Whatever the reason, evidence started stacking up: "Bridesmaids" became a smash hit in 2011, and "The Hunger Games" opened in 2012. Pixar's first princess movie, "Brave," also succeeded that year. (Universal would love a "Bridesmaids" sequel, by the way, but Kristen Wiig, who starred in and was a co-writer of the first film, has refused.) By the time Angelina Jolie's "Maleficent" rolled into theaters in May, selling $748.7 million in tickets and becoming the No. 1 nonfranchise film of the summer worldwide, the boom could not be denied.
You guessed it: Disney is working on ideas for "Maleficent 2."

Full text:   AS Tommie Leaders, 22, approached college graduation last spring, his professors told him he would have no trouble getting hired. "You're a guy teaching elementary, " they said.
Mr. Leaders, who earned his education degree from the University of Nebraska in June, started teaching fifth grade last month in Council Bluffs, Iowa. He is the only male teacher in the building.
Across the country, teaching is an overwhelmingly female profession, and in fact has become more so over time. More than three-quarters of all teachers in kindergarten through high school are women, according to Education Department data, up from about two-thirds three decades ago. The disparity is most pronounced in elementary and middle schools, where more than 80 percent of teachers are women.
Educators, advocates and lawmakers fight bitterly about tenure, academic standards and the prevalence of testing, but one thing most sides tend to agree on is the importance of raising the status of teaching so the profession will attract the best candidates.
A change in the gender imbalance could sway the way teaching is regarded. Jobs dominated by women pay less on average than those with higher proportions of men, and studies have shown that these careers tend to enjoy less prestige as well.
Although teaching was once a career for men, by the time women began entering the work force in large numbers in the 1960s, teaching, along with nursing, was one of very few careers open to them. But despite inroads that women have made entering previously male-dominated fields, there has not been a corresponding flow of men into teaching and nursing.
"We're not beyond having a cultural devaluation of women's work," said Philip N. Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. "So that if a job is done primarily by women, people tend to believe it has less value."
Although teachers have more time off and, at least for now, better benefits and job security than many other professions, their pay has remained essentially stagnant since 1970 in inflation-adjusted terms. The median pay for an elementary school teacher is now about $40,000.
According to Maria Fitzpatrick, an economist at Cornell University who analyzed census data, women who work outside of teaching have seen their pay rise by about 25 percent since 1970 while average men's wages in nonteaching jobs have actually fallen, also in inflation-adjusted terms. Still, men can earn much more, on average, outside of teaching, while women's teaching salaries more closely match the average pay for women outside of education.
Because they are still the primary caregivers in families, women may be more attracted to the profession than men in part because they can work the same schedules as their children. Teachers can take a few years out of work to stay at home with babies or toddlers and return to the profession easily (although if they do, their salaries may lag behind those who don't take time off). And although the recession caused many school districts to hand out pink slips, teachers generally have lower levels of unemployment than other college-educated Americans.
With so few men currently in teaching, other men may be less inclined to view it as a desirable option. "It will be less and less in their head that this is an occupation for males," said Richard M. Ingersoll, a professor of education and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania who has analyzed education department data on the demographics of teaching. "There's a snowball effect."
Of course there are other reasons teaching may be devalued beyond the fact that so many women do it. After all, in countries like Finland and Singapore -- where students tend to perform better on academic tests than students in the United States -- teachers are more highly regarded despite the fact that the gender imbalance looks similar at the front of the classroom. In the United States, where 42 percent of high school teachers are men, high school educators do not enjoy a higher status than those in elementary school.
Teachers unions argue that the swift adoption of new academic standards, the use of standardized tests to evaluate teachers' job performance and efforts to overhaul tenure all make teaching a less attractive career for anyone.
"The reality of teaching right now is that it's always been a hard job," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's second largest teachers union. It's "harder now than ever before, with less and less respect," she said.
Deans of education departments lament the lack of men, but are not sure what to do about it. Susan H. Fuhrman, president of Teachers College at Columbia University, said she was puzzled by the persistent absence of men in elementary education programs, where women outnumber them nine to one. "I do think it's a vicious cycle," she said. "Women went into it without other options and it was a low-status profession that was associated with women, and the fact that it's now dominated by women inhibits the status from increasing."
Simply recruiting more men into the profession is not likely to raise the quality of the teaching force.
And at a time when teachers are nowhere near to representing the racial diversity of America's students, many educators argue that increasing the number of African-American and Latino teachers is a higher priority than simply bringing more men onto the job.
Both Teach for America, the group that places high-achieving college graduates in low-income schools for two-year stints, and Teach.org, a newly formed partnership between the Department of Education and several companies, teachers unions and other groups, have recently introduced initiatives aimed specifically at recruiting more racial minorities.
Still, some educators say that boys, who tend to struggle in school more than girls, could use more male role models, or simply people who understand them, in the classroom.
Some say the notion that boys need to be taught differently or by men simply underscores gender stereotypes.
Rafe Esquith, a 32-year veteran who teaches fifth grade at Hobart Boulevard Elementary School in Los Angeles and has written two books on teaching, hopes to show his students -- a vast majority of whom come from poor families -- "a guy who lives a different life than a lot of the male role models that they see." Other than that, he said, the value of a man in the classroom "depends on the man, I think."
Then again, some women may not be eager to open the profession to more men. Men who do become teachers tend to be promoted more quickly into senior administrative positions, said Christine L. Williams, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas who has studied the so-called glass escalator. Nearly half of all school principals are men. If educators are determined to get more men into classrooms, Professor Williams said, the best way would simply be to upgrade the conditions and pay of the job. "And that," she said, "would positively impact the job for women as well."

Full text:   Fabiano Caruana turned in one of the most dominant performances in the game's history at the Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis. He won his first seven games and clinched first place long before the tournament ended on Saturday.
Caruana, an Italian grandmaster, notched victories over all five of his competitors at the elite tournament, which is named for its sponsors, Rex and Jeanne Sinquefield, the United States' leading chess benefactors.
His victories included a Round 3 rout of the world champion, Magnus Carlsen of Norway. Caruana's other victims? Levon Aronian of Armenia, who was ranked No. 2 in the world before the tournament; Hikaru Nakamura, the United States' top player; Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria; and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France. All are among the world's top nine players.
After Vachier-Lagrave lost to Caruana on Wednesday, he said: "I've never seen this. I've never even seen Carlsen play so well."
Based on the competitors' average rating (the system that is used to rank players), it was the strongest tournament in history, although in recent years all players have benefited from ratings inflation.
The last time a player racked up a winning streak nearly as remarkable as Caruana's was in 2005 when Topalov began the World Chess Championship tournament in San Luis, Argentina, with six victories in seven games on his way to capturing the title. Anatoly Karpov, the former world champion from Russa, won his first six games at the 1994 Linares tournament in Spain. His final score -- 11 points out of 13 -- had been widely acknowledged as the game's most impressive tournament performance until Caruana's play at the Sinquefield Cup.
In the Round 3 match between Caruana and Carlsen, the world champion was already facing a difficult situation in the top diagram. Caruana, who was Black, had the bishop pair and the better pawn structure. Carlsen played 15 Bf7, which was tricky. If Caruana had replied 15 ... Qf7, then 16 Ne5 would have given Carlsen an opening for a dangerous attack.
But Caruana calmly played 15 ... Kf7, and after 16 Ne5 Kg8 17 Ng6 Qg5 18 Rf8 Kh7 19 Nh8 Bg4! 20 Qf1 Nd3! 21 Qd3 (to prevent 21 ... Qe3) Rf8 22 hg4 Qg4 23 Nf3 Qg3 24 e5 Kh8 25 e6 Bb6 26 Kh1 Qg4 27 Qd6 Rd8 28 Qe5 Rd5 29 Qb8 Kh7 30 e7 Qh5, Carlsen made a final mistake with 31 Nh2. After 31 ... Rd1 32 Rd1 Qd1 33 Nf1 Qf1 34 Kh2 Qg1, he resigned because 35 Kh3 Qe3 36 Kh2 Qe6 would have been hopeless.
In Round 6, Caruana simply demolished Topalov. In the bottom diagram, Topalov was in trouble. He needed to play 23 ... Rd7. Instead, he went with 23 ... Nc6, and Caruana replied with 24 Be6! fe6 25 Rf3 Ke8 26 Qe6 Rg7 27 Qh6 Nd4 28 e6! Nf3 29 gf3 Bf8 30 Qh5 Ke7 31 Bg7.
Topalov resigned rather than face 31 ... Bg7 32 Qf7 Kd6 33 e7, etc. It would not have helped to play 25 ... Kg7 because after 26 Qh5 Rdf8 27 Rf6!, Black's position would have collapsed.

Full text:   EUROPE has an inflation problem. Prices are not rising fast enough.
In announcing new efforts to stimulate economies in the eurozone, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, spoke this week of "the worsening of the medium-term inflation outlook," adding that numerous indicators indicated falling prices.
As can be seen in the accompanying charts, consumer prices in Germany rose only 0.8 percent over the most recent 12 months, well below the central bank's target rate of 2 percent. But that tiny increase was nonetheless the largest of any in the four largest countries in the eurozone. French prices rose 0.6 percent, while Italian prices were unchanged and Spanish prices declined 0.4 percent.
Two years ago, Germany's inflation rate was 1.9 percent, lower than any of the other three nations'.
A major cause of the economic malaise in many eurozone countries is that labor costs rose much more rapidly than they did in Germany during the years after the euro was created in 1999. That hurt the ability of those countries to compete for export business, while helping German business.
From 2000 through early 2008, unit labor costs in France rose 17.4 percent, and by more in Italy and Spain. But in Germany, those costs fell.
Since then, unit wage costs have been rising in Germany, but those in France and Italy have risen nearly as much. Only in Spain have unit labor costs declined since early 2008 -- and it took a severe recession to accomplish that.
The adult unemployment rate in Spain has been over 20 percent for nearly three years, and the rate for younger workers -- those who are 24 or younger -- has been above 50 percent for two years.
In Italy, unemployment has not been quite that high -- the latest figures are 10.4 percent for adults and 42.9 percent for younger workers -- but Italy's economy is still shrinking, while Spain's has been growing for a year. The Italian economy, adjusted for inflation, is now smaller than it was in 2003.
Had Germany had its own currency for the last 14 years, it would now no doubt have risen against other European currencies, and it would be significantly stronger relative to the United States dollar than the euro is now. That has done wonders for the German economy, where unemployment rates have been falling for years, even as those in its neighbors rose.
"Because Germany through 2000 to 2007 had an inflation rate below that in France and Italy, it now has to have an inflation rate above these countries," said Simon Wren-Lewis, an economist at Oxford University in Britain. "If E.C.B. monetary policy was working, Germany would get no choice in this, because it is part of what they signed up to when joining the euro."
Now, even the German economy is beginning to show some strain. Its gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the second quarter, according to official estimates. The French economy also declined.
Mr. Draghi, the president of the central bank, said this week that declining growth prospects for the eurozone were a major reason that more aggressive actions by the bank were needed. Earlier efforts by the central bank to stimulate bank lending do not appear to have worked, so the European Central Bank will now buy securities backed by bank loans in the hope that will get money out to companies that will spend and invest.
Chart Germany Versus the Rest: The European Central Bank, Alarmed by Low Inflation and the Possibility of a New Recession in the Eurozone, Plans to Buy Securities Backed by Loans, a Tactic It Hopes Will Help Persuade Banks to Make More Loans. A Big Part of Europe's Problem Is That Unit Labor Costs Within the Eurozone Diverged in the Years Before the Financial Crisis, with German Costs Falling and Those of Other Countries Rising. The Gap has Narrowed Since, but Only at a Slow Rate, and It Took Extraordinarily High Unemployment Rates to Accomplish That. (Sources: Eurostat, Haver Analytics)

Abstract: Starting next month, the E.C.B. will begin buying asset-backed securities: packages of home loans, business loans or even credit card debt, which banks bundle and sell to investors. In effect, the central bank will pump money into the financial system using the asset purchases, then charge banks if they park the money rather than put it to more productive use like loans to businesses or consumers.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, is reaching deep into his toolbox to revive the region's moribund economy.
He is cutting interest rates to the bone. He is charging banks even more to park their money. And he is using the central bank's financial muscle to spur lending.
But the question is whether the new actions, announced on Thursday, will be enough to fix Europe's problems. If they don't, Mr. Draghi doesn't have many options left.
"It's a positive step by the E.C.B.," said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. But he added, "no matter how you look at it, monetary policy has done all it can."
Mr. Draghi's aggressive moves reflect the gloomy, if familiar, state of the European economy. Low inflation and stagnant growth feed on each other in a vicious cycle, making existing debt burdens more onerous and making adjustments between the more prosperous Northern European nations and weaker southern ones more painful. The situation has confounded policy makers and politicians who are now grappling with how to prevent another full-on recession.
To some extent, Mr. Draghi is drawing from a new playbook.
Significantly, the central bank took the first steps toward large-scale asset purchases, a milder version of the so-called quantitative easing that the Federal Reserve has used in recent years to pump money into the United States economy.
Starting next month, the E.C.B. will begin buying asset-backed securities: packages of home loans, business loans or even credit card debt, which banks bundle and sell to investors.
For good measure, the central bank also cut interest rates again.
The rate at which the E.C.B. issues short-term loans to banks fell to 0.05 percent from 0.15 percent. The central bank also increased the fee it imposes on banks to store money at the E.C.B., to 0.2 percent from 0.1 percent. That so-called negative deposit rate, first instituted in June, has already pushed some market interest rates below zero.
The collective goal is to kick-start lending. In effect, the central bank will pump money into the financial system using the asset purchases, then charge banks if they park the money rather than put it to more productive use like loans to businesses or consumers.
The moves appeased the market, at least at the outset. Stock and bond prices rose on Thursday. The euro fell sharply against the dollar, a boon for European exporters, since it makes their cars, wine and other goods cheaper abroad. And economists generally welcomed the moves as a sign that the central bank was pulling out all the stops to prevent the eurozone from slipping back into recession.
But even Mr. Draghi conceded that the measures would be ineffective unless political leaders in the eurozone overcame their gridlock and took concerted action to stimulate the regional economy. "It's very difficult for us to reach our objective" using monetary policy alone, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference. Referring to political leaders, he said, "Each of us has to do their own jobs."
As the markets start to digest the E.C.B.'s latest strategy, the initial euphoria might fade.
The details of the bond-buying program were vague. The central bank offered little information about how much money the measures would pump into the economy. Mr. Draghi said that was partly because of the lack of data on how many assets would meet E.C.B. quality standards.
And it was unclear whether the purchases truly would qualify as Fed-style quantitative easing. Mr. Draghi said, in effect, yes and no. The program resembles quantitative easing in that the E.C.B. will purchase assets outright.
But the Fed's quantitative easing, while including asset-backed securities, was based largely on buying up United States government debt in the form of Treasury bills and bonds. By targeting a narrower pool of assets, the E.C.B. effort will be far more modest, at least at first.
Mr. Draghi said that the central bank's governing council was ready to take further measures if needed -- a clear reference to quantitative easing, or broad-based purchases of government bonds or other assets. "The governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments," Mr. Draghi said at the news conference.
That statement was undercut somewhat, however, by his subsequent admission that some members of the governing council had opposed the moves announced on Thursday, a sign that they would probably oppose a broader program of asset purchases. The council includes the central bank governors of the 18 countries in the eurozone.
In practice the E.C.B. would find it much more difficult than the Fed to buy government bonds, which would be necessary for full-blown quantitative easing. Government bond purchases would provoke vehement opposition in some European quarters, particularly in Germany, where many people regard such purchases as an abuse of central bank power.
"Such a policy would be at the expense of European taxpayers, who would have to pay for the losses incurred by the E.C.B.," Hans-Werner Sinn, a prominent economist who is president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich, said in a statement on Thursday.
As Mr. Draghi also made clear, the E.C.B.'s efforts won't be enough unless the eurozone heads of state take more action.
That might presumably include François Hollande, the deeply unpopular president of France, and Matteo Renzi, the promising but largely unproven prime minister of Italy. Mr. Draghi has spoken to both leaders recently, but declined on Thursday to say what they discussed.
There is no quid pro quo, Mr. Draghi insisted, in which the E.C.B. doles out stimulus measures if political leaders force through unpopular changes like fewer restrictions on hiring and firing -- the sort of changes many economists say France and Italy, among others, must take. "There isn't any grand bargain here," he said.
But there is pressure. Mr. Draghi returned on Thursday to a theme he had raised last month at a Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., complaining of the impediments to entrepreneurship that still plague many eurozone countries.
"We can provide as much credit as we want," he said. "But if the person who plans to use this credit for a new business has to wait eight months before he or she can open this new business, and then she has to pay lots of taxes, this person will not apply for credit."
Part of any joint action by eurozone leaders would require the backing of Germany and Angela Merkel, its chancellor. And so far the Germans have been reluctant to abandon the philosophy of strict budgetary discipline, often referred to as austerity, that they have preached throughout the financial crisis, and that a growing chorus of critics says is to blame for the eurozone's inability to resume growth.
The most important effect of the central bank measures might be psychological. Thursday's moves signaled that at least one European institution is doing all it can to avert the threat of deflation -- the pernicious downward spiral of prices that often leads to high unemployment. Annual inflation in the eurozone was 0.3 percent in August, according to an official estimate, worrisomely below the central bank's target of about 2 percent.
"It's most important to give businesses, consumers and politicians as well the feeling that we are willing to do something for this recovery," said Horst Löchel, a professor of economics at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. "The mood is very, very important."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- American businesses hired workers at a steady clip in August, and services sector activity accelerated to the highest point in six and a half years, providing evidence that the economy is on track for sturdy growth in the third quarter.
That view was reinforced by other data on Thursday showing only a slight increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week and a narrowing in the trade deficit in July to its lowest point in six months.
"The story line of underlying growth momentum at least being sustained and at best picking up this quarter has more or less been confirmed," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities.
ADP, a payroll processing firm, said private sector payrolls increased by 204,000 last month after rising by 212,000 in July, with gains spread across a range of industries.
While the ADP report was a bit softer than economists expected, it was the fifth consecutive month of gains above 200,000 and augured well for the broader employment report that the government will release on Friday.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 59.6 last month, the highest reading since its inception in January 2008, from 58.7 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the vast services sector..
The government on Friday is expected to report that employers added 225,000 jobs last month after an increase of 209,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
The upbeat employment picture was also captured in another report from the Labor Department showing that initial claims for state unemployment benefits last week held at levels consistent with a tightening of labor market conditions. Initial jobless claims rose 4,000, to a seasonally adjusted 302,000.
"The broad evidence is that the labor market continues to improve at a very solid rate," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.
The I.S.M. services report followed strengthening auto sales and manufacturing data in suggesting a solid base for growth, as did the report on international trade.
The Commerce Department said the United States trade deficit fell 0.6 percent to $40.5 billion in July, its smallest size since January. When adjusted for inflation, it reached its narrowest point since December 2013, prompting economists to raise their estimates for third-quarter gross domestic product.
Goldman Sachs lifted its G.D.P. growth forecast by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.2 percent annual rate. Morgan Stanley raised its estimate to a 3.3 percent pace, from 3 percent.
In July, exports rose 0.9 percent to a record high, with automobile and nonpetroleum exports surging to new highs.
That eclipsed a 0.7 percent rebound in imports. The rise in imports, which was driven by food and autos, is a sign of underlying strength in domestic demand.

Abstract: On Thursday, the European Central Bank announced a series of new steps it was taking in an effort to boost Europe's economy. [...]yes, a tendency to prefer truthiness to more complicated truth is and pretty much always has been associated with political conservatism, and this tendency is especially strong in an era when leading politicians get their monetary theory from Ayn Rand novels. Back in the Gilded Age, the elite mobilized en masse to defeat William Jennings Bryan, who threatened to take the United States off the gold standard; campaign spending as a percentage of G.D.P. was far higher in 1896 than in any presidential election before or since.

Full text:   On Thursday, the European Central Bank announced a series of new steps it was taking in an effort to boost Europe's economy. There was a whiff of desperation about the announcement, which was reassuring. Europe, which is doing worse than it did in the 1930s, is clearly in the grip of a deflationary vortex, and it's good to know that the central bank understands that. But its epiphany may have come too late. It's far from clear that the measures now on the table will be strong enough to reverse the downward spiral.
And there but for the grace of Bernanke go we. Things in the United States are far from O.K., but we seem (at least for now) to have steered clear of the kind of trap facing Europe. Why? One answer is that the Federal Reserve started doing the right thing years ago, buying trillions of dollars' worth of bonds in order to avoid the situation its European counterpart now faces.
You can argue, and I would, that the Fed should have done even more. But Fed officials have faced fierce attacks all the way. Pundits, politicians and plutocrats have accused them, over and over again, of "debasing" the dollar, and warned that soaring inflation is just around the corner. The predicted surge in inflation has never arrived, but despite being wrong year after year, hardly any of the critics have admitted being wrong, or even changed their tune. And the question I've been trying to answer is why. What is it that makes a powerful faction in our body politic -- call it the deflation caucus -- demand tight money even in a depressed, low-inflation economy?
One thing is clear: Like so much else these days, monetary policy has become very much a partisan issue. It's not just that talk of dollar debasement comes pretty much exclusively from the right of the political spectrum; inflation paranoia has, to a remarkable extent, become a matter of conservative political correctness, so that even economists who should know better have joined in the chorus. So we can focus the question further: Why do people on the right hate monetary expansion, even when it's desperately needed?
One answer is the power of truthiness -- Stephen Colbert's justly famed term for things that aren't true, but feel true to some people. "The Fed is printing money, printing money leads to inflation, and inflation is always a bad thing" is a triply untrue statement, but it feels true to a lot of people. And, yes, a tendency to prefer truthiness to more complicated truth is and pretty much always has been associated with political conservatism, and this tendency is especially strong in an era when leading politicians get their monetary theory from Ayn Rand novels.
Another answer is class interest. Inflation helps debtors and hurts creditors, deflation does the reverse. And the wealthy are much more likely than workers and the poor to be creditors, to have money in the bank and bonds in their portfolio rather than mortgages and credit-card balances outstanding. Back in the Gilded Age, the elite mobilized en masse to defeat William Jennings Bryan, who threatened to take the United States off the gold standard; campaign spending as a percentage of G.D.P. was far higher in 1896 than in any presidential election before or since. Are the wealthy similarly mobilized against easy-money policies today?
As far as I know, we don't have rigorous evidence to that effect. There are certainly a lot of wealthy investors in the debasing-the-dollar crowd, but we don't know for sure how representative they are -- and you could argue that big investors should like the Fed's expansionary policies, which have been very good for the stock market. But the wealthy may not trust that connection, in part because the inflationary '70s were very bad for stocks. And we do know that the very wealthy are much more likely than the general public to consider budget deficits our biggest problem, even though fiscal austerity is probably bad for profits. So perceived class interest is probably also a key motivation for the deflation caucus.
A side note: Europe's wealthy aren't as wealthy or influential as their American counterparts, but creditor interests are nonetheless even more powerful than they are here because creditor nations, Germany in particular, have ended up dictating policy for the whole of Europe.
And the important thing to understand is that the dominance of creditor interests on both sides of the Atlantic, supported by false but viscerally appealing economic doctrines, has had tragic consequences. Our economies have been dragged down by the woes of debtors, who have been forced to slash spending. To avoid a deep, prolonged slump, we needed policies to offset this drag. What we got instead was an obsession with the evils of budget deficits and paranoia over inflation -- and a slump that has gone on and on.

Full text:   Medicare spending isn't just lower than experts predicted a few years ago. On a per-person basis, Medicare spending is actually falling.
If the pattern continues, as the Congressional Budget Office forecasts, it will be a rarity in the Medicare program's history. Spending per Medicare patient has almost always grown more rapidly than the economy as a whole, often by a wide margin.
Health economists call that difference "excess cost growth."
Lately, though, some have taken to using the unwieldy phrase "negative excess cost growth."
This year, Medicare, which covers those 65 and older and people with disabilities, will spend about $11,200 on average for every person enrolled in the program. By comparison, it spent $12,000 three years ago, in inflation-adjusted dollars. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the number will fall below $11,000 by 2017 and stay below this year's number until 2020.
The starkness of the pattern has been obscured because the budget office does not generally adjust its numbers for inflation. So its official charts -- and other charts based on them -- can mislead when it comes to future costs because they show increases that are simply a reflection of economy-wide inflation. Adjusted to reflect the value of a dollar, Medicare spending has not been rising and is not projected to rise in the next few years.
The only other time cost growth has ever stayed below zero was in the late 1990s, when Congress made substantial cuts to Medicare spending. Then, the trend lasted for three years. This time, the budget office expects it to be more enduring.
The recent pattern reflects two main factors. One is that the baby boom generation is entering the program. In the long term, that's a problem for Medicare's finances because the number of people it must care for is going to surge. But in the short term, it skews the group enrolled in Medicare toward a younger, healthier population.
The second factor is more surprising and consequential. Over the last few years, Medicare patients have been using fewer expensive medical services, particularly hospital care and prescription drugs. The budget office is increasingly persuaded that such a pattern is going to last for a while.
The reduction in the usual growth in health care spending means spending for the entire Medicare program is on track to grow more slowly over the next decade, even as more baby boomers reach retirement age and the number of people entering the program grows.
An inflation-adjusted picture of Medicare's overall spending trajectory, according to the C.B.O., shows modest growth for the program, especially compared with its estimates from just a few years ago. Reductions made in the last four years alone are responsible for 10-year savings of more than $715 billion, which dwarfs nearly every deficit-reduction measure currently under discussion.
(The budget office's projections here assume that Congress will not raise doctors' pay through its usual custom of temporary "doc fix" bills, but the trend will look almost identical even if Congress does pass such bills.)
Will it last? No one knows. The 1990s slowdown obviously did not last. But even if you focus only on what has happened, rather than on what budget analysts think will happen in the future, the change is remarkable. The notion that Medicare would have been spending less money, per person, would have been hard to fathom just a few years ago. (Remember the fights about the Affordable Care Act's "rationing" board and Paul Ryan's Medicare voucher plan? Both were aiming for annual excess cost growth targets of 1 percent.)
The demographic pressures on the program still matter, but the flat per-person spending growth makes the Medicare budget more affordable. Historically, the budget office has thought about excess spending growth as representing about half of Medicare's future spending growth, with the aging of the population representing the other half. Now that first half has gotten a lot smaller.

Full text:   In the months before Labor Day last year, job growth was so slow that economists said it would take until 2021 to replace the jobs that were lost or never created in the recession and its aftermath.
The pace has picked up since then; at the current rate, missing jobs will be recovered by 2018. Still, five years into an economic recovery that has been notable for resurging corporate profits, the number and quality of jobs are still lagging badly, as are wages and salaries.
In 2013, after-tax corporate profits as a share of the economy tied with their highest level on record (in 1965), while labor compensation as a share of the economy hit its lowest point since 1948. Wage growth since 1979 has not kept pace with productivity growth, resulting in falling or flat wages for most workers and big gains for corporate coffers, shareholders, executives and others at the top of the income ladder.
Worse, the recent upturn in growth, even if sustained, will not necessarily lead to markedly improved living standards for most workers.
That's because the economy's lopsidedness is not mainly the result of market forces, but of the lack of policies to ensure broader prosperity. The imbalance will not change without labor and economic reforms.
For instance, new research from the Economic Policy Institute shows that from the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014, hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, fell for nearly everyone. An exception was a small gain for the bottom 10 percent of wage earners, which was because of minimum-wage increases in 13 states this year.
That's clear evidence that raising the federal minimum wage, while only a first step toward better pay, would have a powerful effect. A lift from the current $7.25 an hour to the modest $10.10 called for by President Obama and Democrats in Congress would put an estimated additional $35 billion in the pockets of affected workers over a three-year phase-in period.
Unionization is also associated with higher wages and benefits, especially for low-wage workers, which argues for greater legal enforcement of the right to organize without retaliation.
Similarly, stronger enforcement of both labor laws and antitrust laws is needed to ensure against wage theft. Once assumed to be mainly an issue of unpaid overtime or other wage violations, wage theft became a white-collar issue this year, when it was revealed that collusion among the biggest companies in Silicon Valley had suppressed the pay of software engineers by an estimated $3 billion.
The pay of middle-income workers has also been diminished. Decades of outsourcing government jobs to the private sector has undercut public employment, once a mainstay of middle-class life, even as evidence has mounted that outsourcing often does not save money or improve services. What's needed is a systematic review of government contracts with the private sector and a willingness to end those that are counterproductive.
Another threat to middle-class wages is rampant misclassification -- of employees as independent contractors and of workers as supervisors -- a tactic that employers use to deny pay and benefits that would otherwise be due. In a promising development, a federal appellate court recently ruled that drivers for FedEx in California are employees, not independent contractors, an example of the courts stepping in when the other branches of government have let an injustice persist.
There has been progress since last Labor Day. Mr. Obama has signed executive orders to improve the pay and working conditions of employees of federal contractors. The Labor Department is revising rules on overtime pay; simply updating them for inflation would make millions of additional workers eligible for time-and-a-half for overtime.
What is still lacking, however, is a full-employment agenda that regards labor, not corporations, as the center of the economy -- a change that would be a reversal of the priorities of the last 35 years.

"Once we get past September we will be entering what has historically been the sweet spot of the presidential cycle," said Ed Clissold, the United States market strategist for the Ned Davis Research Group, and co-author of a recently published "Mid-Term Election Handbook," which is concerned far more with the stock market than with congressional politics.

Full text:   Will the Republicans win control of Congress? With summer drawing to a close, the midterm election is just two months away and this question is likely to be analyzed and debated with increasing urgency.
But for the stock market, the answer may not matter at all: The market has a tendency to rally no matter which party wins a midterm election. That's what the historical record suggests, anyway.
In fact, from the standpoint of stock market history, political outcomes aren't very relevant, but the calendar is. September is typically a difficult and volatile month for stocks, while in a midterm election year the clouds over Wall Street have tended to lift in October. Regardless of which side has won in a November midterm election, the market has generally prospered for the rest of the year. And it has often excelled in the next calendar year, typically the most propitious year for stocks in what is often called the four-year presidential cycle.
If you believe in this market cycle, we are now at an interesting moment. "Once we get past September we will be entering what has historically been the sweet spot of the presidential cycle," said Ed Clissold, the United States market strategist for the Ned Davis Research Group, and co-author of a recently published "Mid-Term Election Handbook," which is concerned far more with the stock market than with congressional politics.
The Stock Trader's Almanac has been slicing and dicing these market patterns since Yale Hirsch, its former editor, popularized them in its first edition in 1968. It has chronicled glaring differences in the performance of the Dow Jones industrial average that appear to be loosely linked to the political calendar.
Here is that compendium's current calculations for the average annual gain of the Dow Jones industrial average in each year of a presidential term, going back to the beginning of the 20th century: 6.2 percent for Year 1, 4 percent for Year 2 (which this midterm year would be), 12.4 percent for Year 3 and 7.5 percent for Year 4.
What to make of all this? The data can be endlessly fascinating, in the way baseball or soccer statistics can be. (Forgive me, Britain: For you, it's "football.") They may be best used as light entertainment.
Goldman Sachs, you may recall, engaged in an elaborate statistical study to handicap the recent World Cup, predicting, erroneously, that Brazil would win it all, and noting that, based on historical patterns, a victory could give Brazil's stock market a one-month, 3.5-percentage-point performance edge. Brazil's disappointing play in the World Cup demonstrated the limits of high-powered forecasting, but even if Brazil had won, it would have been the height of foolishness to have made an investment on the sole basis of any of those numbers. Still, they were fun for fans and market wonks to contemplate.
So let's be clear: These are merely patterns, not reliable statistics. As the saying goes, past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. Virtually no one recommends using historical market patterns as simple templates for investing.
"We believe these patterns are worth considering," Mr. Clissold said. "But we don't believe they ought to be anyone's main input for investing."
Why even consider them, then? Aside from their entertainment value, the most compelling reason is simple: They may help explain what is going on in the world. A sizable cottage industry of Wall Street prognosticators and academics regularly dabbles in the dark arts of election cycles, economics and market movements. In his seminal study, "Predicting Presidential Elections and Other Things," Ray C. Fair, the Yale economist, points out that the state of the economy and the results of elections for president and Congress appear tightly correlated. He hypothesizes that a strong economy helps the incumbent president and his party, and many analysts make similar assumptions.
Mr. Fair doesn't use the market directly in his election equations; the growth rate of the gross domestic product, and the inflation rate, are the economic inputs he favors. (For now, his model shows that the midterm election is too close to call.)
The correlation between a political outcome and the movement of the stock market hasn't been demonstrated in as compelling a fashion. There are theories, of course. Mr. Hirsch said that because presidents -- and their parties -- want to win elections, they manipulate the economy as best they can to assure favorable outcomes, and in so doing they affect the stock market. In a president's first year, for example, he can afford to take tough measures, proceeding to stimulate the economy when the next election draws near, or so the theory goes. Academics have considered these issues, too. In most cases, the research has been inconclusive.
But oh, those numbers! They are endlessly intriguing: The stock market, for example, has generally done better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones. From 1901 through 2013, the Dow gained 7.9 percent, annualized, under Democrats, versus 3 percent under Republicans, according to Ned Davis data. Why?
Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, says: "It may be because we have a consumer-driven economy, and Democrats tend to spread the wealth around to lower-income people, who tend to spend it. The market may be responding to that." Or not. "It's possible that these are just numbers and don't mean much," he added. "We don't really know."
Then there are midterm elections under Democratic presidents, specifically. The market has done splendidly when Congress has been split, as it is now, with annualized returns of 10.4 percent, but there is a major caveat, Mr. Clissold said. The Obama years are the only ones since the dawn of the 20th century in which there has been a Democratic president with a divided Congress. "That's not a very big data set," he said wryly.
There's a little more data for a Republican-controlled Congress under a Democratic president, an alignment that occurred under both Bill Clinton and Woodrow Wilson, and in those years the Dow gained 9.6 percent, on average.
The record for midterm elections under lame ducks like Mr. Obama isn't very deep, either. Since World War II, there have been four of them, during the presidencies of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Mr. Clinton and George W. Bush. The midterm in November will be the fifth. For what it's worth, the data is upbeat, Mr. Hickey said, with positive returns but less volatility than in elections during presidential first terms.
Regardless of the outcome in the Senate, Republicans are virtually assured of retaining control of the House, so power in Washington will remain divided, and that's been good for stocks, Mr. Hickey said. "The market seems to like it when you don't have one party controlling everything. It likes the status quo. And it likes it when administrations run out of steam," which, he said, tends to happen by the middle of a presidential second term.
"Wall Street assumes a president at that point won't get much more done," he said. "And the market likes it when nothing much happens in Washington."
None of this proves where the market is heading, of course, and it isn't an uplifting gloss on the state of affairs in Washington. It does, however, suggest a cheery mood for the stock market over the next year or so. And if enough people believe it, that may even turn out to be true.

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- American moviegoers sent a clear message to Hollywood over the summer: We are tired of more of the same.
But don't entirely blame the sequels and superheroes.
The film industry had its worst summer in North America, still the world's No. 1 movie market, since at least 1997, after adjusting for inflation. Between the first weekend in May through the end of August, ticket sales in the United States and Canada are expected to total roughly $3.9 billion, a 15 percent decline from the same stretch last year, according to Rentrak, a box office data company.
Analysts in the spring had predicted an 11 percent drop, citing viewing distractions like the World Cup and scuttled release plans for films like "Fast and Furious 6" and Pixar's "Good Dinosaur," which both had production problems. But the decline was worse than expected, and the reason, analysts and studio executives said, may have been a nasty case of déjà vu.
Tom Cruise's futuristic "Edge of Tomorrow," for instance, looked like a hit -- and that was exactly its problem. The title was too similar to "The Day After Tomorrow," released in summer 2004. The barren landscape too closely resembled Mr. Cruise's 2013 film "Oblivion." Characters walking around in robot exoskeletons? Been there ("Pacific Rim"), done that ("Real Steel").
Despite stellar reviews, "Edge of Tomorrow" took in $99.9 million at North American theaters, a major disappointment for Warner Bros., which spent at least $250 million on production and domestic marketing.
"Hercules," which arrived seven months after "The Legend of Hercules," turned out to be a box office weakling. "Sex Tape" was heavily marketed on Cameron Diaz's legs, but moviegoers shrugged: Sorry, we've seen them. "Both 'Sex Tape' and 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' failed to stand out among the other R-rated comedies," said Phil Contrino, the chief analyst at BoxOffice.com.
Sameness sells tickets, no doubt about it. The Top 10 movies of the summer all came from familiar brands (Marvel, DreamWorks Animation), featured familiar characters ("Godzilla") or turned on familiar stories (the raunchy college comedy). Still, only a few of those films truly popped, Mr. Contrino noted, adding that the ones that did "each gave fans something that was unique, fresh and surprising."
Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy" was the No. 1 movie, selling more than $258 million in tickets and still going strong. "Guardians" was widely praised as offering something moviegoers had not seen before -- namely, comedic D-List superheroes, including a talking raccoon and a walking plant, against a 1970s-era soundtrack.
Disney's "Maleficent" also became a runaway hit, taking in $237.6 million in North America to become third-biggest movie of the summer. Not bad for a film that one Wells Fargo analyst earmarked in the spring as a too-weird-to-succeed bomb.
Although the characters were familiar to anyone who knows the "Sleeping Beauty" tale, which is just about everyone, "Maleficent" offered a revisionist story line with an unexpected twist. Angelina Jolie's titular villain, an evil fairy with a fondness for bondage gear, transformed into a hero by the movie's final reel.
"Maleficent" may have had skeptics, but nobody saw "Lucy" coming. A modestly budgeted science-fiction movie starring Scarlett Johansson, "Lucy" delivered a hefty $115.1 million in ticket sales. Fresh marketing may have made the difference: Universal Pictures backed "Lucy" with an unusual black-and-white ad campaign that stood out against a sea of uninspired billboards.
Movie companies are quick to point out that overseas audiences turned many films into hits, arguing that they work in a global marketplace, and that judging a movie's success or failure based on North America is unfair.
What they do not often mention is that overseas ticket sales are often less profitable. In China, for instance, as little as 25 cents of every box office dollar comes back to Hollywood; in the United States, it's 50 percent.
Studios released 12 sequels this summer, from the mega-budgeted "Amazing Spider-Man 2" to the low-priced "Step Up All In." If sequels are doing their job, ticket sales go up: Existing fans come back, new crowds come in. At the very least, sequels are expected to tread box office water.
But only three managed to deliver significantly improved results, compared with their series predecessor: "22 Jump Street," "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" and "X-Men: Days of Future Past." One, "The Purge: Anarchy," was approximately flat.
That left eight sequels to nose-dive in North America. Ticket sales for Paramount's "Transformers: Age of Extinction" totaled $243.9 million, a 35 percent decline from results for "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" three years ago. ("Age of Extinction" was nonetheless the summer's second-biggest film.) "Planes: Fire & Rescue" dropped 38 percent, and "Think Like a Man Too" came in 31 percent lower. Sony's "Amazing Spider-Man 2" was down 25 percent.
What separated the few winners from the many losers? For the most part, the winners convinced ticket buyers that they were not just more of the same.
Mark Weinstock, the president for domestic marketing at 20th Century Fox, made "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" distinctive by using a bold advertising image of a machine-gun-wielding chimp on horseback. The movie, a sequel to the 2011 film "Rise of the Planet of the Apes," also received rave reviews and meaningfully advanced the franchise plot.
Fox also shepherded a seventh "X-Men" installment, "Days of Future Past," to blockbuster results; the studio offered something new by bringing back older cast members like Halle Berry and Patrick Stewart.
Mr. Contrino of BoxOffice.com, while no defender of retreads, said that a well-done sequel can still feel fresh. "More than anything, fans want something that feels unique and surprises them," he said.

Full text:   THE Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has doubled in value, and it only took 16 and a half years.
The index, which includes all the largest United States companies, climbed above 2,000 on Tuesday, 6,049 days after it first closed above 1,000 on Feb. 2, 1998. That is a compound annual return of 4.3 percent, which is a far cry from the 27 percent annual return when the index doubled from 500 to 1,000 in less than three years.
As the accompanying charts show, the ride up was anything but smooth. Along the way, there were two recessions, the last one called the Great Recession, each accompanied by a bear market that cut share prices in half. Since the market hit bottom in March 2009, the index has nearly tripled, rising at a rate of more than 15 percent a year.
Breaking that double into five segments -- three bull markets and two bear markets -- shows that there is truth to the biblical injunction that "the last shall be first, and the first last." The best stocks of the bull markets tended to be poor performers in the bear markets, while those that lagged on the way up recovered.
Technology and telecommunications issues soared until early 2000. But consumer staples -- the things that consumers will always buy, like soup and soap -- were deemed boring and lost about a quarter of their value from early 1998 through the peak on March 24, 2000.
Then the tech bubble burst, the economy went into recession and the stock market crumbled. Technology and telecommunications issues led the way down. But consumer staple stocks actually rose during the bear market that ended in autumn 2002.
It then took exactly seven years for stocks to rise to a new peak, this time led by energy stocks. In that move, health care and consumer staple stocks were the laggards. Those two sectors were then the best performers during the down phase, which ended on March 9, 2009. Financial stocks were by far the worst performers in that bear market. Since then, financials have been among the best performers among the 10 S.&P. sectors, although they remain far below their 2007 peaks.
The accompanying charts show the performance of each of the sectors, comparing them with that of the index as a whole. The star sector was energy, which rose nearly 300 percent over the period. Oil traded for about $17 a barrel when the S.&P. 500 first reached 1,000, and about $94 when the index hit 2,000. Telecommunications stocks are about 19 percent below where they were in 1998, and financial stocks are only 10 percent higher.
Many stock investors no doubt did better than the S.&P. 500 since 1998. The Russell 2,000, an index of companies whose market capitalization is just below the 1,000 largest, rose 171 percent. And the smaller stocks in the S.&P. 500 generally did better than the large ones. An investment divided equally among all 500 stocks would have gained 229 percent.
Of course, saying that the S.&P. 500 has doubled since 1998 can be misleading. That ignores dividends, which if reinvested would have produced a gain of 171 percent. But it also ignores inflation. Adjust for that and share prices are just 36 percent higher than in 1998. Adjust for both of them, and the gain is 85 percent.
While taking 16.6 years to double seems awfully slow, it took 17.4 years to go from the first close over 100, in 1968, to the first one over 200, in 1985. A significant bear market in the 1970s intervened. And it took more than 29 years to go from the first close over 25, in 1929, to the first one over 50, in 1958. That period included the Great Depression.
Chart A Double, in 16 Years: The Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index Topped 2,000 for the First Time On Tuesday, More Than 16 Years After It First Hit 1,000. The Charts Show the Rocky Road to That Level and Compare the Index's Performance with That of an Index of Smaller Stocks, the Russell 2,000. They Also Show How Well an Investor Would Have Done Owning an Equal Amount of Each of the 500 Stocks, Rather Than a Portfolio Weighted by the Market Value of Each Stock. They Show the Performance of the 10 Industry Segments That Make Up the Index. (Sources: Bloomberg; Standard & Poor's)

Full text:   PARIS -- Six years after being struck by economic crisis, Europe is facing a fresh downturn, with few new ideas on the table for reigniting growth and deepening political divisions over the austerity policies that many blame for worsening the malaise.
Even as the United States economy rebounds from its worst recession since the 1930s, Europe is heading in the opposite direction. A halting recovery that took hold in the 18-nation euro currency bloc in the last year has now gone into reverse as Germany, France and Italy, its three largest economies, stumble anew. Some analysts say the region could be headed for another full-scale recession -- a slowdown that could have ramifications in the United States, Europe's biggest trading partner. For American companies that do business in Europe, profits would suffer.
Germany, the Continent's economic engine, contracted in the second three months of the year, while the bloc of 18 European Union nations that use the euro failed to grow at all. Political and financial instability related to Russia's confrontation with Ukraine and the effects of escalating economic sanctions between Europe and Russia have further clouded the economic outlook.
Unemployment, which in the United States has fallen to 6.2 percent from a peak of 10 percent in 2009, has fallen only marginally in Europe, to 11.5 percent in July from a peak of 12 percent last year, according to figures released on Friday.
"Europe is at risk of secular stagnation," said Lawrence H. Summers, a former United States Treasury secretary and former economic adviser to President Obama, referring to a situation in which very sluggish economic growth becomes the new norm. Unless governments find a solution, he added, "there is little chance that reasonable and rapid growth is going to return to the eurozone."
The fresh downturn has worsened tensions between European leaders and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Ms. Merkel continues to stand by an austerity program that she considers essential to financial stability, but that many critics now say is only deepening Europe's woes and leaving it at risk of losing a generation of growth.
The situation has placed additional pressure on Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, to act more aggressively, much as the Federal Reserve has in the United States, to stimulate the economy through bond purchases. In a speech last week at a Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Draghi for the first time challenged the austerity consensus, suggesting that European governments might need to relax their budgets in the short run to give their economies a kick.
Action by the European Central Bank, which meets in Frankfurt next week, has become more urgent in the face of signs of another potential menace: deflation, a downward spiral in prices and wages that could further crimp Europe's recovery prospects. On Friday, Europe's statistical agency reported that inflation declined again in August to its lowest level since 2009.
"This is a major red light" for Europe, said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, a professor of economics at the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris. "We need to change the direction of policy to avoid a situation with potentially worrisome consequences for society and politics."
It is not clear that a shift in monetary policy alone can reinvigorate the European economies. President François Hollande of France, whose government has been in turmoil after a failed effort by a left-leaning minister to challenge Germany's economic prescriptions, on Thursday called for a "eurozone summit" to restore growth and investment in the euro area "as soon as possible."
A new approach is needed, Mr. Hollande told a conference of French ambassadors in Paris, because "the recovery is too weak, because inflation is too low, because the euro is too strong, and because Europe is menaced by long and possibly interminable stagnation if we don't act."
Mr. Hollande, a Socialist who as a candidate promised a new economic approach, has shown little willingness to break decisively with Germany over Ms. Merkel's insistence that keeping government debt under control is the precondition for long-term prosperity.
Still, France, Italy and a number of other countries are likely to press within the European Union in coming months for a loosening of deficit-reduction targets for the next several years.
The austerity program has helped Spain, Ireland and other troubled economies regain their ability to borrow money in the bond markets. But critics say that forcing countries to cut spending and raise taxes to meet fiscal targets while in recession also delayed and weakened the economic recovery, impeding job creation and income growth.
Ms. Merkel, while agreeing that growth is important, continues to rebuff calls for a change in German policy.
"We can talk about whether you make 2 or 3 percent more debt, or 1 percent, or, like us, a balanced budget," Ms. Merkel said this week. "But one really must question whether we can go on receiving less than we spend, so that our debts keep on growing. Indeed, a whole crisis of confidence has grown out of that."
Still, she hinted she could be more flexible if countries undertook reforms to revive competitiveness. Spain, which adopted more business-friendly labor laws and other structural changes to its economy, is one of the few eurozone countries to show signs of recovery. In a visit this week with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Ms. Merkel praised Spain as a model for how to rebound from the crisis.
Ms. Merkel has remained unmoved by her critics, even as Germany's economy has slowed and been challenged by new pressures like the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. To some degree, the slowdown in Germany is being driven by a lack of demand for its exports from neighbors like France and Italy, which, lacking the ability to use government spending to spur growth, have struggled to gain economic traction. Italy, the third-largest eurozone economy, has returned to recession and remains saddled with a debt equal to 136 percent of gross domestic product, the highest ratio in the eurozone after Greece. Analysts said a new crisis in Italy could reignite fears that the eurozone will come apart.
Germany is further vulnerable to the strife in Ukraine. Sales of machinery to Russia, the industry's fifth-largest export market, fell 19 percent in the first six months of the year. On Thursday, Ms. Merkel said the European Union would discuss tougher sanctions this weekend, hours after Kiev accused Moscow of a fresh incursion.
Germany is also grappling with its strained relationship with France, where Mr. Hollande is having trouble holding his party together as calls increase to challenge the supremacy of German economic policy leadership. While the two recessions that have hit France in the last five years have not been as deep as those in other countries, growth has failed to revive meaningfully.
Germans worry about the imbalance between the Continent's two essential powers, while French leaders feel belittled by Ms. Merkel, who "wants to give us lessons," said Jean-Christophe Cambadélis, a prominent French Socialist. "We are a great nation trying to pull ourselves together. We are not one of the German länder," he added, using the German word for its 16 states.
"Germany is a strong country, but it is too weak to lead the Continent alone," said Guntram Wolff, a German who runs the Bruegel organization in Brussels. While trade with France is important, their common projects -- monetary union, the European Union itself, centuries of shared history -- count for much more, he said.
A prolonged downturn in Europe, should it happen, could weigh on the American recovery and have far-reaching consequences for European society and politics at a time when far-right forces have emerged as challengers in France, the Netherlands, Greece and elsewhere, analysts said.
And as American imperatives point toward more multilateralism, Mr. Summers said, "a greatly diminished and stagnating Europe will mean that the United States will increasingly lack its best partners."

Spending Falters, but Consumer Confidence Reaches a 7-Year High

Full text:   Consumer spending fell in July for the first time in six months, but a measure of confidence among households hit a seven-year high in August, suggesting the retrenchment would be temporary.
A third report on Friday showed a sharp acceleration in factory activity in the Midwest this month, a further sign that the economy remains on solid ground.
"The weakness in spending will quickly subside this fall" as momentum builds from promising signs like the surging stock market, rising home prices and an improving job market, said Michael Woolfolk, global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States, dipped 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in June, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected a 0.2 percent gain. When adjusted for inflation, it fell 0.2 percent.
The weakness in spending prompted some economists to lower their forecasts for third-quarter economic growth. Goldman Sachs cut its projection by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.1 percent annual rate. Macroeconomic Advisers cut its forecast by a similar amount, taking it down to 2.9 percent.
But it also left inflation muted in July, giving the Federal Reserve room to keep interest rates near zero for some time.
Consumer prices edged up 0.1 percent, the smallest rise since February, the spending report showed. In the 12 months through July, it was up just 1.6 percent. Excluding food and energy, prices also rose 0.1 percent, with the 12-month reading holding at 1.5 percent. The Fed targets inflation of 2 percent.
Over all, many economists expect another relatively sturdy quarter given the rise in confidence, a strengthening labor market, and gains in manufacturing and business spending. Housing and government spending are also improving.
Two such examples came on Friday. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased to 82.5 in August, the highest level since July 2007, from 81.8 in July. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its barometer of Midwest factory activity shot up to 64.3 this month from 52.6 in July -- the biggest monthly point gain since July 1983.
"We expect growth to remain on a firmer trajectory as improving economic fundamentals continue to reassert themselves," said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
The sluggish consumer spending may also signal hidden momentum as many households opt to save extra money from steady income gains. Income rose for a seventh straight month in July, while savings hit their highest level since December 2012.
"Consumers could be positioned to trim savings and tap credit to fuel stronger spending, although it remains to be seen," said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich.

Abstract: Increased investment by businesses and a slightly improved trade picture prompted the revision, which lifted the estimated annual rate of growth in April, May and June to 4.2 percent, up from the government's initial reading of 4 percent in late July. Since the economy emerged from the recession five years ago, companies have been hesitant to spend heavily on new capacity, but these figures and other recent data indicate that is finally changing.

Full text:   The United States economy grew faster than first thought last quarter, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, the latest in a series of signals that point to a period of sustainable growth ahead.
Increased investment by businesses and a slightly improved trade picture prompted the revision, which lifted the estimated annual rate of growth in April, May and June to 4.2 percent, up from the government's initial reading of 4 percent in late July.
Since the economy emerged from the recession five years ago, companies have been hesitant to spend heavily on new capacity, but these figures and other recent data indicate that is finally changing.
"Not only was there an upward revision, but the composition points to solid growth in the second half of this year," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. "Businesses have bounced back after the bad winter disrupted production and demand."
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week by 1,000, to 298,000, helping push the eight-week average for new claims to below 300,000 for the first time since April 2006, well before the onset of the recession.
President Obama hailed the improving economic news, saying that "companies are investing, consumers are spending."
In brief remarks to reporters on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Obama noted that private businesses had created 10 million new jobs since the recession ended, and he said, "There are reasons to feel good about the direction that we are headed."
But he added that there was "more that we should be doing" to improve the economy further, and he promised to push Congress on those things when lawmakers return to Washington in September.
Despite the faster overall growth rate, businesses still seem to be benefiting more from the economy's upward trajectory than many individual consumers are.
The revision on Thursday, for example, lowered the estimate of workers' wage and salary growth slightly in the first half of 2014, with income rising 5.8 percent in the second quarter. Corporate profits, on the other hand, jumped 8 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said.
That split could change if unemployment continues to drop and the labor market tightens enough to give employees more bargaining power to demand higher pay. Although the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.2 percent from 8.2 percent two years ago, broader measures of joblessness remain much higher, meaning that for now, there is little incentive for employers to substantially raise wages to retain and attract workers.
Economists expect the unemployment rate to fall below 6 percent by the end of 2014, and Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, will be closely watching the data on employment, wages and inflation to determine when to start raising interest rates next year, said Doug Gordon, senior investment strategist for North America at Russell Investments in Seattle.
So far, inflationary pressures remain muted; Mr. Gordon and most other market observers do not expect the Fed to start increasing rates from their level, currently close to zero, until the middle of 2015.
The next major reading on the job market will come on Sept. 5, when the Labor Department reports on employment and job creation in August. Wall Street economists are predicting that employers added roughly 220,000 jobs this month, with the unemployment rate dropping 0.1 percentage point to 6.1 percent.
One conundrum, Mr. Gordon says, is that even as the economy builds momentum, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond has been falling, the opposite of what usually happens to bond yields when growth picks up.
In part, Mr. Gordon attributed this trend to increased demand for Treasury bonds as a safe harbor in the face of rising tensions in Ukraine and weak economic growth across Europe, where borrowing rates in countries like Germany and France are even lower than in the United States. In addition, he said, pension funds and institutional investors who have enjoyed big stock market gains in 2013 and 2014 may be buying Treasury securities to diversify their holdings.
In trading on Wall Street, stocks finished the day slightly lower. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 17,079.57, down about 42 points, or 0.25 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds fell to just above 2.3 percent, the lowest level this year.
Another clue as to how substantial the economic rebound will be for the rest of the year will come on Friday, when the Commerce Department reports data on personal income and spending for July. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported a strong reading for orders of durable goods in July.
Separately, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that its index of pending home sales rose 3.3 percent in June, a stronger gain than many economists had expected.
Thursday's report on gross domestic product was the second of three estimates issued by the Commerce Department. The final reading is due on Sept. 26.
Within the report, analysts were especially pleased that the upward revision was largely because of factors that signify healthy demand, rather than the piling up of inventories.
The estimate of final sales in the second quarter was revised upward, to 2.8 percent from an initial reading of 2.3 percent, while inventory gains were revised downward. In addition, orders for equipment by businesses rose at an annual rate of 10.7 percent in the quarter, well above the earlier 7 percent estimate.
In addition, exports in the period were revised slightly upward, while imports were revised modestly downward, which also boosted the overall growth rate.
"Investment spending by businesses tends to follow activity, so this is a sign that good demand in the second quarter will be followed by stronger business investment in the third and fourth quarters," said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- THERE are few truisms about the world economy, but for decades, one has been the role of the United States dollar as the world's reserve currency. It's a core principle of American economic policy. After all, who wouldn't want their currency to be the one that foreign banks and governments want to hold in reserve?
But new research reveals that what was once a privilege is now a burden, undermining job growth, pumping up budget and trade deficits and inflating financial bubbles. To get the American economy on track, the government needs to drop its commitment to maintaining the dollar's reserve-currency status.
The reasons are best articulated by Kenneth Austin, a Treasury Department economist, in the latest issue of The Journal of Post Keynesian Economics (needless to say, it's his opinion, not necessarily the department's). On the assumption that you don't have the journal on your coffee table, allow me to summarize.
It is widely recognized that various countries, including China, Singapore and South Korea, suppress the value of their currency relative to the dollar to boost their exports to the United States and reduce its exports to them. They buy lots of dollars, which increases the dollar's value relative to their own currencies, thus making their exports to us cheaper and our exports to them more expensive.
In 2013, America's trade deficit was about $475 billion. Its deficit with China alone was $318 billion.
Though Mr. Austin doesn't say it explicitly, his work shows that, far from being a victim of managed trade, the United States is a willing participant through its efforts to keep the dollar as the world's most prominent reserve currency.
When a country wants to boost its exports by making them cheaper using the aforementioned process, its central bank accumulates currency from countries that issue reserves. To support this process, these countries suppress their consumption and boost their national savings. Since global accounts must balance, when "currency accumulators" save more and consume less than they produce, other countries -- "currency issuers," like the United States -- must save less and consume more than they produce (i.e., run trade deficits).
This means that Americans alone do not determine their rates of savings and consumption. Think of an open, global economy as having one huge, aggregated amount of income that must all be consumed, saved or invested. That means individual countries must adjust to one another. If trade-surplus countries suppress their own consumption and use their excess savings to accumulate dollars, trade-deficit countries must absorb those excess savings to finance their excess consumption or investment.
Note that as long as the dollar is the reserve currency, America's trade deficit can worsen even when we're not directly in on the trade. Suppose South Korea runs a surplus with Brazil. By storing its surplus export revenues in Treasury bonds, South Korea nudges up the relative value of the dollar against our competitors' currencies, and our trade deficit increases, even though the original transaction had nothing to do with the United States.
This isn't just a matter of one academic writing one article. Mr. Austin's analysis builds off work by the economist Michael Pettis and, notably, by the former Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke.
A result of this dance, as seen throughout the tepid recovery from the Great Recession, is insufficient domestic demand in America's own labor market. Mr. Austin argues convincingly that the correct metric for estimating the cost in jobs is the dollar value of reserve sales to foreign buyers. By his estimation, that amounted to six million jobs in 2008, and these would tend to be the sort of high-wage manufacturing jobs that are most vulnerable to changes in exports.
Dethroning "king dollar" would be easier than people think. America could, for example, enforce rules to prevent other countries from accumulating too much of our currency. In fact, others do just that precisely to avoid exporting jobs. The most recent example is Japan's intervention to hold down the value of the yen when central banks in Asia and Latin America started buying Japanese debt.
Of course, if fewer people demanded dollars, interest rates -- i.e., what America would pay people to hold its debt -- might rise, especially if stronger domestic manufacturers demanded more investment. But there's no clear empirical, negative relationship between interest rates and trade deficits, and in the long run, as Mr. Pettis observes, "Countries with balanced trade or trade surpluses tend to enjoy lower interest rates on average than countries with large current account deficits, which are handicapped by slower growth and higher debt."
Others worry that higher import prices would increase inflation. But consider the results when we "pay" to keep price growth so low through artificially cheap exports and large trade deficits: weakened manufacturing, wage stagnation (even with low inflation) and deficits and bubbles to offset the imbalanced trade.
But while more balanced trade might raise prices, there's no reason it should persistently increase the inflation rate. We might settle into a norm of 2 to 3 percent inflation, versus the current 1 to 2 percent. But that's a price worth paying for more and higher-quality jobs, more stable recoveries and a revitalized manufacturing sector. The privilege of having the world's reserve currency is one America can no longer afford.

Full text:   Retail prices for many United States meats, already at record highs, continue to rise on a combination of drought and disease, but overall food cost increases remain near long-term averages, the Agriculture Department said on Monday. The agency now forecasts pork, beef and veal prices to rise by 6.5 to 7.5 percent in 2014, up from 5.5 to 6.5 percent forecast a month ago. The overall "meats, poultry and fish" category will rise by 4 to 5 percent. Overall food inflation -- items bought in grocery stores and in restaurants -- will be 2.5 to 3.5 percent in 2014, in line with historical norms. Since 1990, grocery store prices have risen by an average of 2.8 percent annually. The agency said that the lower prices outlook for commodities like corn and soybeans, as well as rising animal inventories, should provide relief.

Abstract: Today, we're not used to the idea of declining living standards, because growth throughout the 20th century was the global norm for economies that were not at war. International trade grew rapidly after World War II, but at least in the early postwar years most of that trade was among countries with roughly comparable technologies and real wages.

Full text:   Commentators have often compared the recent Great Recession of the United States and Europe to the Great Depression of the 1930s. In both cases, asset prices tumbled, financial systems turned insolvent and demand plummeted. One difference is that in the recent case, we mounted a swifter rescue effort than we did in the 1930s; for instance, Ben S. Bernanke, as chairman of the Federal Reserve in the recent crisis, drew upon his academic research in supporting bailouts and reflating the economy.
This comparison is intriguing, but we may be neglecting other, less obvious and yet more unsettling historical parallels for today's global economy. For all the talk of the Great Depression, we might look at a different exemplar for modern times, 18th- and 19th-century economic history India. That country's economic retrogression during that era may help us understand the quandary that some parts of the world face today.
In 1750, India accounted for one-quarter of the world's manufacturing output, but by 1900 that was down to 2 percent. The West became more productive as a result of the Industrial Revolution, and India lost much of its leading export sector, textiles. While the data is fragmentary, the best estimates show that India's living standards declined through the middle of the 19th century and that its economy retrogressed, even as it borrowed some technological improvements from the West. India just didn't do enough to move toward production on a larger scale or with better machines.
This story of India's loss to foreign competition is documented in "Deindustrialization in 18th and 19th Century India," a paper by David Clingingsmith, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University, and Jeffrey G. Williamson, an emeritus professor of economics at Harvard.
Economists are accustomed to emphasizing the benefits of international trade, and these arguments are largely correct. But in India, internal regulations and underdevelopment, combined with British colonial depredations, prevented Indian resources from being redeployed productively. The lesson is that a sufficiently large international trade shock can lead to decades of economic decline in a major economy, especially if that economy isn't geared to mounting a flexible response.
Today, we're not used to the idea of declining living standards, because growth throughout the 20th century was the global norm for economies that were not at war. International trade grew rapidly after World War II, but at least in the early postwar years most of that trade was among countries with roughly comparable technologies and real wages. And that trade spurred growth rather than damaging laggard economies.
In the last 20 years, the economic surge of Asia, especially China, has brought a large trade readjustment to the world, one with few parallels with the possible exception of the rise of the Western economies several centuries ago. China's per capita income, less than $300 in 1984, is now in the range of $10,000. The country is now the world's second-largest economy, and becoming the largest by one measure.
Who are some of the possible losers in this radical transformation in the global economy?
Italy, which is producing less today than it was in the middle of 2000, is undergoing a triple-dip recession. Croatia is in its sixth consecutive year of recession -- and joining the European Union didn't help it much. In France, the economy has slowed to a crawl, but because taxes there are already high, there isn't much room for further budget adjustment. French citizens expect a great deal from their government, and strikes are a common response to reduced wages or benefits.
These economies have a few features in common: They try very hard to preserve old jobs at high real wages, they are not very flexible at adjusting, and they have not engaged in a major economic restructuring. While China is not the main problem of these economies, Chinese export growth and wage competition may have been a kind of final straw that made old ways unsustainable.
If either France or Italy, much less both, is in for 15 or 20 years of economic stagnation, it's hard to see how the eurozone will avoid another major financial crisis. Portugal and Greece, both of which have been de-industrialized over the last few decades, are also possible candidates for continuing, rather than temporary, retrogression.
In Asia, the most likely future candidate for this problem is Taiwan, where real wages were largely stagnant from 2000 to 2011. In 2012, Taiwan's trend was even more disturbing: Its economy grew 1.3 percent, but real wages fell 1.6 percent, both adjusted for inflation. Taiwanese capital has flowed into China, creating a new class of Taiwanese millionaires but hollowing out the country's manufacturing base as capital was reallocated to the mainland.
What about the United States? The chance of an overall economic reversal here is very slim. The American economy is relatively flexible, and various candidates for future growth are strong: technology, health care research, energy and higher education. Despite its slow recovery, the United States probably still has the best fundamentals of any major economy.
That said, this same model of deindustrialization may apply to some parts of old industrial America and to some segments of the American middle class. The median individual income of Americans has not risen since 2000, and more recently median household income is still lower than it was when the economic recovery began in June 2009. Downward wage pressure has been strongest where there is competition from Chinese exports.
It was once an unthinkable question, but we've arrived at the scary point where it needs to be asked: What if American median income over the next 15 years keeps stagnating -- or maybe even falls?
Our Social Security system, whose receipts are based on wage taxation, could then prove to be a bigger fiscal problem than Medicare. Asset prices would most likely prove overvalued, possibly setting off another financial crash or at least damaging many Americans' retirements. And the rate of household formation would most likely remain slow, depressing the housing market for the foreseeable future.
India's economy started to reindustrialize in the late 19th century, but growth remained subpar until the 1990s -- a truly long recovery lag. This may sound strange to say, but when it comes to some parts of the Western world, the Great Depression may offer the cheerier analogy.

Abstract: Wage increases of that magnitude are not in the cards, and neither is any hint of worrisome inflation. Since the economic recovery began in mid-2009, hourly wages have risen by a mere 1.9 percent a year on average.

Full text:   A sharp debate within the Federal Reserve over when to raise interest rates was publicly aired last week at the annual central bankers' conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. On one side is a small yet vocal minority of Fed officials who want to head off inflation by raising rates sooner rather than later. On the other is a majority that thinks a near-term rate hike would stifle growth and, with it, any chance of restoring health to the labor market. That group includes Janet Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, and most members of the Fed's policy committee.
The economic evidence indisputably favors Ms. Yellen, who has indicated that rate increases should not begin until sometime next year, at the earliest. It will take until then to be able to say with confidence whether recent improvements in growth and hiring are sustainable. For now, the prospects for both are mixed at best, with the preponderance of evidence -- including the Fed's own analysis -- indicating that growth this year will average out around a still-sluggish 2.3 percent. That is too slow to reliably boost the number and quality of jobs and, as such, too slow to justify raising rates.
It is also unknown whether growth and hiring, if and when they fully recover, will spark inflation. For that to occur, wage increases would have to be substantial enough to push up prices, meaning annual raises in excess of 3.5 percent given present rates of inflation and productivity growth. Wage increases of that magnitude are not in the cards, and neither is any hint of worrisome inflation. Since the economic recovery began in mid-2009, hourly wages have risen by a mere 1.9 percent a year on average.
Against that backdrop, arguing in favor of a near-term rate increase is to argue for subpar wage growth and for continuing a status quo in which economic gains flow largely into profits rather than wages. Ms. Yellen and her supporters are right to rebut that stance in both word and deed.
The debate over interest rates does not stop there. Another argument in favor of near-term rate increases is that the Fed's prolonged low-rate policy is inflating asset bubbles that could burst with harmful consequences. Unlike the inflation argument, for which there is no evidence, concern about bubbles is justified.
The Fed's loose policies have pushed up stock, bond and real estate prices -- which is, in fact, the point of a low-rate policy. There is legitimate debate about how overvalued assets may be. But low rates, by fostering investments with borrowed money, invariably create the conditions for bubbles.
The answer, however, is not to raise rates, slowing the entire economy in order to tame the markets. The answer, laid out in recent remarks by Ms. Yellen and Stanley Fischer, the Fed vice chairman, is to use bank regulation and financial oversight to ensure that institutions and investors do not use low rates as a springboard for speculating.
That requires identifying and stopping reckless lending of the sort that has surfaced in subprime auto loans and unaffordable student loans. And it requires vigilance for signs of systemic risk in the complex activities that make institutions interdependent. Here the Fed is still too lax, as in its recent indulgence of too-big-too-fail banks that have failed to meet regulatory demands intended to reduce risks and prevent bailouts.
There is no guarantee that keeping rates low for a "considerable period," as the Fed leadership has pledged, will propel the economy forward. But it is all but certain the economy will backslide if rates are raised too soon. That's because the economy's critical underpinning -- good jobs at good pay -- has not yet been restored, and until it is, monetary support from the Fed and fiscal support from Congress are needed. Fiscal support has been withdrawn and reversed in recent years, a misguided move that has needlessly depressed growth and represents a failure of both policy and politics. Raising rates too soon would be a policy error on a par with that debacle, a mistake that the economy can ill afford.

Full text:   JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that the economy was improving but that the Fed was awaiting more evidence about the health of labor markets before deciding when to start raising interest rates.
Ms. Yellen's first keynote speech at the annual conference here in the shadow of the Grand Tetons was mostly an extended explanation of the reasons for the Fed's caution, and an effort to buy time for the Fed to deliberate. She emphasized her view that no single factor, including inflation, could be used to judge the recovery.
"While these assessments have always been imprecise and subject to revision, the task has become especially challenging in the aftermath of the Great Recession," she said, both because of the downturn's "nearly unprecedented" depth and because of simultaneous changes in the economy separate from the ups and downs of the business cycle, including the aging of the work force.
Ms. Yellen broke little new ground in her speech. She reiterated the Fed's basic guidance after its July meeting that holding short-term interest rates near zero remains necessary and useful to increase employment. She said the gap between current conditions and a return to full health was still "significant."
Acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding this assessment, Ms. Yellen added that the Fed was prepared to adjust its stance as the economic evidence became clearer, either moving more quickly to raise rates or holding steady for even longer. She said the Fed expected to end the expansion of its bond holdings in October.
Investors generally expect the Fed to start raising interest rates in the summer of 2015, or slightly later, based on asset prices tied to the level of future rates. John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a prominent centrist, told CNBC on Friday that was still a "reasonable guess."
Another centrist, Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in an interview on Friday that Ms. Yellen's speech "did not break a lot of new ground," because the Fed's trajectory depended on the economy. "I'm still someone who thinks midyear is the most likely timing," Mr. Lockhart said.
Some analysts, however, viewed Ms. Yellen's speech -- along with the minutes of the Fed's July meeting, released on Wednesday -- as evidence that the Fed had become a little more likely to raise rates earlier, if the economy kept gaining strength.
"We do not believe she has changed her core views," Michael Gapen, director of United States economic research at Barclays, wrote on Friday in a note to clients after Ms. Yellen's speech, "but see the change in tone as a normal evolution based on the fact that the Fed is closer to achieving its dual mandate than at any point in the recovery and has found itself at this stage faster than expected."
Ms. Yellen's audience on Friday included several internal critics of the stimulus campaign, including her host, Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which sponsors the annual conference, and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, who dissented at the last meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee. Both argue that the Fed has neared the limits of its ability to improve the health of the economy and that persisting in its efforts could loosen the central bank's control over price inflation.
Ms. Yellen's optimism that Fed policy can increase employment and wages is also challenged by a growing body of economic literature contending that the decline in the share of the working-age population in jobs stems largely from factors that predate the recession and cannot be addressed by continuing to hold down interest rates.
The economists Stephen J. Davis, of the University of Chicago, and John C. Haltiwanger, of the University of Maryland, argued in a paper presented on Friday at the conference that employment levels had declined because the labor market has stagnated in recent decades. Fewer people are leaving or losing jobs, and fewer are taking new ones.
"These results," they wrote, "suggest the U.S. economy faced serious impediments to high employment rates well before the Great Recession, and that sustained high employment is unlikely to return without restoring labor market fluidity."
Ms. Yellen noted their work in her speech as part of a broad survey of all the things the Fed does not know about the state of the economy. The most important uncertainty, she said, is "just how far the economy now stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal."
She said this unusually murky situation required the Fed to consider a broad range of economic indicators, and to make "difficult judgments" in the absence of clear knowledge. The remarks amounted to a rejection of legislation proposed by House Republicans to require the Fed to make policy according to a firm set of rules.
"Monetary policy ultimately must be conducted in a pragmatic manner that relies not on any particular indicator or model," Ms. Yellen said.
She also sought to play down the importance of inflation as an indicator. Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace sought by the Fed, but Ms. Yellen said this should not be seen as clear evidence that slack remains in labor markets. At the same time, she warned that a rising inflation rate, by itself, would not clearly indicate that the Fed had reached the limits of its stimulus campaign.
"Tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward 2 percent might, in this case, prevent labor markets from recovering fully," she said.
A small group of demonstrators made the trek to the remote resort hotel in the middle of Grand Teton National Park to urge Fed officials to continue the stimulus campaign. They formed a receiving line for policy makers in the lobby outside the conference, dressed in green T-shirts emblazoned: "What Recovery?"
"The Federal Reserve decides how many of us will remain unemployed and whether our wages will go up or stay low," said Reuben Eckels, the pastor of a church in Wichita, Kan. "They need to hear voices from everyday people."
The demonstration was organized by the Center for Popular Democracy, a nonprofit advocacy group that has generally focused its campaigns on microeconomic issues like the minimum wage and sick days. Ady Barkan, a lawyer with the group, said it had decided there was a need to focus on the big picture, too.
Mr. Barkan said Ms. Yellen briefly engaged with the demonstrators as she arrived at the conference on Thursday. "She said, 'We understand the issues you're talking about and we're doing everything we can,' " he said.
The demonstrators also spent two hours speaking with Ms. George on Thursday and said she told them the Fed needed to pull back soon.

Full text:   The death of Fernand St Germain last week, at the age of 86, got me thinking about the financial calamity that he was long associated with: the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s. There are things it could have -- and should have -- taught us as we spiraled toward the financial crisis less than two decades later.
"Freddie" St Germain was the sort of congressman you don't see much anymore: the lovable rogue, a backslapping, deal-making legislator who saw nothing particularly wrong with taking advantage of his position to feather his own nest. As The Times pointed out in its obituary, he liked to joke that he didn't put a period after "St" because he was hardly a saint. Entering Congress in 1961, when he was 32 years old, he steadily climbed the seniority ladder until he was the chairman of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs in 1981.
It was a terrible time for the nation's 4,600 or so S.&L.'s. Inflation was raging, and interest rates spiked as high as 21.5 percent. But the interest rate that S.&L.'s could offer their depositors was fixed at 5.25 percent, an amount established by government regulation. As consumers realized that the value of their deposits was being eroded by inflation, they began to move their money to a newfangled financial device being offered by mutual fund companies: the money market fund, which paid competitive rates of interest.
It was Congress's view -- and it was certainly St Germain's view -- that the S.&L. industry was vital to the American dream of homeownership. Indeed, back then, the only loans the industry was allowed to make were mortgages. Thus, in 1982, Congress passed the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act -- which St Germain wrote with Edwin "Jake" Garn, the Republican senator from Utah -- which essentially deregulated the industry, allowing S.&L.'s not only to pay market interest rates, but to make loans far afield from home mortgages.
The idea was that S.&L.'s needed to be able to make more profitable loans since they were going to be paying much higher interest rates to gain deposits. What nobody seemed to realize was that financial deregulation was bound to have unintended consequences. S.&L.'s went from being the most cautious of financial institutions to the most heedless. S.&L. operators dove into all kinds of exotic areas. By the late 1980s, it had all come a cropper; ultimately more than 1,000 S.&L.'s -- one out of every three still operating in 1988 -- went under. The industry's collapse cost the taxpayers nearly $125 billion.
In some ways, the legislators who deregulated the S.&L. industry felt that they had no choice -- if they didn't act, the S.&L.'s would have been in terrible trouble, just of a different kind. Seventeen years later, when Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act -- thus deregulating the entire financial services industry -- it didn't have that excuse. The drive to abolish Glass-Steagall was ideologically inspired, the core belief being that the market would keep the industry honest. But the S.&L. crisis had proved that wasn't true.
Rather, bankers were only too happy to privatize profits and socialize losses. During the S.&L. crisis, bankers fueled an unsustainable commercial real estate bubble, sold bonds to customers that turned out to be worthless, and, generally, used shoddy business practices to enrich themselves. In the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, bankers handed out mortgages to millions of people who lacked the ability to repay them, and then bundled those mortgages into toxic subprime mortgage bonds. It was just a variation on a theme.
There is another lesson from the S.&L. crisis. In its aftermath, there were somewhere around 1,100 prosecutions, the most famous of which was that of Charles Keating, the chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, an institution that cost the government $3.4 billion when it collapsed. A few years ago, I asked someone who had been involved in prosecuting S.&L. operators why the government had been so intent on putting them in prison. "Because the country demanded it," he said.
In the wake of the financial crisis, the Department of Justice also set up a task force to root out the wrongdoing that led to the financial crisis. But it has mostly been a joke. The prosecutions have been mostly small-time stuff: homeowners who lied on liar loans, for instance. Meanwhile, not one single employee of Countrywide Financial has been prosecuted, even though Countrywide loans were at the very heart of the financial crisis.
Earlier this week, Bank of America agreed to pay $16.65 billion to settle a handful of government investigations. Bank of America, of course, bought Countrywide in 2008, and the huge sum it was paying was the government's way of showing that it was tough on financial crime after all.
But it's not the same as prosecuting those responsible. After all, the country is still demanding it.

Abstract: Speaking before an annual gathering of central bankers and economists at a resort in the Rocky Mountains, Mr. Draghi said that the central bank was moving to increase its own stimulus campaign but that governments in the eurozone also needed to help bolster demand for goods and services. "Since 2010, the euro area has suffered from fiscal policy being less available and effective," he said.

Full text:   JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said Friday that European governments needed to move from a focus on austerity to a "more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies."
Mr. Draghi's comments were a change in tone for him, reflecting mounting concern that economic growth is sputtering in many European countries and that existing efforts have proved insufficient to spur faster growth.
Speaking before an annual gathering of central bankers and economists at a resort in the Rocky Mountains, Mr. Draghi said that the central bank was moving to increase its own stimulus campaign but that governments in the eurozone also needed to help bolster demand for goods and services.
"Since 2010, the euro area has suffered from fiscal policy being less available and effective," he said. "It would be helpful for the overall stance of policy if fiscal policy could play a greater role alongside monetary policy, and I believe there is scope for this."
Mr. Draghi's comments underscored a growing divide between the United States, where the economy appears to be gaining strength, and Europe, where an enduring malaise has kept unemployment painfully high while the rate of inflation, generally considered most beneficial when it is running around 2 percent annually, has nearly come to a halt.
The aggregate economy of the 18 euro area countries did not grow in the second quarter, according to an initial estimate published this week. The data provided ammunition for critics who say European countries have undermined growth by curtailing government spending.
The central bank moved in June to expand its own campaign to stimulate the economy, and Mr. Draghi emphasized that the effort would continue.
"Our preparations for outright purchases in ABS markets is fast moving forward," he said, referring to the bank's plans to begin a broad bond-purchase program, emulating the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.
He also noted that the euro's recent decline was likely to continue as the American economy gains strength, a development he characterized as favorable because it would help to increase exports.
Mr. Draghi suggested that European countries should consider public investments and tax cuts to complement the central bank's stimulus campaign. Countries like Germany, which are relatively healthy, have the most room to adopt such policies without breaking the rules of the euro area.
Mr. Draghi appeared to refer to the need for such countries to reconsider their commitment to austerity in calling for the euro area to move to "a more growth-friendly" fiscal stance. Some German officials, however, have already signaled a reluctance to move in this direction. They argue that the onus is on struggling European countries like Spain, Italy and Greece to make painful economic adjustments intended to increase long-term growth, like reducing legal protections for workers, cutting back on social welfare programs and reducing public spending.
Mr. Draghi was careful to say that those countries could not avoid such adjustments. The argument he made on Friday, however, was that such policies are by themselves insufficient.
"Without higher aggregate demand, we risk higher structural unemployment, and governments that introduce structural reforms could end up running just to stand still," he said. "Without determined structural reforms, aggregate demand measures will quickly run out of steam and may ultimately become less effective."

Full text:   AS the predominantly black, disproportionately poor community of Ferguson, Mo., erupted in protest after the shooting death of Michael Brown, critics excoriated President Obama for his failure to empathize. Michael Eric Dyson, for example, called the president's statement about the case on Monday a "stunning epic failure."
Mr. Obama's defenders point to his second-term commitment to issues that touch the lives of poor communities of color, especially his initiative to assist young minority men, My Brother's Keeper. But what both sides are ignoring is the president's first-term record.
A true measure of a president's priorities lies hidden in plain sight in his budget proposals. Under that standard, Mr. Obama has been more committed to communities like Ferguson than any Democratic president in the past half century.
By looking at what percentage of the budget presidents propose to spend to fight poverty, we can compare their degree of commitment.
While Mr. Obama advocated for the Affordable Care Act as a way to assist poor African-Americans, for example, we can't put that on an effort scale and compare it to President Bill Clinton's advocacy for his health care plan. Our method also avoids the problem of accounting for forces beyond presidents' control.
Using this method, we find that President Obama attempted to deliver far more than his counterparts. The Congressional Budget Office's inflation-adjusted numbers show that Mr. Obama sought to spend far more on means-tested anti-poverty programs than other first-term Democratic presidents. The targeted needs include food, housing, education, health care and cash.
Mr. Obama earmarked 17 percent of his budget for these needs, versus Mr. Clinton's 12 percent and Jimmy Carter's 8 percent. These presidents all faced economic challenges, although of different degrees and strength. Each was committed to the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged. But Mr. Obama made good on that commitment far more concretely.
No president gets all he requests, but the outcomes speak well for Mr. Obama, too. Christopher Wimer of Columbia University found, for example, that tax and transfer policies lowered the poverty rate by only 1 percentage point in 1967, under President Lyndon B. Johnson, but by almost 13 points in 2012.
Did Mr. Obama plan to spend more simply because he had more mouths to feed? No. Even after accounting for the higher numbers of poor people caught in the Great Recession, Mr. Obama's record outshines his predecessors'. His proposed first-term spending per poor individual was $13,731 to Mr. Clinton's $8,310 and Mr. Carter's $4,431, in 2014 dollars.
Mr. Obama even exceeds Mr. Johnson, whose budget priorities amounted only to $111 per poor person. (Because Mr. Johnson was the first postwar president to tackle poverty issues with so many new programs, it is not surprising that his proposed funding levels were low at the start.) The same pattern shows up in spending per poor family. Mr. Obama allocated $67,132, Mr. Clinton $39,820, Mr. Carter $20,790, and Mr. Johnson $546, again using 2014 dollars.
Nor is Mr. Obama simply a big spender across the board. His spending on the Department of Agriculture, for example, was lower than Mr. Clinton's and Mr. Carter's, removing food stamps and adjusting for inflation.
A final test of priorities is how much a president proposes to spend compared with his immediate predecessor. By that yardstick, Mr. Obama does well too. The percent change in anti-poverty spending per poor individual is highest for Mr. Clinton relative to the first President Bush (27 percent), and lowest for Mr. Carter, who actually spent slightly less than Gerald R. Ford. Mr. Obama's increase relative to George W. Bush was a respectable 17 percent. When it comes to the poor, Mr. Obama does not appear a failure, much less an epic one.
So why does Mr. Obama elicit fiery condemnation for lacking empathy? His first four State of the Union speeches provide several telltale clues. These are a president's showcase, watched, in recent years, by up to 52 million viewers. What did Mr. Obama signal to those millions?
First, he rarely mentioned poverty. Listeners had to hunt for words like "poor" or "homeless." His average poverty word count is seven, lower than Mr. Carter's nine and Mr. Clinton's 23. Second, the little he did say was drowned in a wave of words aimed at the middle class, like "average earner." His ratio of middle-class-related words to poverty-related words was nearly 3 to 1.
When he did mention the needs of the poor, he tiptoed around them. His ratio of direct mentions of poverty to indirect mentions was 1 to 3. Contrast that with Mr. Clinton's 8-to-1 ratio. Even Mr. Carter's was higher than Mr. Obama's (1 to 2). By favoring words like "vulnerable" and "unemployed" so heavily, Mr. Obama nearly gave up the bully pulpit.
While critics are right to chastise Mr. Obama for his pallid rhetoric on race, at least as president, they are wrong to say that he does not care about poor communities of color. Mr. Obama has been spending without saying. He should get at least as much credit for the former as vilification for the latter.

Full text:   For five years, the United States economy has been expanding at a steady clip, the stock market soaring, the headlines filled with talk of recovery. Yet public opinion polling shows most Americans still think the economy is pretty miserable.
What might account for the paradox? New data from a research firm offers a simple, frustrating answer: Middle-class American families' income is lower now, when adjusted for inflation, than when the recovery began half a decade ago.
Sentier Research, a firm led by former census officials, used census data to tabulate an estimate of the median household income -- how much is earned by families at the exact middle of the nation's income distribution. In June 2014, it found in a report issued Wednesday, the median household income was $53,891, down from $55,589 in inflation-adjusted dollars when the economic expansion began in June 2009.
The economic paradox isn't much of a paradox at all in this light: The purchasing power of the typical American family is 3.1 percent lower now than it was five years ago. No wonder people are unhappy about the economy! The benefits of rising levels of economic activity have simply not accrued to middle-income wage earners.
Other measures of Americans' income that rely on averages paint a sunnier picture. For example, inflation-adjusted per-person disposable personal income is up 4.2 percent from mid-2009 to mid-2014. But averages like that can be distorted by strong income gains among the wealthiest, so looking at the median income can give a better sense of economic conditions faced by the majority of Americans. And by that measure, the gloomy news actually goes back even beyond the disappointing recovery of the last five years.
Sentier's estimates of median household income, which are broadly consistent with the Census Bureau's annual estimates, remain lower than they were in January 2000, when the data series began. The middle-income American family is worse off, in other words, than it was 14 years ago.
One more negative twist: The researchers broke down the shift in median income by type of family. And the steepest declines, with median income off 10.4 percent in the last five years, is in families with three or more children. It is large families that are seeing incomes fall off most sharply.
But there is some good news, too. If you look not at the entire five years of the current expansion, but only the last three, there has been improvement. June 2014 household incomes were up 3.8 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from June 2011.
"The recovery has been very slow," said Gordon W. Green, an author of the report and a former census official. "Income didn't start to turn around until the summer of 2011. The problem is that income dropped so sharply during the first two years that even though we started to rebound in the summer of 2011, by the time we get to the present, we're still not where we were when the recovery started. But it is encouraging that income has turned around."
The Census Bureau's data on median income is more reliable than Sentier's estimates, but it comes out once a year and with long delays (the 2013 number isn't due until next month). The researchers behind the new numbers crunch data in the bureau's Current Population Survey to arrive at an estimate of median income that is available monthly and with a much shorter delay.
So for a sense of when incomes are starting to accelerate for ordinary Americans -- and thus when the official recovery feels like a broadly shared recovery -- keep an eye on their data.

Abstract: According to a recent report in The Times, there is dissent at the Fed: "An increasingly vocal minority of Federal Reserve officials want the central bank to retreat more quickly" from its easy-money policies, which they warn run the risk of causing inflation. Carving out an exception for monetary policy -- "Government is always the problem, not the solution, unless we're talking about the Fed cutting interest rates to fight unemployment" -- may just be too subtle a distinction to draw in an era when Republican politicians draw their economic ideas from Ayn Rand novels.

Full text:   According to a recent report in The Times, there is dissent at the Fed: "An increasingly vocal minority of Federal Reserve officials want the central bank to retreat more quickly" from its easy-money policies, which they warn run the risk of causing inflation. And this debate, we are told, is likely to dominate the big economic symposium currently underway in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
That may well be the case. But there's something you should know: That "vocal minority" has been warning about soaring inflation more or less nonstop for six years. And the persistence of that obsession seems, to me, to be a more interesting and important story than the fact that the usual suspects are saying the usual things.
Before I try to explain the inflation obsession, let's talk about how striking that obsession really is.
The Times article singles out for special mention Charles Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed, who is, indeed, warning about inflation risks. But you should know that he warned about the danger of rising inflation in 2008. He warned about it in 2009. He did the same in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. He was wrong each time, but, undaunted, he's now doing it again.
And this record isn't unusual. With very few exceptions, officials and economists who issued dire warnings about inflation years ago are still issuing more or less identical warnings today. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, is the only prominent counterexample I can think of.
Now, everyone who has been in the economics business any length of time, myself very much included, has made some incorrect predictions. If you haven't, you're playing it too safe. The inflation hawks, however, show no sign of learning from their mistakes. Where is the soul-searching, the attempt to understand how they could have been so wrong?
The point is that when you see people clinging to a view of the world in the teeth of the evidence, failing to reconsider their beliefs despite repeated prediction failures, you have to suspect that there are ulterior motives involved. So the interesting question is: What is it about crying "Inflation!" that makes it so appealing that people keep doing it despite having been wrong again and again?
Well, when economic myths persist, the explanation usually lies in politics -- and, in particular, in class interests. There is not a shred of evidence that cutting tax rates on the wealthy boosts the economy, but there's no mystery about why leading Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan keep claiming that lower taxes on the rich are the secret to growth. Claims that we face an imminent fiscal crisis, that America will turn into Greece any day now, similarly serve a useful purpose for those seeking to dismantle social programs.
At first sight, claims that easy money will cause disaster even in a depressed economy seem different, because the class interests are far less clear. Yes, low interest rates mean low long-term returns for bondholders (who are generally wealthy), but they also mean short-term capital gains for those same bondholders.
But while easy money may in principle have mixed effects on the fortunes (literally) of the wealthy, in practice demands for tighter money despite high unemployment always come from the right. Eight decades ago, Friedrich Hayek warned against any attempt to mitigate the Great Depression via "the creation of artificial demand"; three years ago, Mr. Ryan all but accused Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman at the time, of seeking to "debase" the dollar. Inflation obsession is as closely associated with conservative politics as demands for lower taxes on capital gains.
It's less clear why. But faith in the inability of government to do anything positive is a central tenet of the conservative creed. Carving out an exception for monetary policy -- "Government is always the problem, not the solution, unless we're talking about the Fed cutting interest rates to fight unemployment" -- may just be too subtle a distinction to draw in an era when Republican politicians draw their economic ideas from Ayn Rand novels.
Which brings me back to the Fed, and the question of when to end easy-money policies.
Even monetary doves like Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, generally acknowledge that there will come a time to take the pedal off the metal. And maybe that time isn't far off -- official unemployment has fallen sharply, although wages are still going nowhere and inflation is still subdued.
But the last people you want to ask about appropriate policy are people who have been warning about inflation year after year. Not only have they been consistently wrong, they've staked out a position that, whether they know it or not, is essentially political rather than based on analysis. They should be listened to politely -- good manners are always a virtue -- then ignored.

Abstract: Most officials, according to the minutes, take the view that the unemployment rate overstates progress in the labor markets, because an unusually large number of Americans have stopped looking for work but are likely to resume their searches as the economy improves.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- An increasingly vocal minority of Federal Reserve officials want the central bank to retreat more quickly from its stimulus campaign, arguing that the bank has largely exhausted its ability to improve economic conditions.
The debate, reflected in an account of the Fed's most recent policy-making meeting published on Wednesday, is likely to dominate the gathering of central bankers and economists at Jackson Hole, Wyo., Thursday through Saturday.
Fed officials are convinced that the economy is gaining strength after the years of false starts, but a majority of policy makers, led by the chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, favors a slow retreat from the Fed's efforts to encourage job creation. They note that millions of people still cannot find jobs, while inflation remains relatively weak.
At the July meeting, however, a number of officials described a growing risk that the Fed's control of inflation is being loosened by its focus on job creation. They note that the economy has improved more quickly than expected in recent months. The remaining damage caused by the Great Recession, in this view, can no longer be repaired by keeping interest rates low through the Fed's primary policy tool.
Officials, in other words, disagree about the proximity of the finish line.
"Participants generally agreed that both the recent improvement in labor market conditions and the cumulative progress over the past year had been greater than anticipated and that labor market conditions had moved noticeably closer to those viewed as normal in the longer run," according to the account, released after a standard three-week delay. "Participants differed, however, in their assessments of the remaining degree of labor market slack and how to measure it."
Some analysts saw evidence that the Fed's internal critics were exerting growing influence over the course of policy, suggesting that the Fed was becoming a little more likely to raise interest rates before the middle of 2015, now considered the most likely time for the Fed to begin raising rates from the near-zero level it has maintained since late 2008. "Some of the centrists appear to be acknowledging the rapid improvement in labor market conditions," wrote Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics.
Others said the debate was merely becoming more polarized, with the majority remaining firm in its views. "We continue to believe that the Fed will not move until at least mid-2015 despite some of the hawkish rhetoric which has recently grown louder," wrote Michael Dolega, senior economist at the TD Bank Group.
Investors, too, appeared to share the uncertainty about the meaning of the minutes. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose after the Fed released the minutes at 2 p.m., then disgorged some of those gains, but still closed up for the day at 2.43 percent. Stocks first fell, then rebounded to pass the earlier high. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended at 1,986.51, up 0.25 percent on the day.
Ms. Yellen is scheduled to speak Friday morning at Jackson Hole, and she is expected to discuss the state of labor markets. The annual conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, has sometimes served as a platform for Fed leaders to signal policy changes, but more often as a highly publicized chance to explain their views.
The conference, this year on the theme of "Re-evaluating Labor Market Dynamics," also is expected to offer an opening to Ms. Yellen's critics, both internal and external, to press their side of the case. The president of the Kansas City Fed, Esther George, is among the strongest advocates of a faster retreat by the Fed.
One potential motivation for an earlier retreat has lost some of its urgency. The account said officials did not see much evidence that markets were overheating.
"Participants noted evidence of valuation pressures in some particular asset markets, but those pressures did not appear to be widespread and other measures of vulnerability in the financial system were at low to moderate levels," it said.
But the unemployment rate has fallen more quickly than the Fed predicted at the beginning of the year. It stood at 6.2 percent in July. Price inflation has lately shown some signs of reviving, although it remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy.
Most officials, according to the minutes, take the view that the unemployment rate overstates progress in the labor markets, because an unusually large number of Americans have stopped looking for work but are likely to resume their searches as the economy improves. Ms. Yellen has frequently espoused this view.
Wage growth also remains slow. The Fed for the first time described the slow pace of wage gains as a threat to growth.
But the question, increasingly, is whether these problems can be solved, or significantly improved, by easy monetary policy.
The Fed's staff economists, who prepare a forecast for the policy makers, once again in July reduced their estimate of the maximum sustainable pace of growth and, in effect, their judgment of how many people were likely to return to work.
The account underscored that Ms. Yellen and her allies are not saying that the minority is wrong, but that the evidence is unclear. Policy, the Fed has said repeatedly, marches to the beat of the economic data. "Many participants noted that if convergence toward the committee's objectives occurred more quickly than expected, it might become appropriate to begin removing monetary policy accommodation sooner than they currently anticipated," the account said.
One committee member, Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, dissented at the July meeting, arguing that there was already reason enough for the Fed to change course. The minutes said officials also were "increasingly uncomfortable with the committee's forward guidance" that the Fed expects to maintain its key short-term rate at its low level for some time.

Full text:   The attention paid to income and wealth inequality spurred by the French economist Thomas Piketty's best-selling opus, "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," comes with a caveat from some of its fans: What about women?
The question may seem odd given that when it comes to wages, women have made far more progress than men over the past three decades. Since the 1980s, men without a college education have seen their real wages -- after taking inflation into account -- decline 5 to 25 percent. The lower the education level, the steeper the drop.
By contrast, for most women, real wages have been climbing. And while both male and female professionals have enjoyed larger paychecks, women's gains have far outpaced men's, rising more than 30 percent among the most educated.
It's at the lowest income levels that the burden on women stands out. Not only are they more likely than men to be in a minimum-wage job, but women are also much more likely to be raising a family on their own.
"Inequality is rising among women as well as men, but at the bottom, women are struggling with some dimensions of these problems that men aren't, which is raising and supporting these families as single heads of households," said Francine Blau, an economist at Cornell University.
So while the number of families living on less than $2 per person per day doubled between 1996 and 2011, according to the National Poverty Center, it tripled among families headed by a lone woman.
Wages are only one part of the problem, said Arlie Russell Hochschild, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, whose 1989 book, "The Second Shift," described how fathers rarely chipped in with housework and child care even when their wives were working full-time. She notes that as men's economic opportunities decline, so do their marriage prospects. The increase in poor single mothers means that many of the lowest-wage workers are not getting any help in the second shift.
"One thing that strikes me is how the whole discussion of the class gap and its effect on women has been dissociated from a discussion from public policy," Ms. Hochschild said. Minimum-wage jobs rarely have the kind of child care and family leave benefits that help low-income mothers manage both shifts.
In a speech on the impact of inequality on families scheduled for Monday afternoon at the American Sociological Association's annual convention in San Francisco, Ms. Hochschild plans to focus on how free-market policies are undermining the family.
"If the trickle-down theory were correct, the richest countries would have the highest proportion of thriving children," Ms. Hochschild argues. But they don't.
A 2010 Unicef report that measured the health, education and material well-being of a nation's poorest children against its median children found that the United States ranked 23rd out of 24 nations. The only country that scored lower was Slovakia.

Abstract: In 1930, just after the 1929 crash, Prof. Irving Fisher of Yale published "The Stock Market Crash -- and After." Back in 1979, Franco Modigliani of M.I.T. and Richard A. Cohn of the University of Hartford argued that investors were then undervaluing the stock market, because they failed to perceive that despite high inflation, real interest rates were relatively modest.

Full text:   The United States stock market looks very expensive right now. The CAPE ratio, a stock-price measure I helped develop -- is hovering at a worrisome level.
I wrote with some concern about the high ratio in this space a little over a year ago, when it stood at around 23, far above its 20th-century average of 15.21. (CAPE stands for cyclically adjusted price-earnings.) Now it is above 25, a level that has been surpassed since 1881 in only three previous periods: the years clustered around 1929, 1999 and 2007. Major market drops followed those peaks.
The CAPE was never intended to indicate exactly when to buy and to sell. The market could remain at these valuations for years. But we should recognize that we are in an unusual period, and that it's time to ask some serious questions about it.
My colleague John Y. Campbell, now at Harvard, and I created the ratio more than 25 years ago. It works like this: Using inflation-adjusted figures, we divide stock prices by corporate earnings averaged over the preceding 10 years. Our ratio differs from a conventional price-to-earnings ratio in that it uses 10 years, rather than one year, in the denominator. It does so to help minimize effects of business-cycle fluctuations, and it's helpful in comparing valuations over long horizons.
In the last century, the CAPE has fluctuated greatly, yet it has consistently reverted to its historical mean -- sometimes taking a while to do so. Periods of high valuation have tended to be followed eventually by stock-price declines.
Still, the ratio has been a very imprecise timing indicator: It's been relatively high -- above 20 -- for almost all the last 20 years, with the exception of 20 months, mostly in the recession of 2007-9, when prices tumbled and it fell as low as 13.32.
In other words, the ratio is saying the stock market has been relatively expensive for years. And that raises a question: Are there legitimate factors behind high stock prices that might keep them elevated for decades more?
Such a question has been addressed before. In 1930, just after the 1929 crash, Prof. Irving Fisher of Yale published "The Stock Market Crash -- and After." The book explained why there were "sound reasons" for the high valuations of 1929. He couldn't have been more wrong.
To understand valuations, I have conducted questionnaire surveys of individual and institutional investors since 1989, recently under the auspices of the Yale School of Management. One question, asking if stocks are overvalued, undervalued or valued about right, is used to create a valuation confidence index. When the CAPE ratio reached its record high of 44 in 2000, the confidence index hit a record low.
But as the market fell from its 2000 peak, the confidence index rose to high levels again, where it remained until recently. This year, the index took a dive for individual investors, and now is at the lowest level since 2000. The confidence of professional investors has fallen, too, but not as sharply. In short, people are beginning to worry.
Yet valuations remain high, and it would be comforting if they made sense. So I've been trying to come up with a theory to explain today's elevated stock prices -- and maybe convince myself that they could remain lofty for some time. One factor to consider is that bond prices are high, too.
Inflation is running at only around 2 percent, and 10-year Treasury notes yield less than 2.5 percent, a very low level. Bond prices move in the opposite direction as interest rates, and high bond prices may account for the high valuations in stocks.
The inverse was certainly true in the late 1970s and early '80s, when inflation and Treasury yields were in the double digits. Back in 1979, Franco Modigliani of M.I.T. and Richard A. Cohn of the University of Hartford argued that investors were then undervaluing the stock market, because they failed to perceive that despite high inflation, real interest rates were relatively modest. The two men rightly predicted that there would be a stock market boom if inflation fell significantly -- as we now know it began to do within a year after they made their case.
It's possible that bond prices account for today's stock market valuations. But that raises another question: Why are bond prices so high? There are short-term explanations: the role of central banks, for example. But is there a compelling reason for prices of stocks and bonds (and maybe houses, too) to remain high indefinitely?
I've looked for untraditional answers. Perhaps today's prices have something to do with anxiety about the future. I suspect that after the financial crisis, working people are much more worried about their future pay. Many are concerned that they might lose their jobs to cost-cutting, or that they might eventually be replaced by a computer or robot or website. Such anxiety might push them to try to make up for these potential shortfalls by investing in stocks and bonds -- even if they worry that these assets are overvalued.
Extrapolating from a theory of Robert E. Lucas Jr. of the University of Chicago, one might well expect lofty stock prices amid such worries: When there aren't enough good investing opportunities, people wishing to save more for the future may succeed only in bidding up existing assets even if they think they're overpriced. Call it the "life preserver on the Titanic" theory.
This explanation, though, is probably not the whole story. The problem, as shown in my work with Sanford Grossman, founder of QFS Asset Management, and in work by Lars Peter Hansen of the University of Chicago and Kenneth Singleton of Stanford, is that the market just moves up and down more than Professor Lucas's theory would suggest.
So nothing I've come up with is a slam-dunk explanation for the continuing high level of valuations. I suspect that the real answers lie largely in the realm of sociology and social psychology -- in phenomena like irrational exuberance, which, eventually, has always faded before. If the mood changes again, stock market investments may disappoint us.

Full text:   WE like to remember a child's summer as a season of no responsibility, unfettered by parental supervision, a time to indulge and explore. And we like to complain that summer has changed; that children have more responsibility, less freedom, fewer indulgences.
But has it really? The staff members of The Upshot spent several fine summer days at their desks searching for data. Some things, like the number of children who spend an entire day alone wandering a city or hunting for crayfish in a creek, are unmeasurable. But there is clearly evidence that summer is different. Maybe not worse or better, just different.
Programmed Camps
It's a common lament that children today are missing out on the aimless summer days their parents enjoyed, getting lost in the woods and daydreaming under sunny skies. That sense of loss is grounded in reality. Data on how children spend their time out of school shows that organized activities have increasingly replaced free play.
Summer days are now likely to be spent in day camp. The number of day camps has increased 40 percent in the last five years, according to the American Camp Association, with the biggest enrollment increases among children 9 and younger. Their popularity has grown because more families have two working parents, said Tracy Holman, a spokeswoman for the association.
Day camp itself is also more structured. It no longer means hiking and making friendship bracelets. Now parents choose from dozens of specialty camps, emphasizing things like leadership, archaeology, fashion, crime-scene investigation and computer programming.
Sleep-away camps also accommodate more children than ever before. Stays are shorter, but according to the camp association, there are around 7,000 overnight camps in the United States today. That is an increase of 17 percent in the past four years. -- CLAIRE CAIN MILLER AND ANNA BAHR
The Not-So-Great Outdoors
Children are spending more time in structured activities like sports, art and running errands with parents and less time in unstructured play and passive leisure, according to a 2000 University of Michigan study. Another study from the university in 2004 showed an increase in media consumption and a decrease of 69 percent in time spent in outdoor activities and games on days off from school.
Both studies were done before smartphones and tablets became ubiquitous -- experts say children now spend even less time exploring the outdoors because they are glued to screens. According to another study, by the Kaiser Family Foundation, by 2010, kids were spending nearly eight hours a day watching videos, playing games and listening to music. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued an alert about the rise in structured activities and the importance of unstructured play.
Yet even before the harried modern age, children's summer days were not always carefree, according to research on work and leisure by the economists Valerie A. Ramey and Neville Francis. In 1910, for instance, a quarter of boys age 10 to 15 were employed. -- CLAIRE CAIN MILLER
The Endless Road
The heyday of the family road trip was in the 1950s and 1960s, as the expanding Interstate System of highways offered quicker passage across the country. With some exceptions (driving rates plummeted during the oil crisis of 1973, for example), long summer car trips remain a rite of passage in the United States. "Driving to see national parks and monuments is almost a patriotic ritual," said Susan Sessions Rugh, author of "Are We There Yet? The Golden Age of American Family Vacations."
AAA estimates that during the 2014 Independence Day weekend more than 80 percent of the 41 million American travelers would choose to drive, not fly, for an average of 723 miles (about the distance from Chicago to Cleveland and back). That means 34.8 million people were still hitting the road squabbling and singing along with the tunes on the smartphone.
Wasn't it so much cheaper back then? Lodging and meal costs for a family of four on the road averaged $13 per day in 1950 (around $128 in today's dollars). That year, driving a car cost 9 cents a mile, on average. Adjusted for inflation, that's around 89 cents a mile now. So today, it is far cheaper, at about 59.2 cents a mile for the typical family sedan. Unless a family is biking to its destination, the car is still the cheapest way for a group to travel. Safety features like seatbelts and air bags, as well as air-conditioning and video screens for the passengers in the dreaded back seat, have made it easier to keep the peace between restless children. -- ANNA BAHR
Brr!
Summer is supposed to be hot. This summer feels as if it has been cooler, even cold at times. Actually, it hasn't been that cold.
For New York City, 2014 is the 79th-warmest summer in 138 years -- more like a Goldilocks summer: Not too hot, not too cold. The summers of 2000 and 2009 were colder. The average July temperature was 76.1 degrees; the coldest July was in 1888 at 71.1 degrees.
Chicago set no record either: It had its 13th coolest July, averaging 70.4 degrees. Its coldest July was in 1891, with an average temperature of 66.9 degrees. Atlanta had its coolest July in 1967, with an average of 74.1 degrees. This year, July was nearly four degrees hotter, according to the National Weather Service Forecast Office.
One region of the country did get hot: the drought-stricken West. This July was San Francisco's hottest on record, as average temperatures reached 66.9 degrees. -- ANNA BAHR
Scream Less for Ice Cream
Our diet-consciousness is melting that most basic summer treat: ice cream.
According to the United States Agriculture Department, the country produced about 12.9 pounds of ice cream per person in 2012, down from a peak of 22.7 pounds in 1946 -- a time when home freezers started to become commonplace.
Sure, ice cream remains enormously popular. According to the consumer-tracking firm NPD Group, around 40 percent of people have eaten ice cream in the most recent two-week period. (Compare that with coffee, at about 48 percent.) Even though most snacks are doing well, desserts as a group are on the decline.
When we're eating ice cream, we're becoming lazier about how we eat it. The percentage of people scooping ice cream from a carton has declined to 36 percent from nearly 50 percent in the mid-1980s, while we're increasingly partial to packaged ice cream novelties that don't require using -- or washing -- a spoon or a bowl.
Here's one thing that hasn't changed: Despite an explosion in weird and wacky flavors, vanilla still reigns supreme as our country's go-to flavor. "In the battle between chocolate and vanilla, chocolate always wins," said Harry Balzer, the chief food industry analyst at NPD. "Except in ice cream." -- MARGOT SANGER-KATZ
Hot Mugging Weather
Despite the tight leashes children are kept on these days, in some cases from fear of danger, America is statistically far safer. Over the last 20 years, the rate of violent crime in the United States has fallen by 18.7 percent. But an established body of research shows that summer is when we're more likely to become victims of crime.
Over all, crime in the United States has been declining for decades. But persisting throughout that trend is another one: Nearly all categories of serious crime remain seasonal, with rates significantly higher during the summer than in other seasons. The trend holds for burglary, rape and assault, according to a recent analysis from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. Other studies show similar patterns for homicide.
The seasonal pattern appears to go back centuries, and has been observed in other countries.
There are basically two theories to explain the pattern. One is psychological -- postulating that people grow more aggressive when it's hotter out, driving a surge in summertime violence. The other has to do with opportunity: With more people out and about in warm weather, potential crime victims are more plentiful. -- MARGOT SANGER-KATZ
What About Adults?
For a while, peaking in the late 1990s, companies got in the summer spirit by offering benefits like Fridays off and casual dress codes. But sometime around the financial crisis, those perks began to fade.
Rupert Murdoch's 2010 admonition in a memo to News Corporation employees (sent on a Friday) captured the changing spirit: "It may be summer, but work on Friday is just as important as it is in other seasons." It's part of a trend toward less flexible work arrangements. This year, 29 percent of companies offer the opportunity to work four days a week in exchange for working longer hours on those days, down from 34 percent in 2010, according to the Society for Human Resource Management's 2014 employee benefits report. Nineteen percent allow employees to dress casually in the summer, down from 23 percent.
Even on days off, many employees are dragged in to work anyway. Only a quarter take their full annual vacation time, according to Glassdoor, a jobs site where employees review their employers, and almost two-thirds say they do some work on vacation. So much for summer break. -- CLAIRE CAIN MILLER
