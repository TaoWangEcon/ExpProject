Full text: If the European monetary union is something like a bad marriage, what can be done to avoid a messy and disastrous divorce?
Broadly speaking, there are now two prescriptions. One calls for sacrifices and compromises from all sides. The other, echoing the law that used to exist in many societies, is simple: the husband -- Germany -- should rule. Did not the wife promise to obey? It is too late to try to get out of that agreement.
At the heart of the euro system problem now is that most of the rest of the countries are no longer competitive with Germany. They are running large current-account deficits, and the existence of the euro means they cannot devalue their currencies to make their exports cheaper and their companies more competitive.
With no currency adjustment possible, a German central banker, Andreas Dombret, explained this week in a speech in Berlin, "other things must therefore give instead: prices, wages, employment and output."
The question now, said Dr. Dombret, a member of the executive board of the Bundesbank, "is which countries have to shoulder the adjustment burden."
Dr. Dombret's answer is blunt: Not Germany.
"The deficit countries must adjust," he said. "They must address their structural problems, reduce domestic demand, become more competitive and increase their exports."
Suggestions that "surplus countries should shoulder at least part of the burden," he said, simply miss the point. No one can expect Germany to do anything that might affect its competitive position relative to the United States or China, as could happen if German inflation were allowed to rise.
Until now, Germany has seemed to more or less get its way, albeit at the cost of having to put up money to avert disaster. The other Golden Rule -- he who has the gold rules -- has applied. Faced with German anger, and pressure from financial markets, both Greece and Italy jettisoned elected governments in favor of governments that would be run by "technocrats" who would do the right thing, as seen from Berlin. "Merkozy," the combination of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, dominated European summit meetings.
But now the European political winds seem to be moving against Germany. The Dutch government, which had been Germany's staunchest ally in demanding more and more austerity from the so-called peripheral countries, found it could not get that prescription through its own Parliament. Elections are expected later this year.
More ominously from a German point of view, Mr. Sarkozy's own future seems to be tenuous. On Sunday, he finished second in his bid for a second term, behind Francois Hollande, the Socialist candidate who has been calling for less austerity and more efforts to stimulate economic growth. The runoff vote will be held May 6.
Given the fact that France has its own problems, Ms. Merkel might be tempted to go it alone in ruling Europe. But as one German official told me a few months ago, France is an essential partner because of Germany's "special history." German domination of Europe has an unfortunate precedent.
The day after the French voted, I listened to Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank and formerly a top adviser to Ms. Merkel, speak to the Economic Club of New York and throw down the gauntlet.
Departing from his prepared text, he warned that agreements previously made must be respected, adding that the necessary fiscal union meant that some "national sovereignty" would have to be sacrificed. Mr. Hollande talks about amending Europe's fiscal treaty mandating austerity; Dr. Weidmann views it as sacred.
The European Central Bank's sole mandate under the law is to preserve price stability for the euro area as a whole, defined as keeping inflation under 2 percent. At the moment, with Germany doing well and much of Europe in or entering recession -- and Spain being closer to a depression -- there is no such thing as the euro area as a whole in any reasonable sense. But a central bank trying to live up to its mandate might focus on rampant deflation in countries being forced to slash wages and spending and decide that a little inflation elsewhere -- such as in Germany -- makes perfect sense.
The Germans are having none of that. "Let us say that monetary policy becomes too expansionary for Germany," Dr. Weidmann told the Economic Club, making it clear that it is not German national sovereignty that needs to be sacrificed. "If this happens," he said, "Germany has to deal with this using other, national instruments." He did not specify what those instruments would be.
The idea that Germany knows best -- that what is best for it is best for the euro zone as a whole -- is growing less and less popular in the rest of Europe. In northern Italy, some companies are muttering about a German conspiracy to devastate the Italian economy, to enhance the prospects for German companies.
It may be significant that in the first round of the French election, extremist parties of the right and left garnered more than 30 percent of the votes, up from about 18 percent five years ago. The biggest surprise was the strength of the anti-immigrant National Front Party, which received nearly 18 percent of the votes. Both Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande wasted no time in trying to appeal to those voters. In the Netherlands, it was the defection of a right-wing, anti-immigrant party that led to the government's collapse.
Anger is on the rise in many countries. That worries a lot of people, and politicians in many countries are now talking about the need to pursue policies that will bring growth soon, rather than in some distant future.
But there is little evidence that the Germans are concerned. In his speech to the Economic Club, Dr. Weidmann conceded that the German prescription of austerity for all "might, under normal circumstances, dampen aggregate demand and economic growth." But, he added, these are not normal times.
"A widespread lack of trust in public finances weighs heavily on growth," he said. "There is uncertainty regarding potential future tax increases, while funding costs are rising for private and public creditors alike." In those circumstances, continued austerity "might inspire confidence and actually help the economy to grow." Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover's Treasury secretary, could not have said it better.
Germany has been by far the biggest beneficiary of the euro. Its manufacturers have prospered in no small part because the lack of competitiveness of other euro area countries has held down the value of the currency.
Were the currency to collapse, Germany would suffer greatly. A new Deutsche mark would no doubt rise rapidly against other currencies, making Germany's goods more expensive and in that way damaging the country's competitiveness.
I asked one German I know how Ms. Merkel would cope without Mr. Sarkozy at her side. He professed unconcern. A President Hollande, he said, would no doubt come around once he was in office.
The fact that there is no easy way to break up the euro zone -- and that no one can be sure just how painful it would be -- is the best reason to think that, somehow, the euro will endure in all the countries that now use it. Germany's rigid belief that others must suffer to preserve the system may yet make some other country decide to take the risk of ending what has become a very bad marriage.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Wednesday dismissed proposals to escalate the Fed's economic stimulus campaign as "reckless," arguing that the costs would be high and the benefits uncertain.
Mr. Bernanke spoke after the Fed's policy-making committee ended a two-day meeting with a statement affirming its intention to continue until late 2014, and possibly longer, policies that aim to increase spending by holding down interest rates, rewarding borrowers and punishing savers.
The committee again demurred, however, from expanding those efforts, despite its prediction that millions of Americans would not find jobs for years to come.
The Fed also released a set of economic forecasts by 17 senior officials, only some of whom vote on monetary policy, showing that their expectations for domestic economic growth for this year have increased modestly since January. These documents showed that a majority of the 10 officials who vote on policy now foresaw the Fed raising interest rates by the end of 2014.
Taken together, the documents suggested that Mr. Bernanke, who effectively has control over monetary policy, may be facing increased pressure from Fed officials concerned that the central bank has promised too much, even as he confronts mounting external criticism from those who say he is not doing enough.
The central bank has held short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and it has sought to further reduce long-term rates through the purchase of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds. Nine of the 10 members of the committee supported the public declaration that the Fed planned to continue these policies at least through late 2014. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, dissented, saying rates would need to rise sooner.
"The committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually," the statement said. It said that unemployment would "decline gradually" and that inflation remained under control despite the impact of the recent rise in oil prices, which it regarded as temporary.
At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Bernanke offered his most complete public explanation to date for the calibration of the Fed's policies.
The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing unemployment and maintaining stable prices. The Fed predicts that unemployment will remain high for years to come, and it predicts that inflation will remain under control. Under those circumstances, he was asked, why not take stronger action to reduce unemployment?
Mr. Bernanke said that he was concerned about the high level of unemployment but that the Fed's ability to encourage job creation was constrained by its responsibility to keep inflation low and stable.
Lowering the cost of borrowing to spur job creation tends to increase inflation. The current pace is already close to the 2 percent level the Fed considers ideal for long-term economic growth.
Mr. Bernanke said it would be irresponsible for the Fed to pursue a temporary increase in the rate of inflation because it would surrender the credibility of its longstanding commitment to keep inflation around 2 percent. Moreover, he said, the impact on job growth would be "quite tentative and perhaps doubtful."
"The question is, 'Does it make sense to actively seek a higher inflation rate in order to achieve a slightly increased pace of reduction in the unemployment rate?' " he asked. "The view of the committee is that that would be very reckless."
The Fed also could expand its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which it views as a way to reduce borrowing costs without the same risk of increased inflation. Mr. Bernanke said this remained under discussion, but he added that he regarded the current level of Fed policy as an appropriate response to existing and projected economic conditions.
The Federal Open Market Committee "does not appear inclined to take any further aggressive steps, as the labor market recovery has picked up since the fall of 2011," Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC, wrote in an e-mail on Wednesday.
The statement, released at 12:30, and the economic projections, released at 2 p.m., are not completely consistent, reflecting their different origins. The statement, which declared the Fed's commitment to its current policies, is strongly shaped by Mr. Bernanke, who effectively controls the 10-member policy panel.
The projections, which reflected a somewhat more cautious view of current policy, are compiled from the projections of a broader group of 17 officials, including the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks, only five of whom vote each year.
Mr. Bernanke suggested in his news conference that investors and other observers should pay more attention to the statement. He described the projections as the raw material from which the committee's view emerges.
Analysts, however, said the views of the broader group should be viewed as a leading indicator of the direction of policy, suggesting that the Fed had become slightly less likely to maintain current policy through 2014.
The broader group of officials predicted that the economy would grow 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent this year, an increase from their January forecast of growth of 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent. They predicted that the economy would expand 2.7 percent to 3.1 percent in 2013, and 3.1 percent to 3.6 percent in 2014.
There was little change in their views about the long-term path of unemployment, which they predicted would fall no lower than 6.7 percent by the end of 2014.
The Fed also made no policy changes at its last meeting, in March. There are indications that this relative stability will persist for some time.
The Fed's plans are always contingent on economic conditions. In normal times, relatively small changes in the health of the economy produce small changes in monetary policy. But that calculus is different now because, with interest rates near zero, the only options available are big steps. Any new effort at stimulus must be enormous to produce even a small economic boost. And any reduction in existing efforts, however small, would carry the outsize significance of a change in direction. As a result, no change in policy is likely until conditions change significantly.
"If there's a substantial change in the economic outlook in either direction, then there would be a change in the outlook," Mr. Bernanke said. "But for now I think the committee is comfortable."

China Slows Down, and Grows Up

Abstract: [...]China has reached a stage at which all "miracle economies" have slowed significantly, but not disastrously.

Full text: MORE than half of Americans think China is already the world's leading economy -- an astonishing misperception, given that China's gross domestic product is still less than half of America's. As George Orwell once observed, "Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible." China has grown at a breakneck pace for so long that its aura of invincibility has grown to outsize proportions in the Western imagination.
Now, however, there are signs that China's growth is slowing to a rate that is ideal for the interests of the United States: fast enough to remain an important pillar of global economic growth, but not fast enough for China to remain a disruptive threat to American power.
The news of a slowdown in China, which just posted its worst quarter since 2009, has reignited the debate over its future. The consensus remains bullish, and is captured in the latest forecast by the International Monetary Fund, which expects China's G.D.P. to continue growing at an annual rate of around 8 percent for five more years. A bearish minority, however, reads the warning signs -- labor unrest, a housing bubble, an unprecedented investment binge -- as a sign of impending collapse. Neither side has got it right. In fact, China has reached a stage at which all "miracle economies" have slowed significantly, but not disastrously.
It is well known that developing nations hit a "middle-income trap," and stop catching up to rich nations, when per-capita income reaches about $5,000 to $15,000 (in current dollars). The examples (Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia) are numerous. What is less known is that even those rare economies that broke through the middle-class trap started to decelerate -- still catching up, but more slowly -- after reaching a per capita income of around $5,000 (in current dollars). Japan in the 1970s, Taiwan in the 1980s and South Korea in the 1990s all slowed from a growth rate of about 9 percent to around 5 percent, simply because the bigger the economy, the harder it becomes to grow fast.
China passed the $5,000 per capita income level last year, and is now showing the same signs of deceleration that Japan, Taiwan and South Korea exhibited at that level: rising labor demands for higher wages and a decreasing demand for new investments. China's growth model is similar to Japan's in the 1970s, and the most likely scenario is that China will follow the path of Japan in that decade, when its growth rate slowed to 5 percent. China will continue to catch up to the United States, but its growth will slow to a pace of around 6 to 7 percent over the next 5 to 10 years. At that point, China's economy will be even larger, and may decelerate again.
This process is under way, and it signals a basic power shift in the global economy. China became the biggest contributor to global G.D.P. growth in 2007, and it has held the lead ever since. But if the United States continues to grow at its current pace of about 2.5 percent, and China slows to 6.5 percent, then the United States will regain the lead this year -- contributing 23 percent of global growth in 2012, compared to 18 percent for China -- and it will hold that lead at least through 2015, according to Morgan Stanley research.
Investors who have bet big on near-double-digit growth in China will be troubled by this slowdown and will start looking for a safer destination. With Europe and Japan both growing at less than 2 percent, the focus of global attention will shift to the improving competitive position of the United States, and capital flows will follow.
China's slowdown is setting the stage for a drop in the price of oil, which has had a crippling effect on growth in the United States. In recent years China has accounted for nearly half of global growth in oil demand, and every 1 percent of G.D.P. growth in China added 10 to 30 percent to the price of oil.
China's slowdown is also opening the door to a revival in American manufacturing. China is suffering many symptoms typical of a maturing miracle economy, from a strengthening currency to rising wages, land prices and transport costs, while the United States has a weak currency, stagnant wages and a moribund property market. The dollar is near record lows (in inflation-adjusted terms) against many of its trading partners, including China. The long-term decline in the United States' share of global manufacturing exports bottomed out in 2008 at 8 percent, but has since been inching higher. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that by 2015, China will have lost most of its cost advantages, accelerating the "reshoring" that is already bringing some factory jobs back home from China.
These shifts will reshape the global balance of economic power, mostly for the better. A collapse in China to zero percent growth would be disastrous for the world economy, but it is unlikely, in large part because Chinese leaders understand that the current slowdown is inevitable. They are lowering growth targets and trying to manage rather than fight the deceleration (which would only make it worse).
At the near double-digit growth rate of the last 15 years, China was the equivalent of a company with disruptive technology -- destroying competitors, lifting suppliers, sucking in capital, stealing jobs and moving so fast that rivals couldn't keep up. A smooth downshift to 6 or 7 percent makes China a more normal rival, one the world can do business with and compete head to head against -- one that should generate a lot less worry.

Full text: To the Editor:
Peter J. Spiro's take on Arizona's draconian anti-immigration law, S.B. 1070 ("Let Arizona's Law Stand," Op-Ed, April 23), is the free-market approach to legislation.
He urges the Supreme Court, which hears arguments on Wednesday, to uphold the law so it can "wither away on its own." Mr. Spiro would let targeted populations suffer economic disaster, injustice, prejudice and false arrest until the pain of this legislation forces its repeal.
Social justice demands that those most helpless and disadvantaged have the protection of law. Mr. Spiro's solution is heartless, antisocial and exploitative.
WILLIAM O. BEEMAN

The writer is chairman of the anthropology department at the University of Minnesota.

To the Editor:
Peter J. Spiro makes a curious case for Supreme Court inaction. He acknowledges, almost parenthetically, that federal law trumps state initiatives on matters of immigration status, and that these state laws "are misguided at best, mean-spirited and racially tainted at worst." Then, he argues that "immigrant interests" would be better served if the court upholds the Arizona statute at issue.
How so? By Mr. Spiro's reckoning, economic imperatives would steadily drive a new political agenda. Arizona, after all, has already lost tens of millions of dollars in convention business as a result of S.B. 1070.
Companies large and small would continue to shun Arizona and other states viewed as anti-immigrant, Mr. Spiro says. In the end, Arizona's law would "wither away on its own," as would, presumably, similar laws in other states.
Mr. Spiro may be right, but aren't such unintended consequences beside the point? Shouldn't we expect the justices to decide the case on the merits?
Or have we come to that sorry state where such expectations seem merely naive, given our polarization in politics and, yes, in judicial decision-making, too?

To the Editor:
Business interests do not oppose anti-immigration state laws such as this out of humanity. Corporate interests like illegal immigrants because they provide an oversupply of cheap laborers who have absolutely no power.
This is why -- to cite just one example -- the wages of meat packers have declined from around $18 an hour (inflation-adjusted) in the mid-1970s to about $11 an hour at present, and the conditions they labor under have become atrocious over the last generation.
This is why many pro-big-business Republicans such as our last president supported amnesty until the base made that support toxic.
And this is why Cesar Chavez, the legendary founder of the United Farm Workers, denounced illegal immigrants to the federal authorities.

To the Editor:
Re "Defining Moment on Immigration" (front page, April 23):
I know someone who is living in the United States illegally. He is European, has fair hair and fair skin, and speaks English perfectly. Does anyone truly believe that if he were stopped by the police in one of the states with harsh immigration laws, he would be asked to prove he was in the country legally?
Clearly, the answer is no, which shows that these laws are not really about immigration. They are about race and ethnicity, nothing more and nothing less.
Expressing such sentiments openly would be unacceptable. So instead the states passing these laws, and the groups promoting them, claim that what they are really concerned about is jobs, resources, security and the rule of law. But the blatant racial profiling that these laws engender demonstrates how false these claims are.

Abstract: By January 2009, the country was churning out bills worth 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars, which were soon so worthless they would not buy a loaf of bread (the notes now circulate on eBay, as gag gifts). According to the United States Federal Reserve, at least five countries have officially adopted the United States dollar as their currency.

Full text: HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Zimbabweans say they are waiting for change, they are usually talking about politics. After all, the country has had the same leader since 1980.
But these days, Robson Madzumbara spends a lot of time quite literally waiting around for change. Pocket change, that is. He waits for it at supermarkets, on the bus, at the vegetable stall he runs and just about anywhere he buys or sells anything.
"We never have enough change," he said, manning the vegetable stall he has run for the past two decades. "Change is a big problem in Zimbabwe."
For years, Zimbabwe was infamous for the opposite problem: mind-boggling inflation. Trips to the supermarket required ridiculous boxloads of cash. By January 2009, the country was churning out bills worth 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars, which were soon so worthless they would not buy a loaf of bread (the notes now circulate on eBay, as gag gifts).
But since Zimbabwe started using the United States dollar as its currency in 2009, it has run into a surprising quandary. Once worth too little, money in Zimbabwe is now worth too much.
"For your average Zimbabwean, a dollar is a lot of money," said Tony Hawkins, an economist at the University of Zimbabwe.
Zimbabweans call it "the coin problem." Simply put, the country hardly has any. Coins are heavy, making them expensive to ship here. But in a nation where millions of people live on a dollar or two a day, trying to get every transaction to add up to a whole dollar has proved a national headache.
Still, the new predicament is an improvement. By virtually wiping out inflation, analysts say, use of the United States dollar saved Zimbabwe from total economic collapse and brought the country back from the brink. The country's political future remains deeply unsettled since the disputed 2008 election gave way to a shaky power-sharing government. But its economy is growing, if from a very low base.
Zimbabweans have devised a variety of solutions to get around the change problem, none of them entirely satisfactory. At supermarkets, impulse purchases have become almost compulsory. When the total is less than a dollar, the customer is offered candy, a pen or matches to make up the difference. Some shops offer credit slips, a kind of scrip that has begun to circulate here.
But for small merchants who sell handfuls of tomatoes, onions and lemons to poor people, customers may not always have the luxury of buying a dollar's worth of merchandise.
Christine Mhalanga, 27, a hospital orderly, went to buy tomatoes from Evelyn Chikandiwa, who runs another vegetable stall. She selected a stack of tomatoes and some onions for stew. Mercifully, her purchase was exactly a dollar because Ms. Chikandiwa had no coins in her gingham apron to break any bills.
"I already had to buy clothespins I don't need today," Ms. Mhalanga said. "A dollar is a lot of money for me. I need every bit of it. Trust me."
According to the United States Federal Reserve, at least five countries have officially adopted the United States dollar as their currency. Several more, like Zimbabwe, use it almost exclusively but hold on to a national currency, even if it is not in circulation.
But United States coins seldom circulate more than 100 miles beyond the country's borders because of their weight and high shipping costs.
Most countries that use the dollar get around this problem by minting local coins: Ecuador uses the dollar as legal tender but mints centavo coins. The government guarantees that anyone who wants to exchange 100 Ecuadorean centavos for a genuine United States dollar can do so.
But that requires confidence in the local government, something that is in even shorter supply here than coins. Zimbabweans say they want no legal tender issued by their government.
"I won't accept any Zimbabwean money," said Ms. Chikandiwa, the vegetable seller, who saw her life savings wiped out by hyperinflation. Back then, the value of the currency dropped so fast that prices for milk, cigarettes, sugar and flour would change by the hour, if not the minute. These days, Ms. Chikandiwa keeps all her earnings in cash, not trusting her precious dollars to the bank. "We can't trust these people," she said, referring to the government.
Many Zimbabweans use coins from neighboring South Africa. But that presents its own difficulties. South African coins -- the currency is the rand -- are in short supply. Complicating matters, the rand, like most currencies, fluctuates against the dollar, making prices tough to fix.
Tendai Biti, Zimbabwe's finance minister and a senior politician in the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, said that he had tried, to no avail, to find a solution.
"We have been seeking help from the Fed in the States, but we haven't got a lot of joy," he said, an edge of frustration seeping into his voice.
Supermarket cashiers are frustrated, too, and they devise their own ways to defuse the tension. Every transaction is a miniature drama of anticipation, annoyance and negotiation. The shopper tries to add up purchases to avoid needing change. And at the register, shoppers must make up their minds on how to compensate for failure.
As Lydia Zhuwawu worked the cash register at the Classic Supermarket in Harare during the evening rush this week, she tried to size up her customers to guess what they might accept in lieu of change.
A basket full of tomatoes and onions comes to $2.80. Ms. Zhuwawu has two well-worn singles for the $5 note, but no nickels or dimes.
"Sorry, no change," Ms. Zhuwawu said, waving a hand at her assortment of wares.
The customer chooses a packet of four aspirin, 5 cents apiece.
Next up: a customer with $3.90 worth of groceries. Ms. Zhuwawu offers up a steel bottle opener.
"This is for 10 cents?" the customer asks, wearily. She takes it.
With single dollar bills in heavy rotation, they tend to suffer a lot of wear and tear. Many are filthy -- almost black. Ms. Zhuwawu takes note of the cleanliness of the legal tender each customer hands her. Two-dollar bills, rare in the United States, circulate widely here.
Most people, she said, have a sense of humor about the problem. After all that Zimbabwe has been through, it is not that big a burden, she said. It is a give-and-take.
A man comes in to buy staples. A box is 30 cents; he has only a dollar. Her change drawer is empty.
"Just take it," Ms. Zhuwawu said. "It's your lucky day. Nothing is free in Zimbabwe."

Abstract: A German-inspired austerity regimen agreed to just last month as the long-term solution to Europe's sovereign debt crisis has come under increasing strain from the growing pressures of slowing economies, gyrating financial markets and a series of electoral setbacks.

Full text: BERLIN -- With political allies weakened or ousted, Chancellor Angela Merkel's seat at the head of the European table has become much less comfortable, as a reckoning with Germany's insistence on lock-step austerity appears to have begun.
"The formula is not working, and everyone is now talking about whether austerity is the only solution," said Jordi Vaquer i Fanes, a political scientist and director of the Barcelona Center for International Affairs in Spain. "Does this mean that Merkel has lost completely? No. But it does mean that the very nature of the debate about the euro-zone crisis is changing."
A German-inspired austerity regimen agreed to just last month as the long-term solution to Europe's sovereign debt crisis has come under increasing strain from the growing pressures of slowing economies, gyrating financial markets and a series of electoral setbacks.
Spain officially slipped back into recession for the second time in three years on Monday, after following the German remedy of deep retrenchment in public outlays, joining Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Mark Rutte handed his resignation to Queen Beatrix on Monday after his government failed to pass new austerity measures over the weekend.
The political upheaval drove stock markets on the Continent sharply lower, with Germany's DAX index finishing the day down 3.4 percent. The sell-off in Europe dragged American indexes down around 1 percent. A survey of European purchasing managers showed an unexpected plunge in confidence this month.
The Netherlands, a staunch supporter of the German position, became the latest European country forced into early elections by the European crisis, just one day after the first round of presidential voting in France raised the possibility that the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, would be unseated by his Socialist challenger, Francois Hollande, in a runoff election.
From trading floors to polling stations to the streets of cities across Europe, the message appears increasingly to be that countries cannot cut their way to fiscal health. They need growth, too. In recent months, powerful voices have joined the chorus, including those of the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, and Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has called repeatedly for Europe to defer budget cutting in favor of some form of stimulus spending.
Pressured by the presidential campaign, even Mr. Sarkozy, once Ms. Merkel's most prominent ally, has begun to talk of the need for growth.
Despite the rising criticism, Berlin did not seem ready to concede defeat for its austerity plan.
"We certainly still have many difficult reforms, measures and times ahead of us," said Martin Kotthaus, spokesman for the Finance Ministry. "But the path appears to be correct. At least that is what the development of the last weeks and months proves, and also -- as far as I can tell -- the surveys of the populations of the European Union."
It was only in March that leaders from 25 of the 27 European Union countries gathered to sign the fiscal compact championed by Ms. Merkel. Her plan, combined with $1.3 trillion in cheap loans injected into the banking system by the European Central Bank in December and March, raised hopes that the worst of the crisis had passed.
But those hopes have been dashed as growth has faltered and interest rates on the debt of struggling countries like Spain and Italy have shot up to dangerous levels again.
"If significant numbers of the coalition wobble or fall, then Berlin has a problem," said Constanze Stelzenmuller, a senior fellow in Berlin with the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
However, while there is a growing consensus on the need for new growth policies, it is far from obvious what those policies should be, particularly for the heavily indebted countries already having trouble selling government debt.
"You have this dilemma because you have to borrow more money to finance growth measures, but that is also likely to stir up the financial markets," said Tanja Borzel, a professor of European Union politics at the Free University in Berlin. "Then the money you need will be more expensive to borrow."
The European Central Bank cannot be counted on to deliver major monetary stimulus in the manner of the United States Federal Reserve because the bank is required by treaty to combat inflation above all else. One option is to allow debtor countries more time to bring their deficits under control, but that is seen more as damage control than as a way to foster growth.
Another possibility, which Germany will be under renewed pressure to accept, is some form of common European debt, generally referred to as Eurobonds, which any member of the currency zone could tap. It is a step that Ms. Merkel's conservative bloc has opposed forcefully, but with more than 17 million people in the euro zone out of work and the unemployment rate at 10.8 percent, the need for urgent steps is growing.
Marie Diron, an economic adviser to the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said Germany could slow down its own drive to balance its budget and do more to encourage domestic consumption. Other European states would benefit if Germany bought more of their goods.
"Austerity has to fit into a wider policy context," Ms. Diron said.
Taking advantage of growing voter outrage, fringe parties like the Greek ultranationalist group Golden Dawn and France's far-right National Front, which won nearly one in five votes Sunday, are gaining strength, evoking comparisons to the Weimar era, which ushered the Nazi Party into power. That has only added urgency to the push for programs that would create jobs.
"You see an incredible public uproar against the strict austerity measures," Ms. Borzel said. "It's mostly the populist parties that now become ever more critical of the austerity policies."
Even in Germany, where unemployment is low and the crisis seems a faraway phenomenon, the political landscape has grown unpredictable. The computer hackers of the Pirate Party, which supports Internet freedom, have emerged from relative obscurity to challenge the Green Party as the third most powerful faction in opinion polls.
Ms. Merkel's coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats, have been the most prominent victims of the political instability. In trying to stave off its total collapse, the party has become a less and less reliable partner, especially when European rescue packages are up for votes in the German Parliament.
"In a nutshell, you need growth and employment or else debt reduction doesn't work. We're seeing that right now in Spain," Sigmar Gabriel, the head of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, said on German public radio, adding that Ms. Merkel's policies had failed in southern Europe. "The success of Hollande was in sending a signal beyond France that the politics of Merkel and Sarkozy are not without alternatives."
Over the years of the euro crisis, Ms. Merkel has moved on the problems at a deliberate pace, a tactic of brinkmanship meant to achieve debt reduction across the euro zone while limiting German exposure to other countries' liabilities and, therefore, minimizing political damage at home. So far it has largely worked in Germany, and her support in Europe is broader than it appears, with smaller countries like the Baltics, Finland and Austria -- and even the larger and increasing supportive Poland -- content to stand quietly behind her.
Ms. Merkel has proved herself a masterful tactician time and again. She was adept at working with the Social Democrats as her partner in the previous German government, and Mr. Hollande might be even more amenable than Mr. Sarkozy to ceding French sovereignty in economic policy in exchange for help on growth, Mr. Vaquer from the Barcelona Center for International Affairs said.
"She will have to backtrack on austerity anyway," Mr. Vaquer said. "Germany can now extract a much more unified Europe in terms of economic governance than it ever could have before."

Full text: HONG KONG -- A closely watched survey of manufacturing activity in China rebounded in April, offering the latest sign that the Chinese economy was gradually regaining some of the momentum it lost last year.
The monthly survey, which is compiled by Markit and sponsored by HSBC, found that although conditions at factories remained difficult, government efforts to reinvigorate economic growth during the last few months had filtered through to companies.
The reading for April for the survey, the purchasing managers' index, was released on Monday and was 49.1. April was the sixth consecutive month of readings below 50, which separates expansion from contraction. In March, the reading was 48.3.
The improvement underscored the view held by many analysts that the Chinese economy is on course for a gradual slowdown, rather than a sharp collapse, this year -- if, as is widely expected, the authorities take more steps to bolster growth in coming months.
The once torrid pace of growth in China slowed last year as demand weakened because of the debt problems in the euro zone, sluggish growth in the United States economy and tightening measures by Beijing aimed at combating inflation.
Beijing has eased off the brakes in recent months, however, permitting banks once again to extend more loans to businesses. Policy makers now have room to deliver more support to the economy.
The rise in the April index "suggests that the earlier easing measures have started to work and hence should ease concerns of a sharp growth slowdown," Qu Hongbin, China economist at HSBC, said in a note accompanying the release Monday.
"That said, the pace of both output and demand growth remains at a low level in an historical context, and the job market is under pressure," he said.
This, he added, meant that the authorities were likely to speed up monetary and fiscal easing in the second quarter of 2012.

Retail Sales Recover, Mostly, From Recession

Full text: THE American consumer seems to be spending again. Except, that is, on products dependent on home sales.
The Census Bureau reported this week that seasonally adjusted retail sales in March were 0.8 percent higher than in the previous month, more than twice the consensus forecast.
The accompanying charts show trends in retail sales since they peaked in 2008, both for the overall index and for 10 categories of retailers. After sharp falls in almost all categories, there have been impressive rebounds.
Over the last 12 months, the government estimates retail sales totaled $4.3 trillion, nearly 6 percent more than during the 12 months through July 2008, when sales peaked before the credit crisis and the recession caused sales of nearly everything to fall.
Those figures are not adjusted for inflation, but the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis makes such an adjustment for the overall sales figure. By that measure, sales have not completely recovered but are getting close to peak levels.
Retail sales figures are compiled by the type of retailer, not by the product. At the moment, with Internet retailing continuing to take market share from brick-and-mortar competitors, there is a risk that individual categories may appear to be weaker than they would be if the statistics reflected products.
The category the government calls "electronic shopping and mail order retailers" -- labeled Internet retailers in the accompanying charts -- suffered only a mild decline during the recession, and soon resumed its growth. That figure is reported on a delayed basis, so March figures are not available. But in the 12 months through February, it accounted for $308 billion in sales. Sales were up more than 30 percent since the overall sales peak in 2008, and its share of the market had grown to 7.3 percent from 5.7 percent.
Of the 10 categories shown, sales are now higher than predownturn peaks in six areas. The worst performer is furniture and home furnishings retailers, whose sales are still more than 13 percent below the peak. Those products are most often bought by consumers who have recently bought a home. The category that includes appliance stores is off more than 10 percent.
But the category that includes hardware stores and building material retailers appears to be recovering. At the bottom of the cycle, 12-month sales were down more than 15 percent from the 2008 level. They have made up most of that loss.
At the bottom of the cycle, total retail sales were down 11 percent from the peak level. In the more than 40 years for which comparable data is available, there had never been even a 1 percent decline in nominal sales before this cycle.
Of course, in some previous recessions, high inflation rates meant that consumers could continue to spend more money while getting less. This time, there were periods when weak demand meant there was overall deflation. Adjusted for inflation, and using 12-month periods, the maximum decline was 11.4 percent, just a bit more severe than the 11.3 percent fall recorded in the double-dip recessions of the early 1980s.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
PARIS -- To the list of worries about the euro zone, add one in bold: the fate of France as it heads into the first round of a closely contested presidential election this weekend.
After a long stretch in which President Nicolas Sarkozy grappled with the euro crisis, investors are now wrestling with the implications of a potential victory by the Socialist candidate, Francois Hollande. Mr. Hollande's pledges of higher taxes on the rich, and higher government spending, are luring voters disenchanted by the austerity medicine Mr. Sarkozy has administered in hopes of protecting France from financial contagion.
Many investors, though, are questioning what a government run by Mr. Hollande would mean for France's economic competitiveness and its ability to keep clear of the financial turmoil that has once again lifted the borrowing costs of two other big euro zone countries, Spain and Italy.
A surprisingly successful bond auction by Spain on Tuesday at least temporarily buoyed the financial markets in Europe and the United States. But the underlying concerns for Spain and the region have not gone away. And with polls showing Mr. Hollande as at least an even bet to oust Mr. Sarkozy, a fog of financial uncertainty has enveloped France, Europe's biggest economy after Germany.
"If you combine an election of Francois Hollande with a worsening economic situation, no improvement in Spain, and a possible new downgrade of France by the ratings agencies, there is a high likelihood" that France's borrowing costs will also rise, said Evariste Lefeuvre, chief economist at the French investment bank Natixis in New York.
Such sentiments are viewed warily by many French voters, and Mr. Sarkozy's opponents, who are exasperated by what they see as a crass effort by financial players to browbeat France into accepting more of the type of austerity measures that have squeezed growth in Greece, Spain and other troubled euro zone countries.
The German derivatives exchange, Eurex, ignited a political furor in France when it began trading a futures contract Monday enabling investors to hedge their bets on French government debt. The apparent premise is that France's creditworthiness could slip if the government -- whether led by Mr. Sarkozy or Mr. Hollande -- backslides on efforts to cut its debt and deficit.
Executives at Eurex said the timing was a mere coincidence. But for the bristling French, there was no ignoring that it came just days before voters head to the polls this weekend to narrow a sprawling field of French candidates down to two, with a final presidential runoff scheduled to take place May 6.
Mr. Hollande blamed the German exchange for encouraging speculation on France's insolvency, and said that if he were elected, he would try to get the new Eurex contracts eliminated.
With the campaign heating up, Mr. Hollande accused Mr. Sarkozy of encouraging market speculation against France by playing up fears that Mr. Hollande's supposed tax-and-spend programs, together with his inexperience in dealing with the financial crisis, could push France's borrowing costs toward levels that would make it harder for the nation to pay down its debt.
France's government debt will near an estimated 90 percent of gross domestic product this year -- the fifth highest in Europe and well above Germany's estimated 78 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Sarkozy, for his part, has not been shy about sounding his own populist notes in counterattacking Mr. Hollande. On Sunday, the president raised eyebrows in financial markets, and in Germany, by telling a rally in Paris that if he were re-elected, he would open a debate on widening the European Central Bank's legal mandate to let it promote growth through monetary stimulus. It is a power that the Federal Reserve in the United States holds, but that is now largely off limits to Europe's central bank, which is supposed to focus mainly on controlling inflation.
Mr. Sarkozy's campaign promise irritated his German allies. A spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel publicly reminded the French president that the bank needed to remain independent, and that it was the duty of each euro zone country to manage its own finances.
A central plank of Mr. Hollande's platform revolves around restoring social equilibrium in France, which he says Mr. Sarkozy has upset by giving tax breaks to the wealthy, giving employers greater leeway in hiring and firing, and threatening the sanctity of the 35-hour workweek that an earlier Socialist government put in place.
Mr. Hollande also contends that the cuts to government and social programs made in the name of reducing the budget deficit have hit the working class too hard. Such rhetoric has strong appeal at a time when the country is facing a shallow recession, and unemployment remains above 10 percent, the highest level in more than a decade.
But investors are already alarmed by what they see as an erosion of competitiveness among French companies, a widening current account deficit and declining exports.
As a result, investors say France is drifting away from the "core" of strong European economies that include Germany and the Nordic countries. Instead, it is increasingly being lumped together with the weak large economies of Spain and Italy, along Europe's troubled southern rim.
To turn things around, Mr. Hollande and Mr. Sarkozy agree that France's budget needs to be balanced soon. Mr. Sarkozy says his program would get there by 2016. Mr. Hollande says his would reach the goal by 2017. Both agree to whittle the deficit down to 3 percent of gross domestic product next year from 5.2 percent last year.
But that is where the similarities end. Mr. Sarkozy plans to raise value-added taxes on consumer products. He would continue a program of reducing government employment by replacing only one of every two civil servants who retire. He would also reduce France's financial contribution to the European Union budget and to local authorities, as well as freeze spending on certain portions of France's health care system.
Such pledges do not worry the financial markets as much as Mr. Sarkozy's promises to introduce a minimum tax on large companies, or collect more taxes from income French companies earn abroad.
Mr. Hollande, in contrast, is pledging to increase taxes on the wealthy to pay for significant new spending intended to spur the economy. He promises to raise 29 billion euros (about $38 billion) in new revenue while lifting spending by 20 billion euros.
A main Hollande plank includes introducing a 75 percent marginal tax rate on individual income above 1 million euros and forgoing the planned increase in the value-added tax. And he has pledged to fill some of the slots left open by retiring public employees by hiring 60,000 civil servants and teachers. Mr. Hollande would also reverse changes to the pension system instituted under Mr. Sarkozy, by pushing the retirement age back to 60, from 62, for people meeting certain criteria.
That platform, Mr. Lefeuvre said, is why many foreign investors are hoping for Mr. Hollande's electoral defeat.
"If he does win, there will be a lot of concern," Mr. Lefeuvre said.
Correction: April 20, 2012, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about investor concerns arising from the French presidential election described incorrectly an economic proposal by the Socialist candidate, Francois Hollande. While he has proposed hiring 60,000 civil servants and teachers, he would do so by filling slots left open by retiring public employees; it would not be an expansion of the work force.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- As the euro zone crisis shows signs of heating up again, political leaders are once more looking to the European Central Bank for help.
But analysts say they do not expect the central bank, with its focus on fiscal discipline, to provide any quick remedies.
Spain continues to be the focus of regional anxiety, as its borrowing costs rose further on Monday before two crucial debt auctions this week. But some political leaders elsewhere also are feeling public heat as a result of unpopular government policies in response to Europe's debt debacle -- particularly in France, which will hold the first round of voting in its presidential election this weekend.
The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his main challenger, Francois Hollande, have begun loudly pushing the European Central Bank to intervene more forcefully in the sovereign bond markets or take other steps to relieve hard-pressed governments.
But analysts say such pushing could be counterproductive because the bank and its president, Mario Draghi, might be even less likely to act if doing so could appear to be a response to political pressure.
"If I want the E.C.B. to intervene in the sovereign debt market, I would be very angry with Sarkozy," said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
One action the central bank could take, if it chose, would be to try to calm the financial waters by buying Spanish bonds in the open market to help hold down Madrid's borrowing costs, as Spain tries this week to auction off 5.5 billion euros, or $7.2 billion, in new debt.
The central bank has bought bonds from Spain, Greece and other indebted countries off and on since 2010, but the impact on bond prices has usually been only temporary.
The region's sense of crisis over Spain rose Monday as the yield, or effective interest rate, on its 10-year bonds reached 6.10 percent in the open market. That is up from less than 5 percent as recently as March, and it is the highest since Spain's conservative government, under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, took office late last year.
The higher Spain's borrowing costs, the greater the fear that it might require a costly European bailout.
Whether the central bank intervenes "is a function of how much the E.C.B. thinks markets are overshooting and how confident the E.C.B. is that Spanish authorities are doing the right thing and adopting credible measures," said Nick Matthews, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.
On Tuesday, Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, is scheduled to call on Mr. Draghi here. The central bank would not comment on what they planned to discuss.
The European Central Bank has also become an issue in the French presidential campaign in recent days, with the two leading candidates lambasting the bank and its policies.
Mr. Sarkozy, behind in the polls days before voters go to the polls, said the European Union should rewrite the bank's mandate to compel it to pay more attention to economic growth than to controlling inflation. His main challenger, Mr. Hollande, the Socialist candidate, has blamed the central bank for letting the sovereign debt crisis get out of control.
An expansion of the bank's writ to make it behave more like the United States Federal Reserve is extremely unlikely, however.
By law, the European Central Bank's primary task is to contain inflation, whereas the Fed has much greater leeway to buy Treasury bonds or take other steps to stimulate lending and growth. A revision of the central bank's legal mandate would require a change in the European Union treaty, including unanimous approval by the 27 member states.
"The chance of this happening is zero," Mr. Kirkegaard said. "Sarkozy knows that, and Hollande knows that. This is French election Kabuki theater."
Germany, the country most stridently opposed to taking the central bank's focus off inflation, had little reaction to Mr. Sarkozy's comments, probably because most people considered them to be obvious electioneering.
"The German position on the E.C.B. and its independent role is known, also in Paris, and has been unchanged for a long time," Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, said at a news briefing on Monday. But Mr. Seibert added that Germany agreed with France on the need for sustainable growth in Europe.
In any case, the central bank's mandate already encourages it to support growth in the euro zone, just not at the expense of inflation. Mr. Draghi and other top policy makers have often said that they believe modest inflation is a prerequisite for growth.
Still, the statements by the French candidates reflect the frustrations of leaders who must bear the political cost of structural changes that have effectively been a condition for European Central Bank aid, like cutting government budgets and making it easier to fire workers.
The central bank has been widely credited with calming the markets with the total of 1 trillion euros in low-cost three-year loans that it issued to commercial banks in December and March -- some of which was used by the banks to buy more government bonds. But the central bank made that money available only after Spain and Italy committed to labor deregulation and other changes.
The central bank has bought various governments' bonds on the open market intermittently since May 2010, spending 214 billion euros. It does not disclose what bonds it buys, but is believed to have focused on those of troubled countries like Greece, Portugal and Ireland, as well as Spain and Italy. That program has been dormant lately.
Mr. Kirkegaard and other analysts said they thought that the central bank might begin to buy Spanish bonds -- especially if Spain's leaders commit to more steps to remove impediments to growth.
But they said more forceful central bank action -- like a cut in its main interest rate from 1 percent, or another round of inexpensive three-year loans -- was unlikely in coming months, because the bank is still concerned about inflation.
Meanwhile, the Spain is trying to reassure investors that it would be able to rescue any of its 17 regional governments if their finances deteriorate further. Spain posted a national budget deficit of 8.5 percent of gross domestic product last year, well above its target of 6 percent. A big reason was the deficits of the regional governments.
Mr. de Guindos, the economy minister, has repeatedly pledged that the government "will not let any region collapse" because of its solvency problems, while urging them to apply greater fiscal discipline.
On Monday, he met in Paris with French investors to try to convince them that Spain would not need a Greece-style bailout. When he meets Tuesday with Mr. Draghi, it is a message that he is likely to repeat.

Abstract: Many of the Republican tax proposals on the table might increase income inequality, at least in the short term, according to William G. Gale of the Tax Policy Center and many other left-leaning and centrist economists. "[...] the United States is becoming like Old Europe, which is very strange in historical perspective," Mr. Piketty said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- High earners who are worried that this year's Tax Day will be the last one before their rates rise have more than just the White House and Washington to blame. They can also look to two academically revered, if publicly obscure, left-leaning French economists whose work is the subtext for the battle over tax fairness.
Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty have spent the last decade tracking the incomes of the poor, the middle class and the rich in countries across the world. More than anything else, their work shows that the top earners in the United States have taken a bigger and bigger share of overall income over the last three decades, with inequality nearly as acute as it was before the Great Depression.
Known in Washington and the economics profession by the of-course-you-know shorthand "Piketty-Saez," the two have been denounced on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and won mention in White House budget documents.
Mr. Saez, 39, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, has won the John Bates Clark Medal, an economic laurel considered second only to the Nobel, as well as a MacArthur Fellowship grant. Mr. Piketty, 40, of the Paris School of Economics, has won Le Monde's prize for best young economist, among other awards.
Both admire, even adore, the United States, they say, for its entrepreneurial drive, innovative spirit and, not least, its academic excellence: the two met while re-searchers in Cambridge, Mass. But both also express bewilderment over the current conversation about whether the wealthy, who have taken most of America's income gains over the last 30 years, should be paying higher taxes.
"The United States is getting accustomed to a completely crazy level of inequality," Mr. Piketty said, with a degree of wonder. "People say that reducing inequality is radical. I think that tolerating the level of inequality the United States tolerates is radical."
As much as Mr. Piketty's and Mr. Saez's work has informed the national debate over earnings and fairness, their proposed corrective remains far outside the bounds of polite political conversation: much, much higher top marginal tax rates on the rich, up to 50 percent, or 70 percent or even 90 percent, from the current top rate of 35 percent.
The two economists argue that even Democrats' boldest plan to increase taxes on the wealthy -- the Buffett Rule, a 30 percent minimum tax on earnings over $1 million -- would do little to reverse the rich's gains. Many of the Republican tax proposals on the table might increase income inequality, at least in the short term, according to William G. Gale of the Tax Policy Center and many other left-leaning and centrist economists.
Conservatives respond that high tax rates would stifle economic growth, at a minimum, and cause some businesses and high-income workers to flee to other countries. When top American tax rates were much higher, from the 1940s through the 1970s, businesses could not relocate as easily as they can now, say critics of Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez.
"I materially disagree with the idea you can raise a marginal tax rate to 70 percent and not have an impact on economic growth," said Ike Brannon, an economist at the American Action Forum. "It's absurd on its face."
But Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez argue that history is on their side: Many countries have higher tax rates -- and the United States has had higher tax rates -- without stifling growth or encouraging the concentration of income in the hands of the very rich.
"In a way, the United States is becoming like Old Europe, which is very strange in historical perspective," Mr. Piketty said. "The United States used to be very egalitarian, not just in spirit but in actuality. Inequality of wealth and income used to be much larger in France. And very high taxes on the very rich -- that was invented in the United States," he said.
Mr. Saez added, "Absent drastic policy changes, I doubt that income inequality will decline on its own."
The two economists' project of mapping income inequality started two decades ago, when Mr. Saez was teaching at Harvard and Mr. Piketty teaching down the road at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Their innovation was to measure American income inequality historically. Existing data went back only to the 1970s. Tedious archival research at the Internal Revenue Service allowed them to stretch the data all the way back to 1913.
Once they had collected the data, the computation was easy. They figured out the benchmark for various income levels -- the top 10 percent, top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent of earners, for instance -- and calculated what share of income each group took each year.
What they found startled them. As in other industrially advanced countries, income inequality in the United States fell after World War II, a period that economic historians call the "Great Compression," and remained stable through much of the 1970s.
But then inequality started increasing again, with the top 1 percent of earners drawing a bigger and bigger share of overall income. Their graph showing the trend became well-known: a deep U, with inequality as acute today as it was just before the depression.
When they first published their work, income inequality was mostly off the political radar screen, thanks to the 1990s boom, Mr. Saez said.
"Growing inequality was not perceived to be an issue because the economy was growing fast and even the incomes of the 99 percent were growing significantly," he said.
But the deep downturn of the last few years, and Mr. Obama's election, brought the issue back to the fore. Peter R. Orszag, the former Obama budget director, has said the Piketty-Saez work "helped to point the way for the administration in its pledge to rebalance the tax code."
Now living many time zones apart, Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez update their work with frequent e-mails, Skype conversations and data-sharing through Dropbox.
They have found that the trends have mostly continued. From 2000 to 2007, incomes for the bottom 90 percent of earners rose only about 4 percent, once adjusted for inflation. For the top 0.1 percent, incomes climbed about 94 percent.
The recession interrupted the trend, with the sharp decline in stock prices hitting the pocketbooks of the rich. But the income share of 1 percent has since rebounded. Data that the two economists released in March showed that the top 1 percent of earners got nearly every dollar of the income gains eked out in the first full year of the recovery. In 2010, the top 10 percent of earners took about half of overall income.
That has led the two economists to renew their calls for higher rates on the rich. Along with Peter Diamond, an emeritus professor at M.I.T. and a Nobel laureate, Mr. Saez has estimated the "optimal" top tax rates for the wealthy -- getting the most revenue from those most able to surrender it -- to be between 45 and 70 percent.
In France, Francois Hollande, the Socialist who may well succeed Nicolas Sarkozy as president, wants to raise the top marginal income tax rate to 75 percent, calling earnings over a million euros "impossible." A candidate yet farther on the left suggests a top rate of 100 percent."The debate in Washington is between the Bush-era and Clinton-era tax rates," said Mr. Diamond, whom Mr. Obama nominated to the Federal Reserve and Republicans blocked. "Our finding is that the debate should be between the pre-1986 Reagan tax rate, which was 50 percent, and the rates that existed from Johnson until Reagan," which were higher.
"Thirty percent is three times smaller than the 91 percent of Roosevelt," Mr. Piketty said, responding to the Buffett Rule proposal and referring to the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who engineered the New Deal. "And inequality is greater than in the time of Roosevelt."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- If Mitt Romney is considering a quick pivot to the center as he heads into the general election, he will find an imposing impediment: fellow Republicans in the House.
As Congress was set to reconvene on Monday, House Republicans said Mr. Romney could go his own way on smaller issues that may help define him as separate from his Congressional Republican counterparts. But, they said, he must understand that they are driving the policy agenda for the party now.
"We're not a cheerleading squad," said Representative Jeff Landry, an outspoken freshman from Louisiana. "We're the conductor. We're supposed to drive the train."
With Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan, Republicans have already set the agenda on the key issue that divides the two parties in an age of austerity: how to manage the federal budget and its related entitlement programs. Mr. Romney has eagerly embraced it, campaigning with Mr. Ryan by his side and calling him "bold and brilliant."
But a disagreement between the parties over spending levels has paved a path for the sort of clash that led to the near shutdown of the government last year, and it could leave Mr. Romney in the position of having to choose between a loud public battle and a budget compromise with Democrats in the closing weeks of the fall campaign.
Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, and House Republicans diverge on some legislative issues -- notably what to do about Chinese currency manipulation, an issue that has become a centerpiece of the Romney campaign. And that could further highlight the differences within the Republican Party.
In 1999, as House Republicans grappled with far more modest spending cuts, George W. Bush was able to underscore his claim to "compassionate conservatism" by denouncing House efforts. "I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs of the poor," he said
Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a Republican House leader at the time, recalled that as a "defining moment" for the Bush campaign -- one that blindsided Republicans. As Mr. Romney's designated liaison to Congressional Republicans, Mr. Blunt said that one of his jobs was to make sure no one is surprised like that again.
In the past two weeks, he has set up meetings between Mr. Romney's policy shop and key representatives and staff. They included a meeting between Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan, as well as one between the Romney staff and the Republican Study Committee, a group of the most conservative House members.
"There will be issues where the governor needs to steer his own course, no doubt about that," Mr. Blunt said. "My biggest interest is that they have all the information they need to have."
Congress returns this week after a two-week recess, the first time it will convene since Mr. Romney emerged as the presumed nominee. Both chambers are expected to move quickly to take up a variety of fiscal measures, with the Republican-controlled House voting on small-business tax cuts and beginning planning sessions on a tax overhaul. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, will bring to the floor the so-called Buffett Rule, which would raise the minimum effective tax rate for the wealthy.
Undoubtedly, House Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, will move mountains to make sure House Republicans and the Romney campaign speak and act in lockstep toward the greater goal of defeating President Obama in November and retaining the House. At the same time, Mr. Obama has shown a desire to take advantage of the public's low regard for Congress by likening Mr. Romney's agenda to that of House Republicans.
But Mr. Romney may learn the lesson that has been imparted to Mr. Boehner throughout the 112th Congress -- that the most conservative members will steer their own course, and loudly.
Freshmen as well as veteran members of the Republican Study Committee, led by Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, have shown no hesitation to buck the leadership. And Mr. Romney has even less leverage with them.
Still, party leaders insist that House Republicans and Mr. Romney are united on issues that matter most. "On the big issues -- spending, taxes, what we do with the deficit -- I just don't see much difference," said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a member of the Republican leadership, "and more importantly, I don't see an escape."
Indeed, most Congressional Republicans feel certain that the key issues of the campaign will be employment, the economy, the budget deficit and the health care law, matters in which there is little light between Mr. Romney and most Republicans.
"We have led and will continue to lead," Representative Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania said of House Republicans.
"Now I believe Governor Romney will have his own ideas and will use his own experience to form his message," said Mr. Barletta, who supported Rick Santorum. "But we all do agree that President Obama's policies have failed, and we will all rally around that."
But that budget plan leaves little room for Mr. Romney to stray on any proposal that could cost additional money. Both Mr. Romney and House Republicans plan to increase spending on defense, and both have promised to cut tax rates and slash the deficit.
That means sharp cuts to domestic spending. The Ryan plan would cut domestic programs under Congress's discretion, including education, law enforcement and health research -- by 25 percent over 10 years compared with spending if programs were allowed to grow with inflation, or 21 percent below spending caps agreed to in July by Mr. Obama and Congress.
Having taken that politically risky course, Republicans are going to make sure their nominee does not leave them hanging.
"If there was to be a difference of opinion on this, then I think I would make my feelings known," said Representative Tim Griffin, Mr. Romney's Arkansas campaign chairman. "I would say, 'Wait, what are you doing?' If he says something I disagree with, that's his right, but I am going to say I disagree."
A campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said in a statement: "Mitt Romney is in this race to turn the economy around and get Americans back to work, and he will need the help of Congress to do that. Governor Romney will welcome the help of Congress to enact his agenda and get the country back on track."
But disagreements have already begun to develop. On Wednesday, the Romney camp said the candidate had no problem with a Democratic law making it easier for women to sue in equal pay cases -- though House Republicans had denounced it as a trial lawyers' bonanza.
Mr. Romney said one of his priorities as president would be to deal with China's currency manipulation in a manner similar to the one outlined in a bill written by Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, co-sponsored by Senator Lindsey E. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and passed by the Senate last year.
However, House leaders have no intention of bringing that bill -- which would order the Commerce Department to impose tough tariffs on certain Chinese goods, to the floor this year -- and Mr. Boehner has referred to the measure as "dangerous."

Full text: WASHINGTON
ON Jan. 1 of next year, the federal tax bill for a typical middle-class household -- making in the neighborhood of $50,000 -- is scheduled to rise by about $1,750. This increase, which would come from the expiration of both the Bush tax cuts and the Obama stimulus, would follow a decade of little to no income growth for many people. As a result, inflation-adjusted, after-tax income for the median household could fall next year to its 1998 level, in spite of the continuing economic recovery.
The middle-class tax increase is just the beginning of budget changes set to take effect at the start of 2013. Poor families would see their taxes rise somewhat, too. Total federal taxes for top-earning families would rise by tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Spending cuts would also take effect, squeezing domestic programs -- education, transportation, scientific research -- and the military.
All in all, the end of 2012 will be unlike any other time in memory for the federal government.
The tax increases and spending cuts are the result of Washington's having previously kicked the can down the road, to use a phrase that is popular here. Rather than pass a plan to cut the deficit, policy makers have put off tough decisions. With the Bush tax cuts, lawmakers deliberately made them temporary, to avoid running afoul of budget rules intended to hold down the deficit.
Not surprisingly, leaders of both parties now say they are opposed to letting the changes happen on Jan. 1. Economists are also frightened of what such a sharp shift in government policy might do to a still fragile economy. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, has referred to the various expirations as "a massive fiscal cliff." Congressional aides, quoted in The Washington Post, call it "taxmageddon."
The problem, as always, is that the two parties cannot agree on what changes should take place. The combination -- of political stalemate and potential economic cataclysm -- will create an extraordinary period after this year's election. A lame-duck Congress and Mr. Obama, either re-elected or defeated, will have less than two months to agree on an alternative plan, or the tax increases and spending cuts will take effect.
Optimists -- yes, there are still some -- say that the prospect of the tax hikes and cuts could finally nudge the two parties to the kind of deficit solution that many experts prefer. It involves sweeping tax reform that would close loopholes, reduce marginal rates, simplify the tax code and perhaps even lift long-term economic growth. Such tax reform has always been easy to put off, but the compromises it requires may end up being easier to accept than taxmageddon.
YET there is still a basic contradiction with which most politicians and voters have yet to grapple, the same contradiction that has helped create this strange situation in the first place. Talking in exasperated tones about the importance of fiscal responsibility is easy. Cutting the deficit is hard, because it involves unpopular tax increases or unpopular spending cuts -- and huge cuts if the solution involves only spending, not taxes, as many Republicans urge.
Either way, the changes will affect the vast majority of Americans, given that the deficit reflects a basic disconnect between the government we have and the taxes we are willing to pay. Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare may become less generous. The Pentagon may no longer be able to get just about whatever it wants. Taxes may have to rise from their recent levels, which have been lower, as a share of the economy, than at any point in 60 years. That could mean higher rates. Or, if tax reform actually happens, it could mean smaller tax breaks for health care, housing and retirement savings.
The looming end of billions of dollars in popular government benefits may seem ridiculous. And the fact that Washington keeps delaying a serious deficit plan until another day may seem equally ridiculous. But they make perfect sense in a country where hypothetical solutions are a lot more popular than any actual ones.
Nothing highlights the paradox quite like tax reform.
Most people seem to want tax reform. In a 2011 Pew Research Center poll, 59 percent of respondents said the tax code was so flawed that Congress should "completely change it." President Obama and Representative Paul Ryan, the architect of the Republican budget plan, each claim to be more in favor of tax reform than the other one.
The notion of tax reform also has widespread support from economists, liberal and conservative. As they define it, reform would reduce marginal tax rates while eliminating or reducing various tax breaks. The tax code would then be flatter and simpler. Individuals and companies would not have to spend so much time and effort filling out their tax returns and figuring out which provisions helped them -- an especially appealing notion this time of year.
Nobody knows for sure, but many economists believe that tax reform could lift economic growth, by freeing people to spend and work in the ways they think make the most sense, rather than in ways that happen to reduce their tax bill. Mr. Ryan's plan would cut the top rate to 25 percent, from 35 percent, and still leave overall tax collection roughly where it has been, by eliminating tax breaks.
What's missing from these plans is any detail on which tax breaks would be eliminated. Corporate lobbyists, like those at the Business Roundtable, offer an especially telling contrast: they urge the government to reform the tax code while continuing to push for loopholes that benefit them and generally refusing to name loopholes they would close.
The tax breaks that cost the government the most money turn out to be overwhelmingly popular. The three largest are those for health insurance provided by employers, mortgage interest and 401(k)'s. Corporate tax breaks are smaller, but the biggest corporate breaks are often popular, too, like the one for research and development.
"Tax reform is vital but difficult," said Lawrence H. Summers, the former economic adviser to Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton. "When people think of tax expenditures, they think of standing up to the oil industry. But a ton of it is things like I.R.A.'s."
He added: "The moment you start to look at the expenditures you'd eliminate, you're struck by how much pain there is for modest rate reductions."
Optimists who believe tax reform could happen look to 1986, when President Ronald Reagan and a bipartisan Congress lowered rates and eliminated loopholes. However, there are at least two major differences between then and now. Most of the loophole closing in 1986 affected companies, not individuals. And policy makers spent months and months working together to put the law together.
None of that will be possible in the eight weeks between Election Day 2012 and Jan. 1, 2013. "Tax reform is a process, not an event," said Donald Marron, a former aide to President George W. Bush who now runs the Tax Policy Center in Washington. Mr. Marron called full-scale tax reform "really unlikely."
What, then, will happen later this year?
Much will depend on who wins the presidential election. (Neither party is likely to have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.) If Mr. Obama wins re-election, he and his aides say, he will not extend all the Bush tax cuts, as they agreed to do in 2010.
They instead plan to insist on a deficit plan that combines spending cuts with higher taxes for the affluent, who have received the largest tax cuts in recent decades. Mr. Obama, according to a senior adviser speaking last week, views taxmageddon as a chance to force the Republicans to acknowledge that even they do not support the spending cuts necessary to balance the budget without tax increases on the wealthy.
For the White House, the best case might pair an extension of the Bush tax cuts for several more months with a legislative framework for a new tax code that reduces tax breaks for the affluent. The top rate might not rise, but taxes on the rich would. Policy makers would work out the details in early 2013.
The so-called Buffett Rule, a focus of Mr. Obama's last week, is a model for such a tax system. It does not specify which tax breaks would shrink for households with more than $1 million in income but rather caps the total value of such tax breaks. Martin Feldstein, a Republican economist, has proposed a similar cap for all taxpayers. The approach is meant to avoid a political war of attrition over every large, popular tax break.
Of course, Republicans have shown scant sign of wanting to compromise on high-end taxes, even after election losses, as in 2008. If they hold firm once again, Mr. Obama will have to choose between standing down (once again) and allowing taxes to rise on every household when the economy is still likely to be weakened.
Complete gridlock will include not only the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the payroll-tax cut from the Obama stimulus but also a sharp increase in the Alternative Minimum Tax and cuts to national-security and domestic programs, prompted by Congress's failure of last summer to reach a deficit deal. Together, the changes would reduce the deficit by more than 60 percent in the 2014 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, but would inflict obvious pain.
With Mitt Romney in the White House and a Republican House, the uncertainty might be less. Unless Congressional Republicans and a defeated Mr. Obama somehow came to a deal, they could wait for him to leave town before retroactively extending the Bush tax cuts, so long as they could win over a small number of Democratic senators. Republicans could likewise undo the Pentagon cuts.
To hold down the deficit, Mr. Romney and Congress could then cut domestic programs, including Medicaid, more sharply than Mr. Obama has. But recent history -- both Mr. Reagan's administration and the second Mr. Bush's -- suggests that Republicans would probably not find enough spending cuts to offset their tax cuts and instead would accept larger deficits.
In the short term, it might not matter. The deficit is falling already, as the economy slowly emerges from the financial crisis, and foreigners remain happy to lend money to Washington at very low interest rates. Many economists think the state of the economy, not the deficit, is the bigger immediate problem.
Eventually, though, the deficit will start growing again, and sharply. The baby boomers are retiring, and health care is getting only more expensive. The era of falling taxes and growing benefits cannot last forever. The fiscal chaos that awaits at the end of this year is a preview of the choices to come.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- House Republicans return from spring recess next week to face the difficult -- some say impossible -- task of filling the gaping holes in the House-passed budget, including figuring out how to slash income tax rates without costing the government any money and finding nearly $3 trillion in savings from entitlement programs over the next decade.
The budget, which passed the House last month and has since become a central focus of the presidential campaign, has faced blistering criticism for steep cuts to federal programs, including a blast from President Obama, who called it "thinly veiled social Darwinism."
But the deep reductions that Mr. Obama spelled out for higher education, medical research, crime fighting and Head Start are more supposition than reality until the details are filled out. And the charge that such cuts would merely pay for still more tax cuts for the rich is expressly denied by Republican leaders who foresee no change in revenue under the budget.
Now the real work begins. Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the House Ways and Means chairman, will hold meetings with Republican the rank and file next week to map out an overhaul of the tax code that strips it down to just two personal income tax rates -- 25 percent and 10 percent -- and a 25 percent corporate income tax rate, and to pay for it by curtailing or ending tax deductions and credits.
A half-dozen committees will begin drafting legislation to meet a budget-mandated $261 billion in savings over the next decade to stave off scheduled across-the-board cuts to the military in January. First up will be the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, with a bill to curb medical malpractice suits and save the government $39.7 billion over 10 years. On Wednesday, the Financial Services Committee will vote on legislation to save $35 billion over a decade by eliminating a fund designed to prevent future bank bailouts, ending a foreclosure reduction effort, slicing $4.9 billion from the federal flood insurance program, and putting the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under Congressional control and cutting its budget by $5.4 billion.
Also on Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee will draft a measure to save $53 billion over 10 years, in part by grabbing back overpayments for subsidized insurance purchases under the new health care law and by requiring parents to present a Social Security number to claim child care tax credits.
The Agriculture Committee must slice $33.2 billion from its programs, most likely focusing on nutrition and food stamps. The House Energy and Commerce Committee must find nearly $100 billion in savings when it meets in two weeks. Much of it will come from repealing parts of the president's health care law and curbing medical liability lawsuits.
Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, said: "President Obama's own secretary of defense has said the defense sequester would 'hollow out' our armed forces. We have a responsibility to show a better, smarter option."
Even with these efforts, critics say the budget is far less groundbreaking than its supporters and opponents say it is. For all his big numbers on spending reductions and tax changes, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, included few details or instructions to make them happen.
The attainability of his deficit reduction targets are "impossible to know unless you start to describe what kind of cuts are really required," said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who supports the ambition of the budget but faults its partisan tilt.
For instance, to meet its deficit reduction targets, the House budget calls for nearly $1.9 trillion in savings from entitlement programs outside Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, so called other mandatory spending, but it instructs committee chairmen to draft legislation securing a tiny fraction of that amount.
The budget describes significant changes to Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. Medicare would be transformed from a government-run insurance program to a menu of private insurance plans subsidized by the government. Medicaid and food stamps would be converted to block grants to the states, which would be allowed to impose work requirements and time limits. But nowhere are the relevant committees mandated to actually draft the legislation to make any of that happen. Mr. Camp has already indicated he has no intention of drafting Medicare legislation that has no chance of becoming law. And Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, has already said he has no intention of passing a budget this year.
The House Appropriations Committee would have to find cuts from domestic discretionary programs through 2022 totaling $1.44 trillion below program growth through inflation, 25 percent, or $1.2 trillion -- 21 percent -- below caps agreed to last summer, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research organization. But that cutting would not kick in until 2014, when appropriators would have to cut domestic spending by 24 percent. For fiscal 2013, the budget that must be finished before the election, the cut is a more manageable 9.8 percent below inflation growth and 7.5 percent below agreed-upon levels.
The two biggest question marks are on a tax overhaul and the black box of "other mandatory" cuts. On taxes, collapsing the current six tax brackets into two, with the highest bracket dropping to 25 percent from 35 percent, would cost the Treasury revenue totaling $4.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Democrats and some tax experts say that paying for that with loophole closings cannot be done, unless Republicans plan to gut tax programs for the working poor, like the earned income credit.
But Sage Eastman, a spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Camp was eager to prove them wrong. Donald Marron, a former Bush administration economist and president of the Tax Policy Center, tallied $7.7 trillion in "tax expenditures" over the next five years.
"I'll say emphatically we can do it," Mr. Eastman said.

Abstract: In perhaps the most developed plan, the largest publicly traded diamond company, Harry Winston, is working with a Swiss asset manager to create a $250 million fund that is set to begin buying half-carat to six-carat diamonds this year with money from institutional investors like hedge funds and pensions.

Full text: Could diamonds be the new gold?
A small number of investment professionals around the world are competing behind the scenes to turn the gem into a commodity that would be available to investors in the way that gold has been traded through funds on exchanges.
Trading in diamonds is limited in the United States to the retail market for engagement rings and other jewelry and the back-room bargaining among merchants in places like Manhattan's diamond district on West 47th Street.
But financial industry players in New York, London, Switzerland and Israel say there is an opening to provide reliable public access for the growing universe of investors who have been willing to sink money into funds backed by exotic assets like palladium and silver. Those players have turned a gold-backed fund, the SPDR Gold Shares, into one of the world's largest exchange-traded funds, with a market capitalization of about $70 billion.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing a proposal to create the first diamond-backed exchange-traded fund, which would be available to anyone with an online trading account. It would buy one-carat diamonds and store them in a vault in Antwerp, Belgium, providing daily values with an as-yet-unnamed index. The fund is backed by a New York company, IndexIQ, that has brought 14 other exchange-traded funds to market in the last five years.
In addition, Martin Rapaport, who founded a popular gauge of diamond pricing, said recently that he was preparing to release a "few" products this year that would be available to retail investors. He declined to describe them.
In perhaps the most developed plan, the largest publicly traded diamond company, Harry Winston, is working with a Swiss asset manager to create a $250 million fund that is set to begin buying half-carat to six-carat diamonds this year with money from institutional investors like hedge funds and pensions. The fund would own diamonds bought and sold in Harry Winston stores and sell shares to private investors.
"Diamond is the last uncommoditized commodity, and so it's drawing in many organizations," said Edahn Golan, the editor in chief of IDEX Online, a provider of diamond industry data. "I assume that by the end of this year there will be a bunch of them out."
Investment professionals say that retail investors should be very careful, given the difficulty of establishing consistent prices for diamonds of widely different cuts and quality, and the traditional secrecy of the industry. The diamond market has also been tarnished by accounts of stones mined in war-torn parts of Africa, though both the IndexIQ fund and the Harry Winston fund have committed to avoiding such so-called blood diamonds.
"There would be a huge learning curve for me to be comfortable trading something like this," said Matt Zeman, a commodity trader at Kingsview Financial.
The diamond industry can only dream of replicating the success of gold companies. Gold investments, rather than jewelry, have become the primary driver of growth in the industry, according to the World Gold Council, pushing annual production to around $100 billion, Citigroup analysts say. By comparison, the annual production of polished diamonds is about $18 billion, Citi said.
The allure of diamonds is that, like gold, they are easily authenticated and long lasting. But unlike gold, and oil, diamonds have not had much price volatility, in part because they have not been touched by large flows of speculative money, though that could change if the new efforts succeed.
"It makes sense that investors would have interest in diamond-backed funds," said Joung Park, a commodities analyst at Morningstar.
This is not the first rush to bring diamonds to Wall Street. When inflation was soaring in the late 1970s, the search for stable stores of value led to a few legitimate, and many illegitimate, operations that lured retail investors into diamonds. One, started by the financial company Thomson McKinnon, sold shares privately and was wound down when interest rates plummeted, taking the value of diamonds with them.
The market long repelled many investment professionals because of the 80 percent to 90 percent market share of production held by De Beers, the global diamond giant. That began to ebb when De Beers relaxed its grip on the supply channels in 2000, and subsequently sold some of its mines and inventory, reducing its market share to 40 percent today, according to Citi.
"Before De Beers gave up its monopoly, the investment case was pretty difficult," said Peter Laib, chairman of the Swiss firm Diamond Asset Advisors, which is working with Harry Winston on a diamond fund. "Why would I start a fund where the price is controlled by one company?"
The end of the monopoly still left perhaps the biggest barrier to investment: the lack of uniform standards for diamond pricing. Unlike gold, which is sold for essentially the same price in financial markets around the world, diamonds have been sold mostly through bazaarlike areas like the Manhattan district and the Antwerp Diamond Bourse, which advertises that a "binding handclasp fixes price, delivery and conditions."
"The diamond industry suffers from an image which sadly is rather well deserved, which is hiding behind smoke and mirrors," said Charles Wyndham, the London-based founder of Polished Prices, a diamond pricing company.
Many market participants argue that diamonds are not a commodity but unique items that need to be evaluated individually. But Wyndham, Rapaport and IDEX are competing to prove that wrong by creating standardized pricing. IDEX has an hourly updated index of asking prices from its online database, weighted with the 15 most popular varieties.
The IDEX index is not the best gauge, Mr. Wyndham argues, because it relies on asking prices rather than actual transaction prices, as stock exchanges do. He has built the Polished Prices index, which is available on Bloomberg terminals, and uses selling prices the company receives from 20 wholesalers. He said he was working with a "major European financial institution" that is seeking to win regulatory approval in Europe for yet another diamond fund that could be available to the public.
Polished Prices hosted a conference in 2007 with dozens of finance industry professionals who considered how to make diamonds a regulated investment. Mr. Wyndham's partner, Richard Platt, said he thought then that a product would be available sooner.
"It's been difficult, but we're quite a long way down the road to getting there," Mr. Platt said.
Mr. Wyndham and Mr. Rapaport are critical of the only fund that is available to ordinary investors, the Diamond Circle Capital Fund, which listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2008. It collected roughly $50 million from investors and used it to buy stones, each worth at least a million dollars. Mr. Wyndham said the fund managers did not work out a system for pricing and eventually selling its holdings. Shares have dropped to less than $4.20 this week from around $10 in 2008.
Andrew Dawson, the fund administrator, said it recently underwent a management change and now has a better strategy with the new managers. The fund working with Harry Winston has devised a novel way of dealing with the problem of pricing. The manager in Switzerland will pay for the inventory in Harry Winston stores. The value of the diamonds will be determined after a customer buys a piece of jewelry containing the stones and a replacement stone is purchased through Harry Winston's supply chain. The fees for the fund will be similar to those of a hedge fund, with a 1.5 percent management fee and 20 percent of any increase in value.
The United States-based fund from IndexIQ advisers did not list its planned fee in the application it filed to the S.E.C. in March. Its other exchange-traded funds have fees around 1 percent annually and trade on the New York Stock Exchange's Arca exchange. Its biggest fund replicates hedge fund strategies and has attracted $200 million in assets. The S.E.C. does not comment on pending applications.
All the new sponsors make the same argument for what makes diamonds attractive to investors: while the supply of new diamonds is not expected to rise, the demand from India and China is expected to increase steadily. Brian Chen, a mining analyst at Citigroup, said "the fundamentals look so good in terms of supply and demand."
The Polished Prices index has fallen 2.2 percent this year, but risen 5.6 percent over the last year, and 56 percent since its inception in 2003.
But Ron Rowland, a mutual fund and exchange-traded fund adviser, and the founder of Capital Cities Asset Management, said that even if funds did begin, retail investors should approach with extreme caution.
"Stay away until you know exactly how it works, and can be sure it's acting like you think it will," he said. "It's going to be a difficult market to create."

Full text: Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian human rights lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has no affinity for the authorities in Iran, who she fears would have her arrested or worse if she returned home. But she has found herself standing with them in opposition to the onerous nuclear sanctions imposed on her country.
As representatives of Iran and six world powers prepared to resume negotiations on Iran's uranium enrichment activities this weekend in Istanbul, Ms. Ebadi said that the sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union were misdirected.
Although meant to pressure the Iranian government to compromise on its nuclear program, "the very stringent sanctions have really been a tremendous blow to people," Ms. Ebadi said in a telephone interview. "The people need these sanctions to be removed for a sustainable life."
The sanctions have contributed to acute shortages of foreign goods there, rising inflation and unemployment and a sharply devalued currency. Further deprivations loom, especially if a European Union ban on Iranian oil sales goes ahead as planned in less than three months.
In response to the sanctions, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been defiant, asserting that Iran will never stop enriching uranium in response to foreign demands. At the same time, he insists that Iran will never use its uranium stockpile to develop nuclear weapons, despite Western suspicions to the contrary. As for the economic pain in Iran caused by the sanctions, the ayatollah has said Iranians should take it as an opportunity to become more self-reliant and wean themselves off foreign goods.
Ms. Ebadi, 64, who was attending a conference in Minneapolis on Thursday and Friday, asserted that the Iranian government was not correct in saying that its nuclear energy program was popular among Iranians. While Iranians across the political spectrum say Iran has the legal right to develop nuclear energy, Ms. Ebadi said, many people are privately worried about the environmental risks of nuclear reactors, particularly in Iran's earthquake zones. She said there was no public discussion about this issue because the government had banned newspapers from reporting anything but the official position in recent years.
As for the nuclear negotiations, which were resumed after more than a year, Ms. Ebadi was not optimistic. "I hope the talks in Istanbul are fruitful, but the previous experiences proved that Iran was just buying time," she said.
Ms. Ebadi's opposition to the sanctions has not diminished the mutual antagonism between her and the Iranian government, which considers her one of the more annoying critical voices it cannot silence. She left Iran before the disputed 2009 election and ensuing crackdown on antigovernment protests, and has often spoken out about the repression of dissidents, women, religious minorities and others deemed a threat to the conservative Islamic establishment.
She became the first Iranian and first Muslim woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in 2003, for her work in advancing the rights of women in Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. A judge by training before Islamic clerics took control, she was stripped of that title because they deemed women unfit to be judges, and she was made a secretary in her own court. She quit.
Ms. Ebadi then developed her own law practice, representing dissidents and victims of child abuse, and later founded the Human Rights Defenders Center in Iran. Six years after she won the Nobel Peace Prize, the government confiscated her medal and bank accounts, accusing her of evading taxes on the award money and forcing her into exile. The medal was later returned.
She now spends most of her time traveling, attending conferences and lectures and discussing her books about Iran, "The Golden Cage" and "Iran Awakening." She said she had often received death threats that she attributes to Iranian government harassment.
"They only are doing this to scare me," she said. "They've always said they would come after me and kill me."

Abstract: Under the federal crop insurance program, farmers can buy insurance policies that cover poor yields, declines in prices or both.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The federal government could save about $1 billion a year by reducing the subsidies it pays to large farmers to cover much of the cost of their crop insurance, according to a report by Congressional auditors due to be released on Thursday.
The report raised the prospect of the government's capping the amount that farmers receive at $40,000 a year, much as the government caps payments in other farm programs. Any move to limit the subsidy, however, is likely to be opposed by rural lawmakers, who say the program provides a safety net for agriculture.
The report, by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, was requested by Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, as part of his efforts to cut government spending.
Under the federal crop insurance program, farmers can buy insurance policies that cover poor yields, declines in prices or both. The insurance is obtained through private companies, but the federal government pays about 62 percent of the premiums, plus administrative expenses.
The crop insurance subsidy, according to the G.A.O. report, ballooned to $7.3 billion last year from $951 million in 2000, or about $1.2 billion adjusted for inflation. A Congressional Budget Office study cited in the report estimates that the premium subsidy will cost $39 billion from 2012 to 2016, about $7.8 billion a year.
Unlike other farm programs that have income or payment limits, crop insurance payments have no such restrictions, so farmers can get millions in subsidies regardless of their income. The G.A.O. said a cap last year would have affected about 4 percent of farmers in the program, who accounted for about a third of the premium subsidies and were mostly associated with large farms.
"High premium subsidies have hurt small and beginning farmers because the subsidies themselves have distorted the market," Mr. Coburn said. "For instance, high subsidies have artificially increased the value of land and have created other barriers to entry and expansion."
Craig Cox, vice president for agriculture and natural resources at the Environmental Working Group, a research group in Washington, said the report's findings were startling.
"This has huge implications for the farm bill now under consideration," Mr. Cox said about a major agriculture policy measure taking shape. He said the government had moved "from a system of direct payments to farmers where there are income restrictions and payment caps to a world without any restrictions on how much you can get in these insurance subsidies."
"This means more subsidies going to large farmers and more cost to the taxpayers," he added.
Agriculture interests say they oppose any changes to the crop insurance program.
"We think it works just fine," said Steve Wellman, president of the American Soybean Association. "We are certainly willing to do our fair share to help reduce spending, and we are doing that in other areas, like eliminating direct payments. But it doesn't make sense to make changes to a program that has been successful and critical to farming operations."
Farm programs, including crop insurance, have come under scrutiny with increasing pressure to reduce the federal deficit and with farm income at record levels. The Agriculture Department estimates that net farm income was a record $101 billion last year, according to the G.A.O report. In addition, the report said, the department's data shows that farmers' top five years in income over the past three decades have occurred since 2004.
President Obama and many Republicans, including Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who leads the Budget Committee, have proposed changes in the crop insurance program, including limiting payments or lowering the amounts that the government covers in premiums.
But lawmakers on the House and Senate Agriculture Committees are opposed to any adjustments in the crop insurance program. The chairwoman of the Senate committee, Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, whose panel is working on the 2012 farm bill, said she disagreed with proposals to change crop insurance. The House committee chairman, Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, was more direct in his opposition. Mr. Lucas said that any crop insurance cuts would "threaten the integrity of the program itself."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said Wednesday that the lackluster trajectory of the economic recovery might require the Fed to continue its efforts to bolster growth even beyond the end of 2014.
In a speech in Manhattan, Ms. Yellen offered a rejoinder to recent remarks by other Fed officials and investors warning that the Fed would need to raise interest rates well before the end of 2014 to prevent an increase in the rate of inflation.
She indicated that the Fed's leadership, including the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, remained firmly committed to the central bank's efforts to suppress interest rates and reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers.
"I anticipate that the U.S. economy will continue to recover only gradually and that labor market slack will remain substantial for a number of years to come," Ms. Yellen said, according to an advance copy of her prepared remarks.
She said that by some measures the Fed was not doing enough.
"In effect there has been a significant shortfall in the overall amount of monetary policy stimulus since early 2009" relative to those standards, she said in the speech, delivered to the Money Marketeers club of New York University.
She did not call for a new round of stimulus, however, arguing instead that the shortfall might provide justification for extending current efforts.
The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and it has sought to further reduce long-term interest rates through the purchase of more than $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities. It said last fall that it planned to maintain both of those policies until at least late 2014.
As the economy has shown signs of faster growth in recent months, some have warned that the Fed was in danger of pushing growth past a sustainable level.
Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said this week that the Fed might need to begin raising rates by the end of this year.
But Mr. Kocherlakota and his allies form a distinct minority on the Fed's policy-making board, the Federal Open Market Committee. Ms. Yellen, by contrast, hews much closer to the views of Mr. Bernanke, who leads the majority.
Her speech offered an unusually transparent account of how she is balancing various factors in making her decisions about monetary policy.
She said that one economic model used by the Fed suggested that interest rates should be held near zero until late 2015. While others have suggested an earlier increase might be appropriate, she said there still might be reasons to wait, including the insufficiency of current policy and the risk that the economic recovery might falter.
Ms. Yellen was careful to note that the Fed's decisions would depend on actual economic conditions. If growth were faster than expected, it might become necessary to retreat; if slower, it might become necessary for the Fed to do more.
Her frank account is part of the Fed's commitment to increased transparency, but it also reflects the central bank's current dependence on effective communication. The longer the Fed can convince investors that it will maintain its current policies, the longer interest rates will rest at their current, historically low levels.
The Fed could convince investors, as it has until now, by continually expanding its stimulus campaign.
But Ms. Yellen said nothing about doing more, reflecting the reality that the Fed was unlikely to announce new measures unless the economy faltered. And in the absence of new measures, the Fed's effectiveness rests on the quality of its oratory.

Abstract: To many, energy efficiency has become the "Fifth Fuel" -- after coal, petroleum, nuclear power and renewables like wind and solar -- and an important way to address environmental concerns like global warming. Retailers invested more in energy efficiency during the recession to offset declines in consumer spending, take advantage of state and federal tax incentives and meet demands from shareholders to cut costs.

Full text: FOR most people, talking about commercial air filters is a great way to end a conversation. To Charlie Brantl and Bob Devine, it is an invitation to an hourlong discussion.
They are engineers, in charge of finding ways to conserve energy and reduce waste at the Mall of America south of Minneapolis, the country's largest shopping and entertainment complex. And they talk excitedly about everything related to saving energy, including skylights, low-flush toilets and, yes, commercial air filters.
Their enthusiasm is a prime reason the Mall of America, now in its 20th year, can claim to continually reduce costs through conservation. But it is a complicated process because the mall is not just large, but also composed of hundreds of enterprises -- stores, restaurants and an amusement park. And it is heated not conventionally but by skylights, electric lights and the body heat of 45 million visitors annually.
Still, because the Mall of America is so vast -- 4.2 million square feet and growing, a space that could fit seven Yankee Stadiums -- companies with energy savings to sell clamor to have Mr. Brantl and Mr. Devine test and, they hope, order their products. As a result, the mall has become a proving ground for the most energy-efficient and reasonably priced technology.
"We get calls about new technology and dig into it and see if it is smoke and mirrors," Mr. Brantl said, adding that many products he sees do not meet his employer's requirement that investments pay for themselves in energy savings within four years. "We only purchase what we've tested."
The Mall of America is among the many companies investing more in energy efficiency. For years, "conservation was sometimes seen as a penalty, a heavy cost, a cutting-back, a reduction in living standards, a form of self-denial," Daniel Yergin wrote in his book "The Quest: Energy, Security and the Remaking of the Modern World."
That view has changed, he and others say, because developing nations are consuming more of the world's resources, leading to higher costs for all in a sluggish economy. To many, energy efficiency has become the "Fifth Fuel" -- after coal, petroleum, nuclear power and renewables like wind and solar -- and an important way to address environmental concerns like global warming.
But unlike wind turbines, solar panels and other technologies that increase supply (or replace dirtier energy), conservation reduces demand, which can be more difficult to calculate and justify financially.
"Energy efficiency is a negative," said Ben Finkelor, the executive director of the Energy Efficiency Center at the University of California, Davis. "It's easier to say how many kilowatts we produced. Calculating the kilowatt avoided is much harder."
Energy conservation got its first lift after the oil shocks of the 1970s, and some of the measures taken by President Jimmy Carter have worked. The United States uses only half as much energy for the same economic output as four decades ago, Mr. Yergin said. And while the economy has almost tripled in size, adjusted for inflation, total energy use has grown only about 30 percent, he said. President Obama has made energy efficiency a priority as well. Last year, he announced the Better Buildings Initiative, setting a national target of improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings by 20 percent by 2020. If met, that goal would reduce the energy bills of American businesses by $40 billion a year. Many industries and service providers have embraced efficiency. Hotels are using fewer towels, banks are going paperless, and grocery stores are rewarding customers who use their own bags.
Retailers and shopping malls, though, provide one of the best chances to save energy, Mr. Finkelor said -- and not just through the consumer energy-saving gadgets sold at home improvement stores and departments. Retailers themselves use about 20 percent of the energy consumed by all commercial businesses, and they are the fastest-growing commercial category of energy users, according to the Energy Department.
Retailers invested more in energy efficiency during the recession to offset declines in consumer spending, take advantage of state and federal tax incentives and meet demands from shareholders to cut costs. Wal-Mart, for instance, has been painting store roofs white to reflect sunlight and reduce the use of air-conditioning. It is also capturing rain in storage tanks for flushing toilets and other uses that do not require potable water, and installing LED lights in parking lots to cut energy use by more than 50 percent and maintenance by more than 30 percent.
"The bottom line for us is we're really committed to our mission to save our customers money, which means preserving everyday low prices, which means having everyday low costs," said Kim Saylors-Laster, the vice president of energy at Wal-Mart, which aims for a three-year payback on its investments in energy efficiency projects.
The Mall of America is installing more efficient air filters in its 33 mammoth cooling units. The new filters eliminate the need for more than 3,000 pre-filters to be changed each year, which reduces waste. And because the new filters are thinner, they require less power to push air through them.
Macy's has cut its energy bill by 30 percent since 2002 by, among other things, adding sensors that automatically turn off lights in stockrooms, turning off signs at night and installing one million LED lights, according to Bill Lyon, vice president of energy management. Macy's centrally schedules and controls its lighting and air-conditioning and monitors energy use to spot waste. "Twenty years ago, we'd get information on energy use in a report at the end of the month," said Daniel Butler, vice president of retail operations at the National Retail Federation. "Now, we can quickly address it in a day."
Challenges remain. Retailers with older stores must spend more to retrofit them. Mall operators are also trying to move away from leases that include energy costs because tenants have less incentive to conserve. Instead, they are installing meters in individual stores to track use and having the tenants pay their own energy bills, encouraging them to save energy, too.
Retailers are also signing long-term deals with utilities and, when possible, installing solar panels and wind turbines. Wal-Mart, Kohl's, Safeway and Macy's are among the top 20 producers of clean energy on their premises, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Wal-Mart, the country's largest retailer, is the most aggressive. In 2005, it set a target of using 100 percent renewable energy. To hold itself accountable, Wal-Mart now publishes a quarterly figure to chart progress. In the first quarter, it produced 4 percent of its own energy and bought an additional 18 percent of green power from the grid. (A spokesman explained that "sometimes our size and scale can work against us.")
Still, the company says, hundreds of locations meet as much as 30 percent of their power needs with renewable energy. In California, the company aims to put solar panels on 75 percent of its stores by the end of 2013. It says the panels will provide 20 to 30 percent of each location's electricity needs. In Texas, Wal-Mart buys wind energy to provide up to 15 percent of the total energy for more than 360 stores.
Contracting for clean energy "is sort of the win-win for retailers," said Michael Bernier, senior manager in the national tax group at Ernst & Young, who helps companies find tax credits for renewable energy. "You get the benefit from going green, you turn electricity to a fixed cost from a variable cost, and in very attractive states you can often get immediate cost savings."

Full text: RIO DE JANEIRO
THE global oil industry has long been a male-dominated bastion, represented in the popular imagination by real gulf sheiks and fictional swaggerers like J. R. Ewing in "Dallas." But an exception to this rule has emerged in Brazil, Latin America's rising oil power, where women now occupy the most powerful positions in the nation's booming energy industry.
In a matter of weeks this year, Maria das Gracas Foster, a longtime chemical engineer, rose to the top job at Petrobras, Brazil's state-controlled oil company, and Magda Chambriard was nominated to lead the National Petroleum Agency, which regulates Brazil's oil sector.
Placing women in such commanding positions is a priority of President Dilma Rousseff, the first woman to lead Brazil. Ms. Rousseff, who visited the United States this week, is a former energy minister who headed Petrobras's board for seven years during the administration of her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
"She knows the industry very well, and can be extremely demanding," Ms. Foster said in an interview here of Ms. Rousseff, an economist about whom tales of browbeating of subordinates are legend, giving Brazilian comedians ample material for skits. "When she calls, I need to have the answer on the tip of my tongue," Ms. Foster said.
There aren't many examples of women rising high in the energy industry. Within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Diezani Alison-Madueke, the oil minister of Nigeria, is a woman. In the United States, Lynn Elsenhans was Sunoco's chief executive for four years before stepping down this year. The chief executive of Pertamina, Malaysia's oil company, and the head of Schlumberger Asia, a branch of the oil-field services company, are also women.
But running Petrobras, charged with exploiting vast new oil discoveries deep offshore, is another matter. The company, created 58 years ago and led in its early years by Walter Link, an American oilman, is investing by some estimates more in inflation-adjusted terms than NASA did in the 1960s to put a man on the moon, to produce oil from reserves found under miles of water, rock, sand and salt.
"The program that Petrobras is launching is both critical for Brazil and the global market," said Daniel Yergin, author of "The Quest," a new book about the international energy industry. "She sees the big picture and, at the same time, pays close attention to the details," he said of its new head. "She will quickly become known as one of the most important people in the world oil industry, and certainly the most important and influential woman in the business worldwide."
If Petrobras is able to meet its own ambitious production goals by the 2020s, Brazil could catapult past Latin America's oil powerhouses, Mexico and Venezuela, into the top ranks of global producers. Ventures with Petrobras are already making Rio's economy sizzle, with droves of foreign oilmen driving up rents in exclusive seaside districts like Ipanema and Leblon.
Ms. Foster, on the other hand, still lives in an apartment in Copacabana, a less lustrous area hemmed in by big apartment blocks and hillside favelas, or slums. She stands out as an anomaly in the oil patch, not just as the mother of two adult children but because she chooses not even to own a car. Taxi drivers in Copacabana often call out to her with a cheer, "the lady with the fuel," trying to get her business.
She was born 58 years ago, about the time Petrobras was conceived to reduce Brazil's dependence on foreign oil. In the 1950s, her parents moved from the interior of the neighboring state of Minas Gerais to Rio, where they lived in Morro do Adeus, a poor hillside area that now is part of Complexo do Alemao, a collection of favelas occupied by Brazilian security forces.
As an 8-year-old, she contributed to her family's meager income by working as a trash recycler, collecting discarded cans and paper. She said she had also earned money by writing and reading letters for her neighbors, a family of immigrants from Portugal.
After attending public schools here, she became an intern at Petrobras while studying chemical engineering at the Federal Fluminense University. Then she was lured away into postgraduate studies in nuclear engineering, at a time when Brazil was developing its nuclear energy capacity. But she balked at the prospect of spending five years in Germany to delve further into the field, so she returned to Petrobras. Once back at the company, she never left, rising through a series of management posts and obtaining an M.B.A. at Fundacao Getulio Vargas, an elite Brazilian university.
In 1998, while working for a Petrobras unit involved in a pipeline to import natural gas from Bolivia, she met Ms. Rousseff, then an obscure energy official in Rio Grande do Sul, a southern Brazilian state. Ms. Foster, a supporter of the leftist Workers Party, which has been in power in Brazil since 2002, saw eye-to-eye ideologically with Ms. Rousseff, a Marxist guerrilla in her youth; they both are now committed to welcoming foreign investment in Brazil's oil industry and exposing Petrobras to market forces.
When the former president, Mr. da Silva, appointed Ms. Rousseff to his cabinet as Brazil's energy minister, she named Ms. Foster as one of her top aides in Brasilia, the capital. After serving in that position for two years, she chose to return to more hands-on responsibilities at Petrobras. "My business," she said, "is oil and gas."
Shares in Petrobras jumped nearly 4 percent on the day in January she was named as chief executive, replacing the economist Jose Sergio Gabrielli. But important challenges await her.
Already, she is facing the scrutiny of Brazil's media, arguably Latin America's most aggressive in questioning the power structures at large companies like Petrobras. The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported in 2010 that a company controlled by Ms. Foster's husband, Colin Foster, a Briton who has long lived in Brazil, had won numerous contracts since 2007 worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to supply Petrobras with electronic equipment.
Petrobras has denied any wrongdoing, contending that none of the acquisitions was carried out by the unit, gas and energy, under Ms. Foster's command.
In addition, a company spokeswoman said in a written reply to questions about these contracts that Petrobras had made only "small purchases" from 2005 to 2010 from Mr. Foster's company.
The company's shares have slumped more than 30 percent over the last year as concerns persist about a range of issues, from delays in procuring ships from Brazilian shipyards for Petrobras's offshore operations to the costs associated with selling gasoline domestically at relatively low prices and importing refined products from abroad.
The most pressing challenge of all at Petrobras, perhaps, may be in meeting expectations of raising output to an estimated 4.5 million barrels a day, from 2.3 million. Doing so will require guiding Petrobras, Latin America's largest company, past equipment bottlenecks, the development of complex new drilling technologies and concerns over spills at offshore fields.
"We're working to get there," Ms. Foster said about meeting Petrobras's output goals.
Naming Ms. Foster to lead Petrobras is just one example of Ms. Rousseff's push to place women in the highest levels of government since taking office last year. Her 38-member cabinet includes 10 women in ministerial posts, including her chief of staff, Gleisi Hoffmann, and Ideli Salvatti, who manages the administration's delicate relations with a Congress of uncertain loyalties.
While Ms. Rousseff maintains a high approval rating of more than 70 percent, reactions to her nominations have been mixed. Evangelical Christian leaders recently lashed out at Eleonora Menicucci, the minister for women's affairs, over her support of abortion in cases of rape or in which a woman's health is at risk. And in 2011, the defense minister, Nelson Jobim, questioned Ms. Salvatti, the minister of institutional relations, calling her "very weak" in published remarks. Ms. Rousseff responded by quickly removing Mr. Jobim from his post, replacing him with Celso Amorim, a former minister of foreign affairs.
Ms. Foster said she was well aware of the challenges awaiting her as a woman leading an oil company with 82,100 employees in a male-dominated industry. She said she welcomed a certain degree of confrontation, even if it took place in the executive suite.
"The best people to work with me are those who interrupt me, even question me," she said. "If I'm speaking loudly, speak louder. When you discuss, you have an environment that's more intense, that's actually warmer, where you arrive at the best solutions for the company."

Abstract: Chinese leaders are trying to deflate a real estate bubble by banning most purchases of second and third homes, a policy that has brought an abrupt slowdown in residential housing construction, with the exception of public housing projects, a national priority to provide more affordable housing.

Full text: HONG KONG -- After months of weakness in overseas demand, especially from Europe, Chinese exports finally seem to be recovering. But now the country's domestic economy is looking a little less robust.
Exports surged last month, helping to produce an unexpected trade surplus of $5.35 billion in March, according to government data released Tuesday.
But imports grew lethargically, a warning sign for a domestic economy where government policies have aimed to deliberately deflate a real estate bubble and as a growing number of wealthy Chinese appear to be moving money out of the country.
Slowing domestic demand is a concern in any economy, except when deliberately engineered to slow inflation, as is the case to some extent in China. But the Chinese government faces a particularly difficult balancing act because strong economic growth at home has been its main claim to political legitimacy.
Qu Hongbin, a China economist in the Hong Kong offices of HSBC, said that the trade figures added up to a clear signal. "The underlying message is that domestic demand is still slowing," he wrote in a research report.
Chinese officials have been uncertain about how much to stimulate the economy in response to the weakening of domestic demand, particularly as inflation remains a problem. Consumer prices were up 3.6 percent in March from a year earlier, according to official data. And inflation might actually be worse than that, as economists inside and outside China say that the official index represents as little as half of actual inflation because of methodological problems. Aware of that criticism, China's National Bureau of Statistics is looking for ways to improve its data collection on prices.
Despite the inflationary forces, real estate developers and other corporate borrowers have been pressing for an easing of government lending restrictions, complaining that the economy has already slowed too much. But Tang Min, a senior economic policy adviser to the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, expressed caution in a rare column Tuesday in People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper.
"Due to the severe situation of rising prices, there still cannot be a substantial easing of the monetary policy," he wrote. "At the same time, we also see that there are inevitable factors behind rising prices, so there is no need to adopt an overly tight monetary policy."
Various economic statistics are due from China this week, most notably the growth figure for the first quarter, to be released Friday.
Private economists are predicting that China will post growth of 8 to 9 percent in the first quarter -- formidable by international standards, but slower than the double-digit growth the country has enjoyed for most of the last decade.
China's trade surplus has gradually narrowed over the last several years, as economic weakness in Europe and North America has hurt Chinese exports while soaring auto sales in China have produced a boom in oil imports.
The International Monetary Fund has been forecasting in recent years that China's medium-term current-account surplus -- the trade surplus plus net earnings on overseas investments -- would rise again to 7 percent of Chinese economic output as economies in the West recover. But China's current-account surplus was a little less than 3 percent last year.
The I.M.F. is widely expected to reduce the medium-term forecast to 5 or 6 percent when it issues its World Economic Outlook in the coming days, said Eswar Prasad, a former head of the I.M.F.'s China division who is now the Tolani senior professor of trade policy at Cornell.
The I.M.F., the United States and other Western nations in recent years have periodically accused China of deliberately keeping its currency, the renminbi, weak as a way to stimulate exports.
But shrinkage in China's current-account surplus, notwithstanding the modest trade surplus in March, is making it harder for the I.M.F. and others to press for China to allow further appreciation of the renminbi, Mr. Prasad said.
The result has been a shift by many international economists toward encouraging China to address internal imbalances like its heavy reliance on investment instead of consumer spending. But weak growth in imports could be a signal of longer-term difficulties in China's domestic economy.
Chinese leaders are trying to deflate a real estate bubble by banning most purchases of second and third homes, a policy that has brought an abrupt slowdown in residential housing construction, with the exception of public housing projects, a national priority to provide more affordable housing.
Many Chinese exporters have been looking to the country's domestic market in response to tepid growth overseas for the last several years, but are finding the Chinese market an even bigger challenge now.
"The buyers are very aggressive in asking for price discounts and the right to return unsold products," said Peter Chen, the sales manager at the Hua Hai Toys factory, which makes water pistols in Chenghai, China. "At least our overseas customers have never asked to return products back to us."
The recovery in Chinese exports last month, up 8.9 percent from a year earlier, suggests that a long-predicted shift in manufacturing to other Asian nations has not yet taken place on a meaningful scale.
Blue-collar wages have nearly tripled in the last seven years or so in China, but heavy investments in ports, highways, telecommunications and other infrastructure have helped to offset the extra labor costs by making it less expensive and easier to ship goods to markets.
A study released last month by Panjiva, a New York consulting company that advises 2,000 mostly American importers on how to locate overseas suppliers, found that slightly more than half of the importers interviewed had expressed a desire to increase purchases from other Asian nations, notably India, Vietnam and Thailand.
But that has not yet translated into shifts in outsourcing.
"When it comes to moving manufacturing beyond China, there's still more talk than action," Josh Green, the chief executive of Panjiva, wrote in an e-mail on Monday.
One of the biggest mysteries now in China involves the strength of domestic investment, for which the government will release figures late this week. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, is expected to release in the next week its quarterly figure for changes in the country's foreign exchange reserves, the best proxy for how much cash is flowing in or out of the country.
There have been many signs the last few months, although most are anecdotal, that capital is starting to flow out of China. But foreign exchange reserves, at $3.18 trillion, give the country ample ability to counter any run on the renminbi.
Bankers and lawyers say that Chinese companies doing initial public offerings abroad increasingly want to keep the proceeds offshore instead of repatriating them to China. Chinese businesses have been more aggressive in making offshore acquisitions, particularly related to natural resources, although this has been partly driven by government policy.
Also, wealthy Chinese have been pouring huge sums into real estate in havens like Hong Kong and New York, even as real estate prices tumble in mainland China. They have also become very active users of a wide range of offshore trusts and tax shelters in places like the Cayman Islands, far from the Chinese tax authorities and fraud investigators.
Many of the new financial structures being created are so aggressive and creative in hiding assets from the Chinese government that "10 years ago, they'd have gotten shot for it," said James Corbett, partner of Kobre & Kim, a London law firm that specializes in tracing assets.

Full text: DHAKA, Bangladesh -- A labor activist who was arrested two years ago for his role in protests against low wages in Bangladesh's garment industry was found murdered outside this city last week, labor rights advocates and the police said on Monday.
The killing of the activist, Aminul Islam, marks a morbid turn in the often tense relations between labor groups, on one side, and Bangladesh's extensive garment industry, which makes clothes for Western companies like Walmart, Tommy Hilfiger and H&M. In 2010, Mr. Islam, a former textile factory worker, was arrested and, he and other labor activists said, was tortured by the police and intelligence services.
Mr. Islam, 40, was last seen alive on Wednesday near Ashulia, a garment-industry hub outside Dhaka. His tortured body was found on Thursday on the side of a road near a police station in Ghatail, 61 miles to the north, according to the police and labor activists.
Local police officials in Ghatail were unable to identify the body, so they photographed it and buried it. Later, Mr. Islam's brother Rafiqul saw pictures of the body in a national newspaper and identified him. The body was exhumed Monday afternoon and reburied later in the day in Mr. Islam's native village, Kaliakoir. He is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.
"We found several marks of wounds from his waist to his foot," Rafiqul Islam said in a telephone interview. "His big toes and his ankles were smashed."
The garment industry is Bangladesh's largest industrial employer, with 3.6 million workers. It has been gaining ground as a lower-cost alternative to the world's leading garment exporter China, where wages have been rising sharply. Bangladesh is now the second-largest apparel exporting nation with about $18 billion worth of clothes shipped abroad last year.
The industry has periodically been shaken by protests and clashes between workers and the police. But activists say the murder of Mr. Islam would represent a disturbing escalation in violence.
"We are aware of no recent case of a trade unionist being murdered in Bangladesh," said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a university-backed workplace monitoring group based in Washington. "There have been unionists killed in clashes with the police in the midst of protests, but no recent case of assassination. Thus, this represents a deterioration of an already grim labor rights situation in the country."
Workers and labor activists have complained that many Bangladeshi factories pay wages that are difficult to live on, especially given the country's 10 percent inflation rate. They have also criticized lax safety standards that have led to the deaths of dozens of workers in garment factory fires in recent years.
Still, in spite of the low wages, many workers, especially young women who make up 80 percent of employees, have flocked to garment factories, most of which are concentrated in and around Dhaka. They see the jobs as a way to supplement family incomes, many of which are still tied to subsistence farming in this country of 160 million.
Walmart and Tommy Hilfiger, in e-mail statements Monday, pledged their commitment to improving conditions for Bangladeshi workers. H&M did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Islam was an organizer for the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity, a group that has argued for higher pay and better working conditions. The group helped lead protests in 2010 after policy makers did not increase minimum wages in the garment industry as much as some workers' groups had wanted.
The government raised the minimum wage to 3,000 taka a month, about $36 at current exchange rates, from 1,662.50 taka -- the first increase since 2006. Labor leaders like Mr. Islam had demanded an increase to at least 5,000 taka a month, a figure that many factory owners had said would put them out of business.
In early 2010, the country's popular prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wazed, expressed sympathy for garment factory workers. But after the government agreed to raise minimum wages to 3,000 taka, she said that her government would not tolerate any more protests.
Soon after, the police arrested Mr. Islam, along with more than a dozen other workers and activists. Mr. Islam and several of his associates were charged with instigating riots -- accusations that he and the others denied. Criminal cases against him and two other senior labor leaders, Kalpona Akhter and Babul Akter, are pending.
On Monday, Mr. Akter, the president of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation, said Mr. Islam's killing was intended to scare other activists from protesting against the low wages and working conditions in the industry. But he and other activists said they would not back down and threatened to organize protests if the police did not arrest and prosecute the killers.
The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the industry's main trade group, called for a full investigation into Mr. Islam's death on Monday. In Washington, labor rights groups also called for an investigation and said the United States and multinational companies should put pressure on Bangladesh to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation.
Labor leaders have become targets around the world. Human Rights Watch says that more than 2,880 labor leaders have been murdered in Colombia since 1986. Labor unions in the United States pointed to those murders as a reason to block any trade deal with Colombia, but Congress nevertheless ratified a trade pact with Colombia last October.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Solidarity Center has protested what it says were the murders of six union activists in Guatemala -- all involved in that country's banana industry -- over the past 15 months.

Full text: As the nation's economy slowly recovers and income inequality emerges as a crucial issue in the presidential campaign, lawmakers are facing growing pressure to raise the minimum wage, which was last increased at the federal level to $7.25 an hour in July 2009.
State legislators in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois and elsewhere are pushing to raise the minimum wage above the federal level in their own states, arguing that $7.25 an hour is too meager for anyone to live on.
Massachusetts lawmakers are pushing for a big jump, with the Legislature's joint committee on labor approving a measure last month that would raise the minimum to $10 an hour, which would leapfrog Washington State, whose $9.04 minimum is the nation's highest.
Voters in Missouri may be asked to vote on a minimum wage referendum in November.
These moves are giving momentum to an effort to persuade Congress to embrace a higher national minimum wage. Some liberal and labor groups, capitalizing on the energy and message of the Occupy Wall Street movement, are urging Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, to head a Congressional effort to raise the federal minimum to $9.80 an hour by 2014.
Congress last passed a bill to increase minimum wages in 2006, phasing in higher rates over several years. Although some states raise the minimum wage automatically every year as the cost of living increases, federal law does not provides for an automatic increase.
Many Democrats and their labor allies say the time is right to push for another increase, and not just because it is hard to live on the $15,080 a year earned by a person working full time at minimum wage. They say a public debate now over the merits of increasing wages is bound to put many Republicans on the defensive during an election year and would encourage low-income Americans -- an important part of the Democratic base -- to go to the polls this November.
"It's always good to surface an issue that captures voters' enthusiasm and distinguishes the bad guys and the good guys," said Jen Kern, minimum wage campaign coordinator at the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers.
The business community is not at all happy about these developments and has warned President Obama, Democratic lawmakers and labor groups that with weak job growth, the time is definitely not right to raise the minimum wage.
"It's a classic election-year ploy to make the Democrats look like they're protecting low-income workers," said Randal K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor issues at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "I think it's well understood that raising the minimum wage hurts workers on the lower end of the pay scale in that it does kill jobs."
But backers of a higher minimum wage disagree on the economics, pointing to studies that found that an increase in minimum wages did not result in a reduction in jobs. Ms. Kern argued that raising the minimum wage would even stimulate the economy. "You ask business why they're not hiring. They say it's because no one is buying anything," she said. "Well, a higher minimum wage would give people more money to spend."
In 2010, 1.8 million hourly workers earned exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, according to federal data. About 2.5 million had wages below the minimum, in part because of exemptions under the law for certain categories of workers like many students.
Analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research organization, suggests that raising the federal minimum wage to $9.80 would lift pay for more than 28 million Americans, increase the gross domestic product by more than $25 billion and create the equivalent of more than 100,000 full-time jobs.
Advocates for a higher wage note that the issue receives strong public support. In a Quinnipiac University poll released last week, 78 percent of New Yorkers polled supported an increase, while 20 percent opposed it. Even Republicans favored an increase, 53 percent to 43 percent.
Ms. Kern's group along with other labor organizations like Interfaith Worker Justice, the Service Employees International Union and Restaurant Opportunities Centers United are mobilizing to press Congress to take action.
Supporters of a higher minimum are urging Mr. Harkin to break out the minimum wage provisions from a broader bill that would bolster workers' positions by strengthening numerous labor and safety laws.
Mr. Harkin said, "Establishing a reasonable minimum wage is the simplest thing we can do to help hard-working families make ends meet, join the middle class, and help move the economy forward." However, he is waiting to attract more support for a wage increase before proposing separate legislation.
Advocates for a higher minimum wage say they are disappointed that President Obama, after supporting an increase in the minimum to $9.50 during the 2008 campaign, has done little to advance the idea since he was elected.
"The Occupy movement put inequality on the radar," said Dan Cantor, the executive director of the New York State Working Families Party. "If we're serious as a society about poverty and work and decency, the minimum wage needs to eventually become a living wage."
Ms. Kern said Mr. Obama would be smart to champion the idea to mobilize his base, although a top A.F.L.-C.I.O. official said some Democrats in the White House and on Capitol Hill felt uneasy about pushing for a higher minimum wage when the job market was so wobbly.
Mitt Romney, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has called for letting the minimum wage rise with inflation, but has said he sees no need to increase the minimum wage right now.
Isabel Tartaglia, the owner and operator of five American Steakhouse restaurants in Connecticut, said that raising the minimum wage did a disservice to everyone. "If you raise the minimum wage, what happens is companies, especially small businesses, will not hire any extra people," she said. Moreover, "now that you're raising the costs, restaurants will have to raise the costs of their products."
In New York, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, is pushing a bill to raise the state's minimum wage, currently $7.25, to $8.50 an hour. Michael R. Bloomberg, the independent mayor of New York City, has endorsed that legislation, although the Republican-led Senate opposes it. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has taken no formal position.
In New Jersey, the Senate and Assembly leaders, both Democrats, support raising the state minimum to $8.50 an hour from $7.25, and Gov. Chris Christie has urged them to sit down with him to discuss the issue.
In Connecticut, the House labor committee voted to approve a bill that would raise that state's minimum, currently $8.25, in two 50-cent increments to $9.25 an hour by 2014. The administration of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has expressed concerns about the bill but has not said he will oppose it.
Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, an advocacy group for small businesses, said: "On this issue, our members tell us overwhelmingly everywhere they hate it."
"It's interesting that the Democratic governors of New York and Connecticut are ambivalent, even cool to the idea," Mr. Mozloom said. "They seem reluctant to create an additional burden for small businesses in their state."

Full text: HONG KONG -- China ran an unexpected $5.35 billion trade surplus last month, government figures released on Tuesday showed, indicating the country remains a strong exporter despite weak demand in Europe in recent months.
The surplus is likely to bring renewed calls in the United States and elsewhere for China to allow further appreciation of its currency, the renminbi. Responding to complaints from exporters of weak overseas orders, the government has halted appreciation this year while Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has even raised the possibility of increasing tax rebates for exporters.
China's export prowess has stirred worries about job losses in the United States, especially in an election year. But the Obama administration has muted somewhat its criticisms of China's currency policies this year as the country's trade surpluses had seemed to be evaporating.
Private economists had been predicting that China would show a trade deficit of $1 billion or more last month, not a surplus. China's exports climbed 8.9 percent in March compared with a year earlier, more than expected, while import growth slowed to 5.3 percent.
China ran a $31.48 billion trade deficit in February because export factories were slow to reopen after Chinese New Year celebrations in late January while imports continued at a strong pace. The trade figure for March had been widely awaited by economists and traders as the first clear reading in months of the true health of China's trade sector.
Following the government's general policy of minimizing trade surpluses and deflecting international pressure for China to rely less on foreign markets, the official Xinhua news agency emphasized in its report that for the entire first quarter, China ran a surplus of only $670 million.
But the first quarter of the year is always the weakest season for China's trade because export factories close for Chinese New Year; by comparison, China ran a $2.2 billion deficit in the first quarter of last year.
Aside from currency policy, the trade data poses further dilemmas for policymakers in Beijing, economists said.
Weak growth in imports could be a signal of broader difficulties in the China's domestic economy. Chinese leaders are trying to deflate a real estate bubble by banning most purchases of second and third homes, a policy that has brought an abrupt slowdown in residential housing construction, with the exception of public housing projects.
But inflation has slowed less than expected, with China's National Bureau of Statistics announcing on Monday that consumer prices were up 3.6 percent in March from a year earlier, an acceleration from the 3.2 percent pace recorded in February. Together with signs of a rebound in global demand for Chinese exports, the consumer price data raises the risk that the government could rekindle inflation if it starts stimulating the economy through measures like easing controls on bank lending.
Yu Song, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a research note early Tuesday afternoon that the trade data indicated that policy easing would tend "to be less aggressive than otherwise."

Abstract: Without the government assistance, many of the people who would be interested in applying for the driving jobs could not afford the $4,000 classes to obtain commercial driver's licenses. The general dislocated worker program paid for under the Workforce Investment Act would be combined with the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides training and other benefits to workers who lose their jobs because of foreign competition.

Full text: With the economy slowly reviving, an executive from Atlas Van Lines recently visited Louisville, Ky., with good news: the company wanted to hire more than 100 truck drivers ahead of the summer moving season.
But a usually reliable source of workers, the local government-financed job center, could offer little help, because the federal money that local officials had designated to help train drivers was already exhausted. Without the government assistance, many of the people who would be interested in applying for the driving jobs could not afford the $4,000 classes to obtain commercial driver's licenses. Now Atlas is struggling to find eligible drivers.
Across the country, work force centers that assist the unemployed are being asked to do more with less as federal funds dwindle for job training and related services.
In Seattle, for example, the region's seven centers provided training for less than 5 percent of the 120,000 people who came in last year seeking to burnish their skills. And in Dallas, officials say they have annual funds left to support only 43 people in training programs, nowhere near enough to help the 23,500 people who have lost their jobs in the last 10 weeks alone.
The Labor Department announced on Friday that employers had added only 120,000 new jobs in March, a disappointing gain after three previous months of nearly twice that level. But with 12.7 million people still searching for jobs, the country is actually spending less on work force training than it did in good times.
Federal money for the primary training program for dislocated workers is 18 percent lower in today's dollars than it was in 2006, even though there are six million more people looking for work now. Funds used to provide basic job search services, like guidance on resumes and coaching for interviews, have fallen by 13 percent.
Political fights have focused primarily on extensions of unemployment insurance, while the cuts in funds for training have passed with little debate and little notice.
At the peak in 2000, the federal government was spending more than $2.1 billion a year in today's dollars for training programs aimed at dislocated workers under the Workforce Investment Act. Stimulus funds added close to $1.5 billion over two years, but now annual spending has receded to about $1.2 billion.
The cuts "make it harder to meet the employers' needs," said Michael Gritton, executive director of KentuckianaWorks, which oversees four government-financed job centers in Louisville. "And obviously you have these individual customers who are asking for help to climb back into the middle class and you can't help them either."
Employers who want to hire often complain that the jobless do not have the necessary skills. In such an environment, advocates for workers say that cutting funds for training and other services makes little sense.
"We should be spending significantly more than we were spending five years ago," said Andy Van Kleunen, executive director of the National Skills Coalition, a nonprofit group that promotes investment in training. "And even then we would not be catching up to the demand."
Jack Griffin, president and chief operating officer of the Atlas World Group, said that finding drivers should be easy given the national unemployment rate of over 8 percent. "You would think they would be lined up at our door," he said.
Atlas recently lowered the number of driving hours required and is offering a signing bonus of $3,000. Mr. Griffin said the company would consider training applicants itself if they would "sign a piece of paper saying that when they graduate they will come to work for us for two years."
To bolster training and other services for jobless workers, the Obama administration recently proposed consolidating two programs. The general dislocated worker program paid for under the Workforce Investment Act would be combined with the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides training and other benefits to workers who lose their jobs because of foreign competition.
The trade program, which has an annual budget of $575 million, is typically more generous, but narrow in eligibility. The combined program would make all funds available to anyone who had lost a job, regardless of the reason.
In his latest budget proposal, President Obama also requested an additional $2.8 billion a year for job training over the next decade. "Even in this very tight budget," said Gene Sperling, national economic adviser, "the president felt that there was an imperative to call right now for a more simplified and effective training system" that also had an increase in funds.
Whether Congress is willing to consider more aid is uncertain. The federal budget endorsed by House Republicans calls for reductions in a broad category that includes job training.
The constraints are dispiriting for people like Jacqueline Francis, who was laid off from a job in human resources about a year and a half ago. Since then, she has followed the all-too-familiar drill of sending out resumes and cover letters that are never answered.
With her savings depleted, she wants to return to school and switch careers. Ms. Francis, a divorced mother in Louisville with a daughter in high school and a son in college, has pinpointed nursing, a field she considers most likely to provide employment.
Last month, she visited a job center run by KentuckianaWorks only to learn that the $240,000 allocated for health care training had been spent.
"I could have cried," Ms. Francis said. She said she would apply for financial aid at the local community college and sell items in her wardrobe to pay for a nursing degree. "I want to better my situation," she said.
Local employers say they also feel the pinch. "We depend on those dollars to help us with training for more entry-level positions," said Tony Bohn, chief human resources officer at Norton Healthcare, which operates more than 100 doctor's offices in the area.
It is not always easy to measure whether job training helps, or to what degree.
"Traditionally, we have found that job training has not been very effective for people who have lost their job recently," said Kenneth R. Troske, an economist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. Research suggests it delivers better returns for people with checkered job histories, or for people from extremely low-income backgrounds.
The Labor Department is paying for a study of training programs by the Workforce Investment Act at 28 locations across the country, but the research will not be complete until 2015.
Training advocates say that paying for education yields a better return than simply continuing to pay unemployment benefits. Marlena Sessions, chief executive of the Workforce Development Council of Seattle-King County, said that every dollar spent on training dislocated workers in 2009 returned about $8.70 to the local economy as people found new jobs and increased their spending.
Some economists say that previous studies of the cost-effectiveness of training have focused too closely on a worker's starting income after completing a certificate or degree program as a measure of success.
Ken Harris, a 39-year-old former assembly line worker at a General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, financed part of his nursing degree with federal funds. He started a job this year at an emergency room in Cincinnati. At his hourly wage, he says that he will earn an annual salary of about $55,000, with the potential for more, compared with the $74,000 he earned after 15 years with G.M.
But he has peace of mind that he is not likely to lose his job. And he is having more fun. "At G.M. you did the same thing every 48 seconds," Mr. Harris said. "In the nursing job, you don't know what's going to walk in the door."

Full text: Readers debate how best to reduce our use of cars and gas.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Americans pay too little for gasoline and diesel, and our subsequent driving of 2.9 trillion miles annually is a key factor in our trade deficit, military excursions, health and obesity crisis, air and water pollution, and greenhouse emissions. We keep hoping to defeat congestion by building highways -- a counterproductive proposition. The United States enjoys the second-lowest gasoline prices in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development after oil-exporting Mexico and, adjusted for inflation, we don't pay that much more than what our grandparents paid in the 1920s.
While oil worldwide costs the same, other nations put higher fees on gasoline and diesel consumption. Japan's high gas taxes make its 127 million people a huge test market for energy efficiency, while our lower taxes cajoled Detroit into selling gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s.
Of course, decreasing driving in a culture famed for its "love affair with the automobile" is difficult. No one, yet everyone, is to blame for our national default position of key in the ignition to get anywhere, everywhere and -- often -- nowhere. Our politicians are not willing to tell us the most inconvenient of inconvenient truths.
If we'd use our cars smarter, we'd mitigate a host of problems and prevent our grandchildren from following our children in fighting wars in the Middle East.
To begin using our cars intelligently rather than habitually, we need a rational federal gasoline "user fee" rolled in slowly over a decade.
It's time politicians led an adult conversation with America.
RANDY SALZMAN

The writer, a transportation demand management researcher, is writing a book, "Yes We Can: Getting Americans to Back Away From the Steering Wheel."

Readers React
Mr. Salzman calls for politicians to lead "an adult conversation with America" on intelligent versus habitual motor vehicle use. When, pray tell, over the last 40 years, have politicians been able to lead any intelligent conversation on issues related to energy, technology and society? And does this proposed conversation take us down the road to a "user fee" or a tax that is sure to penalize most those Americans who have the least ability to pay it?
Our unique long history with the car has made personal, flexible transportation and perceptions of freedom and autonomy as American as the Fourth of July. It is true that our reliance on the car and fossil fuels is out of balance, but the widespread diffusion of this technology is also in part responsible for the remarkable prosperity and opportunities we have enjoyed.
The key to our future is not to conflate the car with fossil fuel use. Plug-in hybrids give us the thrills and autonomy of personal transportation, while diminishing our energy consumption.
Changing our culture concerning electric cars and plug-ins will ultimately prove to be more decisive in our transition to a cleaner and healthier environment than a tax imposed by politicians who often serve special interests.

The automobile has been around on a commercial basis for approximately 100 years but is unlikely to survive for another century. Congestion, energy scarcity, deteriorating infrastructure, fatalities and numerous other problems are prompting a transition.
The challenge for coming decades is not to electrify the vehicle fleet, as some suggest, but to retrofit our communities to render the automobile irrelevant. Indeed, car use is already on the decline. The streetscape is being reappropriated in many cities for nonmotorized activities, and younger drivers are forsaking vehicle trips in favor of smartphones and other means of "virtual mobility." A growing proportion of 17- and 18-year-olds is not even bothering to get a driver's license.
This trend is apparent in most wealthy countries. It has, for instance, become increasingly common in Japan to speak of "kuruma banare," which can be roughly translated as "walking away from the car." We may have already begun to reach the end of the automobile era.

Mr. Salzman's plan to impose a federal gasoline "user fee" would disproportionately affect those of us who live in less dense residential communities -- call it urban sprawl if you will -- common in Western states, where public transportation is not an alternative. I find it troubling that there is so much talk about punitive taxation intended to change the habits of the population without any regard to what this means for real people living in the world as it is right now, not some idealized future.
Has anyone considered what effect this "user fee" would have on the consumer's ability to spend on other goods and services? Or what effect it would have on the housing market in car-dependent communities like mine?
Finally, Mr. Salzman, have you ever waited for the bus when it's 110 degrees in the shade?

Many Americans seem to forget that our driving culture did not come about as a result of free-market forces or accident, but because of government policies favoring the automobile.
In the early 1900s, the United States had the best public transportation system in the world, with intercity passenger trains that ran faster than the ones we have today and electric interurban railways all over the country.
But after World War II, state and local governments began carving out former farmland and wilderness and turning them into auto-dependent suburbs, and the federal government built the Interstate highway system. Railroads mostly had to fend for themselves, and passenger rail declined as a result. Today, the main reason that people drive and fly everywhere is because they have no other transportation mode.
Meanwhile, people in developed countries that kept their public transit systems -- particularly Japan and Western European countries -- are noticeably thinner than Americans and have lower carbon footprints, and their cities are far more convenient to navigate. Lowering our national carbon footprint, reducing our trade deficits and reducing obesity start with reducing our need to drive.

I don't own a car and haven't since January 2007. It's the only New Year's resolution I can remember keeping for any appreciable length of time. I don't buy gas or car insurance. I never get speeding or parking tickets, and I don't worry about noises under the hood or dings in the windshield.
When I stopped being a habitual driver, I dropped about 10 pounds. I started taking the bus to and from work, and walking all over Bangor, Me., where I live. Surprisingly, I didn't lose much freedom of mobility. I can still go where I want, when I want, most of the time. The exceptions are evening events in outlying areas after the buses stop running. But do those few events justify supporting an automobile 365 days a year?
I've raised and supported children, and car ownership has all the same financial obligations but few of the rewards. Unlike children, cars do not get smarter as they get older. They do not become skilled at taking care of themselves. They may not argue with you, but they will, at inopportune times, refuse to do what they are told.
Suddenly, I had money to dine out, to buy a new guitar, to visit New York. The American Automobile Association estimates the average annual cost of owning a car at $9,000. The occasional cab fare or car rental is a bargain by comparison.

Mr. Salzman may be leading us in the wrong direction. With such a vast country, our "love affair with the automobile" should really be considered a necessity. To be honest, we are not going to be able to reverse that any time soon.
However, a trip with a "smarter car" is clearly indicated. What about the superb cars that American companies design and build, but sadly are available only outside the country? Ford especially is providing vehicles that regularly get about 70 miles per gallon, with low carbon dioxide outputs. And many other manufacturers are following suit.
Perhaps the question should be reframed. Instead of questioning our addiction to cars, we should ask, Why are we addicted to wasting oil?

I couldn't have said it better than Mr. Salzman: "Our subsequent driving of 2.9 trillion miles annually is a key factor in our trade deficit, military excursions, health and obesity crisis, air and water pollution, and greenhouse emissions."
Well, I might add a few other things to this list, including the slow decline of once-vibrant downtown commercial centers, replaced by big-box megastores like Walmart and Home Depot that have popped up at the edges of these towns thanks to Interstate highways.
Not only has this trend of decentralized commerce led to the demise of the familiar "mom and pop" store, but it has also resulted in out-of-control urban sprawl that has contributed to those social and environmental ills described by Mr. Salzman.
The combustible engine is truly the scourge of modern society.

The Writer Responds
While I haven't waited for a bus in 110 degrees, Ms. Wendler, I have bicycled and drilled for oil in similar temperatures. And my son has fought in 110 degrees in Middle Eastern wars with connections to oil.
National good, I submit, should overcome personal convenience. Since several politicians, as well as the auto executive William Ford, suggested rational gasoline taxing 25 years ago, our failure to do so has had huge consequences, including the disconnected suburbs and the decline of "mom and pop" stores cited by Mr. DeArment and Mr. Johnson.
With American political leadership best defined as "getting in front of whatever way the parade is going," Professor Heitmann is right: politicians haven't led. However, smarter taxing dedicated to mass transit actually helps the poor. Two-thirds of American families that use mass transit earn less than $50,000. Yet half of transit companies raised fares and 71 percent added fuel surcharges last year.
Rational gasoline taxing would provide dollars to improve alternative transportation while boosting hybrid and electric sales more than subsidies do.
Since the Arab oil embargos of the 1970s, Americans are driving about a third more miles daily -- and we have fought in oil-producing countries while suffering the two worst offshore oil spills in history.
According to some transportation studies, it costs American society as much as 54 cents for every mile we drive in economic, environmental, health and foreign policy costs, and one analysis notes that we should be paying upwards of $10 a gallon to cover the true costs.

Abstract: In January, when Starbucks raised the price of a 12-ounce cup of coffee in Manhattan to $2.01, with taxes, many coffee drinkers were appalled -- not so much by the cost as by the indignity of needing to fish for pennies. "[...] in a competitive market, you might well see price decreases," says Mr. Velde, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago who is working this year at the Bank of France.

Full text: THE news from north of the border is both trivial and unsettling: they won't be making shiny new pennies in Canada anymore.
The government in Ottawa has made this decision after years of deliberation, for reasons that would seem to apply equally well in the United States. "Pennies take up too much space on our dressers at home," Jim Flaherty, the Canadian finance minister, said in a speech last month. A persuasive government brochure put it this way: "We often store them in jars, throw them away in water fountains, or refuse them as change."
Pennies cost more to produce than they are worth. Yet because of inflation, they are worth so little that many Canadians don't bother to use them at all.
It's not very different in New York City. In January, when Starbucks raised the price of a 12-ounce cup of coffee in Manhattan to $2.01, with taxes, many coffee drinkers were appalled -- not so much by the cost as by the indignity of needing to fish for pennies. In the intervening weeks, I've given up on coins at Starbucks and begun paying for my morning joe electronically.
Do we really need pennies?
The Canadian government doesn't think so. By the fall, it plans to stop minting them and stop distributing them through banks. It won't actually ban them, though. Some people have grown so attached to pennies -- a penny saved is a penny earned, after all -- that they may want to keep using them indefinitely, and they can, the Canadian government says.
But those who can bear to part with their pennies are being encouraged to bring them to banks for eventual melting or to donate them to charities -- which will presumably bring them in for melting. Electronic transactions will continue to include cents, while retail sales will be rounded up or down.
Inflation is sometimes cited as a threat whenever small coins are phased out. A $2.01 cup of coffee should be rounded down to $2, while $2.03 should become $2.05, for example, but retailers in the real world might raise prices more than lower them. That could cause a small, one-time inflation burst, says Francois Velde, an expert on the history of small change.
"But in a competitive market, you might well see price decreases," says Mr. Velde, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago who is working this year at the Bank of France. "In a place like New York, a 99-cent price of pizza might go down to 95 cents rather than $1 to avoid crossing that higher price threshold." Over all and over time, there should be no net price effect, he says.
He finds the argument for phasing out the penny to be at least as strong in the United States as in Canada because the two nations' small coins, political history and socioeconomic culture have so much in common. "That's what makes the Canadian decision a little unsettling," he says. "Their pennies even look a lot like ours."
In the United States, the mint says, each zinc and copper coin costs 2.41 cents to produce and distribute. It costs 1.6 Canadian cents to make a penny at the mint in Winnipeg, according to Canadian government figures. (A Canadian cent is worth about 0.99 cents at the current exchange rate.) "From the standpoint of economics, that's just a total waste of money," Mr. Velde says.
Pennies may not be big money, even if you add them together. But we are paying a cost for the privilege of squirreling them away in drawers and on dressers. The United States government -- that is, taxpayers -- lost $60.2 million on the production and distribution of pennies in the 2011 fiscal year, the mint's budget shows, and the losses have been mounting: $27.4 million in 2010, and $19.8 million in 2009.
A number of countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain, have already dropped their lowest-denominated coins, without dire consequences.
WHAT is to be done in the United States? The mint defers to Congress, and Congress hasn't told it to abolish the penny. Lawmakers have directed the mint to study ways to make small coins more cheaply. Mike White, a spokesman for the mint, says a report will be completed in December -- which happens to be after the presidential election.
President Obama, a former senator from Illinois, has observed that people from that state are partial to the penny, which has depicted Abraham Lincoln since 1909. But after the Canadian announcement, The Chicago Tribune last week editorialized that, sentiment aside, it was "time to kill the cent."
At the very least, a change in the composition of the American penny seems likely.
In 1982, Congress authorized the Treasury to make such a change, and it did. Before then, pennies were 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc, Mr. White says. Pennies manufactured since have been copper-plated zinc, with zinc making up 97.5 percent of the coin and copper only 2.5 percent. Steel, which was used in pennies in World War II, could be substituted next.
But why stop at the penny? It's not the only American coin that costs more than it's worth. Each nickel costs 11.18 cents to produce and distribute, the mint says, at a loss to taxpayers of $56.5 million in the last fiscal year. In its 2013 budget proposal, the Obama administration has asked for authority to alter the composition of the nickel, too.
Mr. Velde has suggested what he calls a "medieval solution to a medieval problem." The United States could resolve the penny and nickel quandaries simultaneously, by revaluing the penny as a five-cent piece and abolishing the nickel. Nickels would be melted down rapidly even now, as a business proposition, he says, if not for regulations imposed in 2006 prohibiting the melting or exporting of both pennies and nickels.
Anti-melting measures have a long history -- medieval England instituted one in 1299 -- but market pressures limit their effectiveness. (English silver coins were debased -- their silver content was reduced -- in 1343.)
"The whole situation is ridiculous," Mr. Velde says. "My medieval solution is, well, medieval. The serious, simple solution is to do away with the penny."
It's hard to be entirely serious about pennies, though. If there are no new ones, says Lizzie Wright, a native of Louisiana, old ones can be shined up very easily by using Tabasco sauce and a rag. Along with Mike Smith, a fellow performance artist, Ms. Wright cleaned pennies for passers-by at the Brooklyn Museum last year, at no charge.
"We think it's a useful service for a coin that isn't very useful," Ms. Wright says. "And if the penny is abolished, we think that will create greater demand for clean pennies."
A penny for your thoughts?

Abstract: Besides usual worries about rising interest rates and bankruptcies, managers investing in emerging-market bonds face risks from government policies, liquidity crises and currency fluctuations.

Full text: MUTUAL funds investing in emerging-market bonds have lately captured a frothy river of new customer cash.
With the measly yields now offered on presumably safer bonds, like United States Treasuries, savers are seeking more appealing sources of income. And in the first quarter this year, the average emerging-bond fund tracked by Morningstar returned 7 percent, versus 0.3 percent for the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.
But this combination -- a surge in popularity for emerging-market bonds on top of a strong performance run -- has some analysts wondering if investors are smartly diversifying or foolishly ramping up risk. "I worry that people are desperate for yield and are chasing performance," said Tom Roseen, a senior analyst at Lipper.
Still, in some ways, the popularity of emerging-market bond funds may be overdue. Handled prudently, these markets' debt can add diversification to portfolios. And bond issuers -- countries and companies -- in developing markets are maturing. By some measures, their bonds look more attractive than those of the developed world.
"The relative risk of emerging markets compared with developed markets has changed," said Campbell R. Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University.
The average debt level of emerging-market countries like Brazil and China is far lower than that of developed ones like the United States and Japan, Professor Harvey said. In addition, emerging economies have continued to surge, even as much of the developed world keeps struggling with the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Today, emerging markets represent about one-third of world G.D.P., and that share should increase in coming decades, he said.
Professor Harvey said he could thus see average investors putting as much as a quarter of a fixed-income portfolio in an emerging-market bond fund or exchange-traded fund. Not all analysts suggest quite so big a bet, but many say people should consider increasing their investment in emerging-market debt because of the diversification benefit.
Too many people shy from investing any money abroad and thus limit their diversification, said Christopher B. Philips, a senior investment analyst at Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group. "It's the home bias -- investors are more willing to hold domestic securities," he said. "The average person holds less than 10 percent of their fixed-income portfolio in foreign bonds."
A recent Vanguard study found that investors could benefit from allocating at least 20 to 40 percent of their fixed-income holdings to international bonds. Emerging-market bonds could be part of that allocation for risk-tolerant investors, Mr. Philips said.
Of course, emerging-market bonds -- and the mutual funds that invest in them -- still carry perils aplenty. Issuers in emerging markets pay better because they have to: the extra money compensates investors for the greater chance of loss. "Their yields are higher because the risk is higher," said Scott A. Richardson, an accounting professor at the London Business School. "Yields reflect risks: bonds that have higher yields are riskier bonds."
Besides usual worries about rising interest rates and bankruptcies, managers investing in emerging-market bonds face risks from government policies, liquidity crises and currency fluctuations. Even if a manager chose, say, the right Brazilian corporate bond, one of those risks could sap its return. Bad policies might lead to high inflation, which erodes bond values, or a bond market might seize up at a time of financial stress.
Over the last several decades, financial crises have repeatedly battered emerging markets. The 1990s were particularly tumultuous. A disaster occurred in Mexico in 1994, when the government devalued the peso. In 1997, the "Asian financial flu" broke out, and in 1998 came Russia's devaluation of the ruble, and a default on its debts.
Given such history, it should be no surprise that returns of emerging-market bond funds can be volatile, more than those of funds investing in, say, United States Treasuries. In 2008, all emerging-market bond funds followed by Morningstar lost money, said David I. Falkof, a Morningstar analyst.
"An emerging-market bond fund, managed by a good manager, can add value to an investor's portfolio," he said. "But you have to have the right expectations. If you can't handle short-term volatility, it doesn't make sense. If you're a long-term investor and can tolerate that, it can."
Some fund companies offer two types of emerging-market bond funds: those that invest mainly in bonds issued in United States dollars and those that invest mainly in bonds issued in local currencies. Pimco, for example, has one of each: its Emerging Markets Bond fund and its Emerging Local Bond fund.
"Both of these strategies invest in emerging-market bonds, but the first does it in dollars, so its total return will be directly influenced by U.S. interest rates," said Michael A. Gomez, manager of both funds. In contrast, the local-currency fund lets investors diversify away from the dollar, which they would want to do if they believed that the currency was going to weaken, he said.
Other companies offer a single fund but give their managers great flexibility in moving back and forth between dollar- and locally denominated bonds. The Fidelity New Markets Income fund fits into this category, though the manager, John A. Carlson, favors dollar bonds because their returns tend to be less volatile than those of local bonds.
"I limit myself to no more than 20 percent nondollar bonds and 20 percent corporate bonds," he said. The fund returned an annualized average of 11.2 percent over the 15 years ended March 31, versus 9.9 percent for the average emerging-markets bond fund followed by Morningstar. Mr. Carlson has managed the fund since 1995.
Michael J. Conelius, manager of the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond fund, also has freedom to roam. In Brazil, for example, he has lately favored local sovereign bonds but dollar-denominated corporates. "Local-currency corporates exist in Brazil, but the market isn't very deep," he said. In a less mature economy, he might stick with dollar issues.
Among funds tracked by Morningstar, there are no index mutual funds for emerging-market bonds, though Vanguard has said it will introduce one later this year. Index E.T.F.'s investing in emerging-market bonds are available. One, from iShares, invests in an index of dollar bonds -- its J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond fund -- and another invests in local bonds -- its Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond fund, which tracks the Barclays Capital Emerging Markets Broad Local Currency Bond Index. InvescoPowerShares provides an indexed dollar-bond E.T.F. called the Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Portfolio, which follows Deutsche Bank's Emerging Market USD Liquid Balanced Index.
Paul J. Chew, head of investments at Brown Advisory in Baltimore, said his money-management company is increasingly steering clients into emerging-market bonds. Even so, he urged caution. "Emerging markets have been very volatile and will most likely remain very volatile until they have a lot of local investors," he said.

Full text: SEEING is supposed to be believing, but a second consecutive quarter of eye-popping gains for stocks has left many investors still unconvinced that the long-term trend is up.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12 percent in the first quarter, after gaining 11.2 percent in the one before, yet the panic that was palpable last fall seems to have given way to doubt, more than to euphoria or even hope.
The index reached a four-year high in March, some 31 percent above its October low, amid stronger economic data in the United States and a resolution, at least for now, of the credit crisis in Greece. Yet investors continue to shun mutual funds with a focus on American stocks; Morningstar reported a net outflow of $3.8 billion in the first two months of 2012, bringing the total in the 12 months through February to $114.2 billion.
"This is the Rodney Dangerfield of bull markets," said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. "It doesn't get any respect. The naysayers have been badmouthing it really since the start."
Skeptical investment advisers find much to say nay about; they question that a bona fide recovery is in place or that the last disruptive piece of news has come out of Europe.
Others, including Mr. Yardeni, are skeptical about the skepticism. "There have been numerous nearly apocalyptic scenarios out there that haven't played out," he said. "Despite the scares we've had, the global economy continues to grow. The adage about the market climbing a wall of worry has never been more relevant."
In Mr. Yardeni's view, investors are ignoring a persistent lift to economic growth and corporate profits from reduced constraints on international trade.
"What the bears have been missing is the power of globalization," he said. "The liberalization of national economies through relatively free-trade policies is creating a lot of wealth. There are a lot more consumers out there than before the end of the cold war."
But investors who have pushed up stock prices may be missing that the interconnectedness of economies and markets cuts both ways. Alan Brown, chief investment officer of Schroder Investment Management, is concerned that the deal to protect European banks and allow Greece to renegotiate its debt is only a limited solution to the region's problems.
"I don't think it's over with at all," Mr. Brown said. "We had some meaningful and very good news in the last few months that kicked the can down the road for a while, but none of this addresses the core problem of lack of competitiveness in the peripheral countries. If it can be addressed at all, it will be a grindingly slow process over a decade or more."
THE recovery in the United States has been grindingly slow, too, but certain measures have picked up of late. Thomas H. Forester, manager of the Forester Value fund, noted, however, that economic output was only steady, not booming. Monthly jobs reports were strong in the first quarter until the one for March, released last Friday, which showed a sharp drop in the number of net jobs created.
"We're not exactly sure what to make of this," he said. "We kind of think there's more employment, but we're not seeing it validated in other areas."
Mr. Forester says he expects the rally in stocks to continue, although he believes it to be closer to the end than the beginning. He is concerned that 2012 may resemble 2011, when, he recalled, "we saw a big spurt in the first three or four months, then it went flat and rolled over." With that in mind, he said, "we're still a bit on the defensive side -- I still see a fair amount of risk, even if it's less than in October."
Owning stocks with high dividend yields "is the way to play the rest of the year," he advised. He is comparatively underinvested in banks, he added, and has trimmed exposure to technology.
Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup, also questions the strength of the employment rebound. He contends that warm winter weather may have pulled some job creation forward, limiting the scope for further gains.
"If we get spring early, then we don't get spring," Mr. Levkovich said. "That won't derail the recovery, but there is certainly some notion that the data isn't as clean as we would normally see."
He also cited concerns like higher gas prices and fat corporate profit margins that leave limited room for improvement. What the economy and stock market have going for them, he said, is Federal Reserve assurances that short-term interest rates will remain low until 2014.
Mr. Levkovich is bullish on stocks, but is in no hurry to buy right now. The S.& P. 500 already neared his year-end target of 1,425 in March. That high level for the index, as well as the various yellow flags, lead him to expect a modest pullback soon, perhaps 5 to 7 percent, before a fresh leg up later in the year. "Buy on weakness," he said. "Don't chase the tape at this point."
He said he would focus on diversified financial services companies, which he considers attractively valued, and "decent growth companies that also pay dividends while you wait" for share prices to catch a second wind.
Mr. Levkovich finds utilities reasonably priced, and favors providers of telecommunication services, which he envisions as raising prices more rapidly as smartphones and tablets continue to catch on. That same trend should help stocks of companies that make technology hardware and semiconductors, he said.
Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, says he is concerned about the lingering impact on consumer and other prices of the Fed's efforts to support the economy and financial system.
"If the economy does gain traction, then monetary stimulus means higher inflation sooner than most people expect," Mr. Arnott said. "If the economy falters, then the stimulus is going to be astronomical; that almost guarantees more inflation."
That perspective makes him bearish on government bonds, and he is not crazy about domestic stocks, either. He considers them "really cheap, compared to Treasury bonds, and more expensive than almost everything else." He would rather have his money in stocks and bonds in emerging markets and in commodities and high-yield bonds.
Those bonds of less creditworthy borrowers were among the strongest performers in the three months through March. They helped the average bond fund in Morningstar's database gain 2.6 percent.
Stock funds fared much better. The average domestic fund was up 12 percent, led by portfolios that focus on sectors most sensitive to economic growth: consumer discretionary, financial services and cyclical industries. Technology funds were the biggest standouts, rising 20.7 percent, on average. International funds were strong, too, rising 11.4 percent.
Mr. Brown shares Mr. Arnott's doubts about long-term bonds and also advises concentrating on high-yield instruments. Among stocks, he considers the American market "the best of a bad bunch," especially high-quality companies with large dividend yields. He would avoid Europe.
Mr. Yardeni also favors American stocks, but more enthusiastically. He expects the S.& P. 500 to rise as high as 1,550, exceeding the record set in 2007. He particularly likes tech stocks. "We're seeing hardware and software companies doing extremely well," he said. "The cloud is the new new thing creating demand for servers and software."
Mr. Yardeni also recommends makers of capital equipment, in part because of rising orders from foreign industrial companies. And he encourages investors to hold energy stocks, both to benefit from acceleration of global economic growth and as a hedge against political instability in the Middle East.
Market segments he is steering clear of are consumer discretionary, a sector that includes retailers, carmakers and travel companies, and high-yield stocks. They have experienced extremely large gains, he noted, and so their best days may be behind them. The unpredictability he finds in financial stocks makes them a category to avoid, too, he said.
SOME possibilities -- rising gas prices, a Persian Gulf conflict, adverse political developments in Europe and the United States -- could temper Mr. Yardeni's bullishness, he conceded. They might prove the skeptics right about the market rally, but, channeling Mr. Dangerfield, he still advises investors to show it more respect.
"There are grounds for arguing that this will end badly," he said, "but there are increasing grounds for feeling that this bull market could last awhile and that the future could be a lot brighter than investors have been thinking."

Full text: STOCK markets in much of the world may have suffered a lost decade, but there was much to gain by investing in Latin America.
A vigorous and persistent economic and political renaissance, especially in Brazil, produced annualized returns of 17.1 percent for funds that focus on the region during the 10 years through March, including a 13.3 percent return in the first quarter of this year.
Another decade like that may be too much to hope for, and fund managers who concentrate on emerging economies highlight a handful of potential challenges for Latin American markets. The markets can be volatile too; they fell sharply in 2008 and more moderately in 2011. Still, continued success is widely expected for the region and for investors who keep their money there for the long haul.
Rick Schmidt, a manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets fund, attributed the run of phenomenal performance to "two and a half stories." One is sustained, strong economic growth across the developing world. Significant growth of another sort -- in democratic political institutions and sound economic management -- was an even greater contributor to success, in his view.
"The countries that made changes to more open markets and to developing their middle class saw the greatest returns," Mr. Schmidt said.
His other favorable circumstance, or half of one, was a lucky coincidence. The economic and currency crisis that began in Asia in 1997 moved on to Russia a year later and then to Latin America. Markets there bottomed almost exactly 10 years ago, he noted, making the returns since then look especially robust.
Gonzalo Pangaro, head of the emerging-markets group at T. Rowe Price, also mentioned improvement in leadership in Latin America, and said it extended from government ministries to corporate boardrooms.
"Most governments, including the key ones in Brazil and Mexico, have implemented very sensible macroeconomic policies -- fiscal prudence, controlling inflation -- and public companies tend to be of very good quality," he said. "The quality of management and protection of minority shareholders are right up there, and growth opportunities are as good as you can find in some of the fast-growing Asian countries."
The healthy increase in profits at Latin American companies has kept valuations reasonable, even as markets have continued to soar. Stocks in Brazil, the region's dominant market, recently traded at about 10 times earnings, compared with a multiple of about 13 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the United States.
Good management is crucial for maintaining robust profits, and so are good customers. Fund managers find plenty of those in Latin America, where growing demand for products and services from increasingly well-off people is helping to transform economies and businesses.
"Seventy percent of Brazil is middle class or higher, and they're active consumers," said William Landers, manager of the BlackRock Latin America fund.
Many of investors' favored stocks in the region are of companies that cater to consumer needs and wants, particularly Brazilian banks and real estate developers. Housing is in short supply in Brazil, portfolio managers say, and a government program in which employers make regular contributions to subsidize employees' mortgages should keep demand high for homes and financing.
Mr. Landers likes Banco Itau and the home builder PDG Realty, which he credits with having "one of the better managements in the sector."
Mr. Schmidt, meanwhile, holds Itau and one of its main rivals, Banco Bradesco. Mr. Pangaro casts a third vote for Brazilian banks, especially Itau, which he called "a very well-run bank with very good profitability."
Jonas Krumplys, manager of the Ivy Asset Strategy New Opportunities fund, holds a broad range of stocks tied to Brazilian real estate, including home builders and developers of shopping malls and warehouses. One company outside Brazil that he expects to benefit from the expansion of the Latin American middle class is Copa Airlines, which is doing brisk business flying passengers between North and South America via its base in Panama.
Apart from banks, Mr. Schmidt recommends the brewers Ambev of Brazil and Femsa of Mexico, along with Coca-Cola Femsa, an affiliate of Femsa and Coca-Cola.
One sector not on managers' favored list is telecommunications. Use of cellphones and the Internet is much lower in Latin America than in mature economies, leaving great scope for growth, but managers find too many companies competing to offer services.
As for the two Brazilian commodity producers that are the largest contributors to regional stock indexes -- the oil company Petrobras and the iron ore mining company CVRD -- investors tend to be indifferent. Although Mr. Pangaro considers Petrobras stock as inexpensive, the two stocks are widely seen as vulnerable to a slowdown in global growth.
Investment advisers agree that Latin America has made spectacular progress in the last 10 to 20 years and, with exceptions, has recovered from the instability that once plagued the region. They caution, though, that investors may still face challenges in coming months, though of the run-of-the-mill variety that afflict economies and markets everywhere.
Inflation has been about 5 percent a year in Brazil. That is nothing like the rates in the 1980s, when they reached percentages in the tens of thousands, but Mr. Landers cited mounting concern that politics, not just economics, would begin to guide decisions by Brazil's central bank, leading to lax monetary policy.
The concern may be justified, given history, but he said he expected inflation -- and central bankers -- to remain well behaved.
The Brazilians "have worked so hard to get where they are," he said. "If inflation comes back, the whole domestic growth trend starts to go the other way, the middle class loses purchasing power and the domestic growth story is called into question."
Mr. Krumplys is less optimistic that the problem can be sidestepped.
"Brazil is probably going to have an inflation problem in the second half of this year," he predicted.
He identified several chronic impediments to long-term progress in Brazil, too, including high tax rates, deficient transportation and other infrastructure and a poor education system.
AS worrisome as such developments might be, however, Latin America is on such a roll that having them lurking in investors' thoughts could prove beneficial -- by providing a vital measure of perspective and humility.
"The real domestic worry would be hubris, getting too successful and blowing what they made in the past," Mr. Schmidt said. "That's what always destroys markets. They get overstretched; they push themselves. They think the rules don't apply to them and they go for too much growth. That never ends well."

Full text: A few days ago, Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, spoke out in defense of his successor. Attacks on Ben Bernanke by Republicans, he told The Financial Times, are "wholly inappropriate and destructive." He's right about that -- which makes this one of the very few things the ex-maestro has gotten right in the past few years.
But why are the attacks on Mr. Bernanke so destructive? After all, nobody in America is or should be immune from criticism, least of all those -- like the chairman of the Fed -- who, by the nature of their positions, have immense power to make our lives better or worse. And while there is an unmistakable thuggishness to the campaign against the Fed, most famously Rick Perry's warning that the Fed chairman would be treated "pretty ugly" if he visited Texas, surely the bad manners of the critics aren't the most important issue.
No, the real reason the attacks on Mr. Bernanke from the right are so destructive is that they're an effort to bully the Fed into doing exactly the wrong thing. The attackers want the Fed to slam on the brakes when it should be stepping on the gas; they want the Fed to choke off recovery when it should be doing much more to accelerate recovery. Fundamentally, the right wants the Fed to obsess over inflation, when the truth is that we'd be better off if the Fed paid less attention to inflation and more attention to unemployment. Indeed, a bit more inflation would be a good thing, not a bad thing.
O.K., I know that many readers are already outraged. But bear with me, and let me take this in stages.
First, about inflation obsession: For at least three years, right-wing economists, pundits and politicians have been warning that runaway inflation is just around the corner, and they keep being wrong. Do you remember the tirades about "debasing the dollar" around this time last year? Do you remember the scorn heaped on Mr. Bernanke last spring when he argued that the bulge in inflation taking place at the time was just a temporary blip caused by gasoline prices and would soon recede? Well, he was right. At this point, inflation is once again running a bit below the Fed's self-declared target of 2 percent.
Now, the Fed has, by law, a dual mandate: It's supposed to be concerned with full employment as well as price stability. And while we more or less have price stability by the Fed's definition, we're nowhere near full employment. So this says that the Fed is doing too little, not too much. Indeed, some Fed officials -- notably Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed -- have tried to make exactly that case.
To be sure, more aggressive Fed policies to fight unemployment might lead to inflation above that 2 percent target. But remember that dual mandate: If the Fed refuses to take even the slightest risk on the inflation front, despite a disastrous performance on the employment front, it's violating its own charter. And, beyond that, would a rise in inflation to 3 percent or even 4 percent be a terrible thing? On the contrary, it would almost surely help the economy.
How so? For one thing, large parts of the private sector continue to be crippled by the overhang of debt accumulated during the bubble years; this debt burden is arguably the main thing holding private spending back and perpetuating the slump. Modest inflation would, however, reduce that overhang -- by eroding the real value of that debt -- and help promote the private-sector recovery we need. Meanwhile, other parts of the private sector (like much of corporate America) are sitting on large hoards of cash; the prospect of moderate inflation would make letting the cash just sit there less attractive, acting as a spur to investment -- again, helping to promote overall recovery.
In short, far from fearing that more action against unemployment might lead to an uptick in inflation, the Fed should actually welcome that prospect. Which brings me back to those Republican attacks and their chilling effect on policy.
True, Mr. Bernanke likes to insist that he and his colleagues aren't affected by politics. But that claim is hard to square with the Fed's actions, or rather lack of action. As many observers have noted, the Fed's own forecasts indicate that while things have been looking up a bit lately, it still expects low inflation and high unemployment for years to come. Given that prospect, more of the "quantitative easing" that is now the main tool of Fed policy should be a no-brainer. Yet the recently released minutes from a March 13 meeting show a Fed inclined to do nothing unless things take a turn for the worse.
So what's going on? I think that Fed officials, whether they admit it to themselves or not, are feeling intimidated -- and that American workers are paying the price for their timidity.

Low Growth In Earnings Is Expected

Abstract: Nucor said on March 15 that it expected first-quarter results in a range of 30 to 35 cents a share, down from 50 cents in the same period in 2011. Because investors are being prepared for what they might see in the coming season, analysts said they did not expect the lower growth to cause any major stock market retreat.

Full text: Corporate profits have been among the brightest lights of the economic recovery, helping to lift the stock market more than 25 percent since October.
But analysts predict that when the first-quarter reporting season starts in earnest next week, American companies will show the slowest rate of growth in operating earnings in three years.
One widely used gauge of profits, the Standard & Poor's Capital IQ survey, forecasts that earnings will have grown 0.93 percent in the first quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2011, for the companies that make up the S.& P. 500-stock index. That would bring the value of one share of the index to $23.85.
In the same period last year, operating earnings per index share were $23.63, a result of 19.68 percent growth from the first quarter in 2010.
"It is the lowest quarter of growth we have seen since the third quarter of 2009," said Christine Short, the senior manager for S.& P. Global Markets Intelligence. Other surveys, by Thomson Reuters and FactSet, show similar trends of weak first-quarter growth compared with the year before.
Many companies struggled through the difficult period since the 2008 financial crisis by trimming costs and laying off employees to help rebuild their bottom lines. Now analysts say that the cutbacks may have reached their limits and that profits could very well have peaked in the second half of last year.
The euro zone debt crisis, slowing growth in Asia and emerging markets, and commodity price inflation are also expected to have hurt performance, analysts said.
Analysts don't expect the European debt crisis "to be fully dealt with in the first half of the year," Ms. Short said. "There is too much uncertainty looming to say how it is going to affect corporate earnings."
Part of the reason the numbers will show weakness is also smoke and mirrors: profits were starting to grow a year ago as the economy rebounded from the financial crisis, so comparisons to 2011 will be relatively mild.
"You still have growth, but it is at a slower pace," said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.
Three of the 10 sectors of the S.& P. 500 index -- the industrial, technology and consumer staples companies -- will show earnings growth in the first quarter of 2012, according to the forecast. The energy industry is expected to show flat earnings.
Of the other six, materials and telecommunications are expected to record the largest drops, partly because of shrinking global demand, according to Ms. Short.
Among the companies with lowered forecasts are the steel companies Nucor and Steel Dynamics. Nucor said on March 15 that it expected first-quarter results in a range of 30 to 35 cents a share, down from 50 cents in the same period in 2011.
Because investors are being prepared for what they might see in the coming season, analysts said they did not expect the lower growth to cause any major stock market retreat. But the guidance the companies will give investors for the current quarter and the rest of the year poses a much bigger risk to sentiment.
Barry C. Knapp, the head of United States equity portfolio strategy at Barclays, said Barclays was estimating a retreat in the S.& P. 500 -- albeit less than 10 percent -- if investors were disappointed by companies' guidance.
Still, equities are inexpensive considering the current low interest rates, Mr. Creatura said.
One of the first major companies to report its first-quarter earnings for 2012 will be Alcoa, the aluminum producer, on Tuesday. Investors view the company as something of a bellwether for global economic trends because its products are used for automobiles, airplanes and construction, and also because it has operations in Europe.
Alcoa's operating earnings per share are forecast to have declined about 3 cents in the first quarter of 2012, about the same decline as in the fourth quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey. Its most recent guidance in January included an outlook of market growth for aerospace and auto companies, with 7 percent global growth in aluminum.
After Alcoa will be JPMorgan Chase, scheduled for next Friday. Average estimates for JPMorgan's operating earnings per share are $1.14, compared with $1.28 a year ago and 93 cents in the fourth quarter of 2011.
It, too, is considered a bellwether for its industry, because it is one of the largest banks in asset terms and because its leader, Jamie Dimon, is often seen as a spokesman for the industry, said Gerard S. Cassidy, a banking analyst for RBC Capital Markets.
A recovery in overall earnings growth is expected in the third quarter, according to average forecasts, said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds.
"I suspect that Europe may have a little bit more of an impact on the bottom line, and the talk may be more measured in terms of growth expectations going forward," Mr. Manley said.

Federal Reserve Minutes Suggest No Bold Action

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The prospect that the Federal Reserve will begin a fourth round of asset purchases appears to be fading as the economy improves. The members of the Fed's policy-making committee barely discussed new efforts to bolster growth during their most recent meeting in mid-March, according to an account of that meeting released by the Fed on Tuesday.
While the committee remains committed to its existing efforts to stimulate growth, the account said that there was no support for additional measures like new asset purchases unless "the economy lost momentum" or inflation settled below the 2 percent annual rate the central bank considers healthy.
The account suggested the committee was unlikely to announce any new measures after its meeting scheduled for this month, as some investors had expected. And markets responded as if the Fed had pulled back on the reins of the economy. Stock market indices fell, while the interest rates on Treasury securities climbed. The reaction was brief, however, and some analysts cautioned against overreaction, noting the Federal Open Market Committee could still announce new steps this year.
Equities and Treasury markets took a dim view of the report, as the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index each fell nearly one half of a percentage point. Treasury prices declined, pushing interest rates up 11/32 of a percentage point.
"The lack of discussion over a possible sterilized asset purchase program does not mean that it won't happen, just that while the data is still firming, there is little incentive to push for something," Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at the investment bank Mizuho USA, said in a note to clients Tuesday. "I still expect that the data will give the F.O.M.C. the opportunity to do more."
The Fed is not shelving asset purchases because it is overjoyed about the state of the economy. To the contrary, it retains a relatively dour outlook, predicting moderate growth and persistent unemployment for years to come.
The committee was not impressed by recent signs of faster growth, according to the minutes, which are released three weeks after each meeting.
"While a few participants indicated that their expectations for real GDP growth for 2012 had risen somewhat, most participants did not interpret the recent economic and financial information as pointing to a material revision to the outlook for 2013 and 2014," according to the document, which is a summary rather than a transcript.
The Fed's staff, which prepares a separate forecast respected for its accuracy, did raise its estimate of medium-term growth "somewhat higher."
It cited three reasons: a better global outlook as Europe continues to avoid a crisis; the weakness of the dollar, which lifts exports; and the rising stock market.
Fed officials are particularly concerned about the recent rate of job growth. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said recently that the economy was not growing fast enough to sustain the trend. The minutes show other officials shared that view.
The dwindling support for new measures is all the more striking in the context of these concerns, but the minutes offer no explanation for the Fed's position.
Inflation is one likely restraint on new measures. The Fed predicts that inflation will continue to rise at roughly 2 percent a year, the rate it considers healthy. That serves as a justification for its existing policies, but it also limits the Fed's willingness to do more.
The minutes reflect the Fed's position that it does not view oil prices as a threat to this balancing act. The document notes that other commodity prices are not climbing alongside oil prices, as they did when oil prices rose last year, suggesting that the increase is the result of geopolitical concerns rather than growth pressures. The Fed continues to predict the impact on inflation will be temporary.
The minutes also spell out a new line of attack by some critics. They have argued that the Fed's tools for enhancing growth are ineffective and risk raising the inflation rate. Now they are advancing the argument that the maximum rate of sustainable growth has declined and as a result the Fed's efforts may cause the economy to overheat.
But Mr. Bernanke has rejected that argument, maintaining that the economy can still return to its long-term growth rate of about 3 percent a year. And most observers believe he has the support to adopt new measures if he so chooses.
The Fed affirmed its plans to complete its third round of asset purchases in June, and the minutes make clear it remains committed to its existing efforts to stimulate growth, including holding short-term interest rates near zero and maintaining a huge investment portfolio to further reduce long-term rates.
The committee is scheduled to hold its next meeting April 24-25.

Full text: To the Editor:
Americans pay too little for gasoline and diesel, and our subsequent driving of 2.9 trillion miles annually is a key factor in our trade deficit, military excursions, health and obesity crisis, air and water pollution, and greenhouse emissions. We keep hoping to defeat congestion by building highways -- a counterproductive proposition.
The United States enjoys the second-lowest gasoline prices in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development after oil-exporting Mexico and, adjusted for inflation, we don't pay that much more than what our grandparents paid in the 1920s.
While oil worldwide costs the same, other nations put higher fees on gasoline and diesel consumption. Japan's high gas taxes make its 127 million people a huge test market for energy efficiency, while our lower taxes cajoled Detroit into selling gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s.
Of course, decreasing driving in a culture famed for its "love affair with the automobile" is difficult. No one, yet everyone, is to blame for our national default position of key in the ignition to get anywhere, everywhere and -- often -- nowhere. Our politicians are not willing to tell us the most inconvenient of inconvenient truths.
If we'd use our cars smarter, we'd mitigate a host of problems and prevent our grandchildren from following our children in fighting wars in the Middle East.
To begin using our cars intelligently rather than habitually, we need a rational federal gasoline "user fee" rolled in slowly over a decade.
It's time politicians led an adult conversation with America.

Full text: Miguel de la Madrid, a former president of Mexico whose derided handling of the earthquake that devastated Mexico City in 1985 was the beginning of the end for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, died Sunday morning in Mexico City. He was 77 .
His death was confirmed by his office. No cause was specified, but Mr. de la Madrid had been hospitalized with emphysema for the past three months, said his private secretary, Delia Gonzalez.
A Harvard-educated technocrat, Mr. de la Madrid was elected in 1982 and presided over one of the most difficult six-year terms of any Mexican leader. He inherited an economy in crisis. After Mexico borrowed against oil revenues, it defaulted on its foreign debt. As inflation roared past 100 percent and unemployment reached 25 percent, the country struggled to apply free-market principles to what had been a closed economy.
To deal with the foreign debt emergency, Mr. de la Madrid imposed austerity measures that were widely unpopular. But he is credited with setting Mexico on a path toward a free-market economy, which culminated in the country's entering into the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada in 1994.
The most memorable event of his time in office was the magnitude 8.1 earthquake that leveled buildings across the capital on the morning of Sept. 19, 1985, and left an estimated 10,000 people dead. Mr. de la Madrid was seemingly absent for the first day and a half after the quake, and he initially refused international aid and played down damage that was obvious to all. When Mexicans saw that their government was failing to act, they cleared debris and searched for survivors on their own, giving rise to citizens' groups that would later challenge Mexico's authoritarian politics.
A beneficiary of the system known in Mexico as el dedazo, the finger tap, Mr. de la Madrid was the anointed successor of President Jose Lopez Portillo. Mr. de la Madrid would also handpick the next president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, but that transition would not go smoothly.
A fierce critic of Mr. de la Madrid's rule, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, joined with other reformers in the P.R.I., as the Institutional Revolutionary Party is known, to call for a more transparent selection process for presidential candidates. Such internal criticism was considered treasonous by party hard-liners, and Mr. de la Madrid said: "As far as I'm concerned, let them go. Let them form another party."
They did, and although Mr. Cardenas failed to defeat Mr. Salinas, the 1988 election would be marred by irregularities, including the crash of the government computer used to count votes. It was the first time in generations that the ruling party's victory was not a foregone conclusion.
Twelve years later, when Vicente Fox won the presidency representing the opposition National Action Party, the P.R.I. would finally lose its grip on Mexico.
Calling him a "gray president," Lorenzo Meyer, a historian, said Mr. de la Madrid had been unlucky to inherit such a grave economic crisis and proved unable to extract the country from it. Mr. de la Madrid, Mr. Meyer said, was the father of Mexico's political opposition, since it was his stubbornness that gave rise to it.
Future presidents learned from Mr. de la Madrid's missteps. During the 2009 outbreak of swine flu in Mexico, President Felipe Calderon took to the airwaves and made public appearances to let the population know he was on top of the crisis. Commentators praised him for not following in the footsteps of Mr. de la Madrid.
After his term ended, Mr. de la Madrid became the director of the state-owned publishing company and remained largely out of the public eye. He did resurface in 2009 in a radio interview in which he expressed regret for choosing Mr. Salinas, who is widely reviled because of an economic collapse shortly after he left office and revelations of an unexplained fortune amassed by his brother.
Born in Colima, on Mexico's Pacific coast, on Dec. 12, 1934, Mr. de la Madrid graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later received a master's degree from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He began his career in government with a series of bureaucratic positions in Mexico's central bank, at the state-owned oil company and in the finance ministry. In 1976 he became secretary of budget and planning under President Lopez Portillo.
Mr. de la Madrid is survived by his wife, Paloma Cordero; his sons, Miguel, Enrique, Federico and Gerardo de la Madrid Cordero; a daughter, Margarita de la Madrid Cordero; and several grandchildren.

Full text: WHAT do Tiger Woods and the S.& P. 500 have in common?
They're back!
Neither Tiger nor the stock market ever entirely disappeared, of course, even when it might have seemed that they should. But they certainly moved out of the spotlight.
You may recall that after a long run of spectacular good fortune, each hit a wall -- or, in Tiger's case, a fire hydrant and a tree. (Hey, this isn't reality TV. Some details will be left to your imagination.)
Amid much heartache, the great golfer and the stock market both lost their way -- and lost the ability to mesmerize a suddenly disenchanted public.
But in March, after more than 900 often harrowing days, both Tiger and the market accomplished something memorable.
On March 25, he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational tournament in Orlando, an accomplishment that was commonplace when he was racking up titles every weekend. It had been a very long time -- 923 days, to be exact -- since the P.G.A. Tour Web site needed to add a new trophy to its "Tiger Woods Victory Room," an online sanctum dedicated to celebrating the career of "the most recognizable athlete on the planet." He said that this particular victory, his 72nd on the official PGA tour, was an occasion for "pure joy."
In some circles, the stock market commands almost as much attention as sports, and in these precincts the month was also notable. On March 15, the Standard & Poor's 500, which tracks the movements of big-company stocks, closed above 1,400. That's a gain of 107 percent from its 2009 low. The index has been flirting with 1,400 since, closing on Friday above 1,408. It has gained 12 percent this year.
That achievement may not warrant a brass band, but it is something of a milestone. Before March, the market hadn't closed above 1,400 in nearly three years -- 951 trading days, actually. (Morgan Stanley has been counting.) Many brokerage statements will now make for more pleasant reading. But based on past history, Morgan Stanley suggested in a research report, investors would be wise to respond with relief rather than rapture.
AFTER all, the market has been here before, several times, always with dismal results. The S.& P. surmounted 1,400 in 1999, before the market tumble that started in 2000. The index broke through it again on Nov. 17, 2006, and climbed above 1,500 the next year, only to fall off a cliff. After many years of wrenching ups and downs, in other words, the S.& P. has gone nowhere.
What's worse, Morgan Stanley finds parallels to late 2006 and concludes that the market today is in some ways more precarious.
While the economy has been growing lately, the report said, "macro conditions are vastly different and largely worse" than in 2006. Real gross domestic product in March grew at a lower annual rate -- 1.6 percent, versus. 2.2 percent in November 2006. Inflation was much higher -- 2.9 percent versus 1.4 percent. And the disparity in unemployment rates is shockingly steep, at 8.3 percent versus only 4.4 percent.
Most corporate balance sheets are in better shape than they were in 2006, but the Federal Reserve's is conspicuously bloated, the report noted. The Fed has been doing its best to prop up the economy and to make riskier assets, like stocks, more appealing, but its efforts may pose significant dangers.
"During this same period, the Federal Reserve has tripled its balance sheet to nearly $3 trillion through purchases of mortgage securities and Treasuries," Morgan Stanley noted. "While this stimulative monetary policy has arguably aided risky assets, it has increased uncertainty as well, since ultimately it needs to be unwound."
The Fed stands ready to do more. With the housing market weak and unemployment high, it is "too early to declare victory" for the economy, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said last week. And if oil and gas prices climb high enough, they could easily derail the American economy. So could the recession in Europe or a flare-up of the financial crisis simmering in the euro zone. Or slowing growth in China. Or fiscal austerity in the United States.
David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto, and formerly of Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report that huge central-bank intervention is the "critical reason" the market has "doubled over the past three years -- punctuated by steep givebacks once the taps are turned off (only to then be turned on again.)" This pattern is likely to continue, he says, so investors should keep their wits about them.
IN a similar vein, Morgan Stanley says expectations of rising corporate profits have persuaded many investors to pay richer prices for stocks. But the trajectory of the profit growth is flattening, it says. The company emphatically warns its clients: "Don't pay a higher multiple for today's corporate earnings."
In short, the stock market is back and may well move higher still. But it's worth remembering that it is a blood sport -- more "Hunger Games" than light entertainment.
Golf, on the other hand, is a gentler pastime. Yet it, too, has provided some stern tests, with one this week at the Masters tournament at Augusta National. Like the market, Tiger Woods is back, yes. How securely, we may soon see.

Abstract: The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said, "Today's vote stands as another example of the Republican establishment grasping onto the same failed economic policies that stacked the deck against the middle class and created the worst financial crisis in decades."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A fierce two-day debate over a Republican budget plan portrayed as either a path to prosperity or a road to ruin ended Thursday with House passage of a blueprint that would transform Medicare, cut domestic spending to levels not seen since World War II and order up a drastic overhaul of the tax code.
The plan, which passed 228 to 191, with no Democratic votes and 10 Republican defections, will form the template around which much of the 2012 election will be fought. Democrats will try to hang its extensive changes to Medicare around the necks of vulnerable Republican candidates, along with the accusation that Republicans supported a program to punish the poor and elderly while rewarding the rich with still more tax cuts. Republicans will say theirs is the party willing to make the tough choices to tame a soaring federal debt.
"It is so rare in American politics to arrive at a moment in which the debate revolves around the fundamental nature of American democracy and the social contract, but that is exactly where we are today," said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee and the architect of the blueprint, adding, "Today's budget is a vote of confidence for the American experiment."
Democrats said they saw nothing brave in voting to decimate programs for the poor, like food stamps and Medicaid, while offering potentially huge tax cuts for the rich.
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said, "Today's vote stands as another example of the Republican establishment grasping onto the same failed economic policies that stacked the deck against the middle class and created the worst financial crisis in decades."
The budget's prescriptions will not become law this year. Leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate have made clear they will not pass any budget, and instead will rely on spending caps established last July during the showdown over the federal debt limit.
But the plan drafted by Mr. Ryan will probably become the standard by which Republican candidates for the House, Senate and White House are measured. Notably, Representative Denny Rehberg, who is seeking a Senate seat in Montana, was one of the 10 Republicans who voted no.
And the plan will remain a political focal point of Congress for months.
The budget orders six House committees to draft plans to cut the deficit by $261 billion by early May to help avert automatic cuts to the military that will take place under last summer's agreement unless a broad deficit reduction plan is passed.
Cuts that are relatively abstract now will become concrete in a matter of weeks -- and will hit nutrition, health care and welfare particularly hard. The House Judiciary Committee will have the task of raising nearly $40 billion over 10 years by curbing medical malpractice suits. The House Government Oversight Committee must find nearly $80 billion over the coming decade, largely from federal workers' pensions. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose jurisdiction spreads from health care to welfare, must find $97 billion in savings.
"I don't know how you write any of these bills because the numbers are going to be pretty dramatic," said Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, citing $47 billion that must be cut from the transportation budget in the coming fiscal year, just as senators are pressing to preserve current levels of infrastructure spending.
And because the Senate will not follow suit, some Republicans say the exercise will yield nothing but rancor and political pain.
"I don't know that other than the comity of the committee, it will make much difference anywhere," said Representative Frank D. Lucas of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, which must cut $33 billion, largely from nutrition programs. "We're all smarting a bit, but sometimes we all have to pull the wagon to get there."
Under the Ryan plan, spending would be cut $5.3 trillion below President Obama's budget through 2022. Medicare would be reduced by $205 billion. Medicaid and other health programs would be cut $770 billion. Other entitlement programs, including welfare, food stamps, agriculture subsidies and transportation, would be cut by nearly $2 trillion.
Programs at the discretion of Congress would be cut $352 billion below the levels requested by the president over 10 years. To do that, House spending bills will have to come in well below the caps set last July. In the fiscal year that begins this October, the House plan sets spending on domestic programs $19 billion below the limit in last summer's Budget Control Act.
Medicare would be turned into a subsidized set of private insurance plans, with the option of buying into the existing fee-for-service program. The annual growth of those subsidies would be capped just above economic growth, well below the current health care inflation rate.
The Republican budget mandates the repeal of Mr. Obama's health care law and assumes the elimination of the government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
It also orders up a sweeping overhaul of the tax code. The six existing personal income tax rates, topping off at 35 percent, would be reduced to two -- 10 percent and 25 percent -- with the revenue loss offset by the elimination of unspecified tax deductions and exemptions.
Under the House plan, the current $1.18 trillion deficit would fall to $797 billion in the coming fiscal year, compared with $977 billion under Mr. Obama's plan. But by 2016, the deficit would fall to $241 billion by Republican estimates. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Mr. Obama's budget would still have a $529 billion deficit.
The Ryan plan would accumulate $3.1 trillion in additional debt through 2022. The president's would add $6.4 trillion.
Passage is only the start of the process. Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will be responsible for producing the most cuts, said he had known for only a couple of weeks what was expected of him.
Making the cuts will not be easy. For instance, the House Financial Services Committee must produce 10-year savings of $29.8 billion, which budget experts believe will come from dismantling the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The federal government took over both programs in 2008. But Representative John Campbell, Republican of California and the co-author of bipartisan legislation to phase out Fannie and Freddie, said he did not believe the exercise should make or cost money.
"What we do with Fannie and Freddie should be linked to housing finance, not about plugging a $10 billion hole in the federal budget," he said. "That would be very short-sighted."

Full text: Stocks retreated on Tuesday, but a batch of large-cap shares touched new highs with the help of portfolio managers buying top performers near the end of the quarter.
With the first quarter ending on Friday, portfolio managers adjusted holdings by buying some of the best performers to dress up their portfolios. A total of 175 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange reached 52-week highs on Tuesday, including the Dow components Home Depot and I.B.M., along with high-end retailers.
"As long as the economy continues to improve, the market will continue to go up, and that's what's happened," said Bryant Evans, an investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Ill.
The moves follow three months of big gains, putting the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on track for its best quarter since the third quarter of 2009. It follows a similarly strong run in the fourth quarter of 2011, with gains for the last six months totaling 25 percent.
On Monday, the three major stock indexes rallied more than 1 percent after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled that supportive monetary policy would remain in place.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke said in an ABC News interview, when asked about the potential for more stimulus action, that the Fed was not taking any options off the table.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 43.90 points, or 0.33 percent, to 13,197.73, on Tuesday. The S.& P. 500-stock index fell 3.99 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,412.52. The Nasdaq composite index was down 2.22 points, or 0.07 percent, at 3,120.35.
Apple touched another record high of $616.28 and closed with a market capitalization of $572.92 billion. The stock closed at $614.48, still up 1.2 percent for the day.
Among Dow components hitting 52-week highs, I.B.M. climbed to $208.56 and then slipped slightly to close 0.3 percent lower, at $207.18.
Walt Disney shares rose to a 52-week high of $44.50, only to slip to $44.15, off 0.5 percent. Home Depot stock reached a 52-week high at $50.34, then gave up some of that gain to end at $50.04, off 0.2 percent for the day.
Among market sectors, the S.& P. technology and financial indexes led quarterly gains, with technology up 22.1 percent and financials up 22 percent for the quarter so far.
Among top-performing stocks, Bank of America, the second-best performing S.& P. 500 stock for the quarter, is up 75 percent; Sears is No. 1, up 130 percent.
"You'll see fund mangers continue to rotate, and the technical bias is up right now, so that bodes well for quarterly window dressing," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.
Some investors say further gains will be difficult since the rally has lasted months without a major correction.
The market's sharp gains have followed improving economic data in the United States, as well as accommodative measures by central banks around the world.
In the latest economic report, the consumer confidence index dipped in March to 70.2, just below the median forecast, while Americans ratcheted up inflation expectations to the highest level in 10 months, according to the Conference Board, a private industry group.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 18/32, to 98 11/32, and the yield fell to 2.19 percent from 2.25 percent late Monday.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Tipping for hotel concierges, bellhops and housekeepers moves up and down with the economy, but lately it has also been affected by changes in corporate, airline and hotel policies.
The airlines' checked bag fees offer a prime example. Since luggage got wheels, more travelers have been eschewing porters and taking their own bags up to their hotel rooms. But the airline fees have made things worse, said Adam Weissenberg, a vice chairman at Deloitte & Touche who leads the firm's American travel, hospitality and leisure division.
"People are packing lighter so they can bring just a carry-on and avoid the fees," he said. "The other day, I was sitting in a lobby for 20 minutes, and not one business traveler used a bellman."
The bag fees have also affected skycap tips, said Calvin Miller, who has worked as a skycap for five years at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. He said that he was paid $2.13 an hour plus tips, and that those tips had decreased by 30 percent since the airlines started charging the fees.
"The more people have to pay for baggage fees, the less money they are going to give to skycaps," he said. "It would be nice if the money could trickle down to the workers who are giving the service."
Business decisions that hotels made when the economy was weak have also affected tips. Many upscale hotels cut their rates to attract customers and fill rooms, but the clientele they attracted was not the tipping kind, said Joseph Sundberg, porter captain at Kimpton's Hotel Monaco in Portland, Ore.
In the down economy, "guests who come on a budget may not be able to tip as generously," he said, "or maybe they don't know the customs."
Guests may leave luggage and laptops with him for the afternoon, he said, and ask multiple times if it will be kept safe. But when they come back to collect their belongings, he said, they often do not leave a tip.
"If it is so valuable to them, isn't it worth a couple of dollars for the person who kept it secure?" said Mr. Sundberg, who has been at the hotel for 16 years. Tips, he said, can be a significant part of a bellhop's total compensation.
He added, though, that repeat guests who travel for business tended to tip the same amount no matter what was going on in the economy. "If their business is bad, they're not going to let it affect you," he said.
Greg Frutchey, who has been a bellhop with the Morgans Hotel Group in Manhattan, said he had had similar experiences with budget travelers who were not familiar with gratuity customs. They may shop for bargains in the city, he said, and then ask the bellhop to weigh their suitcases and wait while they repack them to avoid airport overweight charges, without leaving a tip.
When the American economy faltered, said Kayse Gehret, a massage therapist who works as a contractor at a number of San Francisco hotels including the Ritz-Carlton and the St. Regis, many of her American clients disappeared, but her appointments with foreign guests increased.
"That really affected my income because many of them were not aware that people in the U.S. tip for services," she said. Some hotels now automatically bundle the gratuity in with the service, she said.
The economic downturn also meant fewer business trips and trips of shorter duration, both of which affected housekeeping tips.
"When people just get in and out, they may not feel as obligated to tip the housekeeper, compared to when they've stayed for a longer time," Mr. Weissenberg said.
Some hotels leave a note saying who cleaned the room to remind guests of the service they are getting, although they are wary of making the guests feel uncomfortable if they do not leave a tip, he said. Still, housekeepers' wages are generally low, so leaving $3 to $5 a day can make a big difference to them, he said.
Freddie Floyd, a concierge at the Sanctuary Hotel, an upscale boutique hotel in Midtown Manhattan, said that tips for housekeepers were more affected by the economy than his own tips were.
"People feel more obligated to tip someone who performs a service right in front of them, like calling for a reservation," he said. "But when they come back to their room and it is magically clean, they don't associate a certain person with it," so they may not feel as compelled to tip, he added.
Mr. Floyd said that his clients did not tip him any less during the recession, but that their requests were slightly different.
"They still asked me for restaurant suggestions so they could take their clients out for a nice meal, but some wanted a place that seemed economically prudent, rather than superluxurious," he said. While some guests requested the hotel's Bentley, others preferred less obviously luxurious vehicles, he said.
Corporate restrictions on travel expenses can also affect gratuities. Per-diem expense allowances have not risen with inflation at most companies, said Michael McCall, who is the chairman of the marketing and law department at Ithaca College's school of business and who studies the hospitality industry.
That kind of control on expenses, along with reduced client entertainment budgets, has affected tips for hotel restaurant servers, Mr. Weissenberg said.
"While the average tip on a dinner bill has stayed at 15 or 20 percent," he said, "the total bill might be less," as people choose the less expensive wine for a client dinner or manage their own per-diem costs more carefully.
Concierge tips at some hotels are down for the same reason. With smaller expense accounts, "there aren't as many people using their services to book expensive excursions like a helicopter trip in Las Vegas or last-minute show tickets in New York," Mr. Weissenberg said.
That has seemed to change in recent months, though.
Brandon Perkins, a concierge at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles, said that he noticed a turnaround last year and that business was just about back to normal with his luxury travelers.
"The demand for high-priced services and experiences is on the rise," he said. "Travelers are back to requesting top-dollar Lakers tickets, access to movie premieres and private custom tours."
Service providers in all expense categories have reason to be optimistic.
"Based on our research, business people plan to travel more and increase their travel spending in 2012," Mr. Weissenberg said, and conferences and conventions are growing again.
"This should have a positive impact on tips for hotel staff members," he said. "Or, as the Las Vegas taxi drivers say, 'more trips is more tips.' "

Correction: April 2, 2012, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on the Itineraries page on Tuesday about the effect of business policies like airline baggage fees on the income of people who rely on tips misstated the surname of a skycap at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston who commented on the issue. He is Calvin Miller, not Harris.

Bernanke Says Faster Growth Is Needed to Bolster Job Market

Abstract: More than 40 percent of the unemployed are in this category, compared with less than 25 percent after other recent recessions. "Because of its negative effects on workers' skills and attachment to the labor force, long-term unemployment may ultimately reduce the productive capacity of our economy," Mr. Bernanke told a meeting of business economists in Virginia.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In a speech that sought by turns to deflate optimism and pessimism about the labor market, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Monday that the Fed's efforts to stimulate growth were gradually reducing unemployment, but that the scale and duration of the problem could leave lasting scars on the economy.
"Recent improvements are encouraging," he said. However, he continued, "millions of families continue to suffer the day-to-day hardships associated with not being able to find suitable employment."
Mr. Bernanke said he was particularly concerned about the unusually large share of the unemployed who have been unable to find work for six months or more. More than 40 percent of the unemployed are in this category, compared with less than 25 percent after other recent recessions.
"Because of its negative effects on workers' skills and attachment to the labor force, long-term unemployment may ultimately reduce the productive capacity of our economy," Mr. Bernanke told a meeting of business economists in Virginia.
In describing the Fed's efforts to improve growth as being important and productive, Mr. Bernanke countered recent speculation that the Fed might not continue those policies until at least the end of 2014. The Fed intends to hold short-term interest rates near zero through 2014, and has been investing in government debt to further reduce long-term interest rates.
Mr. Bernanke did not say that the Fed was considering new measures, a subject of intense speculation among investors. But stock markets, the prime beneficiaries of the Fed's easy-money campaign, liked the speech all the same. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.39 percent on Monday.
"Those who are looking for a major shift in Fed policy will be disappointed," Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, wrote in a brief commentary on the speech. She added, however, that Mr. Bernanke "will continue to resist and override dissenters in his own ranks to keep and perhaps even expand monetary policy accommodation."
Ms. Swonk, who attended the speech, noted that the absence of any mention of inflation was unusual, suggesting that Mr. Bernanke remained confident that faster inflation was not an imminent threat.
Critics, including some Fed officials, argue that the central bank's policies are likely to cause inflation because the central bank is trying to stimulate growth in an economy already running near capacity.
Unemployment remains at a high level, but those concerned about inflation say that general stimulus will not help because the problems are structural, including, for example, a lack of desirable skills.
Mr. Bernanke said Monday that structural unemployment might have increased in recent years, but that high unemployment was mostly a cyclical phenomenon, the result of the general economic malaise.
"The continued weakness in aggregate demand is likely the predominant factor," he said. "Consequently, the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policies, by providing support for demand and for the recovery, should help, over time, to reduce long-term unemployment as well."
Mr. Bernanke outlined several reasons for this conclusion. While employers have always preferred to hire people who have been out of work for short periods, that preference has not increased in recent years as might be expected if the long term unemployed were languishing because they lacked relevant skills. Hiring also remains weak across a range of industries, suggesting broad causes.
The Fed also faces critics who agree with this analysis and argue that it should be stimulating the economy more aggressively to reduce unemployment more quickly. Some Fed officials, and many outside economists, argue that the Fed could stimulate the economy most effectively by helping the moribund housing market by buying mortgage-backed securities.
Mr. Bernanke himself outlined the stakes in grim detail Monday, describing the toll of long-term unemployment on workers and on the economy. Studies find that people who cannot find work for extended periods suffer permanent declines in wealth, health and earnings potential. And, their skills deteriorate.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- "The Hunger Games" hit the box-office bull's-eye over the weekend, taking in a record $155 million in North America and setting up what promises to be one of the biggest film franchises of this decade.
Backed by a meticulously executed marketing campaign from Lionsgate, "The Hunger Games" was a gigantic No. 1 and set multiple sales records, including the strongest opening weekend total for a spring release, not accounting for inflation. The previous record holder, "Alice in Wonderland," directed by Tim Burton, took in $116.1 million over its first three days in March 2010 and went on to surpass $1 billion in ticket sales at the global box office.
Nobody is predicting that kind of worldwide total for "The Hunger Games," partly because, unlike "Alice in Wonderland," it was not made available in 3-D, which costs $3 to $5 more per ticket to see. But "The Hunger Games" could easily take in $500 million to $700 million, depending on overseas interest, box-office analysts said. Lionsgate said international ticket sales for the weekend were estimated at $59.3 million.
"It proves that distributors don't have to wait until the summer or the holiday season to release tent poles," said Phil Contrino, editor of Boxoffice.com, using Hollywood slang for broad event films. "If a movie looks intriguing, customers will show up, no matter what the calendar reads."
He added: "This opening is a passing of the baton. The end of 'Harry Potter' and the impending 'Twilight' finale resulted in a marketplace that was hungry for a new, popular franchise to cling to." The roughly $155 million for "The Hunger Games" opening weekend is the third biggest in Hollywood history, not accounting for inflation, behind only "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" and "The Dark Knight," according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data.
"The Hunger Games," directed by Gary Ross ("Seabiscuit"), stars Jennifer Lawrence as a 16-year-old who is forced to battle other children to the death for a futuristic society's televised amusement. Lionsgate and Nina Jacobson's Color Force Productions adapted the movie from Suzanne Collins's best-selling novel of the same name for about $80 million.
Three more films, based on the remaining two books in Ms. Collins's "Hunger Games" trilogy, are planned. More than 24 million copies of the trilogy are in print in the United States alone, according to Scholastic, the books' publisher.
"The Hunger Games," rated PG-13, represents the kind of out-of-the-park successes that can transform a studio. The release represents a stunning reversal for Lionsgate, which has been struggling mightily of late, with flops over the last two years like "Killers,""Conan the Barbarian" and "Warrior."
Lionsgate, until now mostly known for the defunct "Saw" franchise and for distributing Tyler Perry's movies, pursued "The Hunger Games" as part of a strategy -- set by its former movie chief, Joe Drake -- of taking on more ambitious films for bigger box-office payoffs. Mr. Drake, who was replaced at the studio in January but has remained to see "The Hunger Games" to fruition, was understandably ebullient over the weekend as ticket results trickled in.
He wrote of the Lionsgate team in an e-mail: "I'm watching the looks on their faces as the numbers come in and they realize what they've accomplished -- the greatest joy in the business!!!"
Another Lionsgate executive who was crucial to "The Hunger Games," Alli Shearmur, was also replaced in recent months, a result of the studio's acquisition of Summit Entertainment. The runaway success of "The Hunger Games" puts pressure on Jon Feltheimer, Lionsgate's chief executive, to prevent even more of the people responsible for the biggest success in his company's history from leaving.
Hollywood and some Wall Street investors are closely watching to see if Lionsgate can retain its chief marketing officer, Tim Palen. Mr. Palen, whose departure could prompt others to leave, has formed close ties to Ms. Collins.
"The Hunger Games" received strong critical reaction, and audiences in exit polls gave it an A score, which means the movie will probably play well in the weekends ahead. Lionsgate said the audience was 39 percent male, which is another sign of a cultural juggernaut. In comparison, the "Twilight" movies have been mostly a female phenomenon; the audience for "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part I" was only 20 percent male, for instance.
People interested in going to the movies over the weekend would have had a hard time escaping "The Hunger Games," which played in 4,137 locations, including 268 Imax theaters. Greg Foster, president of Imax Filmed Entertainment, credited a "flawless" marketing campaign by Mr. Palen and "an incredibly satisfying film."
The second-biggest film in North America was "21 Jump Street," which took in about $21.3 million for Sony and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, lifting its two-week total to a robust $71.1 million. "Dr. Seuss' The Lorax" (Universal) was third, selling about $13.1 million in tickets for a four-week total of $177.3 million. "John Carter" was fourth, taking in $5 million (for a four-week total of $62.3 million), while Relativity Media's "Act of Valor" was fifth, taking in $2.1 million (for a five-week total of $65.9 million).
Despite experiencing one of the biggest flops in memory, "John Carter," which forced Disney to take a $200 million write down, Hollywood has sharply improved its performance over last year. Even before "The Hunger Games" arrived, attendance for the year was 18 percent higher than the same period in 2011, fueled by hits like "The Lorax" and "The Vow." Now attendance is now up 22 percent.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- A main indicator of business sentiment in Europe unexpectedly fell deeper toward recession territory Thursday, compounding concerns about the global recovery after signs of slowing manufacturing in China.
The gloomy data provided a reminder that, despite the aura of calm in Europe after months of debt-crisis fever, the 17 European Union members that use the euro still have fundamental problems.
Major stock indexes in Europe fell broadly Thursday, and the euro slipped against the dollar, after a survey of purchasing managers suggested that growth in the euro zone declined in the first three months of the year. That would be the region's second consecutive quarter of negative growth, which would meet the broad definition of a recession. Stocks were also down in the United States. Reinforcing the survey results, manufacturing orders in the euro zone fell 2.3 percent in January from December, according to a report Thursday by Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office. That was a slightly bigger drop than expected.
The figures suggest that the euro zone is still struggling even after a flood of cash from the European Central Bank helped calm fears of a banking crisis and credit crunch.
"The easing of the sovereign debt crisis has apparently failed to bring about a lasting improvement in business sentiment," Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note to clients. Reports next week should offer more clues about the direction of the European economy.
On Monday, the Ifo Institute in Munich will release its monthly survey of business sentiment in Germany, seen as a reliable indicator of growth in the country, the euro zone's largest economy. On Wednesday, the central bank will release its monthly report on the euro zone's money supply, which economists will watch for signs of a recovery in bank lending.
A report by the European Systemic Risk Board, which monitors Europe's financial system, warned that banks remained under pressure as they tried to reduce risky assets and find new sources of capital.
"The main issue is how to ensure the provision of credit to the economy in the current environment," the board said. It includes representatives of the central bank, the European Commission and financial industry regulators.
In China, weak external and domestic demand continued to weigh on the manufacturing sector in March, a survey released Thursday showed, raising expectations that the Chinese authorities would step up measures to revive economic momentum.
The survey of purchasing managers in the Chinese factory sector, released by HSBC, showed that activity declined in March for the fifth consecutive month, as the Chinese economy felt the pain of feeble global economic activity.
China has become a major market for European products as varied as heavy machinery and luxury goods, so a slowdown there worsens problems in Europe.
The preliminary reading in the China survey for March dropped to 48.1 from 49.6 in February. Readings below 50 signal contraction, and even though the reading provides only an early insight into this sector of the Chinese economy, the decline was disappointing.
The Australian dollar, which is acutely affected by signs of weakness in China, dropped against the United States dollar after the economic figures were released. Oil and gold prices also declined.
In Europe, the purchasing managers' survey, compiled by Markit Economics, slipped to a three-month low of 48.7 in March from 49.3 in February. In that survey, too, a reading below 50 indicates a contraction in economic activity.
The Markit survey also pointed to a decline in German manufacturing. That is particularly worrisome, because German exports have helped to compensate for sluggishness in Southern Europe as countries like Italy and Spain cut government spending to reduce debt.
"Any hope that the manufacturing cycle is turning rapidly in the euro area is dashed by today's numbers," Stella Wang, an analyst in London for Nomura, wrote in a note. But she said the figures were unlikely to prompt the European Central Bank to cut its benchmark interest rate from 1 percent, because inflation remained above the official target of about 2 percent.
The Chinese and euro zone economies are closely linked because many German exports, including cars and heavy machinery, are sold there. China has become the largest market for Volkswagen and other German companies.
"With new export orders sluggish and domestic demand still softening, China's slowdown has yet to finish," Xiaoping Ma and Qu Hongbin, economists who follow China for HSBC, wrote in a research note.
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist in Hong Kong for Credit Agricole, wrote in a research note about the purchasing managers' index, that "the drop is quite large, especially given that March tends to bring an improvement."
Although the reading is likely to reinforce fears of a hard landing for the Chinese economy, Mr. Kowalczyk emphasized that the slowdown in manufacturing activity was expected to be temporary and that he continued to believe China would have a soft landing, with overall growth this year of 8 percent.
The upside is that Beijing has a fair amount of firepower it can deploy to stimulate growth. May analysts say they expect the authorities to employ a range of these tools as the year progresses.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service, which has proposed closing 3,700 offices, is setting up services inside small grocery stores as it tries to maintain service while trimming billions of dollars in costs.
The agency has been losing $35.7 million a day, and 85 percent of its 32,000 offices do not make enough to cover their expenses. So it is hoping that working with retailers to put stamps and a modicum of mailing services alongside beer and lottery tickets will help put a dent in its growing deficit.
The Postal Service has long allowed retailers to sell postage. But now it is arranging to provide some basic mailing services in stores in rural areas like Brant, Mich., a town of just over 2,000 about 30 miles southwest of Saginaw.
The post office there closed last year because it did not have a postmaster and another post office was nearby.
Last October, the Postal Service contracted out services to Nixon's Grocery, a store known primarily for its produce and fresh meats. Although it does not provide the full range of mailing services, residents can mail letters, buy stamps and send packages. There are also 20 post office boxes for rent.
The store's owner, Gary Nixon, said he received about $500 a year from the Postal Service for the setup.
"We didn't do it for the money," Mr. Nixon said. "It's a service for our customers. People really appreciate it."
There are currently 10 stores across the country serving as village post offices. Two more are expected to open this week, and an additional 26 are under contract but waiting for equipment. The Postal Service said it had gotten more than 600 inquires from other communities that are interested.
The village post office is one of the many ways the Postal Service is seeking to cut cost as revenue declines. The agency said it could not tell how much it would save by setting up shop in small groceries and hardware stores, but it did say it expects to save $200 million annually by closing branches.
The agency is also looking to offer products in other places where customers are already shopping, like drugstores and retail chains, and to expand its services at office supply stores.
Sue Brennan, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service, calls the arrangements with stores a win-win for local communities and the service.
"We want to have a presence in these communities, but we simply can't continue to do what we are doing," Ms. Brennan said. "These village post offices saves us money and still provides needed services in the communities.
Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said the Postal Service should consider using major retailers like Walmart.
"It works for banks and pharmacies," Mr. Carper said. "There is no reason why you couldn't have a post office branch in a Walmart store. They are located all across rural America."
The Postal Service said it was considering several options.
Congress plans to begin work on several postal bills in the next few weeks that are aimed at restructuring the Postal Service's finances.
The volume of mail has plummeted with the rise of e-mail, online coupons and electronic bill-paying. Volume is down 25 percent from five years ago, and projections show even further declines, said Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe.
But federal law prevents the Postal Service from raising postage rates faster than inflation.
Meanwhile, the agency has had a tough time cutting costs to match the revenue drop, with a history of labor contracts offering generous health and pension benefits and no layoff provisions, and laws that restrict its ability to cut the frequency of deliveries.
Postal Service officials say that a major factor behind the agency's $20 billion in losses over the last four years is a 2006 law requiring it to pay an average of $5.5 billion annually for 10 years to finance retiree health costs for the next 75 years. One bill pending in Congress, co-sponsored by Mr. Carper, would lower the payment and stretch it out over a 40-year period.
Postal Service officials say village post offices in grocery stores and other locations will not save the agency, but will help reduce costs while maintaining services.
"Any savings we can get helps us move toward financial stability," Ms. Brennan said.

Full text: General Mills posted a quarterly profit in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday and stood by its lowered full-year forecast as it faced higher costs for raw materials.
"Fiscal 2012 has represented a challenging operating environment, with the highest level of commodity inflation that we've seen in 30 years," the chief executive, Ken Powell, said.
Mr. Powell said sales momentum in the current quarter would somewhat ease the gross margin declines that hurt results in the most recent quarter.
The company, which makes Cheerios cereal and Green Giant vegetables, among other grocery products, said income fell to $391.5 million, or 58 cents a share, from $392.1 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, earnings were 55 cents a share, matching the 55 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
The company cut its full-year outlook in February to $2.53 to $2.55 a share from a previous forecast of $2.59 to $2.61, citing weak sales.
On Wednesday, the company stood by that full-year forecast.
Sales in the most recent quarter, which ended Feb. 26 and was the third quarter of General Mills's fiscal year, jumped 13 percent to $4.12 billion, helped by price increases and last year's acquisition of a controlling stake in the Yoplait yogurt brand. In the retail segment in the United States, the company's largest business, earnings fell 4 percent as a result of higher raw material costs, lower sales volume and higher advertising expenses.
By segment, sales rose in cereals, baking products, snacks and simple meals, were flat for Pillsbury USA and fell at Yoplait, which has suffered from increasing competition from Chobani and other Greek yogurt brands.
General Mills has said commodity costs increased 10 percent to 11 percent in fiscal 2012 because of higher prices for ingredients like grain.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Havens can pose their own risks.
That is the reality that holders of Germany's government bonds now must face. The value of German bonds -- considered a shelter from Europe's debt storm during the last two years -- has started to fall, now that investors sense a calming in other European waters.
On Wednesday the yield -- or effective interest rate demanded by markets -- on the benchmark 10-year German bond rose as high as 2.07 percent, an 18 percent increase from last week. Later in the day, it fell back somewhat, to 1.98 percent.
Because bond yields rise as their prices fall, that means investors holding them now feel proportionately poorer than they did last week. A lot of those holders are big European banks, which have enough problems already without having to worry about their bunds, as German bonds are known.
The spiking yields partly reflect a shift by hedge funds and asset managers into debt issued by countries like Italy and Spain. Those offer a much higher interest rate -- but are evidently not considered quite as risky as they were just a few months ago, as Europe shows signs of having muddled through the worst of the crisis.
As long as that crisis was raging, Germany's relatively robust economy and aura of financial discipline made its bunds seem such a safe bet that the yield fell well below the rate of inflation as their prices rose.
Investors were effectively paying the German government to keep their money safe -- as holders of United States Treasury bonds have been doing in recent years. (Holders of Treasuries are also now experiencing a similar decline in the market value of their haven assets.)
The change in European sentiment is good news for Italy and Spain because it means at least some investors no longer regard their bonds as impaired.
Italy's 10-year bond was yielding 4.9 percent Wednesday -- still a higher interest rate than Germany's, but well off the 7 percent interest rates and more that investors were demanding that Italy pay last November.
But there is a dark side for European banks, which have loaded up on haven bunds the last two years. Europe's 90 biggest banks had holdings of German government debt that regulators valued last June at 489 billion euros ($645 billion).
Some analysts even speak of a bursting bund bubble.
"The bund is probably the most widely held asset in European banks," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "Any further decay in a widely held asset like bunds would be unwelcome, and would contribute to a contraction in credit that I think is the next big problem for Europe."
One problem is that many banks booked gains from German bonds when they underwent official stress tests last summer. The profits helped offset other losses and reduced pressure on the banks to raise more capital. It could be a problem for some banks if those bund profits proved to be ephemeral.
Some economists and European policy makers have watched the decline in German bonds with concern.
Otmar Issing, the former chief economist of the European Central Bank, who remains influential with central bankers, said in a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday that the price of bunds and United States Treasuries had become "distorted" because of their haven status.
Peter Praet, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said at the same conference that banks had been benefiting until recently from the safety status of their German bonds, which made it easier for them to satisfy regulators' demands that the banks reduce risk.
As a sign of the bunds' rising value on the open market last year, the yield on the 10-year bunds went from about 3.5 percent in April to as low as 1.67 percent in September. Now some of those gains are turning into losses.
"What is the potential impact of that distortion?" Mr. Praet asked.
The answer is probably that no one knows. Detailed information on banks' current bond holdings is lacking.
Many will certainly benefit from the recovery by Italian and Spanish bonds, as well as the return of relative calm to European financial markets. But any big shift in such a huge market, especially when prices had reached levels widely considered to be extreme, offers a potential for disruption.
Much depends on how much more bund prices fall, and their yields rise.
Gianluca Salford and Aditya Chordia, analysts at J.P. Morgan in London, forecast in a note to clients this week that the yield on the 10-year bund would not rise above 2.2 percent. That would be about the same level as in December.
Some analysts even say that moderately higher yields on German bonds would be healthy. The resulting decline in the value of the bonds "is not necessarily pleasant news for German banks," which have large holdings of their own country's debt, said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.
But, "I'm not too worried given the levels we have which are not very high," Mr. Veron said. "If we went to significantly higher bond yields, 3 or 4 percent, it would be an entirely different situation. But we're not there and I'm not sure we're going there."
An auction of German bonds on Wednesday showed that they retain their allure.
The government sold debt maturing in two years at a yield of 0.31 percent. Shorter-term bonds almost always have lower interest rates than longer-term bonds. That was up from 0.25 percent at the previous auction on Feb. 22, but still well below the 0.51 percent that buyers bid last September.
Germany also further burnished its reputation as a fiscally prudent country on Wednesday, as Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet approved a budget plan that aims to cut the government deficit to just 0.35 percent of gross domestic product in 2014, two years earlier than previously planned.
The ratio was 1 percent for 2011 -- compared with 8.5 percent for Spain.
And yet, a disruptive lurch in German bond prices is still a risk. Hedge funds and asset managers, who are the most active traders, stand to make immense profits by dumping German bunds and buying longer-term bonds from so-called peripheral countries like Spain and Italy.
These investors are betting that the worst of the debt crisis is over, and yields of peripheral country debt will continue to fall in relation to German debt.
"If you time this right, this will continue being the trade of the year," said Mark T. Muller, a managing director at Credit Suisse in Frankfurt who specializes in debt. "Bunds are probably overvalued and some other countries are undervalued. There is money on the table."
The most common explanation for the rise in German bond yields is that they are coming back to more normal levels as fear of a euro zone Armageddon subsides.
But another reason for the yield surge may be that investors see potential weaknesses in Germany. If the crisis heats up again, as many analysts say it will, Germany is the country that would bear the greatest share of the cost. Its creditworthiness could then slip.
"Whenever there is a disbursement to a Greece program or a Portuguese program, Germany is on the hook for roughly one quarter of the bill," said Mr. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics.
He is also skeptical about another premise for Germany's status as a refuge from the financial crisis: that it has a robust economy. Mr. Weinberg noted that the German economy shrank in the last quarter of 2011, and that recent data shows a slowdown in orders to German manufacturers.
"Based on the numbers I see," Mr. Weinberg said, "the notion that Germany is safe as an economy doesn't hold any water."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Two of the White House's nominees to fill vacancies on the Federal Reserve board moved closer to confirmation on Tuesday after a routine Senate hearing.
The Senate banking committee held a hearing to test the two candidates, the Harvard economist Jeremy C. Stein and Jerome H. Powell, a former private equity executive and Treasury official. If the committee approves the two candidates as expected, perhaps as early as next week, and they pass a Senate vote, the Fed would have a full roster of seven confirmed governors for the first time in six years.
The confirmation process for the two capital markets experts comes amid a tense political climate. For months, the White House has lashed out at Congress for failing to vote on confirming important economic policy makers, including nominees to the Fed board. Lawmakers, in turn, have criticized the White House for starting to vault over the traditional confirmation process.
But Professor Stein and Mr. Powell seem to be candidates chosen to avoid a fight. The nomination of Mr. Powell, a Republican, is the first time in nearly 25 years that a president has nominated a member of the opposing party to the Fed's powerful board, not counting the position of chairman. Mr. Powell is currently a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington-based research group.
Professor Stein is an acclaimed academic economist. He served on President George H. W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, and advised the Obama administration for six months in 2009.
The two nominees made few waves during the short and generally amiable hearing on Tuesday, in which they discussed how to start shrinking the Federal Reserve's bloated balance sheet, the appropriate course of monetary policy and transparency at the institution.
Both nominees underscored their specialized knowledge of financial and capital markets -- expertise in relatively short supply on the Fed's board at the moment. The board currently consists of Ben S. Bernanke and Janet L. Yellen, both academic economists; Elizabeth A. Duke, a former banker; Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former regulator; and Daniel Tarullo, a law professor.
Professor Stein said his research tried "to understand the real-world details of how monetary policy filters through the banking system to ultimately impact borrowers and lenders," according to his prepared testimony.
Mr. Powell said his "practical experience of the private sector and the financial markets would provide a valuable perspective" to the Fed's internal deliberations, according to his prepared testimony.
Only four senators quizzed the nominees during the question-and-answer period: Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota and the committee's chairman; Kay Hagan, Democrat of North Carolina; Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey; and Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the committee's ranking member.
Both of the nominees said the Fed should consider tightening interest rates to fight off inflation before the end of 2014 if economic conditions merit it. The Fed has said it plans to keep short-term rates close to zero until late 2014.
If "the economy were to strengthen materially faster than expected, it would be absolutely warranted to revisit the path of the easing," Professor Stein said. Mr. Powell agreed, saying he would carefully weigh the Fed's dual mandate to maintain price stability and promote full employment.
In 2010, Senator Shelby put a hold on the nomination of Peter A. Diamond, a Nobel laureate in economics and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to join the board. Still awaiting confirmation, Professor Diamond withdrew his nomination last year. Thus far, no senators have voiced significant opposition to the two current nominees.
But nominations remain a contentious issue between the White House and Congress. This winter, President Obama bypassed the Senate and installed two nominees using recess appointments.

Full text: Pressured by tightened Western economic sanctions and a burgeoning black market for dollars, with Iranian citizens desperate to buy them, Iran's central bank has loosened its strict foreign exchange policy, allowing money traders there to sell dollars for rials at the unofficial market rate, rather than the artificially fixed official rate.
Few Iranian money changers had been willing to sell dollars at the official rate, 12,260 rials to the dollar, because it was unprofitable for them.
The glaring absence had caused a surge in illicit money changing in Iran, in which buyers who needed dollars were willing to pay ever-increasing numbers of rials for them, pushing the unofficial market rate to about 19,000 rials to the dollar.
Economists said the eased exchange rate restriction, which was announced on Sunday, appeared to be a bow to reality.
"It was extremely difficult to outlaw a market that the people desperately need," said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an Iranian economics professor who teaches at Virginia Tech and has followed the foreign exchange problems confronting Iran. "Iranians were doing this outside the formal market, so letting it become formal was logical."
Dollars and precious metals like gold are coveted in Iran because they have proved to be an effective hedge against the rial's weakness from worsening inflation, estimated to be more than 20 percent a year.
Dollars are also in high demand in Iran because they are needed for travel abroad and for other foreign expenses like overseas college tuition. The appetite for dollars in Iran has put even more pressure on the rial, which has lost about half of its value in the past year.
Economists said the eased exchange rate restriction, which now simply requires money changers to report the rate at which they sell dollars for rials, would provide the central bank with more precise information about the domestic demand for dollars and enable it to track the disparity between the official rate and the market rate more accurately.
The official rate was designed in part to prevent a flight of capital from the country.
But the eased policy creates new risks for Iran's government by raising the likelihood of such a capital flight, as Iran's economic isolation increases because of the sanctions imposed by Western powers in response to its disputed nuclear energy program.
The sanctions have targeted the banking and oil sectors of Iran's economy and have made it increasingly difficult for Iranian companies to import needed goods and conduct business abroad.
The sanctions are expected to intensify further in coming months, as the European Union imposes a boycott of Iranian oil starting on July 1 and the United States enforces a new law that can penalize any foreign company that does business with Iran's central bank by denying that company access to the American market.
The eased policy on currency trading also appeared to be one of the central bank's first public responses to its expulsion from a global telecommunications network of banks that took effect on Saturday, part of the tightening vise of sanctions.
The expulsion from the network, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, severed an important link between international financial markets and up to 30 Iranian financial institutions, including the central bank.
Iranian leaders have denounced the sanctions and vowed to find ways to bypass their effects. The Iranians have negotiated barter deals with Russia and India to avoid spending dollars and other foreign currencies, for example.
Reuters reported Monday that Pakistan had decided to export one million tons of wheat to Iran in a barter arrangement, possibly in exchange for Iranian iron ore.

Full text: Investors will be closely watching for another rise in interest rates when trading resumes on Monday, after the bond market's sharpest move in nearly six months caught some traders by surprise last week.
Despite the sudden swing higher, most Wall Street strategists are playing down the danger of a surge in interest rates, which have been historically low because of demand for bonds from both the Federal Reserve and private investors wary of all but the safest assets.
The sell-off last week was caused by increasing signs that the economy might finally be gaining steam, lifting the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds to 2.31 percent on Friday, from 2.04 percent a week earlier. That was the biggest move in bond yields, which move inversely to bond prices, since October, when rates briefly topped 2.4 percent.
"It clearly caught everyone's attention," said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist for Northern Trust in Chicago. "When something moves like this, by definition it's a surprise."
More data confirming that the economy is gaining momentum could come later this week. In addition to data expected on Tuesday and Wednesday on housing starts and existing home sales, the Commerce Department will disclose the latest figures for sales of new homes on Friday. And on Thursday, the Conference Board will announce its index of leading economic indicators for February.
After meeting last Tuesday, the Federal Reserve acknowledged the slight upturn in economic conditions but reiterated its intention to keep short-term rates near zero through late 2014. That was despite an earlier warning from one regional Fed president, Jeffrey M. Lacker of Richmond, that rates might have to be raised sooner than that to head off any risk of inflation.
While rising bond yields can undermine prices for stocks and indeed signal the threat of inflation, Mr. McDonald said he did not think they were a threat right now. Instead, he said, the uptick in rates represents a "normalization" for bond yields, which are near historic lows.
"At worst, it's a very mild yellow signal," he said. "It's far from a flashing red."
And although everything from car loans to mortgages to credit card rates are keyed off of bond yields, and go up when yields rise, Mr. McDonald said he did not think consumers should be too concerned, at least for now.
"There's a much bigger risk from rising gas prices than rates," he said. "That's a very visible consumption tax."
Strategists, money managers and other experts said last week's move in rates was spurred by the Federal Reserve's statement about improving economic trends, as well as the largely upbeat results also announced on Tuesday from the stress tests performed by the Fed on 19 large banks. Regulators will now permit a host of banks to raise dividends and buy back stock, another sign of the financial sector's recovery since the financial crisis.
At the same time, the recent move by bond investors to largely accept a steep write-down in the face value of Greek debt, along with support for local financial institutions from the European Central Bank, has helped ease concerns, for now, about the Continent's sovereign debt problems. When fears were surging about Europe late last year and earlier this year, many investors sought out United States Treasury bonds as a rare haven.
"The message is that maybe things aren't as bad as people thought," said Carl Kaufman, a portfolio manager in San Francisco with Osterweis Capital, which has $5 billion under management. "You can't have it both ways with healthy banks, a stronger economy, and still have a zero interest rate policy."
Bonds typically sell off during periods of stronger economic growth, when inflation is more of a threat, and in better economic conditions investors also favor riskier assets like stocks, as opposed to safer, fixed-income holdings.
In fact, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.4 percent last week and now stands at its highest level since May 2008, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the onset of the financial crisis.
David Kelly, chief market strategist for J. P. Morgan Funds, said he thought the upward tick in rates might encourage some corporate borrowers and home buyers to act now, before rates moved higher.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out rates wouldn't stay in this range," he said.
Despite last week's run-up, though, rates remain very low by historical standards.
Between 1990 and today, the typical yield on the 10-year bond averaged 5.25 percent, and even for the last five years, the average, 3.38 percent, was significantly higher than it is now, according to Ira Jersey, United States interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse. At about this time last year, he noted, the 10-year bond yield was 3.4 percent.
"This happened a little sooner than we expected," he said. "We thought it was going to be a second-half-of-the-year event."
Nonetheless, Mr. Jersey said he expected rates to stay between 2.10 and 2.42 percent, rather than embark on a swift move higher. "We don't expect this to be a long-term trend that will take us back to a yield of 3.4 or 4 percent," he said.
He added that if rates were to keep moving higher, the Fed would most likely step in with another round of "quantitative easing," buying up bonds to force rates lower. In particular, the Fed wants mortgage rates to remain low in an effort to help the housing market heal. Mortgage rates have increased slightly in recent days, but remain below 4 percent.
"If you got back to 4.4 percent or 4.5 percent, the Fed would get nervous," Mr. Jersey said.

Where Divorce Can Be Denied, Orthodox Jews Look to Prenuptial Contracts

Full text: CHICAGO -- Before a packed house of 350 men and women at a Jewish educational center, Beverly Siegel suggested three questions that religious Jewish women should ask before divorcing: "Do I get a get? Do I not get a get? Hmm, what kind of get should I get?"
Ms. Siegel, a Chicago filmmaker, was screening her 2011 documentary, "Women Unchained," about Jewish women whose husbands refuse to give a religious divorce known as a get. Less religious Jews divorce with no thought to the get. But in traditional Judaism, the husband may withhold the divorce. The women are considered agunot, or "chained wives." A recent survey found that between 2005 and 2010, there were 462 cases of agunot in North America.
Even if she has obtained a civil divorce, a chained wife, or agunah, cannot remarry within the faith. If she does, children from her new marriage carry a stigma forever. In exchange for a get, husbands often demand reduced alimony, favorable child-custody arrangements, even cash payouts.
Ms. Siegel became interested in agunot after a friend from synagogue told her that his daughter was being refused a get. The friend eventually had to cover his son-in-law for more than $400,000 to secure the get, including paying outstanding mortgage and credit-card bills.
In prewar European villages, a man might answer his door to find muscled goons hired by his father-in-law to encourage him, so to speak, to release his wife. In Israel today, some reluctant husbands are jailed until they issue gets. But in the United States, secular courts cannot interfere in a religious divorce, and violence is likely to result in an arrest, as in the case of a Lakewood, N.J., couple apprehended last July for arranging the kidnapping and beating of a man who refused to give a get. So, some are promoting a more civilized solution.
During a discussion after "Women Unchained," Ms. Siegel urged Jewish couples to sign the prenuptial agreement devised 20 years ago by the Beth Din of America, a leading Orthodox religious court.
Couples who sign the Beth Din of America halakhic prenuptial agreement -- "halakhah" means Jewish law -- agree to have all religious aspects of their divorce decided by a Jewish court. More important, the husband agrees that if the couple separates, he will pay his wife $150 per day until they are religiously divorced, adjustable for inflation. In other words, he will support his wife until he gives her a get, which is the Hebrew word for the Jewish divorce document.
There are many versions of the religious prenuptial agreement, but the one promoted by the Beth Din of America, which is based in New York, seems most widely used. Asked how many couples sign the agreement, Rabbi Shlomo Weissmann, the court's director, said not enough.
"The goal would be to have it universally adopted across the entire Orthodox community," Rabbi Weissmann said by telephone. "Repeatedly and consistently, even in extremely adversarial situations, the prenup has worked to prevent agunah situations and the improper use of the get in divorce negotiations."
In 2006, the Rabbinical Council of America, a separate organization affiliated with the Beth Din of America, passed a resolution encouraging rabbis not to perform a wedding without a halakhic prenuptial agreement. About two years ago, Rabbi Weissmann said, a Beth Din of America survey found that about 70 percent of its affiliated rabbis required or encouraged couples to use the document.
"There certainly are segments of the Orthodox Jewish community that have not embraced it," Rabbi Weissmann said. "When we talk about wedding practices, these are ancient and sacred practices, and when you start tinkering with them, people start getting nervous."
Hannah Scholl, 23, a graduate of Stern College, an Orthodox women's school in Manhattan, is not married, but she encourages her religious friends to use the halakhic prenuptial agreement. It is not always an easy sell, she said.
"I have a friend who is bright, who has considered that not everything will end up perfectly," Ms. Scholl said last week, hours before the Jewish holiday of Purim. "And I have been badgering her about signing a prenup. I think there's this discomfort with it in the more right-wing community, because it is considered innovative on some level."
And talking about a prenup can seem like a bad omen, Ms. Scholl said. "Some people are uncomfortable with it because they feel, 'Why are you starting a marriage thinking along the lines of it dissolving?' "
Ms. Scholl is one organizer of a social media campaign on behalf of the country's most famous agunah, Tamar Epstein. Ms. Epstein is still religiously married to Aharon Friedman, tax counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee. They were separated in March 2008, and she received a civil divorce in April 2010.
But Mr. Friedman has refused to give her a get. Their case has been covered by The New York Times, Politico.com and The Huffington Post. At public events, Ms. Epstein has encouraged women to sign halakhic prenuptial agreements.
During the panel discussion at Spertus, a Jewish educational center near Grant Park in Chicago, Rabbi Gedalia Dov Schwartz, who is featured in "Women Unchained," mentioned one possible hope for chained wives: an annulment.
If a marriage began under false pretenses, Rabbi Schwartz said in a telephone interview, it can be considered never to have taken place. Such a case might involve a spouse's failure to disclose homosexual tendencies, an abusive streak or a gambling addiction.
"If he had this addiction," Rabbi Schwartz said this week, "and he had covered it up, and once they get married, he goes through his money, his wife's money, he cleans out her accounts, he's gambling it away, he goes to the casinos, and back and forth -- that's a deception."
Rabbi Schwartz cautioned that for an annulment to occur, a spouse's flaw must have been present but hidden before the marriage. In the end, the prenuptial agreement matters because a rabbi can do only so much.
"I can't break the law," Rabbi Schwartz said -- although others sometimes do. He said he had recently met a Russian Jewish immigrant from a "semi-Hasidic" community. "I was talking in his presence about the problem of the chained women," the rabbi said, "and he said in Yiddish, 'What's the problem? We don't have a problem! We beat them up.' "

Abstract: The return on cash is typically the expected rate of inflation plus some real interest rate that is derived from the rate a central bank sets to promote growth. (A black swan, a term popularized by the economist Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is the unlikely event that too few people plan for.)

Full text: THE stock market seems to have found its footing lately, touching levels not seen since early 2008.
So I was surprised to hear Jean L. P. Brunel, chief investment officer at GenSpring Family Offices, tell me that he was preparing his clients for a sustained period of low investment returns. And further, he is counseling those clients -- families with hundreds of millions of dollars -- that they may need to spend less or change their estate plan.
If this is his advice for the wealthy, what does it mean for people with considerably less, who may simply be saving for retirement?
Mr. Brunel argues that the classic link among the return premiums for bonds over cash and stocks over bonds still holds, but they are substantially lower because of the low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve.
Here is how it works. The return on cash is typically the expected rate of inflation plus some real interest rate that is derived from the rate a central bank sets to promote growth. The return on bonds is cash plus some additional amount to account for the duration of the bond. The return on equities is the bond returns plus some premium for the risk associated with stocks.
He noted that cash typically had a return of 4 percent, putting bonds at 6 percent and stocks at 8 to 9 percent. With cash now yielding zero, that has lowered bonds' return to 2 to 2.5 percent and stocks to 5 percent. The problem, as he sees it, is that too many people are stuck on the old numbers.
"I don't want you to read into this that we have precise information on real returns," he said. "I could be wrong. It wouldn't be the first time. But whichever way you cut it, the environment is radically different."
Sure, the stock market is off to a nice start this year. But 2011 also started strong -- until the tsunami in Japan and the uprisings throughout the Arab world touched off a downward spiral. For the year, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished flat, unless you include dividends, which put it up 2.1 percent.
We'll find out if Mr. Brunel's gloomy take is right. But in the meantime, his forecast of low returns is worth thinking through.
LOWER EXPECTATIONS The consensus among other analysts I spoke with is that most people should plan for single-digit investment returns for a while. That time horizon ran from five to as many as 20 years, in the case of Jim Russell, regional investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
"If we're able to generate returns above that, that's a good problem to have," he said. "Most clients think the worst is over, but most professional investors think the black swan event is possible." (A black swan, a term popularized by the economist Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is the unlikely event that too few people plan for.)
Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer for the Northeast at Wells Fargo Private Bank, said the issue for many clients was the effect of negative real interest rates on their portfolios. This is often a hidden problem because, for example, a 10-year United States Treasury bond was paying 2.295 percent on Friday, but core inflation is around 3 percent. In other words, owning government bonds costs investors money.
"Over the past decade or two, we've had positive real rates of return," Mr. Cronk said. "We talk about purchasing power risk, scarcity of income for portfolios and duration risk, but a negative real interest rate is a challenge for the bond market."
Maria Elena Lagomasino, chief executive of GenSpring, said clients were not pleased with the implications when she talked to them about Mr. Brunel's calculations. "The clients get mad when you say what we thought was true in the past may not be true in the future," she said. "Maybe it won't happen. But what if it does?"
HOW IT ENDS Mr. Brunel's forecast is bleakest in how he believes the environment of low investment returns will end: global hyperinflation to reduce government debt burdens.
Given this gloomy time, he may well be overly pessimistic -- the flip side of being overly optimistic when it seems that markets can only go up. (Mr. Brunel said that even his son was rooting against his end-game prediction.)
"A lot of our clients are worried about the after-effects of this global liquidity glut and what it will be" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for personal financial services at Northern Trust. "The world is awash in developed market currencies. You can inflate your way out of it or you can grow."
She falls on the side of slow but steady growth.
Mr. Cronk said that the notion of using inflation to deal with too much government debt was an old one. While he agreed that anything was possible, he also said that he expected moderate inflation and moderate growth in gross domestic product.
"It won't be 5 to 6 percent, but a positive 2.5 or 3 percent growth rate that would allow interest rates to move higher," he said. "It would reinflate the value of risk assets so you'd get more normal returns."
Growth that small, he said, probably will not quickly reduce the unemployment rate.
SOLUTIONS When, how and if returns on traditional assets return to old levels is not the immediate issue. Rather, the question is how people should plan for years of low returns, particularly when retirement may be near.
The easiest strategy is to spend less. But telling people to cut back is as difficult a conversation to have as telling people that the old model is broken.
"The day we do that is the day the relationship walks out the door," Mr. Russell said. Instead, he shows clients portfolio simulations so they can see what the current return rates mean for the future.
If these return predictions are wrong, the worst that can happen is people have more money. (Mr. Brunel is more concerned, he said, with the overly optimistic return projections that many, often underfunded, pension funds are making, since they will have to pay out a set amount of money at some point.)
The other option, which the analysts I spoke to all agreed on, is for people to rigorously practice mental accounting -- one of the main tenets of behavioral finance. By putting money in various fictional baskets or buckets, people can become more comfortable about the money they have. As long as the money for the next five years is safe, the thinking goes, clients are less apt to touch the money meant for after that.
Mr. Cronk suggested that investors consider a medium-term basket, which would be for securities that have an income stream. "You need to look for income in nontraditional sources -- places where there is growth and income streams over time," he said. He said he had been recommending real estate investment trusts, master limited partnerships and dividend-paying stocks for his wealthy clients. But these are all securities that most investors can buy.
For the money in the basket meant for growth, Mr. Brunel recommended securities that focus on global issues not tied to the economy of any one country: consumer demand, the need for more energy and technological innovation.
Of course, this is predicated on a long-term view -- and an ability to wait. "Things do recover," Ms. Nixon said. "It just takes time."

Full text: Lawmakers in Iran subjected the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to an unprecedented interrogation on Wednesday, questioning his economic policies, cabinet appointments and tense relationship with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a publicly broadcast parliamentary session that seemed intended to humiliate the president in the final few years of his tenure.
The hourlong interrogation, carried live on Iran state radio, was the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that an Iranian president had been required to appear before lawmakers to answer their questions.
The session itself seemed to reflect the emboldened position of Ayatollah Khamenei in a power struggle with Mr. Ahmadinejad, a former ally, who has irritated the supreme leader and alienated many members of the overwhelmingly conservative Parliament in recent years. Although Mr. Ahmadinejad is also a conservative and shares their antipathy toward the West and many Western values, some of his actions have challenged the Islamic religious hierarchy's pre-eminence.
Undaunted, Mr. Ahmadinejad declared at the outset that he did not want to attend, and he responded to the questions evasively, dismissively and sometimes sarcastically, offending the interrogators and leading some to call for his impeachment. At the least, the session amounted to an unusual public airing of the tensions in Iranian politics at a time when the country is straining under major outside pressure.
Analysts of Iranian politics said it was highly unlikely that Mr. Ahmadinejad would be impeached, a prospect the Parliament has often threatened. But some said the interrogation further diminished the prospects that he would be able to cultivate a protege to run in the 2013 presidential elections or even exert any political influence after his term expires. Such an outcome was already in doubt from the results of the March 2 parliamentary elections, in which his supporters lost many seats to rival conservatives.
"His opponents smell blood," said Alireza Nader, an expert on Iran at the Washington offices of the RAND Corporation, a research group. "But in some ways the threat of Ahmadinejad has receded. I really don't see it in the interest of the system for him to resign or be impeached. It makes more sense for Ahmadinejad to fade away."
An official catalog of 10 questions in the interrogation covered issues that included Mr. Ahmadinejad's unexplained personnel decisions, unachieved economic growth rates, Iran's acute inflation and mysteries over missing money allotted to improve Tehran's mass transit system.
Conspicuously absent in the questioning, however, was foreign policy, notably Mr. Ahmadinejad's defiance of Israel and the West in promoting Iran's disputed nuclear energy program, which is widely supported in Iran even though many Iranians are feeling the pressure from harsh economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union.
Two specific questions related to Mr. Ahmadinejad's efforts to dismiss his former intelligence and foreign ministers, moves that directly challenged Ayatollah Khamenei's authority.
Last year, the president tried to dismiss the chief of the Intelligence Ministry, the government branch that exerts widespread control over domestic life. Ayatollah Khamenei ordered that the minister, Heydar Moslehi, keep the post, but Mr. Ahmadinejad stayed home for 11 days before heeding the demand in what was taken as a show of pique.
"What justification did you have for your 11-day resistance to the supreme leader's decree?" asked Ali Motahari, a lawmaker who is a conservative antagonist of Mr. Ahmadinejad's and asked the questions. Mr. Ahmadinejad denied he had defied the ayatollah and responded, "Work did not stop for a single day."
In late 2010, Mr. Ahmadinejad unceremoniously dumped Manouchehr Mottaki, the foreign minister and a Khamenei ally, while Mr. Mottaki was on a mission to Senegal.
The disputes weakened Ayatollah Khamenei's close bonds with Mr. Ahmadinejad, who was first elected in 2005 and won re-election in 2009 in a suspiciously lopsided vote, supported by the ayatollah. The election incited widespread political unrest that was harshly suppressed.
Questioned about his failure to control soaring prices of basic goods, which outside economists have partly attributed to the phasing out of state subsidies and a steep decline in the value of the rial, Iran's currency, Mr. Ahmadinejad was dismissive. "The reason behind these inflations is something else which I will explain at a proper time," he said.
Questioned about his chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who has been accused by lawmakers of heading a "deviant current" in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Revolution, Mr. Ahmadinejad said only that he supports Iran's "history."
At the end, Mr. Ahmadinejad equated the questions to a school quiz concocted by simplistic instructors, and said he expected to get a top grade. "To me, those who designed the question were among those who got a master's degree by just pushing a button," he said, provoking anger from lawmakers who considered him rude and condescending.
"Needless to say, Ahmadinejad did not endear himself to the deputies," said Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a professor of political science at Syracuse University.
In what appeared to be another political slap at Mr. Ahmadinejad, Ayatollah Khamenei announced on Wednesday the new makeup of the Expediency Council, a group of elders who act as advisers to the supreme leader. The most significant element of the announcement was the reappointment of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president, as the council's chairman. Although he has a wary relationship with the ayatollah, Mr. Rafsanjani is known to deeply dislike Mr. Ahmadinejad. The new council members also included a former culture minister whom Mr. Ahmadinejad had dismissed.
Nonetheless, Iran political experts said that Mr. Ahmadinejad's own tenure seemed secure, judging by the confident insolence he displayed.
"His performance was the performance of a man safe in the knowledge that he will not be impeached," said Farideh Farhi, a professor at the University of Hawaii who is an expert on Iran. "The members of Parliament cried foul that he insulted and mocked their questions," she said, "but a concerted effort to push for the next step is highly unlikely because everyone is quite aware of the costs of bringing him down in the midst of all the external pressures Iran is under."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve on Tuesday offered a slightly more upbeat account of the American economy, but added that it planned to continue its efforts to improve growth.
The Fed cited the improving job market and increased spending by households and businesses as reasons for increased optimism in a statement after the regularly scheduled meeting of its policy-making committee.
But the statement remained dour in its overall tone, predicting "moderate economic growth," and just a gradual decline in unemployment, cold comfort for more than 23 million Americans still unable to find full-time work.
Among the persistent causes: The housing market remains deeply depressed, Europe is still unstable and rising oil prices threaten to crimp other spending -- the same combination that derailed growth last year.
The Fed said that rising oil prices also would increase the rate of inflation, but it predicted the effect would be temporary, and that the rate of increases in prices and wages subsequently would settle "at or below" its desired annual rate of 2 percent.
The language in Tuesday's statement was incrementally more positive than the statement released after the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in January, but the Fed's outlook remained considerably more subdued than that of other forecasters, who have embraced signs of stronger growth.
The committee "is clearly shifting its stance away from blanket gloom to something more realistic, but they have a long way to go," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States. economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting firm in Valhalla, N.Y.
But Fed officials see ample reasons for their continuing concern.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, testified before Congress two weeks ago that a recent surge in job creation was outpacing broader indicators, like consumption of goods and services, and therefore was likely to slow down.
The central bank also has overestimated the strength of the recovery several times in recent years. Three years ago this week, Mr. Bernanke told the television program "60 Minutes" that he saw "green shoots" of nascent recovery.
Last spring Fed officials once again saw green shoots -- although they had learned at least one valuable lesson, and were no longer using the term -- and they began to talk about reducing the central bank's support for the economy.
This time, Fed officials seem to be waiting until they are sure. "The Fed can hardly be accused of acting as a cheerleader for the recovery," Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
While the policy-making committee did not announce new policies Tuesday, it said that it planned to continue its campaigns to help growth. The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since the end of 2008, and the statement affirmed its plan to maintain that effort until late 2014, at least.
The Fed also continues to stockpile Treasury securities in an effort to further reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The Fed holds about $2.5 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, and it is shifting $400 billion into securities with longer terms, to increase the impact on long-term rates. It does not plan to begin winding down the portfolio before 2015.
Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, cast the sole dissenting vote on the 10-member committee. Mr. Lacker said after a similar dissent in January that he believed the Fed would need to raise short-term interest rates sooner than late 2014 to check a rise in inflation.
The Fed's efforts are providing a modest but measurable boost to the economy, according to a number of independent studies. That has led some Fed officials to call for a fourth round of purchases. Under one such proposal, the Fed would buy mortgage securities to help the housing market.
But Mr. Bernanke, who exercises disproportionate influence over the committee's decisions, has said he would support new purchases only if the economic outlook deteriorated, and provided that inflation remained below 2 percent.
The statement released Tuesday said nothing about the possibility of additional asset purchases. More information about the committee's deliberations may come in three weeks, when the Fed releases an account of the meeting.
The next meeting of the policy-making committee is scheduled for April 24-25.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The scheduled meeting Tuesday of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee is unlikely to resolve the foremost question confronting the central bank: What happens next?
The Fed plans to complete by the end of June its current campaign to suppress long-term interest rates, keeping borrowing costs low for businesses and consumers. Some Fed officials see no reason for new measures, as the economy appears to be gaining strength. Others are eager for a new campaign, arguing that the recovery remains weak. But public remarks by Fed officials suggest a decision will not come before the committee's next meeting in April.
First, there is a mystery to resolve: The Fed is not sure how fast the economy is growing. Some of the main measures, which produce a murky picture in the best of times, are now telling divergent stories. In particular, people do not appear to be buying enough goods and services to sustain the rising pace of job creation.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, testified before Congress last month that job growth would probably slow because the other measures tended to be more accurate. But he added that the reverse also could be true. And the Fed would like to know the answer before it decides whether it should promise new efforts to improve growth.
"In light of the somewhat different signals received recently from the labor market than from indicators of final demand and production, however," Mr. Bernanke said, "it will be especially important to evaluate incoming information to assess the underlying pace of economic recovery."
The significance of the pending decision is easy to overstate. The Fed is already engaged in an immense campaign to improve growth, which it has said it plans to continue for the next three years. The central bank is holding short-term interest rates near zero, and it has amassed a $2.5 trillion portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to pull down long-term rates. Any new program probably would amount to only a modest increase in the scale of the overall effort.
While many members of the policy-making board, the Federal Open Market Committee, remain ambivalent about doing more, Mr. Bernanke and others on the committee have made clear they are not giving serious thought to doing less.
"I am comfortable with the current stance of monetary policy," Sandra Pianalto, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said earlier this month. "Doing more at this time could create too much inflation risk, and doing less could risk weakening an already slow expansion and causing an unwelcome disinflation."
The current campaign to reduce borrowing costs, nicknamed Operation Twist, was begun in September. The Fed is buying $400 billion in long-term Treasury securities, increasing competition and in that way forcing other investors to accept lower interest rates. The Fed is also selling the same volume of short-term securities so that the purchases do not increase the size of its balance sheet.
The program extends the Fed's earlier attacks on long-term rates through the purchase of more than $2 trillion in long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
The Fed paused after each of the first two rounds of purchases, only to watch the economy falter. Mr. Bernanke has said that he is again inclined to pause and wait for evidence that the recovery is losing momentum. Many analysts have accordingly concluded a new round of purchases is unlikely.
But Vincent Reinhart, an economist at Morgan Stanley who served as the Fed's chief monetary policy official during the early years of Mr. Bernanke's tenure, said he still believed there was a 75 percent chance that the Fed would act by June.
In a note to clients last week, Mr. Reinhart said the recovery remained weak, inflation remained under control and the public remarks of Fed officials suggested to his practiced ear that they intended to act. And waiting any longer than June, he said, would inject the Fed into the presidential campaign.
"Economic slack persists and inflation is running below the Fed goal in its medium-term projection," Mr. Reinhart wrote. "The dual shortfall from its mandate provides both justification and political cover for action."
One possibility advocated by some committee members is a tailored effort to aid the housing market through increased purchases of mortgage securities.
Such a program would renew the concerns of critics, including some Fed officials and many Republican politicians, that its efforts to spur growth will impede its ability to respond with necessary speed and force when the pace of inflation begins to rise. Some argue that this could happen soon.
The Fed finances its purchases by creating money, but it has sought to address concerns that this could spur inflation by preventing the money from circulating. For the first two rounds of purchases, it paid the banks that sold securities to keep the money that they were paid on deposit with the Fed. During the current campaign, because it is buying some securities and selling others, the Fed is taking in exactly as much money as it is pumping out.
In any new campaign, the Fed also may consider a variant on those strategies, borrowing as much money as it spends by taking short-term loans called reverse repurchase agreements -- in effect, a different way of paying banks to keep the money off the streets. The Wall Street Journal first reported this possibility.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- China said Saturday that its monthly trade deficit reached $31.5 billion in February, its weakest performance in over a decade and the latest indication of slowing growth in the nation's economy.
The huge size of the deficit surprised analysts, but they also cautioned that trade figures covering the first two months of the year tend to be distorted here by the Chinese New Year holiday.
In January, China recorded a trade surplus of about $27.3 billion. For the two months combined, exports rose about 7 percent, while imports rose by about 7.7 percent, according to government data.
Still, with China's economy beginning to moderate amid growing signs of weakness in Europe, there are concerns that global growth will slow as well.
Chinese leaders are already preparing for more moderate growth this year, closer to 7 percent, a significant slowdown from the last few years when growth was cresting closer to 9 or 10 percent.
China also reported last week that industrial production and retail sales had slowed in the first few months of this year. In addition, China's once-booming property market has been showing signs of weakness.
But few economists are predicting a hard landing in China, which is now the world's second-largest economy after the United States. There are signs of more moderate growth here, with inflation easing. Many analysts said they believed that Beijing could use monetary and other policy measures to stimulate growth, if necessary.
In a report issued Friday, HSBC analysts in China called for the Chinese government to increase "easing" policies meant to free up money and stimulate growth.

Abstract: According to the Pew Research Center, the proportion of young adults living at home nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008, before the Great Recession hit. Though it's easy to blame the high cost of cars or gasoline, Comerica Bank's Automobile Affordability Index shows that it takes fewer weeks of work income to buy a car today than in the early 1980s, and inflation-adjusted gasoline prices didn't get out of line until a few years ago.

Full text: AMERICANS are supposed to be mobile and even pushy. Saul Bellow's Augie March declares, "I am an American ... first to knock, first admitted." In "The Grapes of Wrath," young Tom Joad loads up his jalopy with pork snacks and relatives, and the family flees the Oklahoma dust bowl for sun-kissed California. Along the way, Granma dies, but the Joads keep going.
But sometime in the past 30 years, someone has hit the brakes and Americans -- particularly young Americans -- have become risk-averse and sedentary. The timing is terrible. With an 8.3 percent unemployment rate and a foreclosure rate that would grab the attention of the Joads, young Americans are less inclined to pack up and move to sunnier economic climes.
The likelihood of 20-somethings moving to another state has dropped well over 40 percent since the 1980s, according to calculations based on Census Bureau data. The stuck-at-home mentality hits college-educated Americans as well as those without high school degrees. According to the Pew Research Center, the proportion of young adults living at home nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008, before the Great Recession hit. Even bicycle sales are lower now than they were in 2000. Today's generation is literally going nowhere. This is the Occupy movement we should really be worried about.
For about $200, young Nevadans who face a statewide 13 percent jobless rate can hop a Greyhound bus to North Dakota, where they'll find a welcome sign and a 3.3 percent rate. Why are young people not crossing borders? "This generation is going through an economic reset," said John Della Volpe, who directs polling at Harvard's Institute of Politics, which surveys thousands of young people each year. He reports that young people want to stay more connected with their hometowns: "I spoke with a kid from Columbus, Ohio, who dreamed of being a high school teacher. When he found out he'd have to move to Arizona or the Sunbelt, he took a job in a Columbus tire factory."
In the most startling behavioral change among young people since James Dean and Marlon Brando started mumbling, an increasing number of teenagers are not even bothering to get their driver's licenses. Back in the early 1980s, 80 percent of 18-year-olds proudly strutted out of the D.M.V. with newly minted licenses, according to a study by researchers at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. By 2008 -- even before the Great Recession -- that number had dropped to 65 percent. Though it's easy to blame the high cost of cars or gasoline, Comerica Bank's Automobile Affordability Index shows that it takes fewer weeks of work income to buy a car today than in the early 1980s, and inflation-adjusted gasoline prices didn't get out of line until a few years ago.
Perhaps young people are too happy at home checking Facebook. In a study of 15 countries, Michael Sivak, a professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute (who also contributed to the D.M.V. research), found that when young people spent more time on the Internet, they delayed getting their driver's licenses. "More time on Facebook probably means less time on the road," he said. That may mean safer roads, but it also means a bumpier, less vibrant economy.
All this turns American history on its head. We are a nation of movers and shakers. Pilgrims leapt onto leaky boats to get here. The Lost Generation chased Hemingway and Gertrude Stein to Paris. The Greatest Generation signed up to ship out to fight Nazis in Germany or the Japanese imperial forces in the Pacific. The '60s kids joined the Peace Corps.
But Generation Y has become Generation Why Bother. The Great Recession and the still weak economy make the trend toward risk aversion worse. Children raised during recessions ultimately take fewer risks with their investments and their jobs. Even when the recession passes, they don't strive as hard to find new jobs, and they hang on to lousy jobs longer. Research by the economist Lisa B. Kahn of the Yale School of Management shows that those who graduated from college during a poor economy experienced a relative wage loss even 15 years after entering the work force.
Perhaps more worrisome, kids who grow up during tough economic times also tend to believe that luck plays a bigger role in their success, which breeds complacency. "Young people raised during recessions end up less entrepreneurial and less willing to leave home because they believe that luck counts more than effort," said Paola Giuliano, an economist at U.C.L.A.'s Anderson School of Management. A bad economy can boost a person's weighting of luck by 20 percent, Ms. Giuliano found.
Notice how popular the word "random" has become among young people. A Disney TV show called "So Random!" has ranked first in the ratings among tweens. The word has morphed from a precise statistical term to an all-purpose phrase that stresses the illogic and coincidence of life. Unfortunately, societies that emphasize luck over logic are not likely to thrive.
In the mid-'70s, back when every high school kid longed for his driver's license and a chance to hit the road and find freedom, Bruce Springsteen wrote his brilliant, exciting album "Born to Run." A generation later, as kids began to hunker down, Mr. Springsteen wrote his depressing, dead-end dirge, "The Ghost of Tom Joad." We need to reward and encourage forward movement, not slouching. That may sound harsh, but do we really want to turn into a country where young Americans can't even recognize the courage of Tom Joad?
Maybe it's time to yank out the power cords, pump up the flat bicycle tires or even reopen Route 66 -- whatever it takes to get our kids back on the road.

Full text: WITH ample reason, President Obama has grown impatient with my industry.
In a recent speech at the University of Michigan, he said that while most new jobs in coming decades would require college training, access to higher education is increasingly threatened by runaway tuition growth. "We're putting colleges on notice: you can't assume that you'll just jack up tuition every single year," he said. "If you can't stop tuition from going up, then the funding you get from taxpayers each year will go down."
Because annual federal subsidies to higher education exceed $30 billion, the speech got college administrators' attention. Yet some experts remain skeptical. Diane Ravitch, for example, the New York University professor and former assistant secretary of education, has urged college presidents to resist the "accountability juggernaut."
Higher education has long been a primary source of America's competitive advantage, so government officials would be wise to proceed cautiously. But an examination of the economic forces that have shaped the higher-education market in recent decades suggests that there may be promising opportunities to curb tuition growth.
Some of that growth has resulted from a phenomenon called Baumol's disease, after the economist William J. Baumol, who described it in a 1965 article he wrote with William G. Bowen. The basic idea is that while productivity gains have made it possible to assemble cars with only a tiny fraction of the labor that was once required, it still takes four musicians nine minutes to perform Beethoven's String Quartet No. 4 in C minor, just as it did in the 19th century.
College instruction more closely resembles a musical performance than an auto assembly line. Although information technologies have yielded some productivity growth in academia, instruction still takes place largely as it always has.
To recruit professors, universities must pay salaries roughly in line with those made possible by productivity growth in other sectors. So while rising salaries needn't lead to higher prices in many industries, they do in academia and many other service industries.
Because universities are already rushing to use technologies for improving faculty productivity -- for example, Web-based review sessions and homework evaluation -- subsidy reductions won't encourage much additional progress against Baumol's disease. But there's a second major source of tuition growth that universities are less able to ameliorate on their own: the escalating competition for academic prestige.
This phenomenon is rooted in the growing disparities in graduates' starting salaries, which resemble those we've seen for the country as a whole. After adjusting for inflation, starting salaries for most graduates have remained essentially stagnant for several decades, while those at the bottom of the group have actually declined. Only the highest-paid graduates have enjoyed significant salary growth, and among those a very thin slice at the top has seen truly spectacular increases.
Because of the bitter competition for those premium salaries, elite educational credentials are often a precondition for even landing a job interview. With so many applications for every vacancy, many consulting firms and investmentbanks, for example, now consider only candidates from a short list of top-ranked schools.
Degrees from those schools clearly open doors. For example, more than 40 percent of the 2007 graduating class at Princeton landed one of the most highly sought prizes: a position in the lucrative financial services industry.
Universities have responded vigorously to escalating student demands for elite degrees. Their main strategy has been to bid more aggressively for the most distinguished researchers, which explains not only the rapid salary growth for top faculty members in the last several decades, but also the fact that teaching loads at many elite schools have decreased by more than 25 percent. Similar, albeit smaller, changes in salaries and workloads have percolated throughout higher education.
Yet no matter how much universities might spend in pursuit of elite status, only 10 percent at any moment can end up in the top 10 percent. To be sure, the additional expense has not been pure waste. Professors now publish more papers and in the process have generated at least some useful new ideas. But most of their best ideas would have made it into print anyway.
Richard H. Thaler, a former colleague at Cornell and another contributor to the Economic View column, once remarked about an unsuccessful candidate for a faculty position, "What his resume lacked was five bad papers." By that, he meant that while the candidate had published several papers containing enough genuinely important ideas to satisfy any rational hiring committee -- more than could be said of most faculty members -- he had too few to satisfy the bean counters, who fretted about how uninformed outsiders might react to the appointment.
Researchers have responded as expected to these incentives. But the additional papers they've written have added little value. The economist Philip Cook and I found, for example, that in the first five years after publication, many fewer than half of all papers in the two most selective economics journals had ever been cited by other scholars.
TYING federal subsidies to tuition growth would dampen a university's incentive to bid for prestige in much the same way that league-imposed salary penalties in professional sports help curb the bidding wars for superstars. But if the starting-salary gap keeps widening between the highest- and lowest-paid college graduates, this remedy's effectiveness would be temporary at best.
We might consider taking more direct aim at the component of tuition inflation that is attributable to growing salary gaps. Raising taxes on top salaries would be a good idea for American society in general, and not just for higher education. It would not only shrink the effect of salary disparities, but would also generate some much-needed revenue.

Abstract: Looking over her recent cases, Ms. Leginski cited a new college graduate who found work helping the developmentally disabled, a 60-year-old manufacturing specialist whose contract job in Mexico had led to full-time work back home, and a financial services worker who had landed a management job in Charlotte, N.C. Such improvement, if it continues, will most likely be a boost for President Obama as he makes a case to voters that his economic policies have been working. For black men, the jobless rate increased, to 14.3 percent from 12.7 percent, while the biggest employment gains went to whites, black women and, overwhelmingly, college graduates.

Full text: After a stretch of economic expansion so weak that Main Street struggled to detect any improvement, three consecutive months of solid employment growth have begun to lift the mood of consumers and the unemployed.
The economy added 227,000 jobs in February, the Labor Department reported Friday, and though the unemployment rate held steady at 8.3 percent, that was largely because nearly half a million people had joined, or resumed, the search for work in hopes their prospects had improved.
"We've seen a lot less Eeyore," said Sherry Leginski, operations director at CareerPlace, a job placement center in the Chicago suburb of Barrington. "Maybe they're turning a little bit more Tigger instead of Eeyore. They're feeling better."
Looking over her recent cases, Ms. Leginski cited a new college graduate who found work helping the developmentally disabled, a 60-year-old manufacturing specialist whose contract job in Mexico had led to full-time work back home, and a financial services worker who had landed a management job in Charlotte, N.C.
Such improvement, if it continues, will most likely be a boost for President Obama as he makes a case to voters that his economic policies have been working. Republicans quickly criticized it as too little, too late. Still, the report coincided with other signs of strength, like a surge in consumer confidence and growing strength in manufacturing.
"There is no real cloud in the silver lining of this morning's jobs report," wrote Steven Blitz, chief economist of ITG Investment Research.
The big question was whether such improvement could be sustained, or even accelerate, as is necessary to significantly drive down the unemployment rate. Most projections call for slower economic growth in the first quarter of this year than the last quarter of 2011, and a second report on Friday further reduced expectations. The report, showing a higher-than-expected trade deficit, prompted firms like JPMorgan Chase and Macroeconomic Advisers to lower their growth forecasts for this quarter.
The focus, though, remained on more encouraging signs. Public sector job losses, which have been steep, have slowed. Job gains for December and January were stronger than previously reported, the Labor Department said, accounting for 61,000 more jobs than the department estimated last month, and the February report could also have understated the improvement.
Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic research at J. H. Cohn, an accounting and consulting firm, said the recent run of gains was approaching "escape velocity."
There were job gains across a broad swath of industries, including manufacturing, finance, professional services like law and accounting, hotels and restaurants, and mining. The construction industry lost jobs after two months of gains, and the retail sector shrank. For black men, the jobless rate increased, to 14.3 percent from 12.7 percent, while the biggest employment gains went to whites, black women and, overwhelmingly, college graduates.
President Obama said that more companies were bringing jobs back to the United States and that manufacturing was adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s.
Speaking from the floor of a new manufacturing plant in Virginia, President Obama said, "Day by day, we're restoring this economy from crisis."
In a campaign appearance in Jackson, Miss., Mitt Romney, a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, pointed out that there were still 24 million Americans who were unemployed or underemployed, working part time when they would like to have full-time jobs.
Republicans said that President Obama had not done enough to reduce burdens on businesses or to expand domestic energy production, pointing to his blocking of the Keystone pipeline. Virtually all the growth in the trade deficit was linked to higher oil prices, according to an analysis by Capital Economics, a research firm.
Gas prices have not yet risen enough to slow consumer spending, but Friday's report showed that wages are lagging behind inflation.
"This underscores the Federal Reserve's concerns about the economy," said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Mesirow Financial. "There's still a lot of slack; the spending power's not there." Ms. Swonk estimated that 10 to 20 percent of the job gains were because of an unseasonably warm winter, essentially borrowing from spring's normal uptick in activity.
But things are looking up for Martin Okekearu, 58, an engineer in Kansas City, Mo., who has had long dry spells in his eight-month search for work. In the last two weeks, he said, he has received two promising leads from manufacturing firms in the area. One found his resume on the local employment center's Web site. It had been posted there for six months.
Mr. Okekearu, who has a master's degree in engineering management, was relieved to find that either job would make use of his skills. "My younger son says: 'Daddy, they talk about somebody educated -- you are one of them. They talk about somebody experienced -- you are one of them,' " he said.
Others said it had become easier to find income, but only via temporary or freelance jobs.
"My feelings are mixed about the recovery," said Pam Sexton, 45, also of Kansas City, who was laid off by Sprint in 2009. "So far, I've managed to find work, but a full-time, permanent job is somehow elusive to me."
Temporary hiring, often a precursor to permanent hiring, increased by 45,000 jobs. "Companies are more and more interested in converting people from temp to full time," said Tig Gilliam, chief executive of the Adecco Group North America, a staffing company. "That's a really good indicator."
Competition for highly skilled workers is on the rise, according to Applied Predictive Technologies, a technology company in Virginia that is planning to add 60 workers, mostly recent college graduates, to its staff of 150.
"The sense of nervousness and caution that people felt a couple of years ago has really dissipated," said Catherine Baker, senior vice president for marketing and administration. "There's a real war for talent going on."
The recovery has been here before, only to falter. Last February, March and April saw net gains of more than 200,000 jobs each month. But then the effects of high gas prices, the earthquake in Japan and the resurgence of the fiscal woes in Europe kicked in, slowing job growth to a crawl.
"Everyone got burned last year, from being elated over the better economic data only to have their hopes dashed come spring," said Ellen Zentner, an economist with Nomura Securities International. "If we can get past April and these trends continue, I'll breathe easy."
This year, though, the economy appears to be somewhat less vulnerable to shocks. There were 1.4 million more jobs in January than there were last April, and they were spread across more industries and more cities. Consumers have paid down some of their debt and begun to make large purchases, particularly cars.
There was also some evidence that job growth might be stronger than the labor report suggests. For one thing, upward revisions are common during a recovery, and have occurred in each of the six preceding months.
Another good sign, analysts said, was the strength of job growth reported in the department's household survey. The monthly employment report comes from two surveys -- one of businesses, from which the net job growth is calculated, and one of households, which generates the unemployment rate. But the household survey also measures job growth, including some types, like new companies, that the business survey does not capture well.
Household survey respondents indicated that 879,000 more people were working in February than in January. Though it is not unusual for the two surveys to differ, it is unusual for the growth in the household survey to be so much greater.
More people looking for work was also a good sign, said Betsey Stevenson, former chief economist for the Labor Department and now a visiting professor at Princeton University. She noted that among the unemployed, there were fewer people who had recently lost their jobs and more people who had entered or re-entered the work force, or who had quit their jobs, presumably to look for something better.
"You didn't want to quit your job a year and a half ago," she said. "I take that as not just a sign that the labor market is improving, but that workers out there perceive that the labor market is improving."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
I RECENTLY came across a report on the value of taking on some debt that was so simply worded and straightforward that I was startled. Those types of reports, typically, are anything but easy to understand. They're also usually trying to sell something that is complicated.
But then, I wondered about the need for the report, "Leverage: A Thoughtful Approach," part of a series from J. P. Morgan Private Bank called "Managing Wealth in a New World." Have even the very rich become so averse to debt, or leverage as it's called in financial jargon, that they need a primer?
The answer, it appears, is yes. And that is not necessarily a good thing. Debt, after all, allows you to keep cash on hand. On a more complex level, it can allow you to increase your investment returns without taking excessive risks.
When I called the writer of the report, Phil D. Conway, the United States head of capital advisory at J. P. Morgan Private Bank, he confirmed that his aim had been simple. "All we were trying to do with the paper was to get people to think rationally about debt and not irrationally," Mr. Conway said. "There is a healthy way to think about leverage, and that's what I wanted to do with the piece."
He said he realized that most people had either a fight or flight mentality toward debt. "It's sort of like being at an all-you-can-eat buffet," he said. "People gorge themselves when times are hot and then they say they're never eating again until they get hungry. Then guess what? They gorge themselves again."
To continue the analogy, J. P. Morgan and other banks are not about to throw open the doors of the buffet to everyone, and they will make money from lending money to a group of people they are confident can pay it back.
But what interested me was finding the more rational ways that people are using debt. This is not an issue just because interest rates are at historic lows. Instead, there are costs to paying cash for everything and putting money in low-yielding bonds. Here are some of the advisers' thoughts on debt that struck me.
EXTREME CAUTION For the average person, debt is a mortgage, car loan or credit card balance. For the wealthiest, debt can be money borrowed to increase investmentreturns, and it goes by the fancier name of leverage. The goal is to get a return higher than it costs to borrow the money.
John C. Bailey, the founder and chief executive of Spruce Private Investors, which manages $3.2 billion for a group of ultra-affluent families, said his clients were particularly cautious about any leverage today.
"There are two areas where clients have levered historically," Mr. Bailey said. "Only one of them has worked out."
That one way is borrowing to buy commercial real estate. His clients continue to do that, but they are putting more money down.
Borrowing has not worked out, he said, when people have used the money for illiquid investments like hedge funds that are already leveraged. "Leverage on leverage never ends well," he said.
Leverage, after all, not only multiplies returns on the way up, it also quickly compounds losses on the way down.
As to household debt, the advisers said their shrewdest clients were paying that down to levels that were psychologically comforting, if not rational.
John M. Verfurth, managing director at VWG Wealth Management, a division of HighTower, said clients had paid down mortgages to less than $1.1 million, which is the limit of where mortgage interest can be deducted.
And that is true even among people of higher income levels, where the deduction could be phased out starting in 2013 if there is no extension of certain parts of the Bush administration tax cuts.
THE BLINDNESS OF LENDERS At the same time, many more people are taking on more risk than they may realize.
The other side of borrowing money is lending it, and that is what the millions of people who have bought United States Treasuries have done. Being a lender to the federal government carries risks if inflation increases or the economy improves enough that people start selling their Treasury bonds to get higher yields elsewhere.
"What we're telling our clients is it's an incredibly dangerous time to be a lender, particularly to the U.S. government because rates are at historic lows," said Joseph J. Duran, chief executive of United Capital Financial Partners. "If the economy picks up steam and we get any inflation, it will have a huge impact on returns."
Mr. Duran said his firm had completed a study that showed that 1 percent increase in yields on 30-year Treasuries would result in an 18 percent loss in the value of the bond. He added that Treasuries were 3 percent below their historic average yields.
Of course, such advice, built on simple math, can go unheeded when investors remain scared about other options.
"I have clients who are 100 percent in fixed income and who still want to bury their money in the backyard," said Seth J. Finkel, managing director at Neuberger Berman Wealth Management. "Often, I have to explain the risks of being a lender. You used to be able to get safety and income, but now you choose one or the other."
GOOD BORROWING In the end, I found two areas where a little debt, judiciously applied, can be beneficial.
The first is a way to get slightly higher returns without taking on considerably more risk. Mr. Conway gave an example of borrowing 30 percent against $1 million in bonds with two- to three-year maturities so the investor had $1.3 million invested. "My yield could go from 7.5 percent to a little over 8 percent with a modest increase in volatility," he said. "That's a better way to get increased return than going down to buying junk." That may not sounds like a big return but he argues that it is a safer way to increase yields than buying riskier investments.
The other use is for personal needs, and that is through a margin account. While no one is recommending you borrow $105,000 against your bond portfolio to buy a Mercedes SL500, borrowing against a securities portfolio can be an easy and low-cost alternative to taking out a bank loan for a mortgage or business investment.
"A bank may not want to lend $2 million on a $3 million house, but Schwab, who is our custodian, will lend $2 million on a $4 million account at 2 to 4 percent in a few hours," said Marc Singer, founding partner of Singer Xenos Wealth Management. "It's so cheap because the loan is 100 percent securitized and 100 percent liquid. A bank may not want to put that big of a loan on its books."
If a portfolio is earning 5 to 6 percent and a bank will not lend to you, then borrowing against your own money at 3 percent is perfectly rational.
Of course, being a rational investor is not always easy. "You could say I'm comfortable with a stock like Apple, but I bet you could get less volatility in a leveraged bond portfolio," Mr. Conway said.
And volatility, or how much any investment swings up or down, is probably going to determine whether you stick with it.

Correction: March 15, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Wealth Matters column on Saturday, about the financial value of taking on certain debt, misstated current tax law regarding the deduction of mortgage interest. While the maximum for deductible mortgage interest is $1.1 million, that amount is not currently reduced at higher income levels, because of the Bush administration tax cuts that took effect in 2010. (Before that tax cut, the deduction was phased out starting at income levels of $200,000. And when the income stretched into the millions, as much as 80 percent of that deduction was phased out.)

Abstract: Recent data from the Economic Policy Institute shows that the inflation-adjusted hourly wage of college-educated men aged 23 to 29 dropped 5.2 percent from 2007 to 2011, and for female college graduates of the same age, 4.4 percent.

Full text: The job market is showing slow and steady improvement. In February, 227,000 jobs were added. It was the 24th straight month of private-sector job gains, and the third month in a row of gains well above 200,000, the best three-month stretch in nearly two years.
The jobless rate is still 8.3 percent and, at today's slow pace of improvement, it will still take nearly five years before the economy returns to a prerecession jobless rate of 5 percent. By then, Americans will have endured nine years of employment weakness, which for millions will translate into permanently lost opportunities for wage growth and irreversibly diminished living standards.
Washington needs to do more to help. Instead, Congress seems poised to do less.
The federal highway bill, a prodigious job creator, is stalled in the House. Congressional Republicans have also consistently rejected calls for more aid to states, despite the 485,000 jobs lost by public employees over the past two years, and 6,000 layoffs in February alone. Now, some House Republicans are gearing up to demand even deeper budget cuts. Another round of budget fights could hobble business and consumer confidence and more cuts would hobble demand.
President Obama has continued to push job-creation efforts. On Friday he announced plans for a $1 billion network of regional manufacturing hubs. It is a worthy idea, but one that will require Congressional cooperation. He also said that the administration would use $45 million from existing resources at the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies to support investments in advanced manufacturing equipment and research. That does not need Congress's approval, but moving beyond the pilot stage would.
Years into a weak labor market, and with years to go before full recovery, the scars are becoming all too apparent. Recent data from the Economic Policy Institute shows that the inflation-adjusted hourly wage of college-educated men aged 23 to 29 dropped 5.2 percent from 2007 to 2011, and for female college graduates of the same age, 4.4 percent. Joblessness and wage declines are also pronounced for those with only a high school education. For those men aged 19 to 25, wages fell 8 percent from 2007 to 2011. For those young women, the decline was 3.1 percent.
The latest job growth numbers are encouraging. But there is a very deep hole and a lot more climbing to do.

Full text: One way in which Americans have always been exceptional has been in our support for education. First we took the lead in universal primary education; then the "high school movement" made us the first nation to embrace widespread secondary education. And after World War II, public support, including the G.I. Bill and a huge expansion of public universities, helped large numbers of Americans to get college degrees.
But now one of our two major political parties has taken a hard right turn against education, or at least against education that working Americans can afford. Remarkably, this new hostility to education is shared by the social conservative and economic conservative wings of the Republican coalition, now embodied in the persons of Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney.
And this comes at a time when American education is already in deep trouble.
About that hostility: Mr. Santorum made headlines by declaring that President Obama wants to expand college enrollment because colleges are "indoctrination mills" that destroy religious faith. But Mr. Romney's response to a high school senior worried about college costs is arguably even more significant, because what he said points the way to actual policy choices that will further undermine American education.
Here's what the candidate told the student: "Don't just go to one that has the highest price. Go to one that has a little lower price where you can get a good education. And, hopefully, you'll find that. And don't expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on."
Wow. So much for America's tradition of providing student aid. And Mr. Romney's remarks were even more callous and destructive than you may be aware, given what's been happening lately to American higher education.
For the past couple of generations, choosing a less expensive school has generally meant going to a public university rather than a private university. But these days, public higher education is very much under siege, facing even harsher budget cuts than the rest of the public sector. Adjusted for inflation, state support for higher education has fallen 12 percent over the past five years, even as the number of students has continued to rise; in California, support is down by 20 percent.
One result has been soaring fees. Inflation-adjusted tuition at public four-year colleges has risen by more than 70 percent over the past decade. So good luck on finding that college "that has a little lower price."
Another result is that cash-strapped educational institutions have been cutting back in areas that are expensive to teach -- which also happen to be precisely the areas the economy needs. For example, public colleges in a number of states, including Florida and Texas, have eliminated entire departments in engineering and computer science.
The damage these changes will inflict -- both to our nation's economic prospects and to the fading American dream of equal opportunity -- should be obvious. So why are Republicans so eager to trash higher education?
It's not hard to see what's driving Mr. Santorum's wing of the party. His specific claim that college attendance undermines faith is, it turns out, false. But he's right to feel that our higher education system isn't friendly ground for current conservative ideology. And it's not just liberal-arts professors: among scientists, self-identified Democrats outnumber self-identified Republicans nine to one.
I guess Mr. Santorum would see this as evidence of a liberal conspiracy. Others might suggest that scientists find it hard to support a party in which denial of climate change has become a political litmus test, and denial of the theory of evolution is well on its way to similar status.
But what about people like Mr. Romney? Don't they have a stake in America's future economic success, which is endangered by the crusade against education? Maybe not as much as you think.
After all, over the past 30 years, there has been a stunning disconnect between huge income gains at the top and the struggles of ordinary workers. You can make the case that the self-interest of America's elite is best served by making sure that this disconnect continues, which means keeping taxes on high incomes low at all costs, never mind the consequences in terms of poor infrastructure and an undertrained work force.
And if underfunding public education leaves many children of the less affluent shut out from upward mobility, well, did you really believe that stuff about creating equality of opportunity?
So whenever you hear Republicans say that they are the party of traditional values, bear in mind that they have actually made a radical break with America's tradition of valuing education. And they have made this break because they believe that what you don't know can't hurt them.

Full text: A USEFUL way to avoid potholes on the road to retirement is an investment policy statement -- an interactive atlas that will help you get where you're going and show you what to expect along the way.
Financial planners and registered investment advisers have been using them for years with their clients; brokers less so. While the statement is time-consuming to assemble and maintain, it will serve you well, particularly in volatile markets.
The basic investment policy statement puts on paper answers to your questions about objectives, return expectations, risk tolerance, time horizon and portfolio allocation. Should you weight your holdings more toward bonds or stocks? Do you want to save for college and a second home in addition to retirement?
Why is it important to write all of this down? The statement will help keep you focused on your goals. You will not only be taking the appropriate amount of the risk, you will have some idea of how your portfolio will do in a down year.
Most important, once it's reviewed by a fiduciary adviser you engage to take legal responsibility for drafting your retirement plan, your policy statement can show you over time if your return expectations are realistic. Keep in mind that you also need to estimate inflation, market factors and tax liability.
"What matters is after-tax wealth," said Michael A. Dubis, a fee-only certified financial planner in Madison, Wis. "I will tell clients if their return expectations don't make sense. Hope is not a strategy."
Mr. Dubis sees a policy statement as part of a coordinated financial planning process. Although most advisers are generally focused on investments, they can also work with tax, estate and insurance advisers on protecting your assets and helping them grow over time.
To draft a policy statement, you need to determine your investment philosophy. What kind of investor should you be? Can you afford to be aggressive? Maybe not, if your income is tied to a volatile industry like financial services. Are you an active or passive investor? Trading is rarely a good idea when hundreds of index funds are available, offering broad exposure to nearly every market.
Advisers should include in the statement their style of money management, how much they charge, their responsibilities and a periodic review schedule. They may even include some language on what they won't or can't do -- like estate planning or tax planning -- although they often coordinate with other professionals. Even computerized Monte Carlo analyses of the probability of achieving your goals are useful.
Once you review your objectives, what you own, how you want to invest and risk and return expectations over given time periods, you can sit down with your planner to construct a portfolio that's right for you. The amateur investment group Bogleheads provides an excellent introduction to the process.
A draft portfolio is a synthesis of the information you supply your planner. A sample might stress long-term growth in United States and international stocks, along with bonds, real estate investment trusts and inflation-protected securities.
Larry Swedroe, director of research for Buckingham Asset Management in St. Louis, said people needed to do some self-analysis and chat with family members before the final statement was in place.
"You need to separate desires from needs," said Mr. Swedroe, who wrote "The Only Guide You'll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan" (Bloomberg Press 2010). "It's critical to integrate your plan with taxes, estate planning and insurance needs. It's a necessary condition for success, but not a sufficient one."
Mr. Swedroe recommends that clients also do a mind map, which is like a flow chart that shows relationships among family members, assets, advisers, interests, values and goals.
While this process sounds tedious and time-consuming -- it can take up to four meetings to draft and review a policy statement with your adviser -- it is worthwhile because it may address needs you've never discussed with your family or advisers.
What do you do if the market dives just before your retirement? Can you save more? What if you have to support an aging relative? What if you sell some real estate and downsize? Your statement can be adjusted as you go along.
At the very least, your adviser should be able to tell you the worst- and best-case range of returns given your investment allocation. That way, you can insulate your portfolio from a dismal year like 2008.
A few paragraphs on how your adviser will manage your money is also essential before you actually build the portfolio. If his or her objectives differ from yours, you need to discuss it. Do you want an actively managed, aggressive growth strategy? Or are you more focused on capital preservation and income? Don't stay with an adviser whose approach doesn't match your needs.
Like any moving vehicle, an investment policy statement needs regular care, maintenance and rebalancing. It should be flexible to accommodate changes in your life: divorces, aging parents, inheritances. As the route of your journey changes, you may need a new road map.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
A DECADE ago, Jonnie Worth had her eyes on retiring at age 62. Year after year, she funneled money into her 401(k), first when she worked as an event planner and later when she worked in the private banking department at JPMorgan Chase. But the financial crisis of 2008 swamped Ms. Worth. "Like everyone else, I watched my retirement savings plummet," she said. "I lost a big percentage of my investments."
Now 65, Ms. Worth is still working full time; her hopes of retiring at 62 sank along with the 2008 stock market. She does client liaison work for a financial planning firm in Fort Worth, and she still conscientiously puts aside money each month for retirement.
"Nobody else is going to do it for you," she said. As for how much longer she plans to work, she said, "I would say at least five years, maybe longer."
This wasn't how it was supposed to be.
In many ways, things are looking up for America's economy. After several years of roller-coaster-ish volatility, the Dow Jones industrial average has climbed to its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Economic growth, though not robust, has been gathering steam, and the unemployment rate has been inching downward, although fitfully.
While economic experts voice guarded optimism about the overall picture, many experts are highly pessimistic about the part of the tableau involving retirement -- specifically how well (or not well) Americans are preparing for it.
The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College -- the nation's leading research group on this issue -- estimates that 51 percent of households are at risk of not having enough to maintain their living standards after retirement.
A New York Times/CBS News poll in October found that 63 percent of Americans said they did not think they would have enough money to live comfortably when they reached retirement age. And a recent Gallup poll found that 66 percent of Americans said their top financial concern was not having enough money for retirement.
"There's a crisis situation because near-retirees lost 25 percent of their assets in the financial crisis," said Teresa Ghilarducci, a retirement expert at the New School. "It looks like most middle-class Americans will become poor or near-poor retirees."
Whether one is 30, 40, 50 or 60, there are two routes to being adequately prepared: saving enough in the years before retirement (which means many people should be saving considerably more than they are) or pushing back the year of retirement.
"We encourage people to work an extra year or two before retiring because every year you work is in essence a twofer," said David Certner, the legislative policy director for AARP. "It means one more year in building up your pension or 401(k) and one less year withdrawing money to live on in retirement."
Hurt by the downturn and worried that they have saved too little for retirement, many older Americans are working longer -- 18 percent of Americans 65 and over are in the labor force, up from 13 percent a decade ago, translating into an increase of three million workers in that age group.
As for saving money, if someone begins saving $10,000 a year for retirement at age 35, that can easily turn into an impressive nest egg of more than $500,000 by age 65, thanks to compounded investment returns. But if one does not begin saving until age 50 and then sets aside $5,000 a year, that could mean a nest egg of less than $100,000, far less than many experts say is needed. According to the Federal Reserve's most recent figures, the median family 55 to 64 had $98,000 in retirement accounts.
Worried about all the inadequate savings, George Papadopoulos, a financial planner in Novi, Mich., has a maxim. "I tell everybody I talk to -- the earlier, the more, the better," he said. "The earlier you can save and the more you can save and invest, the better the options you will have in life and in retirement."
There is plenty of reason for all the retirement anxiety. Like Jonnie Worth, many Americans lost tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars, when the markets and their 401(k)'s swooned in 2008 -- all told, 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts lost $2.8 trillion in value. Thirty-six percent of American workers age 55 to 64 say they have less than $25,000 in retirement savings, according to a survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. (The number is 52 percent for workers age 45 to 54.) Rock-bottom interest rates have squeezed older Americans who rely on interest from their bond or retirement accounts, and many companies, viewing them as too costly, have eliminated or frozen the traditional pensions that guarantee retirees a solid monthly stipend. Today only 17 percent of workers have such defined-benefit pensions, while 39 percent have 401(k)'s; some in those two groups have both, but an unfortunate 53 percent of all workers have neither.
Housing prices have not recovered from their tumble, making it harder to take sizable sums out of one's home to help finance retirement -- either by selling one's house or through a reverse mortgage. On top of all this, Washington is awash with talk about scaling back Social Security benefits, even though about a third of America's retirees receive at least 90 percent of their income from Social Security. "Half the population looks in pretty good shape, and the other half, I don't know how they're going to make it financially if they retire at 66 or 67," said Jack VanDerhei, research director for the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Boston College research center on retirement, said there was a simple reason so many Americans were unprepared.
"We as a nation have institutionalized too low a savings rate," she said. "Retirement is really expensive. We need to budget a higher percent of our income to it than we are."
Many Americans, she noted, retire at 65 naively thinking they can live comfortably just on Social Security and the $100,000 or so they have in a 401(k). If these people follow the advice of financial planners, she said, they will draw 4 percent each year from their 401(k)'s, translating to $4,000 a year. When that is added to the average amount retirees receive in Social Security -- $14,700 a year -- it translates to $18,700 a year or just over $1,550 a month (or around $33,000 for a couple when both receive benefits).
"That's not a lot," Ms. Munnell said. She warned that many Americans could slide into poverty in retirement because their nest eggs were so small.
One piece of upbeat news is that Americans are generally living longer. For couples retiring this year, there is a 50 percent chance that one spouse will live to 92. But there's a downside to this increased longevity: many retirees are depleting their nest eggs by age 80 or 85, and they then have to rely on Social Security and the generosity of their children, many of whom are already squeezed financially.
"I have tons of clients in their 90s who never thought they would live this long," said Diahann W. Lassus, a financial planner in New Providence, N.J.
Bemoaning the small size of many people's nest eggs, Mr. VanDerhei said workers with traditional pensions were generally in far better shape than those with 401(k)'s, because pensioners receive a defined monthly benefit for life. In even worse shape, he said, are the majority of workers who have neither a pension nor a 401(k) plan at work.
Many Americans with 401(k)'s do not save enough, many empty their accounts for living expenses when they lose their jobs, and many, Mr. VanDerhei said, skew their accounts too much toward equities, often in their own companies' stock -- bitter medicine when the stock market plunged. And some workers drain their 401(k) accounts to help pay for college for their children; indeed, the soaring cost of college prevents many parents from even saving for retirement.
A big question is, how much should one save? Traditionally, many financial planners put forward a rule of thumb that one's postretirement income -- through Social Security, savings and pensions -- should be 65 to 85 percent of one's preretirement income. Postretirement income can be lower, the logic goes, because one will no longer be making contributions to Social Security, commuting or buying as many suits.
But many financial planners steer people away from relying on a theoretical retirement replacement rate. Instead, they recommend using a retirement calculator to estimate how much they will need to save each year to reach their goal. (AARP has a highly recommended calculator: www.aarp.org/retirementcalculator.)
Some calculators ask people to insert the annual return they hope to achieve, but planners warn against seeking ambitious returns because they can involve a lot of risk. It is vital to assess one's risk tolerance, said Tom Orecchio, a financial planner in Westwood, N.J. "Everyone thought their risk tolerance was one thing until they lived through the financial crisis, and then they realized their risk tolerance was very different," he said. Some still expect investment returns of 8 percent a year, but, Mr. Orecchio said, 4 to 5 percent is a far more realistic goal.
Fred Sanford, 59, moved to Orlando, Fla., from Illinois in 2004 to take a job as a financial adviser with Merrill Lynch, helping to attract clients and invest their money. He steadily put aside money for retirement, he said, investing it conservatively, but nonetheless "lost a chunk" in the stock market after Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. Not only that, Merrill laid him off 18 months ago. "I guess I hadn't saved enough for retirement, nor do I think anybody else has," he said. "What is enough?"
He has tried to climb back into financial services, but to no avail. To help make ends meet, Mr. Sanford and his wife have begun letting out a room in their house. In addition, helped by his Web site fredsanfordmusic.com, he plays piano several nights each week -- "boomer tunes, Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder," he said -- at wine bars and country clubs. Retirement is nowhere in sight, he acknowledged, adding, "60, 65 is the new 40, 45."
Fortunately, his wife still has her job as a school paraprofessional who works with autistic children in Orlando, where thousands of homes have been foreclosed upon and many families with children are homeless.
"You have to be grateful in life for what you have because no matter how bad you have it, there are those worse off than you," Mr. Sanford said.
Mr. Orecchio recommended that everyone sit down to do retirement planning as well as a cash-flow analysis to determine how much is coming in and spent each month. Without that, he said, it is hard to figure out how much one can afford to save for retirement.
He said not just households with incomes of $1 million a year need financial planners but also those with incomes of $50,000, $70,000 or $100,000 a year. They can often find such planners through the National Association of Personal Financial Advisers, a fee-only group. Financial planners like him often say that Americans do not begin to understand how much they should be setting aside. If a couple hopes to live on $60,000 a year in retirement, they might receive $30,000 in Social Security benefits and then draw down $30,000 a year from their savings and investments. Assuming the recommended drawdown of 4 percent a year, a nest egg of $750,000 might be needed.
Financial experts generally urge workers to try their hardest to invest the maximum amount allowed into their 401(k) each year -- $17,000 for 2012 under current law, with a catch-up provision allowing people 50 and over to contribute an additional $5,500. "I tell my clients that is nonnegotiable; they've just got to do it," Mr. Papadopoulos said.
Of course, that is far more than many workers can afford to set aside, but putting $17,000 instead of $5,000 into one's 401(k) means no income taxes on an extra $12,000. (In case you are wondering, some tax experts have noted that the 401(k) tax breaks go disproportionately to the affluent.)
Mr. Papadopoulos said, "I tell my clients to practice these basic things: diversify, keep costs low, be mindful of Uncle Sam and focus on the things you can control."
One thing many Americans can control is when they will start receiving Social Security benefits. Many advisers recommend delaying that move until you really need the money. For Americans born from 1943 to 1954, the retirement age for full Social Security benefits is 66. That age rises in steps to 67 for those born in 1960 or later.
If one qualifies, say, for $1,500 a month in Social Security benefits at 66, and begins taking early benefits at 62, under current rules, those benefits will be 25 percent lower, or $1,125 a month. But if one takes a chance on longevity and decides not to draw benefits until age 70, then one would receive 32 percent more than normal benefits or, in this case, $1,980 a month. "It's an inexpensive way of taking a better annuity," said Mr. Certner of the AARP.
Among financial planners, there is considerable debate about whether to buy annuities. Ms. Lassus said she did not recommend annuities, saying, "We look at Social Security as an annuity."
Mr. Orecchio disagreed, occasionally recommending annuities "as a steadying factor for inco me in retirement." Mr. Papadopoulos, however, cautioned against buying variable annuities that rise with inflation, calling them too expensive. "Fixed annuities will serve the purpose," he said. An annuity starting at age 70 and paying a lifetime monthly income of $2,000, or $24,000 a year, can cost about $300,000 for a man and $330,000 for a woman (the actuarial tables say she'll live longer). There is a similar debate about long-term care insurance. Mr. Certner said many people did not plan ever to enter a nursing home, which can be very expensive. So he recommended that people consider long-term care insurance, lest nursing homes wipe out all their savings.
Ms. Munnell is less enthusiastic about long-term care insurance. Not only can it be very expensive (typically, $2,800 annually if purchased at age 55, for a plan offering $150 a day for four years) but insurers sometimes increase the premiums 20 percent or more in a year, forcing some to drop their insurance after they have paid tens of thousands of dollars for it over decades.
She said she worried that nursing home costs and the failure of many older Americans to save nearly enough for retirement would saddle many of their children with major burdens: providing financial support and care for their parents.
"Older people are reluctant to turn to their children, but their children are going to feel compelled to help," Ms. Munnell said. "You can't have a vulnerable elderly population in isolation. It's going to affect everybody."

Correction: March 14, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about post-recession prospects for retirees misstated the value lost by 401(k) plans in the downturn. It was $1.6 trillion in equity value, not $2.8 trillion. (The larger figure was the amount of equity losses in 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts combined.)

Full text: Companies in the United States increased their hiring in February, shoring up expectations that the labor market's recovery has moved into a higher gear.
Separate data on Wednesday showed wages grew more quickly at the end of last year than originally estimated, good news for consumers, but a potential inflation problem for the Federal Reserve.
The private sector added 216,000 jobs last month, according to the ADP National Employment Report, topping economists' expectations for a gain of 208,000. The ADP figures come ahead of the government's more comprehensive monthly labor market report on Friday, which includes both public and private sector employment.
"After two years of expansion without much gain in employment, we're finally hitting the point where firms need to begin adding people in order to meet increased orders," Steve Blitz, senior economist at ITG Investment Research in New York, said. "There are still risks ahead, but if you could just stop the clock right where we are now, you've got a recovery that is gathering some momentum; it appears to be self-reinforcing."
Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan, noted that in the month of February in recent years, the difference between the two reports has been smaller and missed only by 2,000 in 2010 and 5,000 in 2011.
ADP's January figures were revised up to an increase of 173,000 jobs from 170,000. The report is jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers.
Unit labor costs, which the Federal Reserve watches closely for signs of inflation, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said, revised sharply up from the 1.2 percent pace it reported last month. Third-quarter wage growth was raised to a 3.9 percent pace from the previously reported drop of 2.1 percent.
Hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, rose at a 2.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter, revised from the previously reported increase of 1.0 percent. It was the largest gain since the second quarter of 2010.
The Labor Department revised up its reading on nonfarm productivity growth to a 0.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter from 0.7 percent.
Data later on Wednesday showed consumer credit expanded sharply in January for the fifth consecutive month as Americans borrowed money to buy cars and go to school.
Separate reports on the housing market suggested the sector was continuing to scrape along the bottom.
Home prices fell 1.0 percent in January, the sixth straight month of declines as sales of distressed properties took a toll, the data analysis firm CoreLogic said.
Compared with January of last year, prices were down 3.1 percent. But excluding distressed sales, prices rose 0.7 percent in January and were off just 0.9 percent on a yearly basis.

Full text: The prices of drugs used most widely by older Americans rose by nearly 26 percent from 2005 to 2009 -- nearly twice the rate of inflation -- according to a report issued Tuesday by AARP.
The increase happened even as the price of generic drugs, which account for the vast majority of prescriptions, has been falling in recent years, the report found. "At a time when our country is contracting economically and inflation is really, really low, inflation in the cost of prescription drugs is going in the other direction," said Cheryl Matheis, the senior vice president for policy strategy at AARP, whose members are 50 and older. "The word we use is relentless because it just doesn't seem to abate."
But officials in the pharmaceutical industry criticized the report, saying that the expanded availability of generic drugs has slowed the increase in drug prices in recent years. "AARP has released yet another misleading pricing report that ignores key facts about the marketplace for prescription medicines and paints an inaccurate picture of prescription drug spending in the U.S.," the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade and lobbying group, said in a statement Tuesday.
The AARP report, which examined the retail prices of the 514 brand name and generic drugs most widely used by Medicare recipients, said that the price of generic drugs fell by nearly 31 percent from 2005 to 2009. But at the same time that brand-name drug prices grew by nearly 41 percent and specialty drugs rose more than 48 percent. The rate of inflation, by contrast, grew by just over 13 percent over the same period.
Few dispute that the price of brand name drugs is increasing. "Inflation is alive and well in the drug industry," said Lawrence Marsh, managing director of equity research at Barclays Capital, who tracks drug prices. He said drug companies had been raising prices on drugs whose patent protections were about to end in an effort to squeeze as much profit as they could before losing market share to generics.
Studies using more recent data have shown that the rate of growth in drug spending appears to be leveling off. A report by government economists last year found that total retail spending on prescription drugs was up just 1.2 percent in 2010, a record low rate. And a study by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, a research group that consults for the drug industry, reported that spending on prescription medicines grew by 2.3 percent in 2010, compared with 5.1 percent in 2009.
Some criticized the AARP report because it reported on only the full retail price consumers paid at the pharmacy, even though many patients were responsible for only a small co-payment or nothing at all. It also did not take into account rebates and other discounts insurers had negotiated with drug companies; AARP said that data was not available to the group. And some said that the widespread use of generics had been driving down the overall cost of drugs for years.
"There are a whole bunch of high quality medicines that are becoming available generically, and the cost is dropping 30, 40 percent," said Michael Kleinrock, director of research development at the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. A study of the Medicare Part D drug program by the IMS Institute found that the daily cost of drugs fell from 2006 to 2010 for 8 of 10 categories of drugs that make up the most volume of prescriptions under Medicare Part D, the drug program for retirees.
Even so, Mr. Kleinrock said that his research showed that even with discounts, what insurance companies had been paying for drugs on a national level increased consistently by about 5 to 6 percent a year.
Leigh Purvis, one of the authors of the AARP report, said the studies that reported a slower growth in spending did not look at the price of individual drugs. That matters to Americans who do not have health insurance and who have to pay for those drugs out of pocket.
The price of brand-name drugs can also drive up insurance premiums, she said, and push retirees more quickly into the coverage gap -- or the so-called doughnut hole -- in the Medicare Part D drug program.
Ms. Matheis said this was especially relevant to AARP members, who are older and likely to lose their jobs or have a harder time finding one at the same time that they are more likely to need prescription drugs.
"If they don't have coverage for those drugs, they are in a world of hurt," she said.

Full text: Stocks fell on Monday for the second straight session and the third in the last four trading days, led by a drop in share prices for basic materials after China trimmed its 2012 prediction for economic growth.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index opened lower. Data showing that the services sector of the nation's economy expanded in February at its fastest rate in a year did little to stem the decline.
The benchmark S.& P. 500 is up 8.5 percent so far this year as investor anticipate a recovery in the United States economy, a containment of the euro zone's debt crisis and the belief that China will avoid a hard landing in its current economic growth cycle.
China, the world's second-largest economy, lowered its 2012 growth prediction to an eight-year low of 7.5 percent and made expanding demand by Chinese consumers its top priority. That way, the Chinese government hopes, it can shrink the economy's reliance on external spending and foreign capital.
"That spooked everybody this morning. It started over in Asia, flowed right to Europe and flowed right over here," said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New York.
"The fact is, they are guiding a little bit lower to control their inflation. It is not necessarily the end of the world, but it gave people a reason to take some money off the table," he said.
Shares of materials, which are sensitive to signs of slowing in China's commodity-hungry economy, dropped and were the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S.& P. materials sector index fell 1.6 percent, with Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold off 3.8 percent at $40.45.
The S.& P. 500-stock index dipped 5.30 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,364.33. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 14.76 points, or 0.11 percent, to 12,962.81. The Nasdaq composite index lost 25.71 points, or 0.86 percent, to close at 2,950.48.
The Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 57.3 in February from 56.8 in January. Economists expected a drop to 56.1.
It was the index's highest level since February 2011. The services sector accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity in the United States. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
In another report, the Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods fell 1 percent, not as big as the 1.5 percent drop that economists were expecting. Still, it was the biggest decline since October 2010.
The Nasdaq registered the biggest decline among the three major stock indexes as Apple dropped as much as 3.5 percent to a session low at $526 share on heavy volume. By the close, Apple had recouped some of that loss, closing down 2.2 percent at $533.16. "There is talk about iPad sales slowing down and all that," Mr. Polcari said. Sales, he added, have gone straight up with no correction, "so any whiff of the slightest miss or negative news is going to take money right out of it, and that's what you saw today," he said.
The S.& P. technology sector index lost 1 percent.
In another deal weighing on investor sentiment Monday, Greece warned it was ready to enforce losses on its private sector creditors, although major Greek bondholders later voiced their support for the deal.
Steel makers in the United States were also hurt by the news from China. AK Steel fell 6.1 percent, to $7.29; United States Steel dropped 4.7 percent, to $26.21; and Nucor slipped 2.4 percent, to $42.52.
Interest rates were higher on Monday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 8/32, to 99 30/32, and the yield rose to 2.01 percent from 1.96 percent late Friday.

Full text: The economic news is looking better lately. But after previous false starts -- remember "green shoots"? -- it would be foolish to assume that all is well. And in any case, it's still a very slow economic recovery by historical standards.
There are several reasons for this slowness, with the most important being the overhang of household debt that is a legacy of the housing bubble. But one significant factor in our continuing economic weakness is the fact that government in America is doing exactly what both theory and history say it shouldn't: slashing spending in the face of a depressed economy.
In fact, if it weren't for this destructive fiscal austerity, our unemployment rate would almost certainly be lower now than it was at a comparable stage of the "Morning in America" recovery during the Reagan era.
Notice that I said "government in America," not "the federal government." The federal government has been pursuing what amount to contractionary policies as the last vestiges of the Obama stimulus fade out, but the big cuts have come at the state and local level. These state and local cuts have led to a sharp fall in both government employment and government spending on goods and services, exerting a powerful drag on the economy as a whole.
One way to dramatize just how severe our de facto austerity has been is to compare government employment and spending during the Obama-era economic expansion, which began in June 2009, with their tracks during the Reagan-era expansion, which began in November 1982.
Start with government employment (which is mainly at the state and local level, with about half the jobs in education). By this stage in the Reagan recovery, government employment had risen by 3.1 percent; this time around, it's down by 2.7 percent.
Next, look at government purchases of goods and services (as distinct from transfers to individuals, like unemployment benefits). Adjusted for inflation, by this stage of the Reagan recovery, such purchases had risen by 11.6 percent; this time, they're down by 2.6 percent.
And the gap persists even when you do include transfers, some of which have stayed high precisely because unemployment is still so high. Adjusted for inflation, Reagan-era spending rose 10.2 percent in the first 10 quarters of recovery, Obama-era spending only 2.6 percent.
Why did government spending rise so much under Reagan, with his small-government rhetoric, while shrinking under the president so many Republicans insist is a secret socialist? In Reagan's case, it's partly about the arms race, but mainly about state and local governments doing what they are supposed to do: educate a growing population of children, invest in infrastructure for a growing economy.
Under President Obama, however, the dire fiscal condition of state and local governments -- the result of a sustained slump, which in turn was caused largely by that private debt explosion before 2008 -- has led to forced spending cuts. The fiscal straits of lower-level governments could and should have been alleviated by aid from Washington, which remains able to borrow at incredibly low interest rates. But this aid was never provided on a remotely adequate scale.
This policy malpractice is doing double damage to America. On one side, it's helping lose the future -- because that's what happens when you neglect education and public investment. At the same time, it's hurting us right now, by helping keep growth low and unemployment high.
We're talking big numbers here. If government employment under Mr. Obama had grown at Reagan-era rates, 1.3 million more Americans would be working as schoolteachers, firefighters, police officers, etc., than are currently employed in such jobs.
And once you take the effects of public spending on private employment into account, a rough estimate is that the unemployment rate would be 1.5 percentage points lower than it is, or below 7 percent -- significantly better than the Reagan economy at this stage.
One implication of this comparison is that conservatives who love to compare Reagan's record with Mr. Obama's should think twice. Aside from the fact that recoveries from financial crises are almost always slower than ordinary recoveries, in reality Reagan was much more Keynesian than Mr. Obama, faced with an obstructionist G.O.P., has ever managed to be.
More important, however, there is now an easy answer to anyone asking how we can accelerate our economic recovery. By all means, let's talk about visionary ideas; but we can take a big step toward full employment just by using the federal government's low borrowing costs to help state and local governments rehire the schoolteachers and police officers they laid off, while restarting the road repair and improvement projects they canceled or put on hold.

Abstract: Partly because energy companies including Exxon and Chevron account for 12.3 percent of the market capitalization of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, rising oil prices "may actually be good for the stock market, up to a point," he said. Since the second half of 2008, Mr. Yardeni says, there has been a strong positive correlation between energy prices and the stock market.

Full text: SOMETIMES a number is just a number. But on Tuesday, when the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 13,000, it was treated as much more than that.
Many news accounts and market commentaries portrayed that clean, round string of digits as a milestone that signified the stock market had come a long way since the darkest days of the financial crisis.
Oil and gas prices have also been rising, and are beginning to attract considerable attention, too. How high and how quickly those numbers climb -- and whether they leap above $5 a gallon and morph into a painful symbol of inflation -- could have an enormous impact on the financial markets, the economy and the presidential election.
"People may not remember too many numbers about the economy, but there are certain signposts they do pay attention to," said Ethan Harris, chief North American economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "As a shorthand way to assess how the economy's doing, everybody notices the price of gas. It can have a big symbolic impact, and in a presidential election year, when the price is rising, that can create a big headwind."
On Friday, gas prices averaged $3.74 a gallon nationwide, their highest levels in the winter months but well below the nominal record of $4.11 a gallon in July 2008. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $4.27 today. In California, the average price on Friday was already $4.34.
Largely because of tensions in Iran and other countries in the region, oil prices rose more than 22 percent in the six months through Thursday, according to John LaForge, commodity strategist at Ned Davis Research.
While those numbers may be disquieting, they haven't had much of an effect on either the stock market or consumer sentiment, said Ed Yardeni, an independent economist who has analyzed the price surge.
Partly because energy companies including Exxon and Chevron account for 12.3 percent of the market capitalization of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, rising oil prices "may actually be good for the stock market, up to a point," he said.
Since the second half of 2008, Mr. Yardeni says, there has been a strong positive correlation between energy prices and the stock market.
If prices continue to rise, though, that benign influence is unlikely to last, he says. "At some point, you'll have a negative feedback loop. High energy prices will correct themselves, and if they go high enough, the negative effects will spill over to stocks and the economy."
Ned Davis Research has found that when oil prices climb by more than 33 percent in a six-month period, stock market performance then tends to weaken, Mr. LaForge said. Prices may not be a big problem right now, he said, but that could change quickly.
How high will those prices go?
Presumably, futures prices already reflect the collective intelligence of the financial markets, said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist of BNY Mellon. "Those prices already factor in the risks of a possible war with Iran or an incident in the Strait of Hormuz that disrupts oil shipping," he said.
He added that he expects that the impasse over Iran's nuclear program will be resolved peacefully -- and believes that, at the moment, the markets think likewise.
Mr. Hoey said that oil prices might spike further, but that they were likely to come down without much lasting harm. "Of course, you never know," he added.
In the past, the domestic effects of rising gasoline prices have sometimes included a decline in auto sales. So far, though, the most recent energy price surge hasn't had that effect.
To the contrary, auto sales rose sharply in February, carmakers and analysts said last week, with the seasonally adjusted selling rate for new vehicles climbing to about 15.1 million, the highest level since February 2008.
Rising energy prices tend to have a lagging economic impact, said James D. Hamilton, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego. Unless income also rises -- which isn't happening for many people now -- higher fuel costs will eventually displace other expenditures. And at a certain point, he said, there will be additional "nonlinear" effects if prices keep rising.
It's as though people finally sit up and really notice the price increase, and their behavior changes. "There's no single magic moment when it happens," he said. But the data indicates that this effect tends to kick in when the highest price level of the preceding three years is surpassed, he said.
We're not at those levels, but we could easily get there. For regular gasoline in the United States, that average price point would be $4.11 a gallon in nominal terms, and $4.27, accounting for inflation. For oil prices, it would be $145.29 a barrel for benchmark American crude, or $150.87, when inflation is factored in.
Ugly-looking prices at the pump are never a good omen for incumbent politicians. Since 1976, they have generally been inversely correlated with presidential approval ratings, Ned Davis Research has found.
In other words, the more expensive gasoline is, the less popular the president tends to be.
The financial reason for this is obvious: with the possible exception of energy investors, few people enjoy paying more to drive. And because fuel costs affect many other items, including food, rising gasoline prices are often associated with an increase in the cost of living.
ON the other hand, the behavioral changes cited by Professor Hamilton include measures to reduce energy expenditures throughout the economy. Thanks in part to the long-term impact of rising prices, the nation has become far more energy-efficient in recent decades, so high fuel prices today shouldn't hurt as much as they once did.
Figures provided by Ned Davis Research show that in December 1981, for example, energy expenditures accounted for 7.81 percent of disposable income in the United States, compared with only 5.5 percent in December 2011. Inflation-adjusted prices of gasoline were approximately the same in both periods, about $3.30 a gallon.
Higher fuel efficiency may account for the relatively strong level of recent auto sales, despite higher energy prices. Consumers have been buying smaller and less gas-thirsty vehicles, auto industry executives say.
What's more, inflation in the United States is quite low at the moment -- largely because of the weak economy.
Yet the apparent relationship between rising gas prices and falling presidential approval ratings appears to be as strong as ever, Mr. LaForge said. "President Obama will need to be paying close attention to gasoline prices, even if they don't have the impact they once did," he said.

Abstract: Throughout almost the entire history of the United States income tax, the tax rate on capital gains has been lower than that on ordinary income. Bob and Carl are being rewarded in part for the time they spend, but the tax law treats both as having earned entirely capital gains.

Full text: WHAT is carried interest? And why does it get the tax treatment it does?
These arcane questions are usually reserved for the green-eyeshade crowd. And for good reason: they can be so bewildering that they seem to be taken from an I.Q. test written just for accountants. But because they concern a few very high-income individuals, including the presidential candidate Mitt Romney, for whom I am an adviser, they have been getting broader attention lately. So let's examine the issue.
Throughout almost the entire history of the United States income tax, the tax rate on capital gains has been lower than that on ordinary income. Today, the top rate is 15 percent for capital gains and 35 percent for ordinary income. There are good reasons for this -- including, for example, the fact that capital gains are not indexed for inflation. But put that aside. If we are going to tax capital gains at a lower rate, one question necessarily arises: What is a capital gain, and how can we distinguish it from ordinary income?
The answer seems simple. If you have a job, the money you are paid for your work is ordinary income. If you buy an asset at one time and sell it later for a higher price, the profit you made from holding it is a capital gain.
But is it really that easy? Consider five examples, and see if you can identify what is ordinary income and what is a capital gain:
Abe buys a vacation home for his family for $800,000. Some years later, when his children have grown and left home, he sells it for $1 million. He makes $200,000.
Bob is a real estate investor. After scouring the market for the best investment opportunities, he buys a house for $800,000 that he believes is undervalued. A few years later, he sells it at $1 million, for a profit of $200,000.
Carl is a real estate investor and a carpenter. He buys a dilapidated house for $800,000. After spending his weekends fixing it up, he sells it a couple of years later for $1 million. Once again, the profit is $200,000.
Dan is a real estate investor and a carpenter, but he is short of capital. He approaches his friend, Ms. Moneybags, and they become partners. Together, they buy a dilapidated house for $800,000 and sell it later for $1 million. She puts up the money, and he spends his weekends fixing up the house. They divide the $200,000 profit equally.
Earl is a carpenter. Ms. Moneybags buys a dilapidated house for $800,000 and hires Earl to fix it up. After paying Earl $100,000 for his services, Ms. Moneybags sells the home for $1 million, for a profit of $100,000.
How much capital gains and ordinary income do we attribute to Abe, Bob, Carl, Dan and Earl? (To keep things simple, assume that Ms. Moneybags is untaxed. Think of her as running a pension fund or university endowment.)
Let's take the easy cases first. It seems clear that Abe has a capital gain. His profit of $200,000 comes from simply holding an asset over time. And it seems equally clear that Earl's $100,000 is ordinary income. He is being paid for providing his services.
But between these cases, the situation gets murky. Bob and Carl are being rewarded in part for the time they spend, but the tax law treats both as having earned entirely capital gains. The tax code does not count the time that Bob spent looking for investments as employment and his gain as taxable labor compensation, even though some of it arguably is. Nor does it try to tax Carl's sweat equity as labor compensation.
This brings us to Dan and his partnership with Ms. Moneybags. The tax law treats this partnership as exactly equivalent to Carl's situation. In this case, however, the $200,000 capital gain is divided into halves: some of it goes to Ms. Moneybags, who provided the cash, and some goes to Dan, who provided the sweat equity. Once again, nothing is treated as ordinary income.
In some ways, this treatment makes sense. After all, Dan is doing half of what Carl did, so why should he have to pay a higher tax rate than Carl did on that half of his income? On the other hand, it seems that Dan is getting off easy. Dan does not seem very different from Earl, because both are getting $100,000 for fixing up the house.
If these examples leave your head spinning, you are not alone. Economists and tax lawyers who study these issues are unsure about the best way to handle these situations in practice.
Here is where carried interest enters the picture. Carried interest from a private equity partnership is like the income that Dan earns from his real estate partnership. In this case, however, Dan is not a carpenter but a specialist in business turnarounds. The partnership does not buy dilapidated houses to fix up and sell; it buys troubled businesses to fix up and sell. And just as Dan the carpenter can treat his share of the partnership income as a capital gain, Dan the business specialist can do the same.
Critics of current law think it is unfair that these private equity partners are taxed at capital gains rates, whereas other high-income individuals like doctors and lawyers pay the much higher tax rates for ordinary income. It is a reasonable point, and some reform may well be appropriate. But as the tax situations of Abe through Earl illustrate, it is not obvious what the best approach would be. Not all problems have easy answers.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Wednesday that the central bank retained its modest expectations for the American economy this year, despite some recent signs of stronger growth.
Mr. Bernanke said the recent rise in oil prices also had not shifted the Fed's view that the economy would expand 2.2 to 2.7 percent this year, about the same pace as during the second half of last year.
He acknowledged that rising oil prices were "likely to push up inflation temporarily while reducing consumers' purchasing power." But the Fed expects the overall pace of increases in prices and wages to remain "subdued," Mr. Bernanke said in testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services.
Some economists see evidence that the pace of growth is increasing. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, an arm of the federal government, said on Wednesday that the economy grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in the last three months of 2011, somewhat higher than its initial estimate of 2.8 percent. The unemployment rate has declined to 8.3 percent in January from 9.1 percent last July.
But the Fed has remained cautious, and Mr. Bernanke repeated a familiar list of reasons for that stance, including the depressed housing market and turbulence in Europe. The Fed also has overestimated the pace of recovery several times in recent years.
"The recovery of the U.S. economy continues, but the pace of expansion has been uneven and modest by historical standards," Mr. Bernanke said. He noted that the Fed did not expect "further substantial declines" in the unemployment rate this year.
As a result, he said the Fed remained committed to continuing its economic stimulus efforts, keeping short-term interest rates near zero and maintaining a large portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage bonds to further reduce long-term rates, holding down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
Mr. Bernanke gave no indication that the Fed was considering new efforts, like increasing its holdings of mortgage-backed securities to bolster the housing market. Indeed, his remarks suggested that the Fed's attention was shifting to the possibility that the recovery is outpacing its expectations.
Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting firm in Valhalla, N.Y., said in a note to clients that Mr. Bernanke was more upbeat than he had expected.
"Mr. Bernanke did not make a clean break from his previous, glum view of the economy, but his position has shifted a bit," he wrote. "This sounds like the start of the beginning of a process."
Mr. Bernanke appears twice each year before the House committee and its counterpart, the Senate Banking Committee, for a formal review of the Fed's management of the nation's monetary policy. The Senate hearing is planned for Thursday.
Wednesday's House hearing unfurled along familiar lines, with Democrats applauding the central bank's efforts to spur the economy, while Republicans expressed concern that the Fed's actions would send inflation soaring out of control.
"I'd like to praise Chairman Bernanke for doing his job and really not bowing to the political pressure," said Representative Melvin Watt, a North Carolina Democrat. "I just think he has done a magnificent job and the Fed has done a magnificent job of navigating us through some very, very difficult times."
The sharpest counterpoint came from Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas and a candidate for president, who flourished an actual, shiny ounce of silver as he lectured Mr. Bernanke on the declining value of the dollar.
Mr. Paul, has long argued that people should be able to exchange dollars for precious metals.
"You love paper money," he said. "I think money should be honest."
Mr. Bernanke was deadpan in his response.
"First of all," he said, "good to see you again."
Much of the hearing focused on fiscal rather than monetary policy. Mr. Bernanke has become an outspoken advocate for Congress to adopt a long-term plan for reducing the government's annual deficits and growing debt. He warned Wednesday that the government faced a "fiscal cliff" at the end of the year, when a number of major policy changes are set to occur simultaneously, including the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and across-the-board reductions in government spending passed last year as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling.
"I hope that Congress will look at that and figure out ways to achieve the same long-run fiscal improvement without having it all happen at one date," Mr. Bernanke said.
He declined several times to endorse the particular fiscal proposals of Democrats and Republicans on the committee.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
HOUSTON -- Gasoline for $5 a gallon? The possibility is hardly far-fetched.
With no clear end to tensions with Iran and Syria and rising demand from countries like China, gas prices are already at record highs for the winter months -- averaging $4.32 in California and $3.73 a gallon nationally on Wednesday, according to AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. As summer approaches, demand for gasoline rises, typically pushing prices up around 20 cents a gallon.
And gas prices could rise another 50 cents a gallon or more, analysts say, if the diplomatic and economic standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions escalates into military conflict or there is some other major supply disruption.
"If we get some kind of explosion -- like an Israeli attack or some local Iranian revolutionary guard decides to take matters in his own hands and attacks a tanker -- than we'd see oil prices push up 20 to 25 percent higher and another 50 cents a gallon at the pump," said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research.
For the typical driver who pumps 60 gallons a month of regular unleaded gasoline, a 50-cent increase in price means an extra expense of $30 a month.
The prospect of such a price increase underscores the political and economic risks that Western political leaders must contend with as they decide how to address the Iran situation. A sharp rise in the prices of oil and gas would crimp the nation's budding economic recovery. It would also cause big political problems at home for President Obama, who is already being attacked by Republican presidential candidates over gas prices and his overall energy policies, and for European nations struggling to deal with the Continent's debt crisis.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told a House committee on Wednesday that rising global oil prices were "likely to push up inflation temporarily while reducing consumers' purchasing power." He maintained the Fed's forecast that the nation's economy would grow 2.2 to 2.7 percent this year.
The Iran situation has already raised the price of crude oil as much as 20 percent, according to oil experts. On Wednesday, the price of the benchmark American crude settled at $107.07 a barrel. That is about four dollars higher than on the same day in 2008. Later that year, oil and gasoline prices surged to new records, including a record nominal high of $145.29 a barrel for oil and $4.11 a gallon for gasoline in July. (In today's dollars, that would be $150.87 for oil and $4.27 for gasoline.)
Although prices plunged late in 2008 as the financial crisis took its toll and the recession deepened, that kind of sharp increase could happen again as summer approaches.
"That's what frightens people," said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service.
That fear is tempered by optimism -- if tensions ease in the Middle East, experts predict that energy prices will fall, with gasoline at the pump potentially dropping 50 cents a gallon or more because supplies are relatively strong in many parts of the country. Some analysts say the world price of oil could fall to $80 a barrel if tensions eased.
And there have been signs in recent days that Iran is feeling the pain of sanctions on its critical oil exports, perhaps increasing its willingness to negotiate with the West.
On Wednesday, Tehran offered Pakistan, which has been suffering power shortages, 80,000 barrels of oil a day on an easy payment plan. It also offered to accept gold rather than dollars for payment from any dealers hoping to get around the Western restrictions on the usual financial channels for buying oil.
And this week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a Congressional committee that the administration was working hard to persuade India, China and Turkey, which represent more than a third of Iran's oil export market, to reduce their purchases.
While all three countries have said publicly that they will continue to buy from Iran, Mrs. Clinton said, "in a number of cases, both on their government side and on their business side, they are taking actions that go further and deeper than perhaps their public statements might lead you to believe."
Neal Soss, chief economist of Credit Suisse, said sustained high gasoline prices would definitely have an impact on the American economy. "As a rule of thumb, a penny a gallon is worth a bit over $1 billion in consumer purchasing power if it is maintained a whole year. A dollar more would be something in excess of $100 billion, which is about the size of the Social Security tax cut."
Despite a fall in gasoline demand in the United States and Europe, global oil markets are tightening because demand for energy from Asian countries, particularly China and India, is rising at surprisingly strong rates even as output is declining from several important producing countries.
Gasoline futures are surging, spurred in part by recent refinery closings that may produce a shortage of motor fuel in the Northeast states by summer.
Oil prices have surged about 8 percent since Iran threatened to cut off oil imports to France, Spain, Italy and other European countries three weeks ago as a pre-emptive move against Western moves to tighten sanctions. The European Union has decided to place an embargo on Iranian oil and ban shipping and insurance on its cargoes. Washington has decided on banking sanctions to curtail Iran's ability to earn money from its oil exports.
Middle East experts express doubts that Iran will follow through on its threats to stop supplying European customers or close the vital oil sea lanes of the Strait of Hormuz. But the saber-rattling from both sides is encouraging investors to buy oil futures contracts at higher and higher prices. Rising conjecture that Israel could launch a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities has heightened market jitters.
"The bankers are speculating, protecting themselves from higher prices by committing obligations to buy now, and that starts the ball rolling toward higher prices," said Sadad Ibrahim al-Husseini, former head of exploration and production at Saudi Aramco, the state oil company.
He added that the escalating civil turmoil in Syria, a crucial ally of Iran, "is bound to increase price volatility and that will drive future speculation."
The Japanese Foreign Ministry signaled on Wednesday that it was close to an agreement with Washington to further reduce shipments of oil from Iran, which have already declined about 20 percent since the beginning of the year.
But any success in tightening sanctions on Iran could squeeze global oil supplies, pushing up prices and causing serious economic repercussions at home and abroad.
"It's a bind for Obama," said Mr. Kloza at the Oil Price Information Service. "How do you get tough on Iran without getting tough on American wallets?"

Full text: WASHINGTON -- These are the best of times for the world's most ravenous borrower, the United States of America.
A combination of unusual and unsustainable forces has pushed the cost of borrowing as low as it has ever been, so low that many investors effectively are paying to lend money to the government.
Investors buying five-year federal debt are accepting such low interest rates that inflation is on pace to reduce the value of their investments by more than 1 percent each year. Yet demand for United States Treasuries remains much greater than the supply.
The glut of cheap money has allowed the government to keep its annual deficits much smaller than it had expected, holding down the growth of the federal debt.
The Treasury Department, seeking to milk the moment, may start issuing debt with negative interest rates, making investors pay for the privilege of lending money to the government.
But a wide range of experts agrees that the bubble will eventually pop. The question, they say, is not if but when. There are signs that the era of low borrowing costs may be approaching its end, as the domestic economy shows signs of strength and Europe pulls back from economic immolation.
"We are in an unusual period right now in which net interest expense is temporarily depressed," William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech last week. "This will not last."
People have been predicting that rates will rise ever since the 2008 financial crisis sent investors piling into the safe haven of federal debt, driving down rates.
But what looked like a brief plunge has become a broad trough. The average rates that the government pays to investors in its debt have declined in each of the last five years, from 4.92 percent at the end of 2006 to 2.24 percent at the end of 2011. Rates have edged even lower so far this year. Adjusting for inflation, the government is borrowing at virtually zero cost.
As a result, while the size of the public debt more than doubled over the last five years, from less than $5 trillion to more than $10 trillion, the government's annual interest payments remained about the same.
In 2006, the bill was $226.6 billion. Last year, the bill was $227.1 billion. The numbers exclude debt held within the government, by the Social Security trust fund, and the cost of interest on those debts.
The danger, Mr. Dudley said last week, is that the current situation may lead some to underestimate the long-term cost of the debt when rates inevitably rise. The administration's recent budget projects that rates will increase gradually over the next decade, including about 1 percentage point this year. If the increase is just 1 percentage point larger this year, the deficit will grow by $13 billion. If the same higher trajectory holds over 10 years, the additional interest payments would approach $1 trillion.
The basic reason to expect higher rates is that investors usually demand compensation as a borrower's debts increase. And the government projects that its debt will grow rapidly in coming years.
The ratings agency Standard & Poor's last year removed some categories of United States debt from its list of the world's least risky investments, citing its concerns about the ability of the government to contain the growth through cutbacks in planned spending or increases in federal revenue.
So far, however, investors have grown only more clamorous for Treasuries.
The demand reflects the weakness of the domestic economy, and the Federal Reserve's determined campaign to drive down the cost of borrowing by purchasing more than $1.6 trillion in Treasury securities.
One less obvious benefit is that about 10 percent of federal interest payments are now collected by the central bank, which returns almost all of the money to Treasury because it is required by law to remit its profits.
The United States also has benefited from concerns about the health of European governments. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the benefits of investors fleeing Europe to buy Treasuries have roughly offset any other damage to the American economy from the struggles of the euro zone.
"There's a good argument that the net impact on the U.S. economy is zero, a little more or less," the I.M.F.'s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said in a recent interview.
All of this has prompted a flight to safety so determined that investors are lining up to accept the near certainty of small losses on Treasuries to avoid the possibility of larger losses on stocks, corporate bonds or the debt of other countries.
This month, when the government auctioned off one-year debt, Treasury agreed to pay 14 cents for every $100 that it borrowed, or 0.14 percent. Last week at the most recent auction of five-year debt, it agreed to pay 88 cents a year for every $100 that it borrowed. At a 2 percent inflation rate, investors would need to be paid $2 for every $100 they lent just to keep pace.
Treasury is now reviewing whether to let prospective lenders offer negative interest rates, meaning that they would pay the government rather than vice versa. It is expected to make a decision by May.
Some economists say they believe rates will remain low for years. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, forecasts little change through 2013.
"While there have been some bright spots in the data, the economy probably won't be strong enough to justify rate increases," Mr. Greenlaw said.
Other economists expect that rates will begin to rise later this year, as the domestic economy improves and fears about Europe abate.
John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, expects rates on 10-year Treasuries to reach 3.75 percent this year, up from about 2 percent now, as investors awaken from what he described as "extreme risk aversion."
But he added that he didn't understand why rates had remained low for this long.
"I have to say that it's a bit of an enigma," Mr. Ryding said. "It's a conundrum."

Full text: SHANGHAI -- A new study by the World Bank and a Chinese government research organization warns that the country's economic growth is likely to diminish over the next few decades unless China alters its development model and rethinks the role of government in managing the economy.
The report, called "China 2030," and produced by the bank and the Development Research Center, the government research organization, calls on Beijing to complete the transition to a market economy, scale back the power of state-owned companies, encourage private enterprise and confront rising inequality and environmental degradation.
As remarkable as China's growth has been over the past three decades, the study suggests that the country's development pattern has been uneven and is unsustainable. The government should make significant changes, it says.
"The case for reform is compelling because China has now reached a turning point in its development path," Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said in a speech in Beijing on Monday, when the report was released. "Managing the transition from a middle-income to a high-income country will prove challenging; add to this a global environment that will likely remain uncertain and volatile for the foreseeable future, and the need for change assumes even greater importance."
The release of the report comes at a critical juncture. China is now in the midst of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition, and the report's proposals could help influence the way the next generation of leaders governs.
Analysts also have growing concerns that China's economy is facing strong headwinds this year.
Economic weakness in Europe, Japan and the United States is threatening to dampen China's export boom. After years of heavy investment in public works, there are worries here, too, about inflation, the mounting debt of local governments and the possibility that big state-owned banks could be at risk.
Mr. Zoellick said in news conferences on Monday that he was reassured that the government would undertake bold changes and that he expected China's economy to remain strong this year, with a soft landing likely.
The 400-page report, however, says little about the immediate challenges facing China's economy. Instead, it lays out a road map packed with recommendations that the authors hope will lead to gradual reforms introduced over many years, if not over a decade or more.
If all goes well and China undertakes serious changes, the study predicts, its economy could grow by about 8 percent a year for the next few years and could sustain average annual growth of about 6.6 percent for nearly 20 years.
That annual growth, the study says, is likely to slow eventually to about 5 percent in the years leading up to 2030, more than enough to enable China to surpass the United States as the world's biggest economy.
Although the risks of a global economic downturn are a concern, the report said, bigger risks may arise from internal structural challenges, like weak domestic consumption, overinvestment in public works and increases in inequality.
Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and the author of "Sustaining China's Economic Growth After the Global Financial Crisis," called the report a thorough benchmark assessment of China and its economy.
But he also said the study failed to offer detailed prescriptions for reforms or to explain why previous efforts had stalled.
"Many of these issues have been on the agenda for at least a decade," Mr. Lardy said in a telephone interview. "But the report doesn't even attempt to explain what obstacles there are to doing these things. Until you shine a light on those things, it will be very difficult to understand why the changes haven't taken place."
One of the study's main recommendations involves efforts to make China's economy more market-oriented, including scaling back the power of state-owned companies and altering the way the government allocates resources.
"The role of the government and its relationship to markets and the private sector need to change fundamentally," the report warned.
The study said that state-owned enterprises should be more commercially oriented, and that the government needed to improve financing opportunities for private companies and to expand the overhaul of the banking and financial sectors.
These changes, the report said, would cause state banks to compete more vigorously for customers and operate on a more commercial basis, eventually paving the way for financial reform and improving the integration of China's currency, the renminbi, into the international economy.
Analysts said the emphasis on proposals to change the state sector seemed surprisingly ambitious, particularly because one of the authors, the Development Research Center, operates under China's cabinet, or State Council. There has been a contentious debate in China in recent years about the power of state-owned companies and about vested interests that try to derail any reforms.
"This represents an attempt to put some more momentum behind the push to rein in the state sector," Andrew Batson, the research director at GK Dragonomics, a research company in Beijing, said of the study.
The report stopped well short of calling for the breakup or privatization of state-owned companies. But it did suggest that the ownership structure of state companies be diversified. The study also said that China's fiscal system should be overhauled, an undertaking that would probably make local governments less dependent on land auctions for revenue.
Among other things, the study called for China to build world-class universities, put greater emphasis on innovation, initiate land reform and improve the social safety net, while also moving to better integrate the country into the global economy.
Because local governments and state-run enterprises are powerful and often resist changes that would weaken their standing, it is unclear whether the report's recommendations will be adopted or even considered seriously by the government.
Despite calls from within China's leadership to bolster consumption and encourage private enterprise, reform has been slow in recent years. Part of the reason, experts say, is that China's export- and investment-led growth has been so successful that few leaders have been willing to press for radical adjustments for fear that they could undermine growth in the short run.
But the World Bank and researchers from the Development Research Center in Beijing contend that without significant structural changes over time, China could face serious economic and social risks in the future, challenges likely to be amplified as it tries to cope with an aging population, a weak social safety net and a widening gap between the rich and the poor.

Full text: Lisbon
Things are terrible here, as unemployment soars past 13 percent. Things are even worse in Greece, Ireland, and arguably in Spain, and Europe as a whole appears to be sliding back into recession.
Why has Europe become the sick man of the world economy? Everyone knows the answer. Unfortunately, most of what people know isn't true -- and false stories about European woes are warping our economic discourse.
Read an opinion piece about Europe -- or, all too often, a supposedly factual news report -- and you'll probably encounter one of two stories, which I think of as the Republican narrative and the German narrative. Neither story fits the facts.
The Republican story -- it's one of the central themes of Mitt Romney's campaign -- is that Europe is in trouble because it has done too much to help the poor and unlucky, that we're watching the death throes of the welfare state. This story is, by the way, a perennial right-wing favorite: back in 1991, when Sweden was suffering from a banking crisis brought on by deregulation (sound familiar?), the Cato Institute published a triumphant report on how this proved the failure of the whole welfare state model.
Did I mention that Sweden, which still has a very generous welfare state, is currently a star performer, with economic growth faster than that of any other wealthy nation?
But let's do this systematically. Look at the 15 European nations currently using the euro (leaving Malta and Cyprus aside), and rank them by the percentage of G.D.P. they spent on social programs before the crisis. Do the troubled GIPSI nations (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy) stand out for having unusually large welfare states? No, they don't; only Italy was in the top five, and even so its welfare state was smaller than Germany's.
So excessively large welfare states didn't cause the troubles.
Next up, the German story, which is that it's all about fiscal irresponsibility. This story seems to fit Greece, but nobody else. Italy ran deficits in the years before the crisis, but they were only slightly larger than Germany's (Italy's large debt is a legacy from irresponsible policies many years ago). Portugal's deficits were significantly smaller, while Spain and Ireland actually ran surpluses.
Oh, and countries that aren't on the euro seem able to run large deficits and carry large debts without facing any crises. Britain and the United States can borrow long-term at interest rates of around 2 percent; Japan, which is far more deeply in debt than any country in Europe, Greece included, pays only 1 percent.
In other words, the Hellenization of our economic discourse, in which we're all just a year or two of deficits from becoming another Greece, is completely off base.
So what does ail Europe? The truth is that the story is mostly monetary. By introducing a single currency without the institutions needed to make that currency work, Europe effectively reinvented the defects of the gold standard -- defects that played a major role in causing and perpetuating the Great Depression.
More specifically, the creation of the euro fostered a false sense of security among private investors, unleashing huge, unsustainable flows of capital into nations all around Europe's periphery. As a consequence of these inflows, costs and prices rose, manufacturing became uncompetitive, and nations that had roughly balanced trade in 1999 began running large trade deficits instead. Then the music stopped.
If the peripheral nations still had their own currencies, they could and would use devaluation to quickly restore competitiveness. But they don't, which means that they are in for a long period of mass unemployment and slow, grinding deflation. Their debt crises are mainly a byproduct of this sad prospect, because depressed economies lead to budget deficits and deflation magnifies the burden of debt.
Now, understanding the nature of Europe's troubles offers only limited benefits to the Europeans themselves. The afflicted nations, in particular, have nothing but bad choices: either they suffer the pains of deflation or they take the drastic step of leaving the euro, which won't be politically feasible until or unless all else fails (a point Greece seems to be approaching). Germany could help by reversing its own austerity policies and accepting higher inflation, but it won't.
For the rest of us, however, getting Europe right makes a huge difference, because false stories about Europe are being used to push policies that would be cruel, destructive, or both. The next time you hear people invoking the European example to demand that we destroy our social safety net or slash spending in the face of a deeply depressed economy, here's what you need to know: they have no idea what they're talking about.

Abstract: The housing market remains a potent drag on the economy as home prices continue to slip, foreclosed homes fill some neighborhoods and millions of construction workers scramble for jobs. Nationwide, the apartment vacancy rate is down to 5.2 percent, its lowest level in more than a decade, according to the research firm Reis Inc. Rent increases are greatest in places like San Francisco, Austin, Tex., and Boston, where technology companies in particular are hiring, as well as in New York City and the District of Columbia.

Full text: The housing market remains a potent drag on the economy as home prices continue to slip, foreclosed homes fill some neighborhoods and millions of construction workers scramble for jobs.
But one group is sitting pretty: landlords.
Unlike home prices, rents have been rising, up 2.4 percent in January from a year earlier, according to recent data, not adjusted for inflation, released by the Labor Department.
With few rental buildings erected over the last few years, available units are going fast. Nationwide, the apartment vacancy rate is down to 5.2 percent, its lowest level in more than a decade, according to the research firm Reis Inc.
Rent increases are greatest in places like San Francisco, Austin, Tex., and Boston, where technology companies in particular are hiring, as well as in New York City and the District of Columbia. But cities like Chicago and Seattle, where house prices are still declining quite sharply, have had rental increases, too.
"We are more of a renter nation than we have been for a while," said Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of real estate at the Columbia University Business School.
Economists suggest favorable conditions for landlords will continue for at least a year, with employment gradually rising and construction of new apartments remaining constrained.
As job growth has begun to accelerate in recent months, young people are starting to move out of their parents' homes or away from shared rooms and into their own rentals.
Families who might previously have bought homes are also staying in rentals longer. They may be waiting for the housing market to hit bottom or finding it difficult to qualify for a mortgage. Many others remain uncertain about their job prospects and wary of the obligations of ownership.
When Charles Griffith moved with his wife and two children to Orlando, Fla., last fall, they chose a new two-bedroom apartment for $1,140 a month. They left a four-bedroom house they had bought a decade ago in Antioch, Calif. His brother-in-law has moved in and taken over the mortgage payments.
Mr. Griffith, who works as a supervisor for Southwest Airlines, and his wife, a customer service representative for the airline, are enjoying the flexibility and convenience of renting, as well as amenities like a pool. "We kind of like the situation now of not having to be under so much pressure," said Mr. Griffith, 40, adding that the family may eventually buy in Orlando. But "with the economy and the airline industry, that factors into us thinking maybe we should hold off for a while."
The home ownership rate has been falling from its peak of 69.4 percent in 2004, according to census data. By the fourth quarter of 2011, it was down to 66 percent. That means about two million more households are renting, said Kenneth Rosen, an economist and professor of real estate at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.
Not all those people are choosing apartments, of course. Some are moving into single-family homes left vacant by foreclosures. Eager to capitalize on the trend, investors are scooping up some houses at a deep discount and leasing them to tenants who have lost their own homes.
Several prominent hedge funds and private equity firms have recently announced plans to invest in distressed properties and convert them to rentals. And earlier this month, the government solicited applications from investors interested in buying pools of foreclosed properties held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration.
Still, it is in apartments, not houses, where renters are feeling the most competition.
Although many families crushed by the recession have doubled up and plenty of underemployed 20-somethings are living with their parents, some young people are finally getting their own space. Nearly 60 percent of job gains in the last two years have gone to people who are 20 to 34, a crucial rental group, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by G. Ronald Witten, a consultant to apartment companies.
During the economic downturn, apartment developers retrenched. The number of new apartments completed fell from 284,200 in 2006 to less than half that number in 2011, according to census data.
The limited supply is pushing up prices in some markets. In San Francisco, rents jumped close to 5 percent last year, according to Reis, and increases averaged 3 percent in Austin and New York. Landlords have also been withdrawing incentives like a free month's rent.
Liz Brent and Matt Mochizuki moved into a studio apartment a year ago in the Mission District in San Francisco for $1,395 a month. Now they want more space.
Ms. Brent, 26, makes costumes and is working as a barista at a cafe where customers leave big tips. Mr. Mochizuki, 27, has a steady job making custom metal work for a design studio. They are budgeting $1,800 a month in rent.
But at an open house for an apartment billed as a one-bedroom, they found a studio with an awkward layout and bad light. More than 40 people were in line, many ready to hand over a check.
"That's what the market is like now," Ms. Brent said of their fruitless search. "That's how many people showed up for this tiny apartment with no windows."
Some rental markets remain soft, like Atlanta and Las Vegas, the epicenter of the housing bust. Orlando, too, might seem an unlikely place for rental strength. The unemployment rate, at 9.7 percent, is higher than the national average, and home prices slipped 4.6 percent last year, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index.
Yet Ric Campo, chief executive of Camden Properties, a real estate investment trust that owns apartment buildings, said rental business was brisk at its LaVina development. Since the office for the 420-unit complex opened last summer, more than half the apartments have rented.
That's "a faster rate than we've ever seen in Orlando," Mr. Campo said. The company has raised the base rent on a two-bedroom apartment to $1,080, from $995 a month.
Many now wonder about a more profound shift among future buyers. Matt Byford, a 24-year-old litigation consultant in Chicago, acknowledges that low interest rates and low prices favor buying. But he says he is renting and in no hurry to buy, because he doesn't expect much to change soon.
Brad Forrester, chief executive of the ConAm Group, which manages about 50,000 apartments in the western United States, says, "I think it's going to be interesting to see whether there's been a fundamental sociological shift in that 20- to 35-year-old cohort, where they literally say 'this American dream just doesn't work for me.' "

Full text: According to Michael Kinsley, a gaffe is when a politician accidently tells the truth. That's certainly what happened to Mitt Romney on Tuesday, when in a rare moment of candor -- and, in his case, such moments are really, really rare -- he gave away the game.
Speaking in Michigan, Mr. Romney was asked about deficit reduction, and he absent-mindedly said something completely reasonable: "If you just cut, if all you're thinking about doing is cutting spending, as you cut spending you'll slow down the economy." A-ha. So he believes that cutting government spending hurts growth, other things equal.
The right's ideology police were, predictably, aghast; the Club for Growth quickly denounced the statement as showing that Mr. Romney is "not a limited-government conservative." On the contrary, insisted the club, "If we balanced the budget tomorrow on spending cuts alone, it would be fantastic for the economy." And a Romney spokesman tried to walk back the remark, claiming, "The governor's point was that simply slashing the budget, with no affirmative pro-growth policies, is insufficient to get the economy turned around."
But that's not what the candidate said, and it's very unlikely that it's what he meant. Almost surely, he is, in fact, a closet Keynesian.
How do we know this? Well, for one thing, Mr. Romney is not a stupid man. And while his grasp of world affairs does sometimes seem shaky, he has to be aware of the havoc austerity policies are wreaking in Greece, Ireland and elsewhere.
Beyond that, we know who he turns to for economic advice; heading the list are Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University and N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard. While both men are loyal Republican spear-carriers -- each served for a time as chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers -- both also have long track records as professional economists. And what these track records suggest is that neither of them believes any of the propositions that have become litmus tests for would-be G.O.P. presidential candidates.
Consider Mr. Mankiw, in particular. Modern Republicans detest Keynes; Mr. Mankiw is the editor of a collection of papers titled "New Keynesian Economics." In an early edition of his best-selling textbook, he dismissed supply-side economics -- the doctrine embraced by the sainted Ronald Reagan -- as the creation of "charlatans and cranks." And, in 2009, he called for higher inflation as a solution to the economic crisis, a position anathema to Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, who warn ominously about the evil of "debasing" our currency.
Given his advisers, then, it seems safe to assume that what Mr. Romney blurted out Tuesday reflected his real economic beliefs -- as opposed to the nonsense he pretends to believe, because it's what the Republican base wants to hear.
And therein lies the reason Mr. Romney acts the way he does, why he is running a campaign of almost pathological dishonesty.
For he is. Every one of the Romney campaign's major themes, from the attacks on President Obama for going around the world apologizing for America (he didn't), to the insistence that Romneycare and Obamacare are very different (they're virtually identical), to the claim that Mr. Obama has lost millions of jobs (which is only true if you count the first few months of his administration, before any of his policies had taken effect), is either an outright falsehood or deeply deceptive. Why the nonstop mendacity?
As I see it, it comes down to the cynicism underlying the whole enterprise. Once you've decided to hide your beliefs and say whatever you think will get you the nomination, to pretend to agree with people you privately believe are fools, why worry at all about truth?
What this diagnosis implies, of course, is that the many people on the right who don't trust Mr. Romney, who don't believe that he's truly committed to their political faith, are correct in their suspicions. He's playing a role, and it's anyone's guess what lies beneath the mask.
So should those who don't share the right's faith be comforted by the evidence that Mr. Romney doesn't believe anything he's saying? Should we, in particular, assume that, once elected, he would actually follow sensible economic policies? Alas, no.
For the cynicism and lack of moral courage that have been so evident in the campaign wouldn't suddenly vanish once Mr. Romney entered the Oval Office. If he doesn't dare disagree with economic nonsense now, why imagine that he would become willing to challenge that nonsense later? And bear in mind that if elected, he would be watched like a hawk for signs of apostasy by the very people he's trying so desperately to appease right now.
The truth is that Mr. Romney is so deeply committed to insincerity that neither side can trust him to do what it considers to be the right thing.

Abstract: Yet the priority of a few retrograde Mubarak holdovers is to put on trial staffers from the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which are allied with the two main U.S. political parties, as well as from Freedom House and some European groups. The Times reported from Cairo that the prosecutor's dossier assembled against the democracy workers -- bolstered by Abul Naga's testimony -- accused these democracy groups of working "in coordination with the C.I.A.," serving "U.S. and Israeli interests" and inciting "religious tensions between Muslims and Copts."

Full text: Sadly, the transitional government in Egypt today appears determined to shoot itself in both feet.
On Sunday, it will put on trial 43 people, including at least 16 U.S. citizens, for allegedly bringing unregistered funds into Egypt to promote democracy without a license. Egypt has every right to control international organizations operating within its borders. But the truth is that when these democracy groups filed their registration papers years ago under the autocracy of Hosni Mubarak, they were informed that the papers were in order and that approval was pending. The fact that now -- after Mubarak has been deposed by a revolution -- these groups are being threatened with jail terms for promoting democracy without a license is a very disturbing sign. It tells you how incomplete the "revolution" in Egypt has been and how vigorously the counter-revolutionary forces are fighting back.
This sordid business makes one weep and wonder how Egypt will ever turn the corner. Egypt is running out of foreign reserves, its currency is falling, inflation is rising and unemployment is rampant. Yet the priority of a few retrograde Mubarak holdovers is to put on trial staffers from the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which are allied with the two main U.S. political parties, as well as from Freedom House and some European groups. Their crime was trying to teach Egypt's young democrats how to monitor elections and start parties to engage in the very democratic processes that the Egyptian Army set up after Mubarak's fall. Thousands of Egyptians had participated in their seminars in recent years.
What is this really about? This case has been trumped up by Egypt's minister of planning and international cooperation, Fayza Abul Naga, an old Mubarak crony. Abul Naga personifies the worst tendency in Egypt over the last 50 years -- the tendency that helps to explain why Egypt has fallen so far behind its peers: South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brazil, India and China. It is the tendency to look for dignity in all the wrong places -- to look for dignity not by building up the capacity of Egypt's talented young people so they can thrive in the 21st century -- with better schools, better institutions, export industries and more accountable government. No, it is the tendency to go for dignity on the cheap "by standing up to the foreigners."
That is Abul Naga's game. As a former Mubarak adviser put it to me: "Abul Naga is where she is today because for six years she was resisting the economic and political reforms" in alliance with the military. "Both she and the military were against opening up the Egyptian economy." Both she and the military, having opposed the revolution, are now looking to save themselves by playing the nationalist card.
Egypt today has only two predators: poverty and illiteracy. After 30 years of Mubarak rule and some $50 billion in U.S. aid, 33 percent of men and 56 percent of women in Egypt still can't read or write. That is a travesty. But that apparently does not keep Abul Naga up at night.
What is her priority? Is it to end illiteracy? Is it to articulate a new vision about how Egypt can engage with the world and thrive in the 21st century? Is it to create a positive climate for foreign investors to create jobs desperately needed by young Egyptians? No, it's to fall back on that golden oldie -- that all of Egypt's problems are the fault of outsiders who want to destabilize Egypt. So let's jail some Western democracy consultants. That will restore Egypt's dignity.
The Times reported from Cairo that the prosecutor's dossier assembled against the democracy workers -- bolstered by Abul Naga's testimony -- accused these democracy groups of working "in coordination with the C.I.A.," serving "U.S. and Israeli interests" and inciting "religious tensions between Muslims and Copts." Their goal, according to the dossier, was: "Bringing down the ruling regime in Egypt, no matter what it is," while "pandering to the U.S. Congress, Jewish lobbyists and American public opinion."
Amazing. What Abul Naga is saying to all those young Egyptians who marched, protested and died in Tahrir Square in order to gain a voice in their own future is: "You were just the instruments of the C.I.A., the U.S. Congress, Israel and the Jewish lobby. They are the real forces behind the Egyptian revolution -- not brave Egyptians with a will of their own."
Not surprisingly, some members of the U.S. Congress are talking about cutting off the $1.3 billion in aid the U.S. gives Egypt's army if these Americans are actually thrown in prison. Hold off on that. We have to be patient and see this for what, one hopes, it really is: Fayza's last dance. It is elements of the old regime playing the last cards they have to both undermine the true democratic forces in Egypt and to save themselves by posing as protectors of Egypt's honor.
Egyptians deserve better than this crowd, which is squandering Egypt's dwindling resources at a critical time and diverting attention from the real challenge facing the country: giving Egypt's young people what they so clearly hunger for -- a real voice in their own future and the educational tools they need to succeed in the modern world. That's where lasting dignity comes from.

Abstract: Saks Fifth Avenue, meanwhile, which said it was selling items like fine jewelry, fragrances and men's accessories at a fast clip, had a "historically high gross margin rate performance," said the chairman and chief executive, Stephen I. Sadove, in a statement. Throughout its divisions, the company's consolidated net income fell 13 percent for the quarter, but Mr. Holley said in a telephone call with reporters that the drop was because of a net income number a year ago that was buoyed by a tax benefit from the disposal of a German business.

Full text: The holidays turned out to be a lot brighter at the high end, judging by the results of four major retailers who reported earnings on Tuesday.
Walmart, Macy's, Home Depot and Saks Fifth Avenue all reported sales increases for their fourth quarters ending in January. But while Walmart had to lower prices so aggressively that it hurt its profit, retailers focusing on higher-income customers crowed about the solid prices those shoppers paid.
For consumers with higher incomes, "I think there's generally more confidence today than there was at this time last year," said Macy's chairman and chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren. But, he added, where someone is "making decisions between filling up their gas tank or buying shoes or a handbag, that consumer certainly is more impacted."
Walmart has been holding down prices to get customers to spend. "We've seen the unemployment numbers come down a little bit, and that's really good, but that hasn't stopped the paycheck cycle," said Charles M. Holley Jr., Walmart's chief financial officer, referring to customers spending paycheck-to-paycheck.
Price cuts meant Walmart's fourth-quarter margin in the United States decreased by $100 million. For the company as a whole, fourth-quarter margin fell by 0.4 percentage points, to 24.3 percent of sales.
Saks Fifth Avenue, meanwhile, which said it was selling items like fine jewelry, fragrances and men's accessories at a fast clip, had a "historically high gross margin rate performance," said the chairman and chief executive, Stephen I. Sadove, in a statement. There was "reduced promotional activity" throughout the year as the company increased its full-price sales, and its margins for the year rose to 40.8 percent of sales, from 40.1 percent. For the quarter, margin fell 0.2 percentage point to 37.6 percent.
At Macy's, a decline in margin was not because of lower prices throughout the store, but because of a free-shipping promotion and markdowns on cold-weather gear, said Mr. Lundgren in an interview. Holiday discounts "were about the same level as last year and they were all planned," he said.
The average price paid for items at Macy's and Bloomingdale's rose 9 percent in the quarter, because of some inflation in commodity costs and better sales of expensive items like jewelry.
Mr. Lundgren added that the Bloomingdale's business was particularly strong. "The Bloomingdale's customer is categorized as that consumer who's buying more luxury product, and that business was very good, and you've seen that from some of the other luxury retailers," he said.
Macy's gross margins declined by 0.3 percentage point for the quarter and for the year, but its margins, at 40.4 percent for the year and 41 percent for the quarter, were much higher than Walmart's.
Home Depot said that sales at stores that had been open at least a year, also known has same-store sales, had increased in 13 of its 14 categories, and that it was seeing improvement in the professional-contractor sector. Sales in states where housing markets were particularly hard-hit by the recession, like Florida and California, were continuing to improve.
"The performance of our business, particularly in the back half of 2011, would suggest a strengthening market," said Home Depot's chairman and chief executive, Frank Blake.
Same-store sales rose 5.7 percent for the fourth quarter. And two indicators of high-end momentum also rose: transactions over $900 increased by 3 percent, while the professional-contractor business, which handles expensive home renovations, posted increases in transactions and the amount spent. "We're starting to see the beginnings of an improvement among the professional contractors, which is great," said Carol B. Tome, chief financial officer.
Home Depot's margins increased 0.29 percentage point from the same quarter a year ago, to 35 percent, which was mostly because of supply-chain improvements, Ms. Tome said.
Apart from their profit margins, all the retailers posted sales increases, though with mixed results.
Walmart reported the second consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales; the retailer had been in a same-store sales slide for nine quarters before that.
The company said Tuesday that its domestic sales grew 2.4 percent in the quarter, to $72.8 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year increased 1.5 percent.
To achieve that, though, Walmart's domestic profit margin slipped lower. Throughout its divisions, the company's consolidated net income fell 13 percent for the quarter, but Mr. Holley said in a telephone call with reporters that the drop was because of a net income number a year ago that was buoyed by a tax benefit from the disposal of a German business. He said the more accurate number to look at was income from continuing operations, which rose 3.4 percent for the quarter, to $5.2 billion.
Sales rose 5.8 percent to $122 billion.
Executives said customers took advantage of programs like layaway over the holidays and responded to the 10,000 or so items that Walmart had brought back to stores. Visits to stores and the average amount spent per visit both rose during the quarter.
January 2012, the last month of the quarter, was the strongest month in terms of sales and traffic, Mr. Holley said. The company did not offer layaway after the holidays.
"It wasn't the time that we had the layaway -- that speaks to the momentum we have in the Walmart business," he said. "We feel very good about where we are with market share grabs in most categories that we operate in."
"Top-line results were generally in line with expectations, but surprisingly did not demonstrate any improved momentum versus" levels in the third quarter, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, Colin McGranahan, wrote in a note to clients.
Macy's net income rose almost 12 percent from the fourth quarter a year ago, to $745 million, while its same-store sales rose 5.2 percent. Online sales for Macys.com and the Bloomingdales.com unit rose 40 percent from a year ago, and the company said it expected online sales in 2012 to exceed $2 billion.
At Saks, sales of luxury items pushed fourth-quarter net income up 48 percent to $37 million. Same-store sales rose 7.7 percent for the quarter.
At Home Depot, net income for the fourth quarter increased 32 percent to $774 million, while sales rose 6 percent to about $16 billion.

Abstract: Affordable housing advocates are rightly alarmed by proposals in the White House budget and in Congress that would drive up rents for the nation's poorest public housing residents, many of whom are in households that subsist on less than $3,000 a year.

Full text: Affordable housing advocates are rightly alarmed by proposals in the White House budget and in Congress that would drive up rents for the nation's poorest public housing residents, many of whom are in households that subsist on less than $3,000 a year. If the federal government raises rents in housing subsidy programs that shelter about 4.5 million households, it must do so in a way that shields the poorest from eviction and homelessness.
Under current federal law, housing authorities have the option of setting a minimum rent of $50 per month. About a quarter of public housing agencies around the country have set the minimum below that number, allowing some of the poorest families to pay $25 or less. A bill in the House would require that the minimum rent in public housing be raised to $69.45. The White House budget would raise it to $75.
These may seem like small amounts, until you consider households where single parents with two children might be subsisting on food stamps and about $250 in cash payments from the federal public assistance program. Many of these families are already teetering on the verge of homelessness. Some in Congress support raising the minimum rent as an adjustment for inflation, but the resources of poor families generally have not increased. The Obama administration believes its proposal can help raise revenues for public housing programs without harming the very poor. One way to do that is to make the rent increases optional, not mandatory, so that housing authorities are not forced to charge the most vulnerable people more than what they can afford to pay.

Full text: CAIRO -- Egypt's transitional government announced plans on Sunday to sign a loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund worth $3.2 billion, less than a year after abruptly turning its back on a loan from the international lender, according to state media.
The $3.2 billion loan will throw a much-needed financial lifeline to Egypt, a country reeling from a year of economic crisis and social unrest after the ouster of the longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak a year ago.
The deal bears a striking resemblance to one Egypt's military rulers negotiated, and abruptly rejected, last spring, citing concerns that it would saddle future governments with such a large debt that it would amount to a violation of Egyptian sovereignty.
Those objections appear to have been eclipsed by the country's mounting economic troubles, which have grown increasingly dire as persistent social unrest has led to a collapse of the tourism industry and the flight of foreign investors.
Since October, seemingly monthly street clashes between protesters and security forces have killed more than 100 people and battered and burned much of downtown Cairo, leaving it divided by concrete walls and coils of razor wire.
The loan will be disbursed in three stages over the next 12 months at an interest rate of 1.2 percent , the state-run newspaper Al Ahram reported Sunday. The first installment, around $1 billion, will be delivered once Egypt signs the agreement in March.
The newspaper also reported that Egypt was negotiating a $1 billion loan from the World Bank, in part to make up for economic assistance pledged by Gulf Arab nations more than a year ago that never materialized.
Egypt's foreign reserves have plummeted from a high of $36 billion, before the revolution, to around $10 billion in late January, as the government has spent vast amounts to bolster the currency, which has come under mounting pressure.
A devaluation of the Egyptian pound may be inescapable, economists say, raising the specter of increasing inflation and the potential for even greater social unrest.
The tourism industry, long a lifeblood of the economy, has all but collapsed since the revolution, and a steady drumbeat of anti-American sentiment in the state-run media seems likely to keep many visitors away.
Egypt's military rulers may also be concerned about the possible loss of more than $1.5 billion of American aid over a dispute with the United States that has driven relations between the allies to a 30-year low.
Egyptian authorities have accused several nonprofit groups, including four supported by the United States, of operating without proper licenses and illegally receiving millions of dollars of American assistance in the last several years.
Criminal charges have been brought against 43 employees of the groups, including 19 Americans. Only seven of the Americans are still in Egypt, but they have been barred from leaving the country.
The American-supported groups include the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute, which have close ties to leaders in the United States Congress. American officials have tried to defuse the crisis through diplomacy, urging the ruling military council to throw out the charges against the Americans or at least allow them to leave the country.
It is an effort that has so far born little fruit. On Saturday, Egypt announced that proceedings against the 43 defendants would begin in a Cairo criminal court on Sunday.

Abstract: Why? Because spending cuts have deeply depressed their economies, undermining their tax bases to such an extent that the ratio of debt to G.D.P., the standard indicator of fiscal progress, is getting worse rather than better.

Full text: Last week the European Commission confirmed what everyone suspected: the economies it surveys are shrinking, not growing. It's not an official recession yet, but the only real question is how deep the downturn will be.
And this downturn is hitting nations that have never recovered from the last recession. For all America's troubles, its gross domestic product has finally surpassed its pre-crisis peak; Europe's has not. And some nations are suffering Great Depression-level pain: Greece and Ireland have had double-digit declines in output, Spain has 23 percent unemployment, Britain's slump has now gone on longer than its slump in the 1930s.
Worse yet, European leaders -- and quite a few influential players here -- are still wedded to the economic doctrine responsible for this disaster.
For things didn't have to be this bad. Greece would have been in deep trouble no matter what policy decisions were taken, and the same is true, to a lesser extent, of other nations around Europe's periphery. But matters were made far worse than necessary by the way Europe's leaders, and more broadly its policy elite, substituted moralizing for analysis, fantasies for the lessons of history.
Specifically, in early 2010 austerity economics -- the insistence that governments should slash spending even in the face of high unemployment -- became all the rage in European capitals. The doctrine asserted that the direct negative effects of spending cuts on employment would be offset by changes in "confidence," that savage spending cuts would lead to a surge in consumer and business spending, while nations failing to make such cuts would see capital flight and soaring interest rates. If this sounds to you like something Herbert Hoover might have said, you're right: It does and he did.
Now the results are in -- and they're exactly what three generations' worth of economic analysis and all the lessons of history should have told you would happen. The confidence fairy has failed to show up: none of the countries slashing spending have seen the predicted private-sector surge. Instead, the depressing effects of fiscal austerity have been reinforced by falling private spending.
Furthermore, bond markets keep refusing to cooperate. Even austerity's star pupils, countries that, like Portugal and Ireland, have done everything that was demanded of them, still face sky-high borrowing costs. Why? Because spending cuts have deeply depressed their economies, undermining their tax bases to such an extent that the ratio of debt to G.D.P., the standard indicator of fiscal progress, is getting worse rather than better.
Meanwhile, countries that didn't jump on the austerity train -- most notably, Japan and the United States -- continue to have very low borrowing costs, defying the dire predictions of fiscal hawks.
Now, not everything has gone wrong. Late last year Spanish and Italian borrowing costs shot up, threatening a general financial meltdown. Those costs have now subsided, amid general sighs of relief. But this good news was actually a triumph of anti-austerity: Mario Draghi, the new president of the European Central Bank, brushed aside the inflation-worriers and engineered a large expansion of credit, which was just what the doctor ordered.
So what will it take to convince the Pain Caucus, the people on both sides of the Atlantic who insist that we can cut our way to prosperity, that they are wrong?
After all, the usual suspects were quick to pronounce the idea of fiscal stimulus dead for all time after President Obama's efforts failed to produce a quick fall in unemployment -- even though many economists warned in advance that the stimulus was too small. Yet as far as I can tell, austerity is still considered responsible and necessary despite its catastrophic failure in practice.
The point is that we could actually do a lot to help our economies simply by reversing the destructive austerity of the last two years. That's true even in America, which has avoided full-fledged austerity at the federal level but has seen big spending and employment cuts at the state and local level. Remember all the fuss about whether there were enough "shovel ready" projects to make large-scale stimulus feasible? Well, never mind: all the federal government needs to do to give the economy a big boost is provide aid to lower-level governments, allowing these governments to rehire the hundreds of thousands of schoolteachers they have laid off and restart the building and maintenance projects they have canceled.
Look, I understand why influential people are reluctant to admit that policy ideas they thought reflected deep wisdom actually amounted to utter, destructive folly. But it's time to put delusional beliefs about the virtues of austerity in a depressed economy behind us.

Abstract: The decision to cut the reserve ratio requirement for the nation's biggest banks by half a percentage point, to 20.5 percent from 21 percent, effective next Friday, should make more money available for lending, adding a little extra juice to an economy that has begun to show signs of slowing.

Full text: BEIJING -- Determined to keep the domestic economy chugging along, China's central bank said on Saturday that it would reduce the amount of cash reserves that banks need to hold, a move widely seen as encouraging stronger growth.
The decision to cut the reserve ratio requirement for the nation's biggest banks by half a percentage point, to 20.5 percent from 21 percent, effective next Friday, should make more money available for lending, adding a little extra juice to an economy that has begun to show signs of slowing.
The cut is not a huge move. But with Europe struggling with a debt crisis and growth in the United States still relatively anemic, Chinese officials are worried that exports to its two biggest trading partners could collapse, and investment could slow here.
The decision to reduce the reserve ratio comes after a similar cut in December, which followed more than a year of tightening measures aimed at taming inflation and a soaring property market. The country's economic leaders have repeatedly moved to tighten bank lending.
In recent months, inflation has moderated, though it ticked up in the most recent report. But analysts say there seems to be enough breathing room for policy makers to loosen money controls and take measures to ensure that China's growth in a nation accustomed to boom times does not weaken substantially.
Although economists constantly worry about China's growth trajectory, government planners have managed to steer the economy away from disaster.
China's economy grew by over 9 percent last year. Economists are forecasting slower growth this year, to about 8 percent, a remarkable rate considering China is now the world's second-largest economy after the United States.

Full text: "CRACK is wack."
Remember that phrase? I heard many people repeat it last week as they appraised the waste of Whitney Houston's later years and flashed back to her 2002 interview with Diane Sawyer, when she uttered those immortal words. She was bristling not at rumors that she abused drugs but at insinuations that she turned to cheap ones. With album sales like hers, you didn't have to suck on a pipe.
Sawyer wanted to know what Houston was on. Everyone wanted to know what Houston was on, and news reports after her death took unconfirmed inventory of the pills in her hotel suite, wondering if they represented the extent of her indulgences.
No. By many accounts, Houston also drank. More than a little. In fact one early, leading theory about the cause of her death, which won't be known until toxicology tests are finished, was that a mix of prescription drugs and alcohol did her in.
But while the drugs leapt immediately to the foreground, with questions raised about which doctors and pharmacies had provided them, the alcohol receded from focus, as it too often does. Wrongly, perilously, we tend not to attribute the same destructive powers to it that we do to powders, capsules and vials.
We don't talk of its abuse in quite the same titillated, scandalized, censorious tone. Vodka isn't wack. Beer, certainly, isn't wack. It has adorable mascots -- remember Spuds MacKenzie, the Bud Light bull terrier? It's advertised during the Super Bowl and on the sides of municipal buses. It even comes in cloying fruit flavors and brightly colored cans, with fun names. Four Loko, anyone?
Because drinking is legal for adults, safe in moderation, the rightful font of epicurean reveries and the foundation of a multibillion-dollar industry with lobbyists galore, it gets something of a pass. Many of us like it -- no, love it -- too much to survey the damage it can do, look at ways in which our society could work to curb that and acknowledge that the effort isn't so very vigorous.
According to Robert Brewer, the alcohol program leader at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, heavy drinking is the third leading preventable cause of death in this country, after smoking and a combination of bad diet and inactivity. By conservative estimates, it's directly related to about 80,000 deaths each year, an agent of -- or co-conspirator in -- cirrhosis, esophageal cancer, overdose, homicide and much, much more. It seeds and squires a broad range of diseases. Multiplies the effects of illicit and prescription drugs. Adds the twitch to a trigger finger. Puts the wobble in legs on a staircase or hands on a steering wheel.
And while 8 percent of Americans ages 12 and over use illicit drugs, 34 percent are addicted to alcohol or indulge in what public health officials consider risky drinking, according to Susan E. Foster, director of policy research and analysis for the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
As a result, she said, "There are many more deaths due to alcohol. There's much more violent crime linked to alcohol."
That's not to mention all the injuries, emergency-room visits, disabilities and missed work days. Brewer calculates that for those reasons and others, heavy drinking costs the United States about $224 billion annually.
"There is a huge societal burden that we're all bearing," he said.
But is there a commensurate societal concern?
States have raised the legal drinking age to 21 over recent decades, and there has definitely been extensive public education about drinking and driving.
But I can't recall much alarm about drinking's other perils. From antismoking ads, I have pictures of blackened lungs and amputated fingers seared into my memory. From antidrug ads, I remember an egg in a skillet as a metaphor for a brain on amphetamines. Where's the analogous image for the ravages of too much booze?
And where are the taxes? Many studies have shown that pricing is a surefire way to control consumption, and taxes on tobacco have risen accordingly, so much so that in New York, a pack of cigarettes now costs upward of $10.
But excise taxes on alcohol have gone down over the last few decades, when adjusted for inflation and measured in terms of the percentage they represent of the wholesale and retail price of a bottle or a can. The federal government and many states long ago set those levies in terms of a certain dollar amount per gallon -- and then didn't tweak them much as the cost of living went up.
Because Congress last revised excise taxes on distilled spirits in 1991, the real value of those taxes has declined more than 35 percent, said Alexander Wagenaar, a professor at the University of Florida's College of Medicine who specializes in alcohol research.
In several states, the situation is even more absurd. According to a national roundup done by Alcohol Justice, an industry watchdog group, Wyoming hasn't raised the excise tax on beer, which is two cents per gallon, since 1935.
Although some states have increased the sales taxes on alcohol over the last few years, they've typically done so in search of badly needed revenue and in the hope that it won't dampen consumption -- not as a public health measure aimed at reducing drinking.
"It's amazing," Wagenaar said. "There are scientists and epidemiologists counting all the bodies from alcohol-related problems, but only a few of them are looking at tax rates."
And while some states restrict the marketing and promotion of alcohol, the overall advertising climate remains permissive enough that between 2001 and 2009, the average number of commercials for alcohol seen yearly by a teenager who regularly watched television rose to 366 from 217, according to a study for the Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth at Johns Hopkins.
I'm not interested in reanimating Carry Nation, and I'm not about to abandon my white Burgundy or gin martinis. But I'm confused by the paucity of public discussion about all this. I've heard more calls for taxes on sugary soft drinks than for an overdue examination of taxes on booze.
The chatter about Amy Winehouse's dalliances with crack cocaine was more derisive than the talk of her boozing, though what ultimately killed her was alcohol.
What killed Houston is still to be determined. But as we turn her into a cautionary tale and tote up all the places she went wrong, let's not be too quick to edit drinking out of the picture.

Full text: The German economy has been one of the wonders of the world over the last couple of years. While the rest of Europe staggered, German unemployment fell to the lowest level in decades.
This week the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of developed economies around the world, issued a new "Economic Survey of Germany." The biggest challenge it could find facing the country was finding enough workers.
It recommended steps to encourage more women to work.
"Please accept our sincere congratulations for a well-managed economy," said Angel Gurria, the O.E.C.D.'s secretary general, in a speech in Berlin. The country's "growth model has been so successful in navigating through the stormy waters of the crisis."
The German labor system, with its incentives to move workers to part time rather than lay them off, does appear to have been critical in keeping the country's unemployment rate from rising more than it did during the credit crisis.
But the decline of unemployment since then has more to do with the fact that Germany -- perhaps unintentionally but certainly effectively -- has managed to assure that its currency is undervalued, both relative to that of its neighbors and to much of the rest of the world. That has helped the country's exporters and brought more business to the country.
In the Great Depression, many countries tried devaluations to gain export advantages over rivals. The strategy became known as "beggar thy neighbor." It generally failed to work because other countries responded with their own devaluations.
Now some of Germany's neighbors have been reduced to begging. They cannot take a page from the Depression playbook and devalue their own currency. They no longer have one.
The creation of the euro a dozen years ago at first seemed to provide a bonanza to many countries that adopted the currency. Their borrowing costs fell, as currency risk seemed to vanish and interest rates converged with the already low German rates. That cheaper credit helped them to borrow and grow. But most did little to hold down labor costs, or to enact structural reforms to let them cope with an environment where they could no longer regain competitiveness through currency devaluation.
The result is that unit labor costs, one measure of competitiveness between economies, fell in Germany while they were rising in other countries. Since the crisis, they have stabilized and even declined in many countries, but they are not close to making up the difference. German costs are not rising either.
That makes it much harder than it used to be for the rest of the countries in the euro zone to compete with Germany. Germans are correct when they say that it was mistakes made by the other countries -- whether in allowing real estate bubbles in Spain and Ireland or borrowing too much and failing to enact structural reforms in Italy -- that caused the problems. But the euro has become a straitjacket for troubled economies trying to recover.
For Germany, the problems of its neighbors have helped it compete against non-European exporters, like Japan and the United States. The value of the euro is set by markets, but it seems reasonable to think it is based on some sort of average condition in the euro zone. If Germany still had its own currency, it would no doubt be stronger than the euro is now.
The impact of currencies could be seen earlier this month on successive days when Nissan, the Japanese automaker, and Daimler, the German maker of Mercedes cars, announced profits. Nissan moaned about the yen, which makes it very difficult to make money exporting cars from Japan, while Daimler forecast strong earnings if the euro stays where it is. The euro has lost a third of its value against the yen since the credit crisis began.
The O.E.C.D. report is worth reading for its explanation of labor policies that other countries should consider. In good times, many German workers work overtime but are not immediately paid for it. Those hours are credited to their account, and when times get rough they go on part time but are paid full-time wages, with the difference coming out of the account. Another government policy allows companies to reduce hours with the government making up two-thirds of the lost pay.
Those policies no doubt reduce hiring when times are good, but also hold down layoffs when times are bad.
Not all is rosy in the German labor market. Felix Hufner, an O.E.C.D. senior economist in charge of the German desk, told me that he was worried about the fact that about two-thirds of younger German workers did not have permanent jobs. Instead, they have "fixed-term contracts," which make it easier for companies to let them go when the contracts end. Germany may, he said, be in danger of becoming a "two-class society," with most older workers in a protected group and most younger ones outside of it.
The euro zone is also starting to look like a two-class society, with Germany and a few other northern countries in the top class and most of the rest in the bottom tier. France is somewhere in between.
Within each class, attitudes are hardening against the other. "The birth defect of the euro was to put very different cultures of economic activity in the straitjacket of a single currency," a commentator, Jan Fleischhauer, wrote in the German weekly Der Spiegel after an Italian cruise ship ran aground last month.
"Be honest," he added. "Did it surprise anyone that the unlucky captain of the Costa Concordia is Italian?" He asked whether anyone could imagine that a German, or even British, captain would have behaved as the Italian did.
An Italian newspaper, Il Giornale, fired back with a front-page article denouncing the Der Spiegel commentary. "We are persons to avoid, a burden for Europe," the author, Alessandro Sallusti, wrote. "The Germans are a superior race. We have already read that in the speeches of Hitler."
Germans are increasingly angry about having to bail out Greece and other countries, while those countries react bitterly to being forced to take orders from Berlin. The Financial Times reports that "a right-wing Greek newspaper depicts Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, in a Nazi uniform above the headline 'Memorandum macht frei' -- an allusion to the memorandum in which Greece's foreign creditors demand more austerity measures and to the Auschwitz slogan."
One of the great accomplishments of the European Union has been an end to the possibility of war in a Continent that started two world wars in the last century. But the euro increasingly appears to be a step too far, or perhaps not far enough. A currency union cannot endure if countries pursue very different economic, regulatory and fiscal policies.
Greece is an outlier, a country that lied its way into the euro and should have been kicked out when that became known years ago. But other countries are also at severe disadvantages to Germany now, after a decade in which labor costs diverged so sharply. Neither austerity nor structural reforms are likely to improve their competitiveness in the near future. German inflation could help, but that is an idea with no traction in Germany.
The euro has been very good to Germany, but if the country wants to continue to reap the benefits it needs to do more than angrily pay for bailouts while increasing its demands. Having already imposed an unelected prime minister on the Greeks, it now wants elections delayed to assure that the government continues to follow proper policies.
The two classes of Europe need to either get different currencies or become much more integrated by agreement, not dictation.
One trouble with "beggar thy neighbor" is that the neighbors don't like it. During the Depression, they could retaliate by devaluing their own currencies. Now they are simply getting angry, and hitting back at Germany the only way they can, with Nazi allusions and, in Athens, burning buildings.

Abstract: For Russian oil companies like Rosneft and Lukoil and the Russian-British joint venture TNK-BP, the international tensions that began over Iran's nuclear development program last autumn have meant a windfall. Russian gas prices in Europe, Gazprom's biggest export customer, are linked to the price of oil under long-term contracts that are adjusted twice annually, based on average oil prices over the previous six months.

Full text: MOSCOW -- For months, the Russian government has opposed the idea of Western petroleum sanctions against Iran. But new threats to Iranian oil flow could have at least one beneficiary: Russia.
The Russian oil industry was already reaping the rewards of higher global oil prices from Iranian tensions, even before Tehran raised the stakes Wednesday by threatening to cut off oil to six European nations.
Now, whether Iran carries out that threat immediately or Europe proceeds with its previously planned embargo of Iranian oil this summer, the Russian industry could capitalize more directly. Its pipelines stand ready to serve customers willing to pay a premium price -- with a grade of oil closely resembling Iran's.
"It's pretty good for Russia right now," Jesse Mercer, a senior oil analyst based in Houston with PFC Energy, said in a telephone interview.
Russia is now the world's largest oil producer, pumping about 10 million barrels of oil a day, slightly more than Saudi Arabia. Of this, Russia exports seven million barrels a day. Most of it goes to customers in Europe and Asia, although small amounts from Siberia make it as far as the West Coast of the United States.
For Russian oil companies like Rosneft and Lukoil and the Russian-British joint venture TNK-BP, the international tensions that began over Iran's nuclear development program last autumn have meant a windfall. Analysts estimate that Iran jitters have added $5 to $15 a barrel to the global price of oil, which means an extra $35 million to $105 million a day for the Russian industry. And the taxes the Russian government has received from those sales have been a political windfall for Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin as he campaigns to return as Russia's president. The extra money has helped further subsidize domestic energy consumption, tamping down inflation.
"It's good for Putin," Mr. Mercer said. "In the United States, when oil prices go up, the president's ratings go down. In Russia, it's the opposite."
Rising prices, of course, are a boon for every oil producer, whether in North Dakota, the North Sea or northern Siberia.
But Russia has a particular advantage: a pipeline system that can supply Iran's traditional customers in both Europe and Asia. Depending on which way the geopolitical winds are blowing, Russia has the ability to direct more or less of its oil either eastward or westward. Some of its oil to Europe travels by pipeline the entire way; other oil is piped to the Black and Baltic Seas and shipped from there.
What's more, the grade of Russia's main export oil, Ural Blend crude, is similar to Iran's and has already been in greater demand as an alternative to Iranian oil for European refineries.
That's why the price of Ural Blend has risen even faster than global prices generally. In December, it traded at a $2 discount to Brent oil from the North Sea. That difference is now gone. Both grades are now trading for about $119.50 a barrel, energy analysts say.
The six nations Iran threatened to cut off Wednesday were, in descending order of the size of their purchases: Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal. Tehran did not explain why it selected those countries, while ignoring even bigger oil users like Germany.
But all six were already planning to stop buying Iranian oil this summer, anyway, as part of an embargo the 27-nation European Union agreed to last month, to begin in July. At its recent peak, Europe was buying 500,000 to 660,000 barrels of Iranian oil a day, according to PFC Energy.
If the European sanctions do take effect then, oil prices could rise further -- by as much as $7 to $13 a barrel above where they are now, in the view of Wood Mackenzie, an oil consultancy based in Edinburgh.
And even if oil prices later fall, Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, would continue to benefit for a while. Russian gas prices in Europe, Gazprom's biggest export customer, are linked to the price of oil under long-term contracts that are adjusted twice annually, based on average oil prices over the previous six months. So even if oil prices decline, Gazprom's gas prices would remain high in the second half of the year.
The United States, despite being a leading critic of Tehran's nuclear ambitions, has been somewhat more muted than Europe on how to punish Iranian's oil industry -- as American politicians have been divided in their willingness to disrupt global petroleum trading and financing to the potential detriment of strategic allies.
In December Congress passed sanctions that, among other measures, impose penalties on foreign banks that clear payments for Iranian oil. Congressional supporters of the sanctions, and the Obama administration, have said the impact on oil prices are justified, given the stakes in Iran.
But the White House also cautioned that the bank strictures could interfere in the business dealings of American allies. And so when President Obama signed the measure, he said some provisions would be nonbinding, angering hawkish supporters of the sanctions, which along with Europe's are set to begin in July.
As it turns out, at least one exemption under discussion is meant specifically to limit the strategic benefits for Russia, which has been an outspoken critic of American and European strictures against Iran.
The United States and European Union are negotiating an exemption that would continue to provide the former Soviet state of Georgia -- a nation that is now a Western ally -- an alternative to Russian natural gas. The workaround allows payments to an Iranian company, Naftiran Intertrade, that has a share of the Shah Deniz natural gas field in the Caspian Sea.
The field, managed by the Western petroleum giant BP, is a supplier to Georgia. It is also a potential source for the proposed Nabucco pipeline, which would be managed by a consortium based in Vienna and backed by some Western European governments to create European competition with Gazprom. But the pipeline, seen as a maneuver to weaken Russia's hand in European energy politics, has been stalled in the planning phase for years.
China, meanwhile, is expected to circumvent the Iranian sanctions with tacit American approval by settling its oil purchases with Iran through banks that have no dealings in the United States. India, for its part, has negotiated to barter wheat for oil, or pay Iran directly in rupees.
To be sure, there are other limits to Russia's ability to fully capitalize on the Iranian oil upheaval. The big one is that the Russian industry is already producing petroleum from its working fields at full capacity, since so much of it comes from far northern and Arctic wells that must operate full-time year-round to keep from freezing. And so Russia cannot suddenly increase its export capacity beyond those current seven million barrels a day.
But its extensive pipeline network gives Russia enviable flexibility to direct its oil to wherever demand -- and prices -- are highest. That could be a boon for its Asian oil distribution.
As it happens, after a decade of Moscow's investment, a trans-Siberian oil pipeline is scheduled for completion in this year's third quarter. That will create opportunities for Russia to export petroleum more cheaply than its current railroad shipments to a Pacific port where it is then pumped into tankers for shipments to Japan and South Korea -- two countries that, as strategic American allies, will be looking for substitutes to Iranian oil.
The new pipeline, called the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline, forks in Siberia so that oil can be sent either to China or to the coast, for export to other Asian customers. It will give Russian exporters the ability to easily exploit likely price differences between customers like China, if it continues as expected to buy Iranian oil, and Japan and South Korea, which probably will not.
"They could arbitrage between the two," Mr. Mercer, the analyst, said of this Russian flexibility, "and it could play to their advantage."

Abstract: The Buffett Rule is named for Warren E. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway billionaire who made a point of saying that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his hard-working secretary, Debbie Bosanek, who sat in Michelle Obama's box at the State of the Union address. According to Internal Revenue Service data, 236,883 tax filers made $1 million or more in 2009, and they paid an average rate of about 24 percent.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Obama has made the Buffett Rule, mandating that millionaires pay at least 30 percent of their incomes in taxes, the centerpiece of his campaign for "fairness." But look for it among the myriad tax changes the White House detailed in the 2013 budget proposal it released this week, and you will not find it.
The Buffett Rule has become a signal piece of election-year political rhetoric. It featured heavily in Mr. Obama's State of the Union address last month. It has become a favored talking point on the campaign trail. And Mr. Obama underscored his support of it in his budget proposal.
But the White House says it is a "guideline," rather than a legislative initiative. And it says it prefers not to establish the Buffett Rule without a broader overhaul of the tax code, though it would support a Congressional effort to carry it out alone.
"This is the guiding principle of tax reform," said Jason Furman, principal deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council. "To some degree, it's a specific policy, where we set a floor, a minimum rate. And to some degree, it is a statement of principle of how you would like to design the tax system."
The Buffett Rule is named for Warren E. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway billionaire who made a point of saying that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his hard-working secretary, Debbie Bosanek, who sat in Michelle Obama's box at the State of the Union address.
It seems like an appealingly simple way to ensure that the rich do not pay a smaller proportion of their earnings than many members of the middle class. But tax experts and even the White House itself contend it might be hard to carry out.
The White House asked for numerous changes to raise more revenue from the wealthiest Americans in its budget proposal. Those include allowing the high-end Bush administration tax cuts to expire and taxing dividend earnings as regular income.
But the proposal stops short of suggesting an application of the Buffett Rule on top of that, instead listing it as a "principle" for future reform, alongside a repeal of the alternative minimum tax.
The much-hated alternative minimum tax was initially designed to do just what the Buffett Rule would: prevent the wealthy from using loopholes and deductions to lower their tax rates. But the tax was not indexed for inflation, and therefore, each year it ensnares more and more middle-class Americans.
Congress has "patched" the tax to prevent it from hitting the more than 30 million tax filers who should hypothetically pay it. Still, 4.3 million tax filers paid the alternative minimum tax last year, raising $39.1 billion in revenue.
Tax experts say creating a new alternative minimum tax for the wealthy might make for good political argument, but it is less compelling as policy.
"It just doesn't make any sense to have one set of rules that applies to some people and one set of rules that applies to everyone else," said Leonard E. Burman, a tax expert and professor at Syracuse University.
"It's really complicated," Professor Burman said. "I'm very sympathetic to taxing capital gains like ordinary income; that's the issue this proposal is ostensibly addressing. But the idea that we have different sets of rules for different people? It undermines the tax code."
William G. Gale, a director of the Tax Policy Center and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said: "A well-designed tax system would as an artifact be consistent with something like the Buffett Rule. But trying to glom the Buffett Rule onto the current tax system? That's going to be a mess."
There is a second reason for not proposing the Buffett Rule in the budget: It would significantly reduce revenue if installed alongside a repeal of the alternative minimum tax.
According to Internal Revenue Service data, 236,883 tax filers made $1 million or more in 2009, and they paid an average rate of about 24 percent. Bringing that up to 30 percent would raise billions of dollars over time -- but not nearly as much as the alternative minimum tax, experts say.
While the White House has declined to make the Buffett Rule a concrete proposal, Democrats in Congress have forged ahead. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat from Rhode Island, independently came up with the idea for a minimum tax for the wealthy, and made a proposal after Mr. Obama mentioned it in his State of the Union address.
The proposed law, the Paying a Fair Share Act, eliminates all deductions for the wealthy except their charitable contributions. After that, they must pay a 30 percent minimum tax on the balance of their income.
The law includes a phase-in, to avoid taxing Americans making $1 million at much higher rates than others making $999,999. If the taxpayer makes between $1 million and $2 million, the tax bill is only a fraction of the difference between taxes owed under current law and taxes as determined by the Buffett Rule.
The administration consulted with Senator Whitehouse's office on the proposal, and has said it backs it. "We're broadly comfortable with the approach Senator Whitehouse laid out in his proposal," Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner told the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. "You can do it different ways, but no concerns about not going ahead with something in that broad neighborhood."
Testifying about the budget proposal on Capitol Hill this week, Mr. Geithner defended the administration's requested tax changes and its choice not to include a comprehensive tax reform plan.
He said the White House strongly recommended broad tax reform to broaden the tax base and simplify the dizzyingly complex tax code. But it recommends enacting changes in the meantime to help reduce the deficit and raise revenue from the wealthy. "We think the better way to get there is through comprehensive tax reform," he said.
"We took a run at trying to negotiate a framework like that with Republican leadership in the House," Mr. Geithner said of comprehensive reform. "We found no basis for agreement on even the broad framework."
"We're just trying to be realistic," he added.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Mired in red ink, the United States Postal Service is warning it will lose as much as $18.2 billion a year by 2015 unless Congress grants it leeway to eliminate Saturday delivery, slow first-class mail by one day and raise the price of a postage stamp by as much as 5 cents.
In a letter to Congress, Patrick Donahoe, the postmaster general, described an updated five-year cost-cutting plan put together in coordination with a Wall Street adviser, Evercore Partners. It reiterates many of the mail agency's proposals to switch to a five-day delivery schedule, raise stamp prices and close about 252 mail-processing centers and 3,700 local post offices.
The Postal Service has already asked Congress for permission to make service cuts and reduce annual payments of about $5.5 billion in funding retiree health benefits. But in recent weeks, the Senate and House have stalled as lawmakers differ widely on costs, the level of financial oversight and the prospect of widespread postal closures.
On Thursday, Mr. Donahoe said the mail agency's proposals would enable it to save $20 billion a year by 2015, repay its $12.9 billion debt to the Treasury and return to profitability. The plan, for instance, notes that if the post office could raise stamp prices from 45 cents to 50 cents, either in a single year or over a multiyear period, it could bring in new revenue of about $1 billion.
In contrast, Congressional inaction would result in significant annual losses and a "long-term burden to the American taxpayer."
In a news briefing, Joe Corbett, the chief financial officer, said that no formal proposals had been made to increase the price of a first-class stamp. He said the plan described the additional revenue the mail agency could realize over a single or multiyear period if it could increase stamp prices above the rate of inflation.
Since 2006, the Postal Service has increased the price of the stamp four times, from 39 cents to 45 cents.
About half of the Postal Service's cost-cutting proposals require legislative approval. Some Congressional proposals have focused on providing short-term relief through a cash infusion to prevent the mail agency's bankruptcy but also postpone major decisions on cuts until later.
Last week, the Postal Service said its quarterly loss rose to $3.3 billion amid declining mail volume and said it could run out of money by October.
The agency forecasts a record $14.1 billion loss by the end of this year.

Full text: The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell to the lowest point in almost four years last week, the latest signal that the job market was steadily improving.
In other economic news, a rise in building permits suggested that the construction industry was growing confident that more buyers were ready to come off the sidelines, and the latest data on wholesale prices signaled that inflation remained largely in check. And a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found continued expansion in factories in mid-Atlantic states.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that weekly applications for unemployment benefits dropped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 348,000. It was the fourth drop in five weeks and the fewest number of claims since March 2008.
The four-week average, which smoothes out fluctuations in the weekly data, fell for the fifth-consecutive week to 365,250. The average has fallen nearly 13 percent in the last year.
The consistent decline indicates that companies are laying off fewer workers and that hiring is picking up. When applications drop consistently below 375,000, it usually signals that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.
In January, the economy added a net 243,000 jobs, the most in nine months. And the unemployment rate dropped for the fifth-consecutive month, to 8.3 percent. The economy has added an average of 201,000 jobs a month for the last three months.
Faster economic growth is spurring the additional hiring. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the final three months of last year, a full percentage point higher than in the previous quarter.
Still, the job market has a long way to go before it fully recovers from the damage of the Great Recession. Nearly 13 million people remain unemployed, and 8.3 percent unemployment is still high.
On the housing front, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday that construction of single-family homes cooled slightly in January after surging in the final month of 2011.
Building permits, however, increased. Builders broke ground on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699,000 homes in January, which is up 1.5 percent from December and nearly matches November's three-year high for starts.
Construction began on 508,000 single-family homes last month, a 1 percent drop from December and the first decline in four months. A big rise in apartment construction helped offset the decline in single-family homes.
Still, the number of December single-family homes was revised up strongly to show builders had started 513,000 homes, a 12 percent gain from November.
And building permits, a gauge of future construction, rose 0.7 percent, a majority of which were for single-family homes. It can take 12 months for a builder to obtain a permit and construct a single-family home.
Single-family home construction rose in each of the final three months of last year, bringing the pace of those starts to the highest level since April 2010.
"The upturn in permits and starts in recent months has been consistent" with the surge in the survey of home builders, "which has surprised the markets to the upside for five straight months," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. "The new home sales numbers have not yet responded, but builders seem confident that if they build, buyers will come."
The Labor Department also reported on Thursday that the producer price index, a measure of wholesale prices, rose 0.1 percent. Wholesale prices fell by the same amount in December. In the last 12 months, they have increased 4.1 percent, the smallest rise in a year.
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices increased 0.4 percent, the most in six months. Economists said most of the increases were likely to be temporary and not to continue driving the core higher.
Wholesale gas prices rose, but were offset by steep drops in home heating oil, natural gas and electricity, which fell by the most in more than seven years.
The Philadelphia Fed's survey of economic conditions for February found increases in manufacturing activity, new orders and shipments. Over all, the report's index of manufacturing conditions rose to 10.2 points, up from 7.3 in January.
The survey of mid-Atlantic businesses also found steady employment levels but an increase in average work hours.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is not inclined to begin a round of asset purchases unless economic conditions deteriorate, according to the minutes of the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee.
The Fed's leaders did not see evidence that growth is accelerating, according to the minutes of the committee's Jan. 24-25 meeting, released Wednesday. The central bank continued to forecast that the domestic economy would grow only modestly over the next year.
But most members of the Fed's policy-making committee agreed that slow growth was not a sufficient reason to expand the central bank's economic aid campaign. Only "a few" argued the Fed should try harder to address problems like the persistently high rate of unemployment, the minutes said.
The Fed has not expanded its portfolio in more than half a year, and the minutes suggested it was unlikely to do so unless "the economy lost momentum" or inflation fell below 2 percent and seemed likely to stay for a while.
"Given that the incoming economic data since that meeting has only been more positive," Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday, "there is now little chance of the Fed launching another round of large-scale asset purchases" in the next few months.
The Fed's forecast that the United States economy will expand 2.7 percent this year remains significantly more upbeat than the predictions of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. According to the minutes, Fed officials think that if the bank's forecast is wrong, it is more likely that growth will be slower than they expect.
The minutes, released three weeks after each meeting of the policy-making committee, offer a laundry list of reasons for concern:
"The slowdown in economic activity abroad," begins the sobering list. "Fiscal tightening in the United States, the weak housing market, further household deleveraging, high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses, and the possibility of increased volatility in financial markets until the fiscal and banking issues in the euro area are more fully addressed."
Under the influence of those concerns, the committee voted with surprisingly little discussion -- at least according to the minutes, actually a summary rather than a transcript -- to announce the Fed's intention to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least until late 2014. The decision, which surprised investors, extended the Fed's previous declaration of intent to keep rates near zero until mid-2013.
The Fed has held rates near zero since late 2008, seeking to spur economic activity by punishing savers and rewarding borrowers. It also has amassed nearly $3 trillion in assets, including government debt and mortgage-backed securities, to make borrowing even cheaper for businesses and consumers.
The minutes make clear that the Fed intends to continue this huge stimulus campaign for years to come.
The central bank does not plan to unwind its portfolio until it starts to raise interest rates, meaning that it currently projects that the first asset sales would happen no sooner than early in 2015.
The committee continues to debate the expansion of those efforts, according to the minutes. A vocal minority believes the central bank already has done too much.
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, told reporters Wednesday after a speech in Texas that the prospect of additional asset purchases was "a fantasy of Wall Street," according to wire services.
"It's not going to happen; it's not necessary," said Mr. Fisher, who has long opposed the idea. He is not a voting member of the committee this year.
Other Fed officials, including the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have been careful to leave the door open, offering variants on the commitment expressed in the minutes that the Fed will respond to economic developments as necessary.
And an increasingly assertive group wants action now.
"In their judgment, current and prospective economic conditions -- including elevated unemployment and inflation at or below the committee's objective -- could warrant the initiation of additional securities purchases before long," said the minutes, which do not describe who holds this view.
The list appears to include Fed Governor Daniel K. Tarullo, who called last year for the Fed to consider buying more mortgage-backed securities.
It also may include John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
"It's vital that we keep the monetary policy throttle wide open," Mr. Williams said in a speech last week, although he did not mention asset purchases specifically.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- With little fanfare, China's currency has appreciated significantly in the last year and a half, leading many economists to question whether the exchange rate is still the most important economic issue for the United States to press with China's leaders.
The rise of the renminbi -- up 12 percent since June 2010 on an inflation-adjusted basis and 40 percent since 2005 -- has helped American companies by effectively reducing the cost of their products in China. In the last two years, American exports to China have risen sharply.
The renminbi remains undervalued, relative to all other currencies, by 5 to 20 percent, according to various estimates. But many business executives and economists say that other issues, like intellectual-property theft and barriers to entering Chinese markets, are now a bigger drag on the American economy.
In his Oval Office meeting on Tuesday with Xi Jinping, China's vice president and likely next leader, President Obama discussed the currency as one of the trade practices that concerned the United States. That meeting -- and tough public comments by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- continued a three-year campaign by the administration to convince Chinese leaders that a stronger currency is in their interest.
"We are making progress, but it's not sufficient," Lael Brainard, the Treasury Department's under secretary for international affairs, said in an interview, "and we will keep on pushing."
Administration officials and members of Congress have chosen not to emphasize the appreciation publicly, partly to keep pressure on China. Widespread discussion of the change could reduce support in Congress for a bill that would impose sanctions on Chinese imports to the United States and that Beijing strongly opposes.
Similarly, the notion that the exchange rate was no longer as serious a problem as it had been could complicate American efforts to rally international pressure, from Brazil and other countries hurt by the renminbi's value.
Politicians are also wary of seeming soft on China, given that polls show many Americans blame China to some degree for this country's economic problems. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has argued for taking stronger measures against China than Mr. Obama has.
But the fact that policy makers often continue to talk about the renminbi as if the situation had not changed brings its own risks.
"People on the Hill are talking the same way they were a few years ago," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "We should be acknowledging that they've made very substantial progress. I think that would give us more credibility."
Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell and Brookings Institution economist, added, "It's hard to make the case the renminbi is very undervalued on a multilateral basis." Other analysts say that an undervaluation of 10 percent of more remains significant.
Some Chinese officials have bristled recently over the lack of credit they have received for their movement. "Perceptions about the renminbi exchange rate in the international community are absolutely groundless," Li Daokui, a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, recently said. The renminbi, he added, was "probably the only emerging economy's currency that has been rising against the U.S. dollar" since last August.
China's economic rise has depended on a growing factory sector that benefits from a cheap renminbi. But the currency value's has both benefits and drawbacks for the country, say economists, both in China and beyond.
An inexpensive currency effectively subsidizes companies that export goods -- and their workers -- at the expense of most Chinese households, whose buying power is diminished.
A more expensive renminbi gives Chinese households more buying power, by reducing the cost of imports to China. It also puts pressure on Chinese companies to develop more innovative products that bring higher-paying jobs, rather than competing mostly on price.
As a result, the debate over the renminbi in China often resembles a struggle between interest groups. Officials from the United States, Brazil, Europe and elsewhere have tried to strengthen the forces seeking a stronger renminbi by explaining how that will lead to more balanced, sustainable growth for the whole world.
Starting in June 2010, with the worst of the global recession fading and political frustration with China rising across much of the world, American officials and others began to have more success.
The renminbi has risen 8.5 percent against the dollar since June 2010, with the pace having slowed in the last six months. Taking into account the different inflation rates in the two counties, the effective increase is closer to 12 percent.
The rise has helped sharply reduce China's current account surplus -- a measure based largely on the difference between a country's exports and imports. In 2007, the surplus equaled more than 10 percent of China's gross domestic product, a level widely seen as unsustainable. Last year, the surplus fell below 3 percent.
The renminbi also rose substantially from 2005 to 2008, under pressure from President George W. Bush's administration and other governments, before holding steady from mid-2008 until mid-2010.
The rise in the renminbi is not the only reason many economists think other issues, like the theft of patented technology, are more important to the American economy. Because many items are assembled in China, with parts made in other countries, a stronger renminbi affects only a small portion of the cost of many products officially made in China.
Less than 4 percent of the value of an iPhone, for example, comes from Chinese labor and parts, one academic study found.

Full text: TOKYO -- Hoping to win its long-futile battle against falling prices, Japan's central bank on Tuesday said it would try to kindle inflation, setting a goal of 1 percent, by pumping tens of billions more dollars into the economy.
While central bankers usually worry more about keeping inflation in check than trying to stoke it, Japan's economy has labored for more than two decades against the stagnating effects of falling prices, or deflation.
The Bank of Japan on Tuesday said it would expand a program of buying government bonds as a way to inject additional money into the economy. And it set a goal of continuing the effort until inflation had reached 1 percent.
Although some analysts question whether the effort will be enough to achieve the desired effect, the Bank of Japan is responding to increasing political pressure to make a clearer commitment to raising prices, as an economic rebound after last year's natural and nuclear disasters is running out of steam.
The government said Monday that the Japanese economy shrank at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the October-to-December quarter, reversing robust gains in the previous three months, as weak overseas demand and a strong yen hurt manufacturing.
Excessive inflation was a cause for concern for Japan during its rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s, and emerging economies are still careful to prevent prices from rising too quickly. But as the Japanese economy stalled over the last two decades, prices have instead fallen in the reverse phenomenon, called deflation -- the damaging downward spiral in prices that saps corporate profits and wages.
Politicians and economists have long criticized the Bank of Japan for not doing enough to combat falling prices. That criticism became louder after the United States Federal Reserve -- facing economic pressures of its own -- set a 2 percent inflation target last month. Adding to the concern has been the gloom that Europe's debt crisis continues to cast over the global economy.
At its policy meeting Tuesday, the Bank of Japan's board showed a more explicit commitment to ending deflation, voting to set consumer inflation at an annual rate of 1 percent as its price goal, at least for the time being. The bank had previously defined 1 percent only as its "understanding" of a desirable rate of inflation.
Prices in Japan have not risen at an annual pace above 1 percent since 1997, when deflation set in.
The central bank on Tuesday also added 10 trillion yen, or $130 billion, to a 65-trillion-yen asset buying and lending program, a measure meant to stimulate the flow of money into the moribund economy. Under the program, the bank buys government and private debt and lends out money, increasing the amount available for economic activity. Buying the government bonds also help sustain Japan's huge public debt burden.
As widely expected, the bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a range of zero to 0.1 percent.
"We welcome the Bank of Japan's policy measures, which constitute aggressive steps to beat deflation," the finance minister, Jun Azumi, told reporters after the decision. "We hope the bank's bold monetary easing will boost the economy."
Tokyo stocks rose modestly, yields on Japanese bonds fell and the yen weakened against the dollar on the news. A weaker yen is good news for Japan's economy because it strengthens the competitiveness of its exports. The yen's recent strength has battered the country's exporters like Panasonic, which predicts record losses for the year.
Takuji Aida, a Japan-based economist at UBS, said the Bank of Japan's move was too subtle, saying perhaps the bank was trying to appease its critics rather than make an effective policy move. Mr. Aida said he was not persuaded the bank would take a strong enough stance toward inflation.
In a note to clients, he pointed out that in the English version of its policy statement, the bank used the word "goal," but that it used an ambiguous word in the Japanese version of the statement.
"The B.O.J.'s decision today to clarify its 'price stability goal' and expand the asset purchasing program was a positive surprise for the markets," the note said, "but we think that the B.O.J.'s monetary policy will not essentially change even after today's decision."
The bank's message was also clouded because it maintained expectations for a moderate recovery, causing confusion among some analysts over why bank officials had chosen to act now. The yen has recently come off record highs and economists expect better numbers this quarter as reconstruction demand takes off in earnest.
Comments from Masaaki Shirakawa, governor of the Bank of Japan, appeared to further play down the actions' significance. He told reporters after the decision that the bank merely wished to better communicate its antideflationary stance to markets.
"We have already implemented powerful monetary easing to beat deflation," said Mr. Shirakawa. "But as our stance was not communicated fully, we saw room to revise our wording."
He said that the bank's decision was not in response to political pressure, and that its increased asset purchase program was not a way to help Japan finance its debt.
Mr. Shirakawa has long argued that monetary policy alone cannot bring an end to deflation in Japan, a situation that he says is caused by a lack of demand. Economists say the bank is running out of options, since interest rates are already effectively at zero and because it has little leeway to expand its asset-buying program.
No amount of money can energize a recovery, Mr. Shirakawa has said, without measures to restructure and expand the real economy. But the Japanese government, saddled with a debt twice the size of its economy, has struggled to spend enough to sustain strong economic growth, and economic reforms have fallen short.

Full text: UTURUNCU VOLCANO, Bolivia -- The broad hill at the base of Uturuncu is unassuming. Its gentle arc fades naturally into the Andean landscape.
But the 43-mile-long stretch of rocky soil is now an object of international scientific fascination. Satellite measurements show that the hill has been rising more than half an inch a year for almost 20 years, suggesting that the volcano, which last erupted more than 300,000 years ago, is steadily inflating.
"The size and longevity of the uplift is unprecedented," said Shanaka de Silva, a geologist at Oregon State University who has been studying Uturuncu since 2006.
Taken together with other new research, he continued, the inflation means "we could be witnessing the development of a new supervolcano."
Such a volcano could produce an eruption of ash, rock and pumice 1,000 times the strength of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington State, the worst volcanic event in modern American history, and 10,000 times that of the Icelandic eruptions in 2010 that paralyzed global air traffic for weeks.
Luckily, while the planet has 30 to 40 supervolcanoes -- 10 of them potentially active -- supereruptions occur only every 100,000 years or so. The last one, that of the Toba Volcano in Sumatra about 74,000 years ago, is thought to have spewed enough ash to cause a 6-to-10-year "volcanic winter," a 1,000-year global cooling period and a loss of life so vast that it may have changed the course of human evolution.
"We see no evidence for an imminent supervolcanic eruption anywhere on earth," said Jacob B. Lowenstern, a research geologist and geochemist with the United States Geological Survey, who specializes in one of the best-known of the world's supervolcanoes -- Yellowstone, in Wyoming.
About Uturuncu, he said that while "its rise over 20 years is certainly significant," there wasn't enough evidence to call it a supervolcano in the making.
Other researchers agree. But they say Uturuncu's steady inflation makes it fertile ground for study. "It's like a tumor growing within the earth," Dr. de Silva said, "and we have to understand whether it is benign or malignant."
In 2009, with funds from the United States' National Science Foundation, an international team of seismologists, geologists, geophysicists and other experts and students formed a project called Plutons to study Uturuncu and Lazufre, a volcano on the border of Chile and Argentina. (The project's name is an acronym for the volcanoes and the researchers' institutions.)
Uturuncu was already considered potentially active. Eighteen thousand feet up its slopes (it peaks at 19,711 feet above sea level), small holes in the ground called fumaroles leak scorching sulfur gases. These may date 10,000 years and are evidence of a heat source close to the surface.
Also telling is the white soil near the summit (from a distance it looks deceptively like snow) that results from thermal changes below.
Martyn Unsworth, a geophysicist at the University of Alberta in Canada and a member of the Plutons team, studied data from 20 days of fieldwork in November using magnetotellurics, a remote radio-wave-sensing method similar to CT scanning in the human body. The findings suggested a zone of low electrical resistance far below the surface "that is likely a magma chamber," he said.
University of Alaska geophysicists note a region where sound waves travel more slowly than normal, a characteristic of partly molten rock. And Noah J. Finnegan, a geomorphologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has concluded that the magma chamber is growing by one cubic meter (35 cubic feet) per second, though its total volume is not known.
Uturuncu is nestled in one of the planet's largest supervolcanic regions, which has six supervolcanoes across Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. Though it was long thought to be separate from those supervolcanoes, new Plutons findings reveal that magma from Uturuncu's last eruption is more similar to the supervolcanoes' than to that of the region's more common volcanoes.
For Mayel Sunagua, a Bolivian government geologist and member of the Plutons team, this is an exciting time -- "the first broad international effort dedicated to investigating our volcanoes." Bolivia has 198 recognized volcanoes; 18 are considered potentially active. The country's last volcanic eruption was 10,000 years ago.
The flurry of activity here does lead some to wonder: Why focus on a potential hazard perhaps tens of thousands of years away, when other volcanic dangers are much more imminent?
"I ask myself that same question," Dr. Unsworth acknowledged. But he added that the research would broaden scientists' knowledge about volcanoes in general.
Dr. de Silva agrees. With its odd bulge and its other unusual signals, Uturuncu has an appealing air of mystery, he said -- and besides, "it's kind of fun."

Abstract: The proposals are put forward as a new model for warfare in an age of diminishing Pentagon budgets, shrinking numbers of troops and declining public appetite for large wars of occupation, according to Pentagon officials, military officers and civilian contractors briefed on the plan.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As the United States turns increasingly to Special Operations forces to confront developing threats scattered around the world, the nation's top Special Operations officer, a member of the Navy Seals who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, is seeking new authority to move his forces faster and outside of normal Pentagon deployment channels.
The officer, Adm. William H. McRaven, who leads the Special Operations Command, is pushing for a larger role for his elite units who have traditionally operated in the dark corners of American foreign policy. The plan would give him more autonomy to position his forces and their war-fighting equipment where intelligence and global events indicate they are most needed.
It would also allow the Special Operations forces to expand their presence in regions where they have not operated in large numbers for the past decade, especially in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
While President Obama and his Pentagon's leadership have increasingly made Special Operations forces their military tool of choice, similar plans in the past have foundered because of opposition from regional commanders and the State Department. The military's regional combatant commanders have feared a decrease of their authority, and some ambassadors in crisis zones have voiced concerns that commandos may carry out missions that are perceived to tread on a host country's sovereignty, like the rift in ties with Pakistan after the Bin Laden raid.
Administration, military and Congressional officials say that the Special Operations Command has embarked on a quiet lobbying campaign to push through the initiative. Pentagon and administration officials note that while the Special Operations Command is certain to see a growth in its budget and personnel when the new Defense Department spending plan is released Monday -- in contrast to many other parts of the military that are being cut -- no decisions have been made on whether to expand Admiral McRaven's authorities.
The White House and State Department declined to comment on the proposal on Sunday.
The proposals are put forward as a new model for warfare in an age of diminishing Pentagon budgets, shrinking numbers of troops and declining public appetite for large wars of occupation, according to Pentagon officials, military officers and civilian contractors briefed on the plan. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because no decisions have been made.
Under the new concepts, a significant number of Special Operations forces -- projected at 12,000 -- would remain deployed around the world. While commando teams would be on call for striking terrorist targets and rescuing hostages, just as significant would be the increased number of these personnel deployed on training and liaison assignments and to gather information to help the command better predict approaching national security risks.
Officials stressed that in almost all cases, Special Operations forces would still only be ordered on specific missions by the regional four-star commander.
"It's not really about Socom running the global war on terrorism," Admiral McRaven said in a brief interview last week, referring to the Special Operations Command. "I don't think we're ready to do that. What it's about is how do I better support" the regional combatant commanders.
For the past decade, more than 80 percent of the United States' Special Operations forces have been deployed to the Middle East. With the military's conventional forces coming home after the full withdrawal from Iraq, Admiral McRaven wants the authority to spread his commando teams into regions where they had been thinned out to provide forces for wars after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Even more, Admiral McRaven wants the authority to quickly move his units to potential hot spots without going through the standard Pentagon process governing overseas deployments. Historically, the deployment of American forces overseas began with a request from a global combatant commander that was processed through the military's Joint Staff and placed before the defense secretary for approval, in a cautious and deliberate process.
Shifting national security threats may argue for Admiral McRaven's plans. With Special Operations forces concentrated in the Middle East and Southwest Asia over the last decade, commanders in other regions are seeking more of these units in their areas.
State Department officials say they have not yet been briefed on the proposals. In the past, some ambassadors in crisis zones have opposed increased deployments of Special Operations teams, and they have demanded assurances that diplomatic chiefs of missions will be fully involved in their plans and missions.
Senior Special Operations commanders pledged that their efforts would be coordinated with the senior diplomatic representative in each country. These officers also describe how the new authorities would stress working with local security forces whenever possible. The exception would be when a local government was unable or unwilling to cooperate with an authorized American mission, or if there was no responsible government in power with whom to work.
Admiral McRaven's plans have raised concerns even within the Special Operations community. Two Pentagon consultants said they have spoken with senior Special Operations officers who worry about their troops being stretched too thin. They are also concerned that Special Operations forces -- still less than 2 percent of the entire military -- will become so much the "go to" force of choice that they are asked to carry out missions beyond their capacity.
"Sure, we're worried about that," said one senior Special Operations officer with several command tours overseas. "But we also think we can manage that."
The Special Operations Command now numbers just under 66,000 people -- including both military personnel and Defense Department civilians -- a doubling since 2001. Its budget has reached $10.5 billion, up from $4.2 billion in 2001 (after adjusting for inflation).
Over the past decade, Special Operations Command personnel have been deployed for combat operations, exercises, training and other liaison missions in more than 70 countries. Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Special Operations Command sustained overseas deployments of more than 12,000 troops a day, with four-fifths committed to the broader Middle East.
Even as the Pentagon trims its conventional force, with a refocus on the Asia-Pacific region and reductions in Europe, the Special Operations Command says it needs to permanently sustain that overseas force of 12,000 deployed around the world -- with troops that came out of Iraq being distributed across regions that had not had many over the past decade.
Under Admiral McRaven's evolving plans -- what he calls the Global SOF Alliance -- Special Operations forces would be moved around the globe at his direction, to bolster the forces available to the top Special Operations officer assigned to each theater of operation. Thickening the Special Operations deployments in these other regions would allow the United States to be ready to respond more rapidly to a broader range of threats.
Current guidelines allow the Special Operations Command to carry out missions on its own for very specific types of operations, although that has rarely been done and officials involved in the current debate say that would remain a rare event.
"He's trying to provide global agility," said one former military official who has been briefed on the planning. "If your network is not elastic, it's not as agile as the enemy."

Full text: KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Sudan and the breakaway nation of South Sudan have been locked in an exceedingly dangerous game of brinkmanship over billions of gallons of oil, seizing tankers, shutting down wells and imperiling the tenuous, American-backed peace that has held -- just barely -- between the two countries after decades of war.
Not for years have north-south relations been so poisonous, with a proxy war between the two nations fueling rebel groups and sometimes even flaring into direct Sudan-South Sudan clashes. The jagged, disputed frontier separating Sudan from its newly independent neighbor is now probably the most incendiary fault line in Africa, with two big armies that fought each other for generations massing on either side.
After emergency talks to prevent a full-fledged conflict, the two sides agreed to a vague nonaggression pact late on Friday, yielding to intense pressure from the African Union, the United States and China -- a major oil partner for both sides -- to move beyond the language and tactics of mutual destruction. But few analysts see any easy solutions to the heated push and pull over oil, and it is not clear how the nonaggression pact will be any different from previous security deals that have led nowhere. In May, the two sides agreed to demilitarize the contested border. But just days after that, Sudan began heavy bombardment along the border, occasionally dropping bombs in the south, while the South Sudanese rushed in weapons to rebel allies fighting just across the divide.
The border area has been a tinderbox for years because that is where most of the oil lies. Both sides desperately need oil to run their governments, feed their people and stamp out spreading rebellions. And theoretically, both sides need each other. The conundrum of the two Sudans is that 75 percent of the oil is in the south, just across the border, but the pipeline to export it runs through the north. Because of this, oil was once thought to be the glue that would hold the two nations together and prevent a conflict. Now, it seems, oil is becoming the fuse.
When South Sudan broke off from Sudan last year, after years of guerrilla struggle, its independence was heralded as the triumphal capstone ending one of Africa's deadliest civil wars. But the question of how exactly the two sides would share oil profits loomed ominously over the separation, unresolved. Now that both nations are struggling to make it on their own, the issue has proved to be as prickly -- and perilous -- as many feared.
It was South Sudanese oil that drove Sudan's economic boom of the past decade and made the repression by Sudan's Islamist government (which is still heavily penalized by the United States) tolerable to many Sudanese. When South Sudan declared independence, it took oil worth billions of dollars with it, gutting Sudan's economy and creating one of the deepest crises that President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has faced in his more than 20 years in power.
Mr. Bashir is now battling high inflation, a shrinking economy, student protests and several simultaneous rebellions -- in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile State -- as well as genocide charges related to the massacres several years ago in Darfur, and stiff American sanctions.
At the same time, South Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries, is facing a major food crisis and heavily armed ethnically based militias that have been sweeping parts of the countryside, killing hundreds and making a mockery of the South Sudanese security forces.
Stoking the tensions, Sudan and South Sudan have been covertly backing rebels in each other's backyards, leading to border clashes and relentless aerial bombings. The more than 1,000-mile border between them is now effectively closed, with millions of pounds of emergency food and just about all trade held up in a two-way stranglehold.
Before the emergency accord on Friday, the situation was so precarious that many saw only violent outcomes. "I, personally, expect full-fledged war," said Mariam al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, a leading opposition politician in Khartoum, Sudan's capital. "This is like the previews before a film."
In the fight over oil, the south has refused to turn over royalties for using Sudan's pipelines. Sudan upped the ante in late December by seizing oil tankers filled with South Sudanese crude. Then the south took the drastic step of abruptly shutting down all of its oil wells, a measure that could quickly bring the economies of both north and south to their knees. South Sudanese officials have admitted they are using their oil to squeeze Khartoum to make concessions on all sorts of issues, including the disputed area of Abyei, insisting that oil production, about 350,000 barrels a day, will resume only after "all the deals are signed."
The south has even threatened to sit on its oil for years while it builds an alternative pipeline through Kenya. But it is not clear how the new country will survive that long; oil provides about 98 percent of government revenue. And experts question whether the Kenya pipeline is even feasible. It would have to run uphill, requiring many expensive pumping stations, and most likely slice across Jonglei, a South Sudanese state that, with all its militias, is essentially a war zone.
In Khartoum, many people are still struggling to swallow the fact that the south is gone. Nobody likes the new map of Sudan. It used to be Africa's biggest country. Now it looks as if it has been crudely amputated, left with the ragged edges of a raw wound.
"I still can't get used to it," said Nada Gerais, a sales manager in Khartoum. "It looks, looks ...," she struggled for the right word. "Weird."
Mrs. Gerais is a perfect example of the nose dive Sudan's economy has taken. She works in a meticulously polished Nissan dealership that used to sell 50 cars a month. Now, sometimes, it is down to five. She is thinking of switching to pharmaceuticals or food.
"People can stop buying cars, but they can't stop eating," she explained.
During the past decade, Sudan's oil wealth helped build factories, roads and countless shish kebab joints, and it fueled plans for a futuristic minicity, a new airport and a reconfiguring of Khartoum to include a breezy promenade along the Nile.
But now high-rise buildings stand half-finished, and the plummeting value of the Sudanese pound has pushed electronics, books and even tomatoes out of reach for many.
Officials in Khartoum say the south owes them nearly $1 billion in pipeline fees, money needed to keep their economy from collapsing, and they recently sold some of the oil from the seized tankers before releasing them. South Sudan's president, Salva Kiir, said the amount Khartoum wanted, $32 per barrel, was "exorbitant" and "completely out of international norms."
Sabir M. Hassan, a Sudanese government negotiator, said that the north was willing to be flexible, but that the southerners were "too emotional" and still saw themselves as rebels.
"If you give them two choices, they'll choose the one that hurts the north, not the one that helps the south," Mr. Hassan said.
South Sudanese leaders say the same about Khartoum, which has blockaded roads leading south and recently held up humanitarian shipments, all to punish the south at the cost of millions of dollars in lost business.
Many political analysts wonder whether Mr. Bashir will be able to survive these crises. But it is hard to see who would replace him.
Sudan's political opposition is deeply divided and run by white-bearded septuagenarians. The rebel movements do not have much support in Khartoum. Sudanese students started an Arab Spring-like movement last year, but they failed to gain any traction. The security forces were quick to arrest protesters and string them up from ceiling fans.
And Sudan has a resilience that transcends the turmoil. Every Friday, in a dusty ring on Khartoum's outskirts, hundreds of Nuban men gather to watch traditional wrestling. Ethnic Nubans are leading the rebellion in the Nuba Mountains. But there is little evidence of that here.
"Things are fine," said one elderly spectator.
Just as he was about to elaborate, a young wrestler scooped up his opponent and body-slammed him in the dirt.
"You see that!" the old man hollered. "My God, I love this."

Full text: THE economic recovery that has followed the end of the 2007-9 recession may be properly named the private enterprise bounce. While the overall recovery is comparable to recoveries after the two previous recessions, this one has been pushed higher by rising private investment and hiring, and held back by cuts in government spending and hiring.
Over all, the economy has grown a little more slowly, as measured by gross domestic product, than it did during comparable periods of the two previous recoveries. Preliminary figures for the fourth quarter of 2011 show the economy 6.2 percent larger than it was when the downturn ended, against 7.3 percent gains after the two previous downturns.
As reflected in the accompanying charts, the most impressive increase has come in the area of private investment, not including housing. It took a few quarters for businesses to begin to invest, as usual, but then the money poured in. That last report shows the level of investment is now 17 percent higher than it was at the end of the downturn. Neither of the previous recoveries did as well during the first 10 quarters of recovery.
But the government sector of the economy, adjusted for inflation, is nearly 3 percent smaller than it was when the economy hit bottom. By contrast, government spending had little impact on the recovery that began in 1991 but was a major part of the recovery that began in 2001.
Similar patterns can be seen in total employment in the United States. In each recovery, hiring was slow to start. This recovery so far has outpaced the 2001 recovery, but not the earlier one. That is largely because state and local governments have been reducing their work forces.
The current recovery followed a much more severe downturn than the earlier ones, and the nature of the latest recession continues to impede the recovery in several ways. Spending on personal consumption -- the largest part of the economy -- is rising less rapidly than in previous downturns, no doubt related both to the high level of unemployment and to the decline in home prices, which has reduced the availability of credit for many.
In previous recoveries, spending on housing construction was an important contributor to growth. By this stage of the previous two downturns, spending on residential investment was up more than half from the level at the end of the recession. Now, it is substantially unchanged. The housing industry is no longer a drag on the economy, but neither is it contributing to the recovery.
A money manager, James W. Paulsen of Wells Capital Management, argues that the similarity of this recovery to the previous ones suggests that 2012, like 1994 and 2004, is what he calls a "gear year." If so, he said, we can expect the unemployment rate to decline and "confidence throughout the economy will rise," leading companies to step up both hiring and capital investment.

Chart Private Sector Leads Recovery: Measured by Overall Growth in the Economy and by Employment Gains, the Recovery From the Recession That Officially Ended in June 2009 Is Roughly Comparable to the Recoveries That Followed the Two Previous Recessions. But the Details Are Very Different. This Recovery has Been Largely Based On Private Sector Investment and Hiring, and has Been Held Back by Reductions in Government Spending and Employment. Consumer Spending has Grown More Slowly Than in Previous Recoveries, and the Home Building Industry Is Barely Holding Its Own.

Full text: After a stellar start to the year, it was bound to happen. The three main indexes on Wall Street each ended the week with a loss on Friday amid a disheartening euro debt picture.
Many investors and analysts had expected a bout of selling after the last several weeks of gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had risen in each of the five weeks since the start of the year, and on Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average had its highest close since May 19, 2008, before the financial crisis.
But by the end of this week, doubts about the euro zone debt crisis -- an entrenched theme of 2011 -- resurfaced to bully the major market indexes lower. A general strike, protests and political turmoil boiled over in Greece a day after the government reached a provisional deal on the terms of a new loan program.
At the close on Friday, the day proved to be the worst trading session for the Dow so far this year. It finished down 0.69 percent, or 89.23 points at 12,801.23, making it the biggest drop by both measures for the index since Dec. 28.
The S.& P. was down 9.31 points, or also 0.69 percent, at 1,342.64. And the Nasdaq finished lower by 23.35 points, or 0.80 percent, at 2,903.88.
That meant the S.& P., the broader measure of the equity markets, had shaved off 0.2 percent over the five-day period, which was its first declining week in 2012. The Nasdaq ended the week down 0.06 percent, also its first week lower in 2012. The Dow Jones industrial average finished lower by 0.5 percent in the week, its second week down this year.
Alan B. Lancz, the president of the money management and investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates, said the market was overbought in the last few weeks and was due for a pullback.
"It's been an incredible stretch," he said, referring to the gains since the beginning of the year. "But I think the markets are a little bit ahead of themselves, and that is what we are seeing here."
With uncertainties about Greece, new fears about inflation in China and worries about tepid growth in the United States, he said, "Nobody wants to hold over the weekend."
The last time the S.& P. 500 had a weekly loss was the final week of 2011, when it ended down 0.6 percent.
Still, the markets have seen little of the volatile trading that characterized the financial markets last year, when there were often swings of more than 2 percent in one day.
Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, said the declines on Friday were not necessarily signs of a trend and meant only that "there are risks in the world today."
He added that the declines on Friday reflected fears of contagion should Greece default on a bond redemption due in March.
"You get the whole financial contagion process moving forward with a lot more uncertainty, a lot more risk aversion in the near term," he said.
Financial stocks, which have traditionally been sensitive to the turmoil in the euro zone, were down by 1 percent. Bank of America was down 1.34 percent at $8.07. Citigroup fell 2.2 percent to $32.92. Energy and materials were also lower by 1 percent or more.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 15/32, to 100 5/32, and the yield fell to 1.98 percent from 2.04 percent late Thursday.
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed down 1.7 percent, and the FTSE 100 index in London fell 0.7 percent. The DAX index in Germany was lower by 1.4 percent. Indexes were also lower in France, Italy and Spain.
The euro closed down slightly at 1.3172, from 1.3283.

Abstract: The trade delegation announcement coincided with new reports that India, an important consumer of Iranian oil, had eclipsed China for the first time as Iran's No. 1 petroleum customer last month, subverting efforts by the United States to persuade other countries to find non-Iranian sources for their energy needs or risk onerous penalties under a new American sanctions law.

Full text: India emerged as a major new irritant on Thursday in Western efforts to isolate Iran, announcing that it was sending a large trade delegation there within weeks to exploit opportunities created by the American and European antinuclear sanctions that are increasingly disrupting Iran's economy.
The trade delegation announcement coincided with new reports that India, an important consumer of Iranian oil, had eclipsed China for the first time as Iran's No. 1 petroleum customer last month, subverting efforts by the United States to persuade other countries to find non-Iranian sources for their energy needs or risk onerous penalties under a new American sanctions law.
The announcement also came ahead of a planned visit to India by Herman Van Rompuy, the European Union president, who was quoted in an interview with The Times of India as saying that he intended to seek the Indian government's help in pressing Iran to give up its nuclear program.
It was unclear whether Mr. Rompuy knew at the time of the interview that India's commerce secretary, Rahul Khullar, was about to announce a big economic push into Iran that could serve to counteract the effects of the very sanctions Mr. Rompuy has helped to promote.
"We will be mounting a mission to Iran at the end of the month to promote our own exports," Mr. Khullar told reporters in New Delhi, according to Indian and Western accounts of his news conference. "A huge delegation will be going."
In what amounted to a rejection of an underlying motive in the American-European sanction effort, Mr. Khullar said India already was honoring the four rounds of United Nations sanctions aimed at dissuading Iran from its uranium enrichment program. Those sanctions, he told reporters, do not apply to "a vast range of products which India can export to Iran."
Even if the United States and European Union wished to shun business with Iran, Mr. Khullar said, "Tell me why I should follow suit?"
"Why shouldn't I take up that business opportunity?" he asked.
The American and European sanctions are primarily aimed at Iran's central bank and oil industry. But they have begun to cause shortages, inflation and payment problems in Iran for a variety of other commodities by preventing Iran from making shipping, insurance and finance arrangements for imports.
The sanctions already had caused India and Iran difficulties on how to bypass new banking obstacles that had prevented India from paying Iran's oil bills.
In addition to the trade delegation news, the Indian newspaper The Economic Times reported Thursday that the Indian government had proposed a barter with Iran in which India would pay for some Iranian oil with Indian wheat. And Reuters reported that Iran was willing to accept rupees instead of dollars, the standard currency in oil transactions, for nearly half of the roughly $11 billion worth of oil that India buys from Iran annually.
India's attitude was welcomed by Iran, which has denied Western accusations that its uranium enrichment efforts mask a weapons program and has called the sanctions an attempt to bully the Iranian people into surrendering their legitimate right to peaceful nuclear energy.
Iranian news agencies prominently reported Thursday that Iran's crude exports to India had increased to 550,000 barrels a day in January, partly offsetting a reduction by China, which has long been Iran's top buyer, to 250,000 barrels a day. Those figures, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, showed that India was "ignoring recent sanctions imposed by the U.S. and E.U. on importing Iran oil," the semiofficial Fars News Agency said.
Iran economic experts said the proposed India-Iran barter arrangement might be replicated by Iran and its other trading partners as a way to bypass the Western sanctions, particularly those that affect the payment abilities of Iran's central bank.
"Iran will barter oil for food, oil for cars," said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economist at Virginia Tech University. "They will find ways."
India's possible role as a sanctions spoiler has not been lost on American lawmakers who have been aggressively seeking to penalize Iran. At a confirmation hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, President Obama's nominee for ambassador to India, Nancy J. Powell, was bluntly questioned about the Iran issue by Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who has helped push through some of the toughest sanctions on Iran.
The Indian government, Mr. Menendez said, "seems to be rebuking the sanctions and looking for workarounds." Asked by Mr. Menendez what she would do about it, Mrs. Powell, a veteran diplomat, responded that she understood that "this is going to be a very important topic and one of those that I will be dealing with very seriously and very early in my tenure."

Abstract: Among white Americans with a high school education or less, marriage rates and male labor force participation are down, while births out of wedlock are up. [...] when you see a modest rise in incomes for the lower tiers of the income distribution, you have to realize that all -- yes, all -- of this rise comes from the women, both because more women are in the paid labor force and because women's wages aren't as much below male wages as they used to be.

Full text: Lately inequality has re-entered the national conversation. Occupy Wall Street gave the issue visibility, while the Congressional Budget Office supplied hard data on the widening income gap. And the myth of a classless society has been exposed: Among rich countries, America stands out as the place where economic and social status is most likely to be inherited.
So you knew what was going to happen next. Suddenly, conservatives are telling us that it's not really about money; it's about morals. Never mind wage stagnation and all that, the real problem is the collapse of working-class family values, which is somehow the fault of liberals.
But is it really all about morals? No, it's mainly about money.
To be fair, the new book at the heart of the conservative pushback, Charles Murray's "Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010," does highlight some striking trends. Among white Americans with a high school education or less, marriage rates and male labor force participation are down, while births out of wedlock are up. Clearly, white working-class society has changed in ways that don't sound good.
But the first question one should ask is: Are things really that bad on the values front?
Mr. Murray and other conservatives often seem to assume that the decline of the traditional family has terrible implications for society as a whole. This is, of course, a longstanding position. Reading Mr. Murray, I found myself thinking about an earlier diatribe, Gertrude Himmelfarb's 1996 book, "The De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern Values," which covered much of the same ground, claimed that our society was unraveling and predicted further unraveling as the Victorian virtues continued to erode.
Yet the truth is that some indicators of social dysfunction have improved dramatically even as traditional families continue to lose ground. As far as I can tell, Mr. Murray never mentions either the plunge in teenage pregnancies among all racial groups since 1990 or the 60 percent decline in violent crime since the mid-90s. Could it be that traditional families aren't as crucial to social cohesion as advertised?
Still, something is clearly happening to the traditional working-class family. The question is what. And it is, frankly, amazing how quickly and blithely conservatives dismiss the seemingly obvious answer: A drastic reduction in the work opportunities available to less-educated men.
Most of the numbers you see about income trends in America focus on households rather than individuals, which makes sense for some purposes. But when you see a modest rise in incomes for the lower tiers of the income distribution, you have to realize that all -- yes, all -- of this rise comes from the women, both because more women are in the paid labor force and because women's wages aren't as much below male wages as they used to be.
For lower-education working men, however, it has been all negative. Adjusted for inflation, entry-level wages of male high school graduates have fallen 23 percent since 1973. Meanwhile, employment benefits have collapsed. In 1980, 65 percent of recent high-school graduates working in the private sector had health benefits, but, by 2009, that was down to 29 percent.
So we have become a society in which less-educated men have great difficulty finding jobs with decent wages and good benefits. Yet somehow we're supposed to be surprised that such men have become less likely to participate in the work force or get married, and conclude that there must have been some mysterious moral collapse caused by snooty liberals. And Mr. Murray also tells us that working-class marriages, when they do happen, have become less happy; strange to say, money problems will do that.
One more thought: The real winner in this controversy is the distinguished sociologist William Julius Wilson.
Back in 1996, the same year Ms. Himmelfarb was lamenting our moral collapse, Mr. Wilson published "When Work Disappears: The New World of the Urban Poor," in which he argued that much of the social disruption among African-Americans popularly attributed to collapsing values was actually caused by a lack of blue-collar jobs in urban areas. If he was right, you would expect something similar to happen if another social group -- say, working-class whites -- experienced a comparable loss of economic opportunity. And so it has.
So we should reject the attempt to divert the national conversation away from soaring inequality toward the alleged moral failings of those Americans being left behind. Traditional values aren't as crucial as social conservatives would have you believe -- and, in any case, the social changes taking place in America's working class are overwhelmingly the consequence of sharply rising inequality, not its cause.

Central Banks in Europe Hold Line on Rates

Abstract: The move also raised confidence that the European Central Bank would do what it took to hold the euro zone together. "Because of this intervention by Draghi there is a kind of implicit understanding in markets that if the euro zone crisis explodes and you have a serious crisis of confidence, the E.C.B. will intervene even if it's against its mandate," said Harald A. Benink, a banking professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank left its main interest rate unchanged Thursday, as policy makers waited to see whether signs of improving growth meant that the euro zone economy had already put the worst behind it.
Separately, the Bank of England also left its benchmark rate unchanged Thursday at a record low, but decided to expand its asset-buying program by $:50 billion, or $79 billion, to $:325 billion to help the British economy avoid falling back into a recession.
Some major economic indicators in the euro zone have been better than expected recently, raising hopes that a downturn at the end of 2011 will be short-lived. But the picture is muddy, and turmoil in Greece continues to pose a threat to European economies.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, gave a slightly more upbeat assessment of the euro zone economy Thursday, saying there were "tentative signs of a stabilization in economic activity at a low level."
"We expect the euro area economy to recover very gradually in the course of 2012," he said at a news conference after the monthly monetary policy meeting of the central bank's governing council.
But Mr. Draghi also expressed concern that credit remained in short supply, and announced steps to expand lending by the European Central Bank to smaller banks, which are a crucial source of financing for small companies.
After just three months in office, Mr. Draghi has presided over a steep decline in financial market tension. Last month, the central bank allowed banks to borrow as much money as they wanted at the benchmark rate of 1 percent for three years, compared with a previous maximum of one year. That step compensated for a dearth of market financing for banks.
"We averted a major credit crunch," Mr. Draghi said.
The move also raised confidence that the European Central Bank would do what it took to hold the euro zone together.
"Because of this intervention by Draghi there is a kind of implicit understanding in markets that if the euro zone crisis explodes and you have a serious crisis of confidence, the E.C.B. will intervene even if it's against its mandate," said Harald A. Benink, a banking professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. "You see that markets are much more optimistic."
The European Central Bank will offer another installment of 1 percent loans to banks at the end of this month. Some analysts predict that banks will borrow as much as 1 trillion euros, or $1.33 trillion, more than double what they drew in December. If so, the central bank's lending would start to approach the size of the Federal Reserve's measures to help the United States economy.
Mr. Draghi urged banks to avail themselves of the low-cost money, and ridiculed chief executives who have boasted that they do not need European Central Bank's help. Without giving names, he called such boasts "statements of virility" made in some cases by heads of banks that in fact had borrowed from the European Central Bank. The E.C.B. does not disclose which banks use its credit lines.
Mr. Draghi's more optimistic view of the economy dampened expectations that the European Central Bank would cut its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting or in coming months. The rate is already tied with its record low.
"Leading indicators tend to signal the mild recession to end in spring," Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note to clients. "This strongly suggests unchanged E.C.B. rates."
With evident relief, Mr. Draghi also noted that he had received a phone call just before the news conference from Lucas D. Papademos, the caretaker prime minister of Greece and a former vice president of the European Central Bank, saying that an agreement had been reached to allow the country to receive another installment of aid and avoid a default.
"A few minutes ago, I got a call from the prime minister of Greece saying an agreement has been reached and has been endorsed by the major parties," Mr. Draghi said. He also said that an agreement appeared near between Greece and private creditors to reduce the country's debt load.
In announcing that the Bank of England would keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent and expand its purchases of government bonds, Mervyn A. King, the governor of the central bank, explained that the extra stimulus was needed to avoid having consumer price inflation falling below the government's 2 percent target in the medium term. Inflation is currently at 4.2 percent.
"The underlying pace of recovery slowed during 2011," Mr. King wrote in a letter to the Treasury. "Some recent business surveys have painted a more positive picture and asset prices have risen. But the pace of expansion in the United Kingdom's main export markets has also slowed and concerns remain about the indebtedness and competitiveness of some euro area countries."
Britain has been teetering on the brink of another recession as an increase in energy and food prices combined with cuts in public sector jobs, pay and pensions squeezed disposable incomes. Consumers have held back on spending and many companies have postponed investments because of uncertainties about the economic crisis in the euro zone, Britain's largest export market.
"It's still very difficult for consumers," Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics in London, said. "Inflation is still relatively high, and events in the euro zone will continue to impact" the British economy.
The Bank of England said it would expand its purchases of government bonds and other assets by $:50 billion to ease pressure on the credit markets. Banks generally remain reluctant to lend, and smaller businesses, especially, continue to find it difficult to get loans.
Britain's economy might shrink 0.1 percent this year and then grow 2.3 percent next year as the strains of the euro zone spill over to Britain -- which is a member of the European Union but not of the euro zone -- the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said last month. Capital Economics predicts that the economy will shrink 0.5 percent this year and that the Bank of England will expand its bond buying program further.
Some positive data about the British economy, published over the past month, could point toward a return of consumer confidence, some economists said. But headwinds from the euro zone mean it is too early to predict an economic turnaround.
The Bank of England has so far pumped $:275 billion into Britain's economy through its asset-purchasing program, a practice called quantitative easing. Adam Posen, a policy maker at the central bank, told BBC Radio this month that the program was working and that "things would have been much worse if we hadn't done the quantitative easing."
