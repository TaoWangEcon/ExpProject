Full text:   Once again, the Federal Reserve helped save the day for investors.
The United States stock market soared in late trading on Wednesday, shrugging off earlier declines in China and Europe. The powerful rally, which came after several days of severe plunges in the world's major stock markets, was inspired by soothing words from an influential Fed policy maker.
At a news briefing in New York, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the recent turmoil in the financial markets was a risk to the United States economy. Crucially, he added that he found the prospect of raising interest rates next month "less compelling."
Mr. Dudley's words were manna for investors who had been starved of good news in recent days. On Thursday, stocks in Asia opened broadly higher for the first time since last week, including in Shanghai, where the main index was up more than 2 percent.
Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial, said the remarks were "likely to have influence well beyond today."
On Wednesday in the United States, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broad measure of the market, closed 3.9 percent higher, at 1,940.51. The much narrower Dow Jones industrial average gained almost 4 percent, or 619 points, to end at 16,285.51. The technology-heavy Nasdaq gained more than 4.2 percent to end at 4,697.54. It was the first positive day for all three market indicators after six days of losses.
The respite from selling may yet prove to be temporary, but the trading on Wednesday showed that the Fed still holds a strong sway over investors' sentiment.
Until the recent sell-off, investors had been betting that the Fed would raise interest rates for the first time in nine years at its September meeting. Now, after Mr. Dudley's comments, a rate increase next month appeared to be all the more unlikely.
"From my perspective, at this moment, the decision to begin the normalization process at the September F.O.M.C. meeting seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago," he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that steers monetary policy. Mr. Dudley is a member of the committee.
Those words raised hopes that a long-running era of cheap money that has buoyed markets would run a bit longer, at least past the next F.O.M.C. meeting on Sept. 16 and 17.
"I do not believe that Fed officials thought financial markets were quite as fragile as they proved to be in the last week, and they tend not to want to tighten policy during these periods of market turmoil," said Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon, who keeps a close watch on the Fed.
More clues may emerge this weekend at an annual conference for monetary policy makers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, is scheduled to speak on Saturday. Earlier in the week, Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta -- and, like Mr. Dudley, one of the 10 Fed officials with votes on monetary policy this year -- said he still expected the Fed to raise interest rates later in the year.
More broadly, Mr. Dudley's comments on Wednesday underscore a relationship between the Fed and financial markets that some analysts have come to describe as unhealthy.
During the financial crisis about seven years ago, the Fed became the central bank to the world, providing emergency loans to global banks and funneling dollars to countries where there were shortages. The stimulus helped bring the financial system back from the brink of collapse and fueled a recovery in the United States that has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
Still, in recent years, the Fed's ultralow interest rates may have also pushed stock and bond prices to what appeared to be unsustainable highs. Many investors even saw the plunges of the last few days as a healthy corrective to the ebullience. And some analysts have asserted that a September rate increase might be a good thing for stock and bond markets, because it would remove a nagging source of uncertainty.
If the Fed does hold off on raising rates, it may seem like an indulgent overreaction, especially if stocks climb back to their recent peaks.
Stock market slides need not do collateral damage to the real economy -- which Mr. Dudley seemed to acknowledge on Wednesday.
"The stock market has to move a lot -- and stay there -- to have implications for the U.S. economy," he said. He also suggested that a September rate increase could still occur if economic and financial conditions were to steady.
Even with Wednesday's rally, the S.&P. 500 is down nearly 6 percent this year, but it is no longer in a correction, the Wall Street term for a market's being down 10 percent or more from its most recent high. After the rally, the benchmark is now down 8.9 percent from its high, reached in May. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 11 percent from its high, also reached in May.
The stock market was powered higher on Wednesday by technology stocks, including Google, which rose 8 percent on the day. Trading was less volatile than it has been in some recent sessions, with Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, the Vix index, down for a second consecutive day. In other markets, oil was weaker, with the benchmark United States crude contract falling 1.91 percent, to $38.56 a barrel.
The recent sell-off in stocks has wiped about $1 trillion of value from the S.&P. 500, depleting households' nest eggs and perhaps delaying some spending. The S.&P. 500 is now lower than its peak in 2000, adjusting for inflation, according to data compiled by Prof. Robert J. Shiller of Yale.
Still, stock market corrections have often come and gone, usually with little consequence. And, importantly, they do not always signal tough economic times ahead.
"Corrections are generally three times as frequent as recessions," David Bianco, a strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York, said in an email, referring to the period since 1960. "This time I think the cause isn't about U.S. recession risk."
The last time the stock market declined more than 10 percent was in 2011. But the United States economy has mostly grown steadily since then.
Corrections hit the stock market in 1997, 1998 and 1999, according to data from S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, and in each of those years the United States economy grew by more than 4 percent. This shows that stock market corrections can be relatively isolated events that are driven more by concerns about the strength of corporate profits.
Mr. Bianco noted that the profits of companies within the S.&P. 500 had been flat in recent quarters and were likely to remain sluggish for a while.
"I believe that is the cause of the correction," he said.
The recent wave of selling was set off in part by China's surprise devaluation of its currency, the renminbi, on Aug. 11.
Since the country's stock market started plunging in June, after a rally that more than doubled share values in a year, China's leaders have been scrambling to prop up the markets. But shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen have continued to slide. Officials now appear to be tacitly acknowledging the failure of their efforts to rescue shares.
Li Kui-Wai, an associate professor of economics and finance at the City University of Hong Kong, said such measures amounted to "financial socialism."
"Basically they just try to bail out everything," Mr. Li said on Wednesday. "The market is unsure about what China can do or will do, other than interfering in it," he added, referring to the state measures.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- As markets quake and stock prices fall, investors increasingly are betting that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates this year.
Their conclusion is a striking rejection of the Fed's stated plans -- and it appears premature.
The Fed watches financial markets closely, of course. Investors are losing money they might have spent, and falling prices can be an indicator of broader economic problems.
But the losses so far probably aren't big enough to crimp growth, and officials have plenty of time to see what happens next. The Fed's policy making committee doesn't meet until mid-September, and it has two more meetings scheduled later this year, in October and December.
"I expect the normalization of monetary policy -- that is, interest rates -- to begin sometime this year," Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a calming speech that he delivered in Berkeley, Calif., on Monday as the closing bell rang in New York, ending another ride on the market roller coaster.
The volatility of financial markets over the last few days contrasts with the stability of domestic economic growth over the last several years. The Fed is focused on that broader picture, and while the pace of growth remains sluggish by past standards, central bank officials have suggested repeatedly that they regard it as good enough.
Mr. Lockhart noted some of the factors that are roiling markets, including the rise of the dollar, China's currency devaluation and falling oil prices. But he said the Atlanta Fed expected the economy to continue its expansion, including adding jobs.
"The current bout of market turmoil, if it continues, might persuade the Fed to hold off on raising interest rates in September," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Monday. "Since that volatility doesn't reflect any genuine economic slump, however, we wouldn't be surprised if it proved short-lived, leaving the way open for the Fed to begin raising rates at some point this year."
Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has said that the Fed wants to raise its benchmark rate slowly over the next several years, gradually reducing its long-running stimulus campaign to bring the economy back to good health. The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since December 2008.
The Fed has repeatedly delayed the beginning of that process, as economic growth has fallen short of its expectations. But as recently as June, most members of the Fed's leadership -- 15 of the 17 senior officials -- indicated they planned to start raising rates this year.
That plan faced considerable skepticism even before the recent market downturn. Inflation has remained persistently sluggish since the Great Recession, even as job growth has strengthened. Some Fed officials cautioned that the central bank had not done enough to raise inflation toward its targeted 2 percent annual pace.
Recent events have heightened those misgivings. The decline of oil prices and China's latest economic stimulus may further damp inflation. The fall of stock prices also reflects concern among some investors about the health of the domestic economy. The share of Americans without jobs remains unusually high and wage growth remains weak, problems that a premature rate increase could worsen.
"A reasonable assessment of current conditions" suggests that a rate increase "in the near future would be a serious error that would threaten all three of the Fed's major objectives -- price stability, full employment and financial stability," Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist who served as President Obama's chief economic adviser, wrote in an opinion piece in The Financial Times on Monday.
In addition, the International Monetary Fund has expressed concern that the Fed, by raising rates, could increase pressure on developing economies.
And the market's decline helps mitigate worries that low interest rates encourage excessive speculation.
Against that backdrop, more investors are now concluding that the Fed will decide to wait a little longer before raising rates.
Measures of expectations derived from asset prices have shifted sharply in recent days. The odds of a September rate increase, by one measure, fell by half, from about 48 percent last week to just 22 percent on Monday. Even more striking, the odds of a rate increase this year fell below 50 percent for the first time.
Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, who had predicted a September lift until the recent stock market sell-off, said he now expected the Fed to wait until March.
"Although we continue to see economic activity in the U.S. as solid and justifying modest rate hikes, we believe the Federal Reserve is unlikely to begin a hiking cycle in this environment for fear that such a move may further destabilize markets," Mr. Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Monday.
Fed officials may reach a different conclusion, but the shift in expectations still poses a challenge because officials have said they want markets to be ready for an increase. By minimizing the element of surprise, they hope to minimize volatility.
If the Fed wants to convince investors that September is still on the table, time is running short. The most obvious opportunity comes this weekend, when central bankers will gather in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming for an annual policy conference. The Fed's vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, is scheduled to speak.

Abstract: The fact that the Chinese government has engaged in unprecedented steps to try to contain the stock market sell-off, to little avail, may suggest limitations on the power of even the mighty Chinese state.

Full text:   Last week, global financial markets were churning, but it really only mattered if you were an oil trader, a Chinese bureaucrat or a hedge fund manager.
Now it's starting to get scary for everyone.
An 8.5 percent drop in the Shanghai Composite index in Monday's trading session spread to financial markets across the world. In the United States, the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 3.9 percent by Monday's close after a volatile trading day, after steeper declines in Asian and European stock markets. Price fell for oil and other commodities, and money rushed into the safety of United States Treasury bonds.
What's fascinating is that there is no clear, simple story about what is different about the outlook now for interest rates, for United States and European corporate profits or for economic growth compared with one week ago, when the S.&P. 500 index was 10 percent higher.
Here's how to make sense of what is a truly global story, stretching from the streets of Shanghai, where stock investing has become a middle-class sport in recent years, to the oil fields of both the Middle East and Middle America, to the hallways of power in the Federal Reserve in Washington.
This Started in China, but Is a Lot Bigger Than China
The immediate cause of the outburst of global volatility was China, where the sharp drop in stocks on Monday continued a rout that has been underway -- with periodic pauses because of government interventions -- all summer.
The Chinese economy is slowing, and the 38 percent drop in the Shanghai composite index since June 12 is indeed a huge number. There is no question that this giant economy is struggling with a transition from the investment-and-export-led boom of the last generation toward something more sustainable.
But a few facts make China's problems a less than completely satisfying explanation for the turmoil across world markets. The Chinese stock market has risen sharply over the past year as millions of middle-class Chinese citizens took to making investments. Even after its steep drop this summer, the Shanghai index is down less than 1 percent for the year and still up 43 percent from one year ago.
There may be a more complex story for why a sharp drop in the Chinese market should cause bigger ripples in the global economy than the sharp gain over the six months that preceded it. The fact that the Chinese government has engaged in unprecedented steps to try to contain the stock market sell-off, to little avail, may suggest limitations on the power of even the mighty Chinese state.
In other words, the sell-off in Chinese stocks may not matter much in isolation. But it tells us much about the inability of Chinese leaders to bring the country's economy in for a soft landing. And that is something scarier.
Other Emerging Markets Are Getting Hammered
Some of the key evidence for the "this is about more than China" story comes from other emerging markets, stretching from Malaysia to Mexico, that are also taking it on the chin. Their currencies and stock and bond prices have fallen sharply over the last week. Some of that drop most likely reflects exposure to the Chinese economy. But some of it reflects something bigger.
Call this the Taper Tantrum 3.0.
The original taper tantrum happened in June 2013. It is a cute name for what occurred when global financial markets collectively went berserk over the realization that the Fed was serious about tapering its program of quantitative easing -- or put more plainly, that the Fed would wind down its injections of money into the financial system over time. There was a second, similar explosion of volatility in October 2014, as the Fed's intentions to raise interest rates in 2015 became clearer.
In effect, the Fed's easy money policies had led global investors to search for higher-yielding securities, which they found in many faster-growing emerging markets. Money gushed into these countries in search of better returns from 2010 until 2013, driving up asset prices.
But as the end of the era of cheap dollars has approached, that hot money has withdrawn -- and created volatile spikes in interest rates and damage to those emerging economies. (Look at this presentation by Hyun Sung Shin of the Bank for International Settlements for a more detailed argument around how and why this happens).
Falling Oil Prices Are a Cause and Effect
The turmoil in financial markets has had a particularly big impact of the price of commodities, including oil, the most economically significant commodity of them all.
The price of a barrel of oil fell from around $60 in late June to under $40 on Monday. Over time, that will be good news for American and European energy consumers, but there are complex feedback loops that probably make the commodity sell-off both a cause and a result of the broader emerging markets panic.
When oil prices first plummeted in the second half of last year, there were widespread forecasts that the price drop would cause oil exploration to shutter around the world, helping keep the market in balance. Instead, American producers have kept up production, keeping supplies high despite lower prices.
Here's the feedback loop: The slowdown in China and other emerging markets lowers demand. High supplies and weak demand equals lower prices -- which feeds back into weaker economic conditions for energy-producing countries like those in the Middle East, Latin America and Russia.
Then the Fed Makes Its Move
In the background of all of this is a crucial decision looming for the United States Federal Reserve. Fed officials have expressed confidence that the domestic economy is on track and that the time is right to raise interest rates after nearly seven years of keeping them near zero. It could make that move at its policy meeting on Sept. 16 and 17.
Fed officials have indicated a determination to base interest rates on what is most appropriate given the state of the American economy and not to overreact to fluctuations in markets. The latest volatility will test that resolve.
Futures markets are increasingly betting that the Fed will indeed hold off to assess the damage to the economy, if any, from the latest global financial strains. On Monday, the market priced in a 24 percent chance of a rate increase in September, compared with a 48 percent chance just a week ago.
And the value of the dollar on currency markets fell 1.6 percent on Monday (as measured by the dollar index) as investors priced in greater likelihood of the Fed's keeping rates lower for longer.
Commentators have long accused the Fed of overreacting to the latest financial market moves, a complaint that makes Fed officials bristle; they argue they are making their decisions based on measures of the real economy like inflation and employment data. If markets remain volatile heading into the next meeting but economic data remains consistent with recent solid readings, that will make for a tough decision.
Of course, it is the Fed's job to set policy based on where the economy is going, not where it has been. If markets keep falling, that could endanger American growth prospects. On the other hand, the Fed's job isn't to try to protect investors from the risks of a downturn.
And if the last few days have taught anything, it is that global markets will be poised for a big reaction, no matter what the central bank does.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- AS Jimmy Carter moves into the twilight of his life, it is enormously frustrating for those of us who worked closely with him in the White House to witness his presidency caricatured as a failure, and to see how he has been marginalized, even by his fellow Democrats, since he left office in 1981.
His defining characteristic was confronting intractable problems regardless of their political cost. His closest aide and confidant, Hamilton Jordan, ruefully joked that the worst argument to make to President Carter to dissuade him from action was that it would hurt him politically.
A former one-term governor of Georgia, Mr. Carter won with a colorblind campaign, and in office he stayed faithful to his message of uplifting the poor of all races at the risk of losing his white Southern base.
Mr. Carter understood that, after Watergate, trust in government needed to be restored. He imposed gift limits and financial disclosure rules on his appointees; slowed the revolving door of officials departing to lobby their former departments; and appointed inspectors general to root out fraud and mismanagement.
Mr. Carter established the Department of Education and increased college tuition grants for needy students. He ended federal price regulation of trucking, interstate buses, railroads and airlines.
America's energy outlook would not be as bright as it is today were it not for his dogged determination to awaken the American public and Congress to the dangers of our growing dependence on foreign oil. He broke a quarter-century impasse and began to phase out federal price controls for natural gas, and then crude oil; created the Department of Energy; and began tax incentives for home insulation and for solar energy.
He created the modern vice presidency, making Walter F. Mondale a full partner, and giving him an office close to his own, access to classified documents and involvement in every major decision.
Mr. Carter's greatest achievements lay in foreign policy, in the humbling aftermath of Vietnam. In an extraordinary act of diplomatic negotiation that he personally conducted at Camp David, Md., Mr. Carter produced the first Middle East peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. It remains a touchstone of United States security policy in the region.
In Asia, he took on the Taiwan lobby to establish full diplomatic relations with China, completing the opening begun by Richard M. Nixon. In Latin America, he began a new era of mutual respect by turning over the Panama Canal to local control, and limiting arms sales to military dictatorships. His administration began the unraveling of the Soviet Union by embracing human rights and introducing intermediate-range missiles in Europe.
Given these lasting achievements, why is the Carter presidency viewed with such disdain by so many? The answers lie in two areas, one in his style of governing and his unbending character, and the other in external events. Losing a fight for a second term in a landslide automatically casts a cloud. President Ronald Reagan's positive, hopeful approach also contrasted with Mr. Carter's penchant to be the bearer of unpleasant truths, to ask for sacrifice in a way that shaded into the image of a public scold. Trained as an engineer, he sought comprehensive solutions to fundamental challenges through a political system designed for incremental change; his significant successes never quite seemed to match the ambition of his proposals.
Early in his presidency, when he was trying to manage the White House on his own, without a chief of staff, Mr. Carter sent Congress a blizzard of controversial legislative proposals. By his own admission, this overloaded the congressional circuits with too many competing initiatives. What came back paled in contrast to his excessively broad goals and confused the public. Some presidents have an indefinable quality of making half a loaf seem like a victory, but Mr. Carter did not really recognize politics as the art of the possible. When he won, he looked as if accepting compromise was a loss. Mr. Carter did what he considered "the right thing" for his country, and let the political chips fall where they may.
The fruit of some of Mr. Carter's greatest achievements came only after he left office. The most painful example was his reining in the ruinous inflation that had bedeviled his predecessors even before the first oil shock of 1973. Over the objection of almost all his advisers, Mr. Carter appointed Paul A. Volcker chairman of the Federal Reserve, knowing he would raise interest rates to squeeze inflation out of the system. He told us that he had tried two anti-inflation czars, jawboning, voluntary wage and price guidelines, and an austere budget policy; that nothing had worked, and that he would rather lose the 1980 election than leave ingrained inflation to the next generation.
To this day, there is a myth -- which Mr. Carter himself has not tried to dispute -- that if only he had dispatched more helicopters, our attempt to rescue the American hostages held at our embassy in Iran would have succeeded. (Military commanders, in fact, argued that additional helicopters would have compromised the secrecy of the mission.)
For many it became a metaphor for a failed presidency. The withdrawal of Iranian oil from the world market meanwhile sent oil prices soaring, produced double-digit inflation, and left millions angrily waiting in lines at the gas pump, just as Mr. Carter sought re-election. The American public saw the entire country held hostage by a second-rate power in the agonizing 444 days that our diplomats and employees were held captive.
After almost 40 years, these failures -- and all presidents suffer from them -- should be weighed against this good man's major accomplishments. Another Democratic president who left office widely unpopular, but who in the cold light of history is seen as a paragon of honesty, decisiveness and achievement is Harry S. Truman. He was an idol of Mr. Carter, who put a plaque with Truman's slogan on his Oval Office desk: "The Buck Stops Here." Their plain-spoken decency, integrity and courage are too often lacking among political leaders today.

Abstract: Students now amass law school loans averaging $127,000 for private schools and $88,000 for public ones. Since 2006 alone, law student debt has surged at inflation-adjusted rates of 25 percent for private schools and 34 percent for public schools. According to its recent report, 25 percent of law schools obtain at least 88 percent of their total revenues from tuition.

Full text:   Wilmette, Ill. -- TEN months after graduation, only 60 percent of the law school class of 2014 had found full-time long-term jobs that required them to pass the bar exam.
Even that improvement over the class of 2013 (a 57 percent employment rate) came with three asterisks: Last year, the American Bar Association changed the job-reporting rules to give law schools an extra month for the class of 2014 to find jobs; graduates employed in law-school-funded positions count in the employment rate; and the number of jobs that require bar passage fell from 2013 to 2014.
Amazingly (and perversely), law schools have been able to continue to raise tuition while producing nearly twice as many graduates as the job market has been able to absorb. How is this possible? Why hasn't the market corrected itself? The answer is that, for a given school, the availability of federal loans for law students has no connection to their poor post-graduation employment outcomes.
Students now amass law school loans averaging $127,000 for private schools and $88,000 for public ones. Since 2006 alone, law student debt has surged at inflation-adjusted rates of 25 percent for private schools and 34 percent for public schools.
In May 2014, the A.B.A. created a task force to tackle this problem. According to its recent report, 25 percent of law schools obtain at least 88 percent of their total revenues from tuition. The average for all law schools is 69 percent. So law schools have a powerful incentive to maintain or increase enrollment, even if the employment outcomes are dismal for their graduates, especially at marginal schools.
The underlying difficulty is that once students pay their tuition bills, law schools have no responsibility for the debt their students have taken on. In other words, law schools whose graduates have the greatest difficulty finding jobs that require bar passage are operating without financial accountability and free of the constraints that characterize a functioning market. The current subsidy system is keeping some schools in business. But the long-term price for students and taxpayers is steep and increasing.
Paradoxically, the task force chairman was Dennis W. Archer, the former mayor of Detroit, who is also head of the national policy board of Infilaw, a private equity-owned consortium of three for-profit law schools -- Arizona Summit, Charlotte and Florida Coastal. These schools are examples of the larger problem. Most Infilaw 2014 graduates didn't find jobs that required their expensive degrees. Excluding positions funded by the law school, only 39.9 percent of Arizona Summit graduates found full-time jobs lasting at least a year and requiring bar passage. Florida Coastal's rate was 34.5 percent. At Charlotte, it was 34.1 percent.
Yet as the demand for new lawyers continued to languish from 2011 to 2014, the size of Infilaw's graduating classes almost doubled, to 1,223. These schools are also among the leaders in creating law student debt. Arizona Summit's 2014 graduates had average law school debt of $187,792. At Florida Coastal, the average was $162,785. Charlotte's average was $140,528.
The task force report said that some witnesses proposed "capping law student loans, requiring law schools to have 'skin in the game' by being responsible for loan repayment in certain situations, and even scrapping the current federal student loan program altogether." It characterized proponents of such measures as hoping "that a kind of fiscal tough love will force schools to become more financially responsible and reduce cost."
But the task force argued that "there seems to be little need to impose the kind of tough love some want because the market is already doing it."
Except that the market is doing no such thing. While enrollment did decline to about 38,000 last year from 52,000 in 2010, it has not been falling at the pace necessary to reach equilibrium in a stagnant legal job market. Too many incoming law school students still believe they will be among the lucky few who get decent jobs.
The task force, having dodged the issues that should have been the focus of its work, offered four suggestions: law schools should offer students better debt counseling; the Department of Education should develop "plain English" disclosure information about student loans; the A.B.A. should collect and disseminate information about how law schools spend their money; and the A.B.A. should encourage law schools to experiment on curriculums and programs.
None of those will make a difference. The crisis in legal education is real. Magical thinking and superficial rhetoric about declining enrollments, better debt counseling for students, and law schools' experimenting with curriculum changes will not create more jobs.
The A.B.A. should treat the challenge seriously and begin to address it with serious solutions. So far, that has not happened. In fact, earlier this month, the A.B.A. House of Delegates missed an opportunity to address this issue by giving its rubber stamp of approval to the task force report.
Until student loans bear a rational relationship to individual law school outcomes, law schools will exploit their lack of accountability, the legal education market will remain dysfunctional, and equilibrium between supply and demand will remain elusive.
The A.B.A. calls itself "the national voice of the legal profession." When it comes to the profession's most urgent problem, it's long past time to speak up.

Abstract: First there was the housing bust, and the banking crisis it triggered. More than a decade ago, Ben Bernanke famously argued that a ballooning U.S. trade deficit was the result, not of domestic factors, but of a "global saving glut": a huge excess of savings over investment in China and other developing nations, driven in part by policy reactions to the Asian crisis of the 1990s, which was flowing to the United States in search of returns.

Full text:   What caused Friday's stock plunge? What does it mean for the future? Nobody knows, and not much.
Attempts to explain daily stock movements are usually foolish: a real-time survey of the 1987 stock crash found no evidence for any of the rationalizations economists and journalists offered after the fact, finding instead that people were selling because, you guessed it, prices were falling. And the stock market is a terrible guide to the economic future: Paul Samuelson once quipped that the market had predicted nine of the last five recessions, and nothing has changed on that front.
Still, investors are clearly jittery -- with good reason. U.S. economic news has been good though not great lately, but the world as a whole still seems remarkably accident-prone. For seven years and counting we've lived in a global economy that lurches from crisis to crisis: Every time one part of the world finally seems to get back on its feet, another part stumbles. And America can't insulate itself completely from these global woes.
But why does the world economy keep stumbling?
On the surface, we seem to have had a remarkable run of bad luck. First there was the housing bust, and the banking crisis it triggered. Then, just as the worst seemed to be over, Europe went into debt crisis and double-dip recession. Europe eventually achieved a precarious stability and began growing again -- but now we're seeing big problems in China and other emerging markets, which were previously pillars of strength.
But these aren't just a series of unrelated accidents. Instead, what we're seeing is what happens when too much money is chasing too few investment opportunities.
More than a decade ago, Ben Bernanke famously argued that a ballooning U.S. trade deficit was the result, not of domestic factors, but of a "global saving glut": a huge excess of savings over investment in China and other developing nations, driven in part by policy reactions to the Asian crisis of the 1990s, which was flowing to the United States in search of returns. He worried a bit about the fact that the inflow of capital was being channeled, not into business investment, but into housing; obviously he should have worried much more. (Some of us did.) But his suggestion that the U.S. housing boom was in part caused by weakness in foreign economies still looks valid.
Of course, the boom became a bubble, which inflicted immense damage when it burst. Furthermore, that wasn't the end of the story. There was also a flood of capital from Germany and other northern European countries to Spain, Portugal, and Greece. This too turned out to be a bubble, and the bursting of that bubble in 2009-2010 precipitated the euro crisis.
And still the story wasn't over. With America and Europe no longer attractive destinations, the global glut went looking for new bubbles to inflate. It found them in emerging markets, sending currencies like Brazil's real to unsustainable heights. It couldn't last, and now we're in the middle of an emerging-market crisis that reminds some observers of Asia in the 1990s -- remember, where it all started.
So where does the moving finger of glut go now? Why, back to America, where a fresh inflow of foreign funds has driven the dollar way up, threatening to make our industry uncompetitive again.
What's causing this global glut? Probably a mix of factors. Population growth is slowing worldwide, and for all the hype about the latest technology, it doesn't seem to be creating either surging productivity or a lot of demand for business investment. The ideology of austerity, which has led to unprecedented weakness in government spending, has added to the problem. And low inflation around the world, which means low interest rates even when economies are booming, has reduced the room to cut rates when economies slump.
Whatever the precise mix of causes, what's important now is that policy makers take seriously the possibility, I'd say probability, that excess savings and persistent global weakness is the new normal.
My sense is that there's a deep-seated unwillingness, even among sophisticated officials, to accept this reality. Partly this is about special interests: Wall Street doesn't want to hear that an unstable world requires strong financial regulation, and politicians who want to kill the welfare state don't want to hear that government spending and debt aren't problems in the current environment.
But there's also, I believe, a sort of emotional prejudice against the very notion of global glut. Politicians and technocrats alike want to view themselves as serious people making hard choices -- choices like cutting popular programs and raising interest rates. They don't like being told that we're in a world where seemingly tough-minded policies will actually make things worse. But we are, and they will.

Full text:   Housing Data
Several important data points on the United States housing market will be released this week. On Tuesday, a Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index is likely to show that home prices in 20 cities rose over the year ending in June. Demand for homes is building, pushing up prices. Also on Tuesday, a report from the Commerce Department will probably show that purchases of new homes increased in July after a surprise decrease in June. More good news is expected from the National Association of Realtors on Thursday as the group reports pending sales of existing homes for July. Sales were unexpectedly down in June, but may well have bounced back. --Dionne Searcey
Cholesterol Fighters
The Food and Drug Administration is expected by Thursday to approve Repatha, a powerful cholesterol-lowering drug from Amgen. That will set the stage for a market battle with Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which won approval for their similar drug, Praluent, last month. Both drugs use the same mechanism and can lower LDL cholesterol, the so-called bad kind, by 40 percent or more beyond what can be achieved with statins like Lipitor. Insurers hope competition will lower costs. Praluent's list price is $14,600 a year, prompting concerns that these new drugs will strain health plan budgets. --Andrew Pollack
Fit Topic for the Fed
Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, is skipping the annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which runs Thursday through Saturday. But other Fed officials, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, will be on hand for the conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. This year's topic, "Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy," is particularly timely. The Fed is struggling to decide whether inflation is strong enough to start raising interest rates, and the next meeting of its policy-making committee is coming up in mid-September. --Binyamin Appelbaum
Mylan Considers Perrigo Bid
Shareholders in Mylan, a big maker of generic drugs, are scheduled to vote on Friday on a matter related to the company's $36 billion hostile takeover bid for another pharmaceutical company, Perrigo. The vote -- on whether Mylan can issue new stock for the offer -- will be a pivotal step in moving forward with that bid. While an influential advisory firm has recommended that investors vote no, two of Mylan's biggest shareholders have publicly supported the Perrigo offer. --Michael J. de la Merced
Japan Faces Consumer Price Decline
Government data, due on Friday, is expected to show Japan's core consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in July from a year ago. Japan's core consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in June. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying to pull the economy out of nearly two decades of deflation through a stimulus program known as Abenomics. Although the program has increased profits at big corporations, it has also left many ordinary Japanese saying they feel few benefits. Japan's economy has struggled to grow consistently. Last week, Japan announced its gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent in the three months through June, weighed down by dwindling exports and weaker consumer spending. Despite the recent economic contraction, analysts have expressed optimism that consumption will pick up and Japan will eventually return to growth in the current quarter.

Full text:   SAN DIEGO, Venezuela -- When he handily won a primary to run for the National Assembly, Enzo Scarano hoped to be part of a wave carrying the opposition to a legislative majority that would alter the political balance in Venezuela.
But when a government agency stripped him of his right to hold public office, scuttling his candidacy, he found himself caught up in a different kind of wave -- of government measures that appear aimed at weakening the opposition ahead of a make-or-break legislative election in December.
"It was a message to the Venezuelan people: 'Look, we can do whatever we want,' " Mr. Scarano said of the move to bar him and at least eight other prominent politicians and activists from running for office. He said the goal was "to discourage people from voting and to create an internal conflict" in the opposition's Democratic Unity coalition.
Mr. Scarano, 52, who served for a decade as mayor in this opposition-dominated city, became a national figure last year after he was thrown in jail and removed from office on charges that he failed to stop protests against the leftist government of President Nicolás Maduro.
His 10-and-a-half-month sentence ended in February, and in May he won the primary to be the local congressional candidate for the opposition. But on July 15 the national controller's office ruled that he was prohibited from holding public office for a year. The reason: The controller's office said Mr. Scarano was late in filing a financial disclosure required of all public officials after they leave office.
Mr. Scarano said he filed the papers in time -- the dispute centers on the date he was officially removed from office by the court. But even if he missed the deadline by a little less than three weeks, as the controller contends, he argued that he should have been fined, not lost his right to run for office.
In recent weeks the government has used similar measures to rule that eight other opposition politicians or activists were ineligible to hold office for at least a year, eliminating them as candidates in the coming election. The list includes Leopoldo López, who has been jailed since February 2014 on charges that he incited violence during last year's antigovernment protests, and María Corina Machado, an outspoken former legislator.
The controller, Manuel Galindo, dismissed criticism of the actions, saying in a recent speech that his office "does not conduct political persecutions of anyone. It simply is in charge of safeguarding public property."
Venezuela is sinking in an economic crisis that has many experts predicting that for the first time in years the opposition could win a major victory at the ballot box. The government has not revealed most basic economic data since last year, but economists calculate that annual inflation is well over 100 percent and could reach double that by the end of the year. The International Monetary Fund predicted that the economy this year could shrink by 7 percent, a recession partly caused by a sharp drop in the price of oil, the country's main export.
Basic goods are in short supply: A supermarket in a mall that also houses the mayor's office in this city of about 157,000 people had no rice, beans, eggs, flour, sugar, cooking oil, dishwashing soap or many other staples.
Mr. Maduro, whose movement boasts an almost uninterrupted string of election victories going back to 1998, blames enemies, including the United States, for waging an economic war aimed at overthrowing his government. Yet most economists say government policy is the cause of the crisis, pointing to tight foreign currency and price controls, a vast increase in the money supply and prodigious deficit spending.
Now, with Venezuelans enduring long lines at grocery stores, ever-higher prices, violent crime and widespread corruption, voters may be ready to punish the government by giving the opposition a National Assembly majority for the first time since shortly after Mr. Maduro's predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chávez, took office in 1999. That would alter the balance of power in a country where the ruling faction has a stranglehold on all facets of government, including the presidency, the legislature, the courts, the military and the electoral authorities.
Most opposition parties have agreed to field a single slate of candidates under the Democratic Unity banner, which they have used in recent presidential elections and the last time the legislature came up for renewal, in 2010.
Government officials frequently highlight signs of weakness in the coalition, and recent measures seem to be aimed at trying to accentuate its internal divisions.
Mr. Scarano was running in a district that is overwhelmingly pro-opposition, so removing him as a candidate is not likely to give the government an edge there on Election Day -- he is being replaced by another member of his Open Books Party. But it could keep a popular figure who says he has aspirations to run for governor or even president from gaining a wider national audience.
Only about 40 of the opposition candidates for the 167 National Assembly seats were chosen through primaries, and it took weeks of often strained negotiations for the coalition to agree on a full list of candidates, in part because each party wanted to maximize the number from its ranks.
So barring some candidates creates the potential for further divisions.
That was the case after the controller declared Ms. Machado ineligible for public office because of inconsistencies in a financial disclosure, which Mr. Galindo said involved the failure to declare income from government food coupons that were part of her compensation when she served as a legislator.
Ms. Machado sought to name the candidate that would replace her, but the coalition said that under its rules a different candidate should be designated. The dispute threatened to create a rift in the organization, although Ms. Machado ultimately ceded.
The coalition's list of candidates previously came under question when the National Electoral Council declared that at least 40 percent of a party's candidates must be women -- a move that some viewed as an attempt to force the coalition to revise its candidate list and go through another round of internal horse trading.
That was also the case after the Venezuelan Supreme Court last month removed the leadership of the influential center-right party Copei and chose the new leaders. Copei is a critical member of the Democratic Unity coalition, but after the court-imposed change, coalition officials said they would not work with a party whose leadership was picked by the government. They then replaced the 27 Copei candidates on the coalition slate with members of other parties.
Despite signs of increasing pressure on the opposition, the government this month released two prominent government critics from jail. Daniel Ceballos, a former mayor who had been jailed on charges relating to widespread protests last year, was moved to house arrest. Raúl Baduel, a former defense minister and government critic, spent more than six years in jail after being sentenced for corruption. He was paroled.
But analysts said the releases could be an effort, with an eye toward the December elections, to reduce the profile of the men, whose presence in prison had brought international attention. Mr. Ceballos is one of the politicians recently barred from running for office. One of Mr. Baduel's sons, Raúl Emilio Baduel, is also in prison on charges related to last year's protests. He was going to run for Congress from jail, but was also barred from the election.
The government has put up obstacles not only to its traditional opposition but also to a newly emerging opposition on the left. Electoral officials in May refused to allow a dissident group that broke off from Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party to register as a political party. The group, Socialist Tide, said it would run candidates on the slates of other small leftist parties.
Nicmer Evans, a leader of Socialist Tide, blamed both the government and the opposition coalition for wanting to keep his group off the ballot, saying that both saw it as a threat. He criticized "the encumbrances and arbitrary actions" of electoral authorities and said, "We are fighting to overcome all of these attempts to exclude us politically."

Full text:   Rand Paul said something funny the other day. No, really -- although of course it wasn't intentional. On his Twitter account he decried the irresponsibility of American fiscal policy, declaring, "The last time the United States was debt free was 1835."
Wags quickly noted that the U.S. economy has, on the whole, done pretty well these past 180 years, suggesting that having the government owe the private sector money might not be all that bad a thing. The British government, by the way, has been in debt for more than three centuries, an era spanning the Industrial Revolution, victory over Napoleon, and more.
But is the point simply that public debt isn't as bad as legend has it? Or can government debt actually be a good thing?
Believe it or not, many economists argue that the economy needs a sufficient amount of public debt out there to function well. And how much is sufficient? Maybe more than we currently have. That is, there's a reasonable argument to be made that part of what ails the world economy right now is that governments aren't deep enough in debt.
I know that may sound crazy. After all, we've spent much of the past five or six years in a state of fiscal panic, with all the Very Serious People declaring that we must slash deficits and reduce debt now now now or we'll turn into Greece, Greece I tell you.
But the power of the deficit scolds was always a triumph of ideology over evidence, and a growing number of genuinely serious people -- most recently Narayana Kocherlakota, the departing president of the Minneapolis Fed -- are making the case that we need more, not less, government debt.
Why?
One answer is that issuing debt is a way to pay for useful things, and we should do more of that when the price is right. The United States suffers from obvious deficiencies in roads, rails, water systems and more; meanwhile, the federal government can borrow at historically low interest rates. So this is a very good time to be borrowing and investing in the future, and a very bad time for what has actually happened: an unprecedented decline in public construction spending adjusted for population growth and inflation.
Beyond that, those very low interest rates are telling us something about what markets want. I've already mentioned that having at least some government debt outstanding helps the economy function better. How so? The answer, according to M.I.T.'s Ricardo Caballero and others, is that the debt of stable, reliable governments provides "safe assets" that help investors manage risks, make transactions easier and avoid a destructive scramble for cash.
Now, in principle the private sector can also create safe assets, such as deposits in banks that are universally perceived as sound. In the years before the 2008 financial crisis Wall Street claimed to have invented whole new classes of safe assets by slicing and dicing cash flows from subprime mortgages and other sources.
But all of that supposedly brilliant financial engineering turned out to be a con job: When the housing bubble burst, all that AAA-rated paper turned into sludge. So investors scurried back into the haven provided by the debt of the United States and a few other major economies. In the process they drove interest rates on that debt way down.
And those low interest rates, Mr. Kocherlakota declares, are a problem. When interest rates on government debt are very low even when the economy is strong, there's not much room to cut them when the economy is weak, making it much harder to fight recessions. There may also be consequences for financial stability: Very low returns on safe assets may push investors into too much risk-taking -- or for that matter encourage another round of destructive Wall Street hocus-pocus.
What can be done? Simply raising interest rates, as some financial types keep demanding (with an eye on their own bottom lines), would undermine our still-fragile recovery. What we need are policies that would permit higher rates in good times without causing a slump. And one such policy, Mr. Kocherlakota argues, would be targeting a higher level of debt.
In other words, the great debt panic that warped the U.S. political scene from 2010 to 2012, and still dominates economic discussion in Britain and the eurozone, was even more wrongheaded than those of us in the anti-austerity camp realized.
Not only were governments that listened to the fiscal scolds kicking the economy when it was down, prolonging the slump; not only were they slashing public investment at the very moment bond investors were practically pleading with them to spend more; they may have been setting us up for future crises.
And the ironic thing is that these foolish policies, and all the human suffering they created, were sold with appeals to prudence and fiscal responsibility.

Preparing for Life After Cable

Abstract: [...]cutting the cord with cable should benefit consumers.

Full text:   In recent years, a lot of media and telecommunications executives dismissed the idea that Americans would stop subscribing to cable and satellite TV services. But the cord-cutting phenomenon can no longer be ignored.
American cable and satellite companies collectively lost more than 600,000 subscribers in the second quarter of this year, the biggest decline the industry has ever seen. Analysts expect the trend to accelerate as more people replace cable with Internet-based services like Netflix, HBO Now and Amazon, which are much cheaper than the traditional TV package offered by companies like Comcast and DirecTV.
On the whole, cutting the cord with cable should benefit consumers. It will help people save money and gain more control over their entertainment by allowing them to pay only for what they want to watch. Many Americans chafe at having to pay about $67 a month for dozens of TV channels they never use so they can watch a handful of shows. The price of cable and satellite TV service has roughly doubled over the last 20 years, rising about twice as fast as inflation, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
That said, many people won't want to cut the cord, while others simply won't be able to, at least not completely. Families with children may want the broad selection of channels traditional cable TV packages offer. And most consumers will still need a high-speed Internet connection to use online services like Netflix. Although Americans now have more choices than ever for how they watch TV, about seven in 10 American households can only get broadband Internet service from one or two providers, usually cable and phone companies.
In other words, the big telecom companies will still have plenty of leverage. Some analysts predict that as customers desert cable TV packages for Internet-based services, the telecom giants like Charter and AT&T will simply charge more for Internet access, wiping out some or all of the savings consumers had hoped for.
That's why it is important that Congress and the Federal Communications Commission push for more choices in the broadband market. Among other things, they should override laws some states have passed that make it difficult or impossible for municipalities to invest in broadband networks. State and local officials could also help by streamlining rules that make it hard for newer businesses to string fiber-optic cable on utility poles or below ground in order to compete with established cable and phone companies.
There is no question that cord cutting will pose a challenge to established media companies. The stocks of Disney, Time Warner Cable and other companies fell sharply recently as investors decided they'd lose when Americans stopped paying for cable TV channels like ESPN and TBS. But TV programmers that adapt quickly to consumer tastes could profit.
Media companies willing to offer shows, movies and sports outside the confines of a cable TV package can offset the revenue they lose from cord-cutters by tapping the market for online entertainment. They could also experiment with new formats that appeal to young people who spend much more time watching videos on their smartphones and computers than on televisions. Some companies are already moving in that direction. Recently, NBCUniversal, a division of Comcast, recently invested $200 million in BuzzFeed, the digital media company.
Customers are clearly saying that they want to watch and pay for TV in a different way. Regulators and media executives ought to heed and respond positively to that message -- policy makers by encouraging more competition in the broadband market, and media businesses by making more of their content available online.

Fed's Concern and Oil's Fall Hit Shares

Abstract: In the minutes, Fed officials appeared to move closer to raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, but remained concerned that the economic slowdown in China could pose risks to the United States economy.

Full text:   Stocks posted losses on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve sent mixed signals on the possibility of an interest rate rise in September. Energy stocks fell as the price of oil plummeted.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 162.61 points, or 0.9 percent, to 17,348.73. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 17.31 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,079.61, and the Nasdaq declined 40.30 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,019.05.
The minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting gave no specific clues on whether its officials were poised to raise interest rates next month. Stocks recovered some of their losses after the release of the Fed minutes, but the modest recovery dissipated and the market ended the day roughly where it was most of the session.
In the minutes, Fed officials appeared to move closer to raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, but remained concerned that the economic slowdown in China could pose risks to the United States economy. Noting the recent sharp decline in commodity prices, policy makers also expressed concern that inflation remained too low to justify an increase in interest rates.
"We don't come away from the minutes feeling more confident about our call for a September rate hike as we might have hoped," said Michelle Girard, a senior economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Bond yields fell sharply as bond traders took the Fed minutes as a sign that interest rates were going to remain at near-zero levels for several more months. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.13 percent, from 2.19 percent on Tuesday.
Most traders said they believed the Fed would either raise interest rates in September or wait until early 2016.
"In their heart of hearts, Fed officials want to raise interest rates this year," said Alan Rechtschaffen, a portfolio manager of UBS. "But with commodity prices as low as they are, it could give the Fed pause."
Benchmark United States crude dropped $1.85, to $41.27 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, a standard for international oils used by many American refineries, fell $1.83, to $46.98 a barrel. Oil's losses deepened after government data showed oil inventories rose much more than expected last week.
Over all, oil prices are down about 50 percent over the last year.
Shares of Marathon Oil fell 7 percent, recovering from a session low that took shares to their lowest prices in six years. Chevron shares lost about 3 percent, ConocoPhillips fell 3.7 percent, and Exxon Mobil declined 2 percent. All reached three- or four-year lows.
Overseas, China's stock market roiled Asian and European stocks, on fears that the country's currency, the renminbi, would continue to erode. Chinese stocks ended ahead, but only after a turbulent day that included sharp losses early on. The Shanghai composite index closed up 1.2 percent after plunging as much as 5 percent. European stocks ended the day down roughly 2 percent.
The euro rose to $1.1128, while the dollar was also down against the Japanese yen at 123.77 yen.
Gold closed up $11, to $1,128.10 an ounce.

Full text:   RAMENSKOYE, Russia -- A basic barometer of economic activity in this tidy town south of Moscow is the pirozhok, a small pie filled with cabbage and meat that is a staple of the Russian diet.
In good times they sell briskly, snapped up by hungry commuters at Arina's Hangout, a tiny shop near the train station. But sales are down by almost half, a gloomy reflection of Russia's economic slump.
"There were just physically fewer people," said Irina A. Safonova, the owner of the shop, which on a recent weekday was serving pies to a slow trickle of customers. "We used to have lines. Now look at it."
Russians are experiencing the first sustained decline in living standards in the 15 years since President Vladimir V. Putin came to power. The ruble has fallen by half against the dollar, driven by the plunging price of oil, the lifeblood of Russia's economy. As a result, prices of imported goods have shot up, making tea, instant coffee, children's clothes and back-to-school backpacks suddenly, jarringly expensive.
Making matters worse are the retaliatory bans that Russia placed on food imports after the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions for its actions in Ukraine, a policy that took a turn for the weird this month when the government destroyed thousands of tons of what it said were illegally imported foodstuffs including cheese and peaches.
The reduced supply means that what remains costs more, even if it is locally produced. Russians are paying a third more for sunflower oil, a fifth more for yogurt and three-quarters more for carrots compared with a year ago, according to government statistics. (The Western sanctions have driven up the cost of borrowing for Russian companies, but they have not had a direct role in the inflation that is raiding Russian pocketbooks.)
Inflation has reduced the purchasing power of Russian wages by more than 8 percent in the second quarter, compared with the same period last year, according to figures published by Russia's Central Bank at the end of July. And in a sign that the worst is far from over, the economy contracted by a steep 4.6 percent in the second quarter, compared with last year, and officially entered its first recession since 2009.
"It's horrible," said Elena Shcherbakova, a 47-year-old shoe saleswoman whose income, based in part on commissions, has fallen nearly a third since last year. She says she now shops at discount supermarkets, buys the cheapest kind of sausage and carefully counts containers of yogurt instead of throwing them into her cart by the handful the way she used to.
It is not clear what, if anything, this means for Mr. Putin. The trouble pales in comparison with the turbulent 1990s, when people's wages went down by nearly half. Russians have an immense capacity for stoicism, and ubiquitous home gardens make budgets more flexible. Mr. Putin's popularity ratings have remained high since last year's annexation of Crimea, which was wildly popular among Russians.
Still, the math is proving tricky. In a new draft budget released in July, the Ministry of Finance proposed halting the practice of raising pensions to keep up with inflation, a politically controversial move that would deliver a blow to Mr. Putin's most loyal base. Investment, food for a hungry economy, has collapsed since the Western sanctions, which also blocked Russia's ability to borrow on global markets.
"They have no way out," said Sergei Guriev, a professor of economics at Sciences Po in Paris. "Unless oil prices go up, they are really looking at a dead end." Without further spending cuts and if oil prices remain around current levels, the government will use up its reserve fund, created when the price of oil was high, in about a year, he added.
Mr. Putin's opponents argue that the nationalist talk washing over Russia is being projected by his government to distract attention from the fragile economic situation. They describe it as a battle in every Russian home between the television (the source of government propaganda) and the refrigerator (whose shrinking contents could eventually prompt discontent).
In Moscow, some in the educated upper classes agree.
"All that Ukrainian noise covers up our internal problems," said Maria Novychkova, a manager in a textile company who was walking a foot scooter in a park last month. Her company has put employees on four-day workweeks. She cannot afford to vacation abroad because of the weak ruble. "He says we are an ideal country, but we are not," she said, referring to Mr. Putin.
The crisis in Ramenskoye is like a car crash in slow motion, gradual but destructive. The town has tried to modernize in recent years, with an airport for private jets and a PepsiCo juice factory. It is also a bedroom community for Moscow. Commuters are Arina's main customers.
Ms. Safonova, the owner of the pie shop, first noticed a drop in business last fall. There were fewer commuters, and those who remained spent less freely. Once-packed minibuses emptied out. The checkout clerks at the nearby Kopeika supermarket had their wages cut. Then in March, PepsiCo announced that the juice factory in town was closing, citing the bad economy.
Prices began jumping. Nescafé went to 389 rubles, about $5.96, from 220 rubles. Ahmad Tea jumped to 319 rubles from 191. Ms. Safonova knew about the sanctions, and that the falling ruble made imports more expensive, but sometimes the logic eluded her. A spike in the price of mushrooms this spring was particularly puzzling.
"I said, 'Why, why?' These are grown near Moscow, right here, not in Europe!"
By summer, the pie shop's sales had dropped by nearly half, and Ms. Safonova had to lay off four of her eight employees. She now works 18-hour days to compensate. She gave up her big kitchen and now mixes dough five times a day instead of 10.
Across Russia, the crisis has prompted a collapse in consumption. International airline travel has fallen almost a fifth since last year, and car sales are down 36 percent in the first half of this year. The production of train cars fell by a third, said Natalia Zubarevich, a researcher at the Higher School of Economics, because fewer goods needed to be transported. In another measure of economic distress, household ruble debt in arrears is up 43 percent since last July, according to the Central Bank.
"The cost of the crisis is being borne by everyone, spread around like butter on bread," said Vladimir Gimpelson, the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at the Higher School of Economics.
As business shrivels across the country, Moscow remains an economic beacon.
Alexandra Vasilieva, the cashier at Arina's Hangout, is from the province of Smolensk in western Russia, where work had dried up so completely that her husband, a window installer, was making just a small fraction of his previous salary. So they came to Ramenskoye and now he commutes more than two hours each way to Moscow for mediocre money. Her son, an auto service worker in Smolensk, lost almost a third of his salary because fewer cars were being brought in for repairs and servicing.
"In the provinces, the wages are too small to live on," she said. Her monthly salary in Ramenskoye -- 20,000 rubles -- is sinking in value, worth just $305, down from $416 in May.
As for Crimea, if she thinks about it at all, it is through the lens of economics.
"I'm sick of Crimea," Ms. Vasilieva said. "I'm sad for people," she said, referring to Ukrainian refugees, "but why are they getting all this government assistance?"
Further pinching Russians' pocketbooks are trims the government is making to benefits doled out when times were flush. Pensioners in the Moscow region can no longer ride free on the Moscow Metro, a change that affects more than a million people in one of the most densely populated regions in the country. Apartment owners across Russia must now pay a repairs fee every month, which has prompted protests in some regions.
Lyudmila, 68, a retired accountant who declined to give her surname, said it was no longer worth it for her husband, an artist who works as a designer on housing projects, to commute into the city to supplement his pension -- $153 a month.
"If all you have is a pension, you can't afford to buy shoes," she said, sitting on a park bench next to her grandson, who was eating a tall white puff of cotton candy.
Still, the discontent seems to bypass Mr. Putin.
"Honestly, we are so proud he is our president," said Vyacheslav, 75, a retired factory manager, who also refused to give his surname, as he steered a mostly empty grocery cart through a Kopeika supermarket here last week. "Thanks to him, we have all of this," he said, gesturing toward a glass display case of beet and potato salads, fried eggplant and pieces of chicken.
Then he called his wife to tell her that they were out of the cheapest hot dogs.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Burdened by weaker consumer spending and exports, Japan's economy contracted in the second quarter, government data showed on Monday, the first such setback since a short but painful recession last year.
The Cabinet Office said gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent in the three months through June.
Japanese growth rates have fluctuated wildly in recent quarters, and the latest downturn only partially erased gains from a strong expansion in the first quarter, which the government now estimates at 4.5 percent. Last year was even more volatile: Consumer spending surged before a sales tax increase in April 2014, lifting the economy to its fastest pace in years, then evaporated afterward, setting off a recession.
The size of the contraction in the quarter through June was roughly in line with the expectations of private-sector economists. In surveys by news agencies, analysts had forecast an annualized contraction of 1.8 percent to 1.9 percent, on average.
But economists say the tide may be turning back to growth in the current quarter. In a recent survey by the Japan Center for Economic Research, an affiliate of Nikkei, Japan's largest financial newspaper, 40 analysts predicted that growth would rebound by an average 2.5 percent in the period from July to September.
"Temporary factors were a big part of it, though I'm not saying the only part," Akira Amari, the economy minister, told reporters, referring to the second-quarter downturn. Rainy, cool weather in June hurt sales of air conditioners -- a major seasonal item in humid Japan -- while an increase in taxes on ultra-small cars weighed on the auto industry, he added.
The slowdown is nonetheless a setback for the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which has been trying to pull the economy out of nearly two decades of deflation through a stimulus program known as Abenomics.
The program, under which the central bank injects vast amounts of cash into the economy, has kept borrowing costs low and weakened the yen. It has been a boon for global manufacturing companies like Toyota that earn much of their revenues abroad in currencies like dollars and euros.
But while Abenomics has increased profits at big corporations and lifted the stock market, many ordinary Japanese say they feel few benefits. Jobs are plentiful -- the unemployment rate is just 3.4 percent, close to an 18-year low -- but the paychecks that go with them buy less than they used to. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, average wages have been stuck in a persistent decline.
Household spending fell at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent in the second quarter, the economic report on Monday showed. A government sentiment survey released last week showed consumer confidence had slipped to its lowest level since January.
Pay has been increasing comfortably for some workers. Toyota, for instance, this year increased base wages for its Japanese work force by the largest margin in 13 years. But economists caution that gains have accrued disproportionately to those with permanent jobs at major companies -- an elite but shrinking minority.
Many of the jobs that have been created since Mr. Abe became prime minister at the end of 2012 have been part-time or temporary, with lower pay and fewer benefits.
Exports, which have been hurt by a weaker Chinese economy, tumbled at an annualized rate of 16.5 percent last quarter, according to the economic report. That was only partially offset by a 9.8 percent decline in the value of imports.
China's rapid development in recent years has had spillover benefits for Japan, where experienced manufacturers of industrial machinery have supplied much of the equipment used in China's proliferating factories. China supplanted the United States as Japan's largest trading partner several years ago.
Thus the slowing pace of growth in China -- and, in particular, a decline in demand for capital goods -- has hurt important parts of Japan's export economy.
The quarterly contraction in Japan could revive speculation on whether the central bank will step up its stimulus efforts. The Bank of Japan has been pouring money into the economy by buying government bonds from the market at a rate of 80 trillion yen a year, or close to $700 billion. Yet the sustained increase in consumer prices that it hopes to generate as a result has been elusive.

Full text:   SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- Political parties whose symbol is a red star tend to be unfavorable for bankers, but Brazil's ruling party has been a lucrative exception.
When the Workers' Party of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and current President Dilma Rousseff took power in 2003, it promised, and for many years delivered, a rising standard of living for the country's poor and working classes.
Yet the gains have been much more impressive for the nation's banking industry, even as the manufacturing sector has stagnated and the broader economy has ridden the ups and downs of global commodity prices. The combined annual profits of Brazil's four biggest banks have grown more than 850 percent to just over $20 billion, from $2.1 billion, in the 12 years of Workers' Party rule.
Even as a corruption scandal centered in the government-owned petroleum giant Petrobras has paralyzed important sectors of the economy, bank profits have kept growing.
Bank earnings made up more than half of the total profits for companies on the São Paulo stock exchange in both 2013 and 2014, according to the consulting firm Economatica. While the stock market is a poor reflection of Brazil's economy -- agribusiness and carmakers are barely represented -- bank profits were never above a quarter of the total all through the previous decade.
Brazil's largest and third-largest banks, Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econômica Federal, do not even have profit as their sole mandate. The government, which controls both, often obliges them to engage in less profitable operations as a public service.
The two giant private sector banks, Itaú and Bradesco, consistently earn returns on equity -- a measure of the earnings a company can squeeze out of each dollar invested -- of around 20 percent. Big banks in the United States usually manage only about half as much.
Government policies and economic trends have helped the banks here.
One is interest rates at levels so high that they would leave borrowers in most other countries speechless.
In the so-called non-earmarked or free credit market, which excludes government-subsidized loans for housing and infrastructure, Brazilian consumers pay on average 58.6 percent interest, and businesses pay 27.5 percent to borrow money.
Brazilian academics argue over the reasons for such high rates, but a history of high inflation, sharp currency fluctuations and large government budget deficits mean that the government itself must pay a steep price to borrow money.
The central bank's basic rate, which it pays on the local equivalent of Treasury bills, is 14.25 percent.
Since banks can make good money by just buying government bonds, to take the effort and risk of actually making loans, they need an even greater profit.
They can often find it. The average spread -- the difference between what banks pay to gain access to capital and what they charge to lend it out -- is 30.7 percent in the free credit market.
Not all of that is profit. Taxes and regulatory costs are high, and the government just announced a plan to further increase taxes on bank profits. And default is a serious risk. Nearly 56 million Brazilians, more than a quarter of the country's population, have missed enough debt payments to be on the blacklist of Serasa Experian, a credit reporting bureau.
But the spreads are easily wide enough to compensate, especially when the economy is growing.
And when times are bad, the banks can look to the government.
Brazil's Treasury not only sells bonds that protect investors against inflation, as certain United States Treasury bonds do; it also offers bonds that increase their payouts when interest rates rise or the currency devalues.
When banks sense that the economy is about to deteriorate, they scale back their loans and migrate into these government-backed investments.
As a result, many of Brazil's recent economic troubles, like inflation of nearly 9 percent, a plunging currency and rising interest rates, have actually bolstered banks' bottom lines.
"Banks here are experts at navigating economic instability," said Luiz Fernando de Paula, an economics professor at Rio de Janeiro State University. "Because of government bonds that offer protection, currency crises and interest rate shocks do not become banking crises. The government pays the price instead."
In a sign of just how intertwined the government and banks are, Brazil's banking industry owns nearly 27 percent of the national debt.
A lack of competition may also be helping profits.
Ever since a banking crisis in the 1990s threatened scores of financial institutions with insolvency, the authorities have encouraged a string of mergers and acquisitions.
"No government official ever made a statement on the subject, but we have seen a regulatory bias that favors fewer but more solid banks," said Roberto Luis Troster, a former chief economist for the Brazilian Federation of Banks.
By one measure, this policy has been a success. The way that many United States and European banks were rocked in the 2008 financial crisis is nearly unimaginable in Brazil.
"With such high spreads on loans, traditional banking operations are so profitable that the banks here don't need to assume much risk," said Luis Miguel Santacreu, financial sector analyst at the Brazilian credit ratings agency Austin Rating. "It is very unlikely that any big bank would need a capital injection to survive."
But borrowers also have few options to shop for better prices.
When President da Silva took office in 2003, the four biggest banks had 53 percent of the banking system's total assets, according to Brazil's central bank. They now have over 70 percent, and many of the smaller banks operate only in limited segments of the market.
"There is some evidence that the banks have oligopoly pricing power," Professor de Paula said.
Not only has the market share of the biggest banks risen, but the credit market itself boomed after first President da Silva, then President Rousseff changed regulations to make it easier for consumers and small businesses to borrow.
Both groups responded enthusiastically. Many low- and middle-income consumers borrowed heavily to buy their first household appliances or cars.
Private sector debt has risen to nearly 70 percent of the economy from 30 percent when President da Silva took office.
That is still low by global standards. In the United States, the ratio is closer to 200 percent, and even the Germans have more private sector debt relative to their economy's size than Brazilians do.
But high interest rates make even modest debt a heavy burden. The average Brazilian household spends 22 percent of its monthly income on debt payments, according to the central bank. The National Confederation of Commerce puts the number even higher, at 31 percent.
The average American household spends under 10 percent of its income on debt payments.
With borrowers overstretched, the banks' days of rapid growth may be coming to a close. Growth through acquisitions is also nearing its limit.
With Bradesco reaching a deal last week to acquire HSBC's operations in Brazil for $5.2 billion, the top four banks' control of the system's total assets will be near the 75 percent maximum that the central bank established in 2012. As a result, the authorities may block further acquisitions.
And if Brazil's recession drags on much longer, default rates will rise. But even if earnings no longer grow as quickly as in the past, they will probably remain strong, even while the broader economy does poorly.
"The banks are reducing their volume of loans, but interest rates are higher than before, spreads are also rising, and they're making money on government bonds," Mr. Santacreu said.
"There's no way that they won't make a good profit."

Full text:   DONALD TRUMP'S economic views may not have garnered as much attention as his misogynistic statements, but they are equally unpalatable, evincing a lack of understanding of basic economics that is startling for a billionaire businessman.
While Mr. Trump has not provided specifics much beyond the "Make America Great Again" slogan featured on his often-present baseball cap, strands of Trumponomics have trickled out amid the stream of braggadocio and ad hominem attacks on his critics.
And what bizarre views they are -- a curious mélange of populism and hard-right conservatism, inherently contradictory perspectives that often lie far outside the boundaries of accepted economic thought.
Take, for example, what seems to be his "No. 1" issue: trade. Mr. Trump believes the Chinese (and others) have been playing us for fools; using cheap labor, currency manipulation and trade barriers to favor their exports and limit our imports.
In Mr. Trump's mind (although not in the minds of serious economists), that's why we've lost five million manufacturing jobs since 2000.
The Chinese are certainly protectionists, but a shift in manufacturing jobs was inevitable. For centuries, as countries have developed, the locus of jobs has shifted based on comparative advantage.
Moreover, many of those manufacturing jobs weren't lost to other countries but to growing efficiency, just as employment in agriculture in the United States has fallen even as output has risen.
No policies could reverse tectonic forces of this magnitude, and in suggesting that there are remedies, Mr. Trump is cynically misleading the American public.
Still worse are his notions for how to bring jobs home, particularly his call for huge tariffs. At various times, he has proposed levies of 25 percent on imports from China and 35 percent on Ford vehicles assembled in Mexico. That would significantly raise prices for Americans and unleash retaliatory moves.
Another tenet of his trade policy would be a weaker dollar, which would discourage imports by making them more expensive and increase the competitiveness of American exports.
But a weaker dollar depends on low American interest rates, and Mr. Trump has separately decried the expansionary monetary policy of the Federal Reserve.
In that criticism, Mr. Trump has been aligned with a flotilla of staunch conservatives who have argued for years that maintaining interest rates near zero is certain to unleash asset bubbles and rampant inflation.
To date, that view has proved utterly wrong. Low interest rates have helped our economic recovery. And not only is inflation nowhere to be seen, but the prices of key barometers, like commodities and energy, are falling.
The list of Mr. Trump's wrongheaded ideas goes on and on: We shouldn't increase the minimum wage, which is well below historic levels, after adjustment for inflation. Corporate taxes should be eliminated. Global warming is a fantasy.
By some estimates, Mr. Trump's proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border would cost billions and his plan to deport 11.5 million undocumented immigrants could cost at least $400 billion over 20 years, while losing the services of millions of workers would significantly dent economic growth.
When challenged on his more outlandish ideas, Mr. Trump retreats into chest thumping, with comments like "you have to let me handle that, O.K.?"
At times, Mr. Trump goes on the attack without actually disagreeing. The Affordable Care Act should be abolished, but his suggested replacement bears considerable resemblance to President Obama's plan. He has pushed for even greater involvement by government in health care, praising the single-payer models of Canada and Scotland.
I guess a foolish inconsistency can also be the hobgoblin of a big mind.
When it comes to budgets, Mr. Trump's numbers (were he ever to release any) couldn't possibly add up.
He wants to build infrastructure, bolster defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, cut taxes and protect Social Security and Medicare from any trims, all while proclaiming that he's a fiscal conservative.
In 1999, to address the problem of too much federal debt, Mr. Trump proposed a one-time, 14.25 percent wealth tax on the very rich. Fortunately, the idea never gained traction; a $5.7 trillion tax increase would have plunged the economy into recession, if not depression.
In the Republican debate, Mr. Trump, who has watched four of his companies slide into bankruptcy, said of the nation's debt mountain: "They need somebody like me to straighten out that mess."
Confronted recently by one journalist about his policy prescriptions, Mr. Trump replied: "You'll be happy, believe me. You'll be happy." I'll be happy when he is off the stage.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- American workers' productivity rebounded in the second quarter, but a weak underlying trend suggested that inflation could pick up more quickly than economists have anticipated.
Nonfarm productivity increased at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the April-to-June period, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. But productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose only 0.3 percent from a year ago.
In line with annual revisions to gross domestic product, first-quarter productivity was revised to show a 1.1 percent rate of decline instead of the previously reported 3.1 percent pace of decline.
"What it means is that inflation could be more problematic down the road, but we haven't seen it yet. It's something to think about long term," said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that wholesale inventories increased 0.9 percent in June, higher than the 0.7 percent rise the government had forecast.
Productivity is one of the things the Federal Reserve is watching as it contemplates raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Economists had forecast productivity rising at a 1.6 percent rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 2.3 percent annual pace in the period.
Annual revisions showed that productivity was unchanged in 2013, the weakest annual reading since 1982. Productivity in 2013 was previously reported to have increased at a 1.2 percent rate.
The average annual rate of productivity growth from 2007 to 2014 was revised down to 1.3 percent a year, from 1.4 percent, well below the long-term rate of 2.2 percent a year from 1947 to 2014.
Growth in productivity is an important determinant of the economy's noninflationary speed limit. The downward revisions suggested that the economy's growth potential could be lower than the 1.5 percent to 2 percent pace that economists have been estimating.
That would imply that the spare capacity in the economy is being squeezed out more quickly than thought and that inflation pressures may take hold a bit faster than had been anticipated.
"We are growing much faster versus potential than we had previously thought," said Jacob Oubina, senior United States economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. "So the output gap over the more recent time frame looks like it is closing at a faster rate than we had thought prior to G.D.P. benchmark revisions. The faster you close the output gap, the faster you get to that threshold where you start to see inflationary pressures."
But inflation remains benign for now. Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at only a 0.5 percent rate in the second quarter after advancing at a downwardly revised 2.3 percent pace in the first quarter.
They were previously reported to have increased at a 6.7 percent rate in the January-to-March period. Unit labor costs rose 2.1 percent compared with the second quarter of 2014.
Compensation per hour increased at a 1.8 percent rate in the second quarter after rising at a downwardly revised 1.1 percent pace in the first quarter.
Compensation was previously reported to have increased at a 3.3 percent rate in the first quarter. It was up 2.4 percent compared to the second quarter of 2014.

Abstract: Joseph Corbett, the Postal Service's chief financial officer, said increased package revenue and productivity gains were not enough to offset inflation and a decline in mail volume, even though operating revenue, at $16.5 billion, was roughly the same as last spring and shipping and package revenue increased by 10.6 percent.

Full text:   The United States Postal Service on Monday reported a net loss of $586 million in the quarter that ended in June, a big improvement over its nearly $2 billion loss during the same period last year. Joseph Corbett, the Postal Service's chief financial officer, said increased package revenue and productivity gains were not enough to offset inflation and a decline in mail volume, even though operating revenue, at $16.5 billion, was roughly the same as last spring and shipping and package revenue increased by 10.6 percent. Fredric Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said the results represented an impressive "turnaround continuing in full force." He added that "2015 is turning into one of the U.S.P.S.'s most impressive annual performances since the Great Recession."

Full text:   BUENOS AIRES -- The future of Argentine politics was fuzzy on Monday after an all-party presidential primary, billed as a measure of the nation's desire for change, proved close enough to cast doubt on who would prevail in general elections.
Daniel Scioli, the nominee of the governing party, took more than 38 percent of the vote, besting the alliance of his main rival, Mauricio Macri. But the eight-point margin of victory was not sufficient to gauge confidently how voters will approach the general election on Oct. 25.
"All possibilities are open," said Mariel Fornoni, a political analyst who runs Management and Fit, a local polling company. "Everybody is celebrating, but at the same time they're all worried."
Mr. Scioli, 58, ran unchallenged for the nomination of the governing party after being endorsed by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who cannot run for a third consecutive term. Mr. Macri, 56, the mayor of Buenos Aires, easily overcame challengers within his Cambiemos, or "Let's Change," alliance.
Argentina switched to an open primary system in 2011. Unlike the United States, primary elections in Argentina are mandatory for all voters, not just those from a specific party. The candidate from each party or alliance that gets the most votes will run in October's general election.
To win outright in October without a runoff, a candidate will need more than 45 percent of the vote, or 40 percent with a lead of more than 10 points. But with 98 percent of the votes counted on Monday, the primary results were seen as inconclusive, complicated by uncertainty over how many votes might drift away from a third political bloc, led by Sergio Massa, which got 21 percent of Sunday's tally.
"We have to wait awhile to see how things reconfigure," Ms. Fornoni said.
Mr. Scioli, a former powerboat racer who is governor of Buenos Aires Province, could win without a runoff if he attracts voters beyond the base of his party, the governing Front for Victory. To do that, he would have to modulate the tenor of his campaign, which is directed at hard-line supporters of Mrs. Kirchner, analysts said.
Mr. Scioli is "in a very good position and remains favored to win," Daniel Kerner, a Latin America analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy firm, wrote in a note to clients, adding that he "still has room to grow."
A sticking point for Mr. Scioli may be Buenos Aires Province, home to more than a third of voters. His party's nominee for governor there, Aníbal Fernández, is Mrs. Kirchner's cabinet chief and has been tainted by accusations of links to drug trafficking. Though Mr. Fernández denies malfeasance, the issue and his closeness to Mrs. Kirchner are barriers to attracting swing voters, said Carlos Germano, an Argentine political analyst.
That increases the probability of a runoff in which Mr. Macri, whose candidate for governor performed well Sunday in a parallel primary, could unite the opposition and overcome Mr. Scioli.
Both Mr. Scioli and Mr. Macri placed a triumphant spin on the primary results.
"Today we have to celebrate, because an alternative has been consolidated," Mr. Macri told his supporters late Sunday night.
Mr. Scioli, meanwhile, pointed in an impassioned speech to the eight-point lead. "They can look at it however they want to look at it, but the only truth is the reality," he said.
Many people here support the Front for Victory because they believe Argentina is far better off today than when the party came to power in 2003, in the wake of a severe crisis that had plunged millions into poverty.
"The truth is that the country is fine; look at where we were 15 years ago," said Alexia Charchabukian, 33, a jewelry seller who said she voted for Mr. Scioli at a school in Chacarita, a gritty neighborhood here. She cited Argentina's rising middle class and Mrs. Kirchner's focus on closing the inequality gap.
"They try to brainwash us, telling us that everything is bad, but we're O.K.," Ms. Charchabukian added, referring to influential news media organizations that have clashed with Mrs. Kirchner, who has compared their newsprint to "ink bullets."
Mr. Macri, a former businessman and soccer club president, has gained support among voters who have voiced discontent with what they see as Mrs. Kirchner's imperious style and other concerns, including accusations of corruption, high inflation and perceptions that violent crime is on the rise.
"The country is not doing well," said Patricia Caneva, 56, a private English tutor who said she voted for Alejandro Bodart, a socialist. She said Mrs. Kirchner's "first term was good, but the second has been a struggle," with a rising inflation rate and slowed economic growth. But hinting at Mr. Macri's struggle to shake off a corporate image, she said: "He will only govern for the upper-middle class. I don't like him."
Mr. Macri has said that if he is elected he will maintain some of Mrs. Kirchner's cornerstone policies, including the nationalization of an oil company and an airline. His aides said he would also strengthen public institutions, including Argentina's politicized judiciary and the national statistics institute, whose data has in the past been criticized by the International Monetary Fund.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: [...]people aren't rejoicing, AAA surveys suggest. Since 2013, as gas prices have dropped, the common view of a "fair price" has shifted downward, too, said Michael Green, an AAA spokesman. A significant factor behind the current imbalances is a slowdown in the rate of growth of the Chinese economy -- and perceptions of even greater problems in China, set off by the sharp drop in that country's stock market since late June and by the Chinese government's intervention in that market, said Michael Pearce, a global economist with Capital Economics in London.

Full text:   Commodities markets have taken a beating this summer. Oil, coal, coffee, soybeans, copper, iron and nearly every other commodity has fallen sharply in price, upending currency markets and inflicting pain in large parts of the world economy.
But few Americans are complaining. Unless you are trading soybeans or have been focused on the battered shares of companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, or on sinking currencies like the Brazilian real or South African rand, you may not have noticed the commodities debacle.
The collapse in oil prices is all too evident in oil shale states like North Dakota and Oklahoma, as well as in nations like Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Norway and Saudi Arabia -- but it has not intruded into the daily experience of many Americans.
For many of us, in fact, the commodities rout hasn't been perceived as a crisis at all: It has seemed to be welcome news. That is understandable, though that view may be shortsighted.
Consider gasoline, probably the most closely monitored commodity in America, one whose price is posted prominently at filling stations all over the country. Compared with the recent past, gas is still very cheap.
Gas prices typically rise when the summer driving season gets underway, and that pattern held true this year. But over the last three weeks, prices have been dropping again. On Friday the average price of a gallon of regular was only $2.62 -- nearly 25 percent below the $3.48 level on the same date last year, the AAA says. But people aren't rejoicing, AAA surveys suggest. Since 2013, as gas prices have dropped, the common view of a "fair price" has shifted downward, too, said Michael Green, an AAA spokesman. Certainly there is no national movement to raise prices to help gas and oil producers.
Nor are consumers demanding an end to low inflation. The "headline" Consumer Price Index, including energy and food, was virtually flat in the 12 months through June; the "core" number, which excludes those items, rose 1.8 percent over 12 months, the Labor Department said.
Declines in the commodities markets have already had a damping effect on inflation in the United States and are likely to restrain it in future data releases, said Azhar Iqbal, an econometrician with Wells Fargo Securities.
How much of an effect has the decline in the commodities market had on inflation? As a rough guideline, note that the widely followed CRB Commodities index has declined more than 18 percent since May 2014. Every 10 percentage point drop in that index shaves 0.4 percentage point from the annual headline C.P.I. number in America, and a lesser amount, less than 0.1 percentage point, from the core inflation index, Mr. Iqbal's economic model shows. "The fall in commodity prices has had a measurable effect in the United States," he said.
The price declines have complicated matters for the Federal Reserve, which has said that after nearly seven years it will begin to raise short-term interest rates from their near-zero level, if data on inflation and unemployment justify the move.
The unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent in July, its lowest level in years, the Labor Department said on Friday. "The low inflation rate, which is connected to commodities, may have induced the Fed to have waited this long to raise interest rates," said Jay Bryson, a global economist with Wells Fargo Securities. Low interest rates are generally thought to be bullish for the stock market, and while the shares of commodities producers have been hammered, the overall American stock market has undoubtedly been helped by that commodities market effect, he said.
But even if Americans outside the oil patch haven't been hurt directly, there are important reasons for them to be concerned about the damage in the commodities markets.
"Historically, commodities have been very sensitive indicators of global economic activity," said Edward Yardeni, an independent economist and strategist. Big declines in the CRB index have typically presaged recessions and bear markets in stocks, he said.
He is not expecting that to happen now partly because the imbalances in commodities markets seem largely to have resulted from miscalculations that led to excess supply. "It's not that demand is that weak," he said, which would be more serious. "The problem is mainly with global supplies."
A significant factor behind the current imbalances is a slowdown in the rate of growth of the Chinese economy -- and perceptions of even greater problems in China, set off by the sharp drop in that country's stock market since late June and by the Chinese government's intervention in that market, said Michael Pearce, a global economist with Capital Economics in London. "I think some of this is overblown," he said. "I'm not expecting a hard landing for the Chinese economy. But these perceptions have had powerful effects."
China is the world's biggest commodity consumer, HSBC figures show. It accounts for 12.8 percent of all global commodity imports. (The comparable figure for the United States, the second-biggest global consumer, is 10.3 percent.) And these days, when China sneezes, the commodity markets run for cover.
Each country and each commodity has its own story, and many countries are enduring significant pain. For example, in South Africa, a major producer of commodities ranging from platinum and gold to iron and coal, the entire mining industry "is in trouble" because of falling commodity prices, the minister of economic development, Ebrahim Patel, said on Wednesday, Reuters reported.
Currency markets have responded to the changes in the terms of trade, weakening the currencies of commodity producers and strengthening the American dollar. (The Chinese renminbi, which the government keeps in a narrow band linked to the dollar, has strengthened against other currencies, too.) That will make imports to the United States cheaper, and it will make exports more expensive, helping rebalance global supply and demand, Mr. Yardeni said. It can be expected to slow American economic growth and speed up growth in commodity-producing countries that are in dire need of stimulus, he said. "We need to keep our fingers crossed and hope that all works out."
He added that there was a good chance that it would work out for the United States. Enjoy the quiet and the low prices, by all means, he said. But be aware that unstable and declining global markets can be quite dangerous.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Russia's capital city has worn many outfits since the fall of the Soviet Union.
There was the tattered but hopeful garb of the first years, threadbare and full of possibility. Then came the leopard print fur of the 1990s, an era of stomach-churning economic collapse when the rich roared around in Mercedes sedans and everyone else suffered through the endless steeplechase of life under uncontrolled capitalism.
More recently, however, the city has donned a beautiful summer dress. There is a bike share program, Wi-Fi on the subway and free tango lessons in Gorky Park. Express trains now zip past traffic snarls to the airports and Uber taxis have replaced wheezing Soviet-era gypsy cabs. Cars park in real parking spaces and tow trucks haul them away if they do not.
But while Moscow looks ever more like an elegant European capital, its political life is marching steadily in the opposite direction. Last month, Russia's powerful state investigation committee proposed removing the principles of international human rights from the Constitution. The regional government in Sverdlovsk recently ordered schools to remove books by a British historian for what it said were inaccurate portrayals of Russian soldiers. Two American charities announced plans to close offices, citing the hostile environment.
For an outsider, the disconnect is dizzying. Which is the real Russia? The one besieged by foreign agents or the one where tattooed hipsters glide around on skateboards? And when -- if ever -- will those two worlds collide?
In many ways, Moscow is resurgent: a more beautiful, confident version of itself. Over the top has given way to casual elegance. On a recent afternoon at Uilliam's on Malaya Bronnaya Street, where duck ravioli with oranges was on the menu, patrons sat on small pillows near open windows, chatting, drinking wine and people-watching. In the park nearby, tired mothers slumped in beanbag chairs while their children screeched and climbed in an inflatable house.
But the rich are not the only beneficiaries. Russians are substantially better off since President Vladimir V. Putin first came to power in 2000. The average salary has roughly tripled, after inflation, and poverty has declined sharply, bringing a feeling of stability and well-being that was lacking in the 1990s. More Russians can now plan life in advance (Where will I go on vacation this year?) instead of snatching it a day at a time (What will I eat for dinner tomorrow?).
"It's so much more comfortable in the city now," said Denis Lebedev, a construction company worker, 33, sitting with his baby daughter on his lap near a pond in Tsarytsino, a meticulously planted park in southern Moscow. Traffic is tamed, mostly, and salaries are better.
"Now there are flowers," his wife, Anya Lebedeva, said of the city parks as she adjusted a plate of pickles on their picnic blanket.
Even the old seems new. Backstage at the Bolshoi Theater on a recent night, dozens of dancers, jubilant and sweaty, mingled with adoring members of Moscow's high society after the premiere of a new Russian ballet. It was a sumptuous display, blending modern and classical ballet with the 19th-century Russian novel "A Hero of Our Time," which had never been adapted for dance before.
"Magnificent, just magnificent," a man in a dark blue suit who stepped onto the stage said to Ilya Demutsky, the young composer from St. Petersburg who wrote the score.
The pomp can also signal something darker, however. On a recent Sunday morning, Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, was blessing the newly restored St. Vladimir Church in central Moscow. Priests swung incense from silver censers that tinkled like bells underneath the soaring ceilings and gilded chandeliers, the glittering pageantry captured by a long line of television cameras. A day later, Mr. Putin came for a private showing. The patriarch's sermon included fiery comments on Ukraine.
"And when we are told today that someone from outside has destroyed the unity of the Ukrainian people," he said, referring to the criticism of Russia's military action in Ukraine, "we answer, 'Be quiet!' " He went on to explain that hundreds of years of discord imposed by the West had divided Ukraine, and only church unity could save it.
Another projector of Russian patriotism is a surgeon-turned-motorcycle enthusiast named Alexander Zaldostanov. His nationalist motorcycle gang, the Night Wolves, last year performed a garish reconstruction of the war in Ukraine that featured Nazis with torches representing Ukrainian nationalists manipulated by a giant set of American hands.
In stuffy room packed with journalists last month, Mr. Zaldostanov, soaking up attention like a seal in the sun, announced plans for a new motorcycle show.
"I'm not a showman," said Mr. Zaldostanov, wearing a leather biker vest and a large medallion with the head of a wolf set in sparkly stones arranged to look like flames. "For me it's a war. This is a fight for the motherland." He accused the United States of "bombing the consciousness" of the world.
Among intellectuals, the mood is dark. In recent weeks, newspaper articles have attacked the journalism department at Moscow State University for teaching liberal ideas. Several professors at St. Petersburg State University have been fired for what their colleagues say are their liberal views.
Many are leaving. The number of Russians emigrating to Israel was up by about two-thirds in the first five months of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. Temporary teaching positions become permanent and graduate programs turn into extended stays.
"It's a very narrow circle but for those it touches, it is very painful," said Lyubov Borusyak, a sociologist at the Higher School of Economics, whose son, studying at Harvard, is an example of someone with no immediate plans to return. "It's like an icicle that is melting."
There are optimists. Vladimir Milov, an opposition politician, said Russians care far more about the economy than foreign politics, and that the aggressive and nationalistic language only goes skin deep.
"There's 5 to 10 percent of people who are really charged up with this imperialist rhetoric," he said. "But over 90 percent just don't care. Of course they watch TV, of course they get the messages, but this is all on the surface, like foam that can be washed away quickly."
On a recent Friday on Maroseyka Street, city workers were painting bike stands, set into the spacious new stone sidewalk. Ivan Ilin was walking back to work after having a bowl of onion soup at the Jean-Jacques cafe. Mr. Ilin, 33, from southern Russia, has a business in the new field of human resources.
"I love this discrimination against drivers," he declared brightly, gesturing at the narrowed road.
He usually travels to Europe twice a year, to Italy, Latvia and Lithuania, and to Lisbon to practice his Portuguese. He does not like the imagery of a Russia under siege, or the fact that the news media are not independent, but he feels there is little he can do to change it.
"I distance myself from it," he said.
Still, he has no plans to leave.
"Go to the U.S. and work in McDonald's?" he said. "No, I'm not going to do that. I want to stay where I'm needed."
Just off Old Arbat Street last week, a human rights activist who often serves as the country's conscience, Lyudmila Alexeyeva, 88, was sunk deeply into a dark blue couch. Her Moscow Helsinki Group has shrunk to seven employees, down from 17 in 2013. It stopped taking funding from outside Russia to avoid being labeled a foreign agent. On a recent radio call-in show, the first question put to her was from a man asking her view on "the predatory snarl of American imperialism."
She explained that America was far away and she was more interested in Russia, but he was implacable. There was a vote at the end. About 80 percent of the callers sided against her.
"What has surprised me and saddened me most was that after these 20 years of being connected to the world, of media, of freedoms, we still have not learned to think for ourselves," she said.
"I hope it will pass," she added, and pointed out that 20 percent had taken her side. "It can't go on like this forever."

Full text:   The American economy delivered pretty much what was expected last month in terms of hiring, giving the Federal Reserve one more piece of evidence that conditions are strong enough to support an increase in the interest rate.
The pace of employment growth was steady, if not spectacular; the economy added 215,000 jobs in July. While not as robust as the gains recorded in May and June, Friday's Labor Department report came in within 10,000 jobs of what forecasters had predicted, a notable feat of consistency in an economy that employs nearly 150 million people.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.3 percent. If the current pace of job growth can be maintained, economists expect the jobless rate to sink below the crucial 5 percent level by late 2015 or early 2016.
With the job market generally moving in the right direction, the Fed is likely to stay the course in its plans to raise short-term interest rates soon. Fed officials haven't given a definitive signal, but they've indicated that a rate increase is possible at the next Fed meeting in September or at their last meeting of the year in December.
While pockets of weakness remain -- namely historically low levels of participation in the work force and very sluggish wage gains for most workers -- private economists said on Friday that a September move by the central bank is a real possibility now, especially if job creation in August turns out to be as good as or better than it was in July.
"Solid enough to keep the September hike alive," said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients shortly after the release of the data.
Although the initial increase will be small, short-term interest rates have been near zero since late 2008. The Fed dropped rates to historically low levels during the depths of the financial crisis in a bid to stimulate growth and stave off panic.
The Fed controls short-term interest rates, rather than the longer-term benchmarks like 10-year bond yields that help determine rates on mortgages, so ordinary Americans won't feel much of an impact at first.
In fact, consumers could actually benefit from an increase in what's known as the federal funds target rate as it filters through the financial markets and causes yields on checking accounts and money market deposits to rise, according to Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
But the slow reversal of years of easy credit by the central bank has markets on edge, with traders and investors having grown used to very cheap borrowing costs. "It comes down to a shift in policy, and this will be a watershed event," Mr. Anderson said. "Investors are looking beyond the first rate hike to where rates will be two, three or four years down the road."
Despite the overall healthy tone of Friday's report, areas of weakness remain.
Wage growth has been sluggish. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in July, also about what was expected and better than comparable figures in June, when wages were flat.
Over the last 12 months, wages have risen at an annual rate of 2.1 percent, not much more than the already-low underlying rate of inflation. The situation helps explain why many workers remain frustrated with what has been a fitful recovery.
The proportion of Americans in the work force also did not bounce back in July after declining in recent months. At 62.6 percent, it remains at levels not seen since the late 1970s.
The Labor Department's broadest measure of unemployment, which includes people working in part-time positions because they can't find full-time jobs, declined 0.1 percentage point to 10.4 percent.
The mining and logging sector lost 4,000 jobs, a sign of the pain in the oil patch as energy companies cut drilling and other exploration efforts. The public sector added 5,000 jobs, while private employers increased payrolls by 210,000.
The strongest areas for hiring included health care, retailing and professional and business services. Manufacturers added 15,000 jobs in July, the biggest monthly increase for the sector since late 2014.
After years of slow gains, healthy consumer demand is finally persuading management at some factories to take the plunge and build up their work forces.
In Morganton, N.C., Ekornes, a furniture maker, plans to hire 10 more workers by the end of 2015, bringing employment at its factory to about 50, said Peter Bjerregaard, president of North American operations for Ekornes.
Like many manufacturing jobs, the new positions at the Ekornes factory pay a bit more than comparable jobs at nearby stores or restaurants. Workers earn $15 to $25 an hour and receive a generous benefits package.
Based in Norway, Ekornes opened the North Carolina plant in 2013 to make high-end Stressless brand recliners and sofas, and sales have been surging because of the strong housing sector. "Furniture gets hit first, and we are the last ones to get out," Mr. Bjerregaard said.
Although more positive in recent days, economic data over the last few months has been uneven, with better numbers for trade and factory orders, but a lackluster overall growth rate recorded in the spring.
These crosscurrents made the report on the labor market eagerly anticipated by traders and investors on Wall Street.
Over all, the tone was slightly better than expected.
The Labor Department also revised upward the number of jobs added in May and June by a total of 14,000, bringing the average monthly gain over the last three months to 235,000.
The average workweek also grew slightly, another sign of economic momentum after a slow start to the year.
"This is very supportive of a September rate hike by the Fed," said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "At this stage, the Federal Reserve is looking for confirmation. They don't need to see additional strength, and this report pushes them one step closer."
The snapshot provided monthly by the Labor Department is of course prone to revision, and even the economists who track it closely each month warn that a difference of 50,000 or so jobs has only limited statistical significance in an economy where gross domestic product stands at roughly $17 trillion.
Summer reports can be especially prone to seasonal variations caused by students entering the work force as well as temporary shutdowns of auto plants as carmakers retool, said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services.
But Mr. Faucher said he was pleased with the data for July.
"It's solid across the board with no red flags," he said. "We had a nice gain in manufacturing, which is always good news, and financial services were also strong, and these tend to be well-paying jobs. The data is just consistent with broad-based economic growth."

Full text:   Founded 150 years ago, the Faribault Woolen Mill in Minnesota survived the Great War and the Great Depression, not to mention World War II. But it almost did not make it through the Great Recession.
The mill went dark for 18 months in 2009 and 2010, and liquidators tagged its looms for shipment overseas. All its workers were laid off.
Faribault has staged a remarkable comeback, though, as consumer demand has increased for its blankets and throws. The company has won new customers like Bloomingdale's and Restoration Hardware, said Bruce Bildsten, Faribault's chief marketing officer.
While virtually all the laid-off workers have been brought back and 30 new positions have been filled this year, employees still sometimes find it difficult to shake off the trauma. "It doesn't keep us awake at night, but we all think about it," said Mr. Bildsten, who joined the company during its recovery. "We're growing slowly and steadily. But we're prepared for the inevitable downturn."
The company's trajectory parallels the course of the overall American recovery in the last six years. Growth has resumed and hiring has picked up, but a lingering unease remains, with workers in particular wondering how long the good times will last, and whether this is as good as it gets.
By some measures, the economy is doing just fine.
Unemployment stands at 5.3 percent, the lowest since the dark days of 2008. Economists are expecting another healthy report on Friday, when the Labor Department announces the latest data on hiring in July.
Last week, the government estimated that the economy grew by 2.3 percent in the second quarter. In late August that figure is likely to be revised higher in light of new data showing healthy factory orders and construction spending in June.
The numbers tell only part of the story, however. Wages for most workers have barely kept up with inflation, even though inflation has been very low since the recession, and even many experienced employees outside specialized fields have little bargaining power when it comes to securing raises.
"Total employment and consumption is rising but that's different from everybody's average income rising," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.
"More people are finding jobs, but nobody feels optimistic about their income prospects," he added. "That's likely why it doesn't feel like the economy has really recovered even though the statistics say it has."
Another big cloud has been the economy's consistent inability to grow by more than 2.5 percent annually. That is a far cry from the 4.5 percent growth rate of the late 1990s, or the 3.5 percent annual gains recorded a decade ago.
Even otherwise optimistic economists do not expect the American economy to see a sudden pickup in momentum.
"I'd be surprised if we can do much better than 2.5 or 3 percent," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research firm in Lexington, Mass. "Some of it is due to longer-term trends like slower population growth and lower productivity growth. And some of it is a hangover from the deep recession and financial crisis."
More recently, the obstacle to better economic performance has been the dismal track record of many overseas economies. Europe has been weak, a situation complicated by the slow-motion crisis in Greece.
Onetime bright spots like Brazil, Russia and China have also experienced slowing growth.
The absence of overseas stimulus means the United States is largely on its own in terms of finding ways to increase overall economic output, Mr. Gapen said.
Domestic consumer consumption has been growing at about a 3 percent annual rate. But that has been dragged down by sharp cuts in spending by energy companies as oil prices have fallen, along with lackluster exports.
"You'd need domestic consumption to be at 3.5 percent or 4 percent to get us over 3 percent, given the international backdrop," Mr. Gapen said.
Patterns of economic growth and retrenchment are notoriously hard to predict. Few economists foresaw the tech-led boom of the late 1990s or that the unemployment rate would fall below 4 percent by 2000. Similarly, even the most astute seers on Wall Street and at the Federal Reserve failed to anticipate just how great the damage from the bursting of the housing bubble a few year later would be, or the depth of the recession that followed.
Some academic experts have suggested that for all the promise of the Internet and digital technology today, the current economic shift will not yield the kind of growth or job gains brought about by earlier industrial transformations.
What is more, most mainstream economists concede that the bulk of the gains from the current expansion are going to wealthier Americans, especially those with large holdings of assets like stocks and real estate, rather than those simply earning salaries.
"Fairly large chunks of the population have a job, but it's not a great job, or their income has barely grown," Mr. Behravesh said. A recent analysis by IHS shows that consumer confidence since 2010 has been closely correlated with income. Households earning more than $100,000 feel very optimistic, while those earning $24,000 to $34,000 remain much more cautious.
In Faribault, Minn., about 50 miles south of the Twin Cities, employees did not expect the roller coaster ride that awaited them when the family that had controlled the Faribault Woolen Mill for five generations sold it to an investment group in 1998.
An expansion binge followed, with the new owners buying mills in other parts of the country, only to see demand plunge and credit dry up in the recession. The Faribault mill closed and century-old looms and other equipment were being boxed up to be sent to Pakistan, a growing destination for textile manufacturers, Mr. Bildsten recalled.
Then two Minnesota businessmen, the cousins Paul and Chuck Mooty, bought the factory and the trademark, pumping in millions to bring the company back to life. While the investment has paid off for them, employees are eager to avoid the boom and bust cycle.
"You have to be aware that there are ups and downs," said Dennis Melchert, 60, who has worked at the mill for more than 40 years and is now vice president for product development and research. "The worst part of what we went through was when the company was unable to pay its bills. Everything in textiles is based on trust."
"The overall economy is picking up," Mr. Melchert added. "But we're more grounded in our decision making, and we're not growing whole-hog. The biggest challenge is that you should grow slowly and not go kaboom."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer spending in the United States advanced in June at its slowest pace in four months as demand for automobiles softened, suggesting the economy lost some momentum at the end of the second quarter.
But the moderation in consumer spending could be temporary as some automakers on Monday reported stronger-than-expected sales last month in the United States, which kept the industry on a pace for its best year in a decade.
Other data showed manufacturing continued to struggle last month, with activity weakening slightly.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity, rose 0.2 percent, after increasing 0.7 percent in May, the Commerce Department said.
June's increase was in line with economists' expectations, and the data was included in last week's second-quarter gross domestic product report. That data showed consumer spending expanding at a 2.9 percent annual rate and the overall economy growing at a 2.3 percent pace.
While the consumer spending data suggest less vigor in the economy heading into the third quarter, any slowdown is likely to be mitigated by a strengthening housing sector and tightening labor market, which are lifting household wealth.
Separately, the Institute for Supply Management said Monday that its index of national factory activity fell to 52.7 last month, from 53.5 in June.
In June, spending on long-lasting manufactured goods fell 1.3 percent, with vehicle purchases accounting for most of the decrease, which reversed May's increase. Outlays on services like utilities rose 0.4 percent.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged after increasing 0.4 percent in May.
Inflation pressures remained benign. A price index for consumer spending rose 0.2 percent after gaining 0.3 percent in May. In the 12 months through June, the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.3 percent.
Excluding food and energy, prices edged up 0.1 percent for the third straight month. The so-called core PCE price index has increased by the same margin every month since January.

A Health Care Safety Net the Public Loves

Abstract: Recent public surveys show that Americans strongly support Medicare and Medicaid, the twin pillars of the health care safety net, and that approval of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's health care reform law, is steadily rising.

Full text:   Recent public surveys show that Americans strongly support Medicare and Medicaid, the twin pillars of the health care safety net, and that approval of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's health care reform law, is steadily rising. The popularity of these three government programs is a stiff warning to critics, mostly Republicans, who seek to radically change or demolish them.
Last month, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that a majority of the public and the vast majority of beneficiaries support Medicare, the federal program for elderly and disabled Americans, and Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor. Majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans all favor keeping Medicare as it is rather than converting it, as many Republican politicians have urged, to a program in which each enrollee would be given a fixed dollar contribution to buy health insurance.
There are legitimate concerns that the financial condition of Medicare could deteriorate as the baby boomers age and as health care costs continue to rise faster than normal inflation. Polls analyzed by Harvard researchers in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013 showed the public strongly in favor of reducing Medicare spending to improve the long-term financial outlook of the program, but strongly opposed if the cuts would be used to reduce the deficit or pay for tax cuts.
As for Medicaid, the Kaiser survey found that more than 60 percent of the public opposes converting it from an entitlement, in which the federal and state governments split the cost for everyone who qualifies, to a block grant, in which the federal government would provide a fixed amount of money. Under that approach, the states would be struggling to keep all costs within that amount, which might well require reducing benefits.
The Affordable Care Act is also gaining support. The latest Gallup poll, published in July, showed that Americans' approval of the law rose to 47 percent, the highest level since 2012. (About 83 percent of Democrats supported the law compared with 14 percent of Republicans.) Other surveys in June and July have also shown a closely split verdict, which is an improvement over earlier polls showing greater public opposition.
The growing approval of the act is likely to get stronger as more people gain coverage and benefit from it. These voters need to throw their political weight behind candidates for Congress and the White House in 2016 who will work to improve the law, not repeal or weaken it.

Full text:   THE ECONOMICS OF INEQUALITY
By Thomas Piketty
Translated by Arthur Goldhammer. 142 pages. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. $22.95.
Back in 2001 two French economists, Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, circulated a seminal research paper (formally published two years later) titled "Income inequality in the United States, 1913-1998." They used data from income tax receipts to do two things that you can't do with standard data on the distribution of income, which come from household surveys. First, they gave us a portrait of the economic stratosphere -- the incomes of the now-famous 1 percent. Second, they gave us historical depth, reaching all the way back to the late Gilded Age.
The picture that emerged was startling to those who still clung to the notion of America as a middle-class society, or who thought of rising inequality as mainly a tale of divergence between blue-collar workers and a fairly broad elite, like college-educated workers. Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez showed that the actual story of rising inequality since 1980 or so was dominated not by the modestly rising salaries of skilled workers but by gigantic gains at the very top -- a doubling of inflation-adjusted income for the top 1 percent, a quadrupling for the top 0.1 percent, and so on. They also showed that these surging top incomes had more or less reversed earlier movements toward equality, that the concentration of income in the hands of a small minority was back to "Great Gatsby" levels.
It was a landmark piece of research that has had a major impact, not just on economics, but on political science too, for the fall and rise of the 1 percent turns out to be closely correlated with the fall and rise of political polarization. And last year, of course, Mr. Piketty made a huge splash with his magnum opus, "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," which both exposed the startling facts about inequality to a wide audience and made a disturbing case that we are well on the way to re-establishing "patrimonial capitalism," a society dominated by oligarchs who inherit their wealth.
"Capital" is a powerful, beautifully written book (wonderfully translated by Arthur Goldhammer). It is also very big and quite dense, and there's reason to believe that many people who bought it didn't get very far in their reading. So it would be really helpful to have a short-form exposition of the essentials of that masterwork.
Unfortunately, that's not what "The Economics of Inequality" offers.
Let me be blunt: I don't know how the decision was made to release this "new" Piketty book in its current form, but it's not at all the book one might have expected. It is, instead, a slightly revised version of a volume first published in 1997, when Mr. Piketty was in his mid-20s.
And by slightly I mean very slightly. Even the data tables have not, for the most part, been updated, in many cases containing no information later than 1995. Perhaps more important, the basic outlines of the argument haven't been updated to reflect later scholarship -- not even Mr. Piketty's own work with Mr. Saez. As the author concedes in a note to readers, "This book does not fully take into account the results of the past 15 years of international research on the historical dynamics of inequality."
So what one gets here is a lucid statement of our understanding of inequality as it stood almost two decades ago, with hardly any allowance for the subsequent research and real-world developments that have changed that understanding.
Take, for example, what this book says about patrimonial capitalism, which Mr. Piketty has placed at the center of debate about our society's future shape. This book declares that progressive taxation "seems to have prevented a return to 19th-century rentier society" -- and moves on to other issues. That was a defensible position two decades ago. But the most important contribution of "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" was precisely its suggestion that since then a rising share of after-tax profits in national income has indeed set us on the path back to a rentier society, in which the rich live off inherited wealth.
Or take the discussion of rising wage inequality. In the 1990s, professional analysis of this issue was dominated by the theory of skill-biased technological change, which asserted that information technology was raising the relative demand for more highly educated workers. In this book Mr. Piketty offers a mild critique of this doctrine, but ends up asserting that it "surely explains a significant part of the increase in wage inequality." Readers won't learn that modern researchers have become highly skeptical of the whole theory, partly because it's inconsistent with much of what has happened since 2000, like the stagnation of earnings among the college educated.
Broadly speaking, the trend of inequality research since Mr. Piketty wrote this book has involved de-emphasizing supply and demand while giving more attention to privilege and power. These factors aren't ignored in "The Economics of Inequality," which among other things contains a good discussion of the role of unions in limiting inequality, and how this helps explain the divergence between the United States and Europe. But readers who see only this volume will end up placing far too much faith in a story that emphasizes the invisible hand of the market, and too little on the visible role of powerful institutions.
I'm sorry to be so negative about a book by such an important figure in our economic thinking. But releasing this youthful effort as if it were a new contribution does a disservice to readers, and I'd argue to the author himself.

Abstract: In a healthy economy, a more or less steady drop in the unemployment rate -- as has occurred in the United States -- would translate into rising wages and higher prices.

Full text:   The Federal Reserve talked up the economy last Wednesday, in a statement that emphasized improvements in employment, housing and consumer spending. Unfortunately, the optimism is misplaced.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that from April through June, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent -- a modest pace, especially given the expectation of a bigger rebound from weather-related poor growth in the first quarter.
In 2014, for instance, when bad weather also reduced first-quarter growth, the economy grew at an annual pace well above 4 percent for the next two quarters. In comparison, the economy's recent performance is not a rebound but rather a resumption of the sluggish growth that has long characterized the economy.
Given the depth of the recession that preceded the current recovery, growth in the 2-percent range has not been enough to pull up wages. That point was driven home on Friday, when the Labor Department reported a slowdown in wages and benefits in the second quarter. In a healthy economy, a more or less steady drop in the unemployment rate -- as has occurred in the United States -- would translate into rising wages and higher prices.
If significant or sustained, such increases would be cause for the Fed to raise interest rates. But so far, no such increases have appeared, and, as a result, most working people have not yet recovered all of the lost ground from the recession or raised their living standards.
Fed policy makers know all that. A recent leak of documents from the Fed shows that its staff economists have forecast more of the same modest growth and inflation for years to come. Nonetheless, the Fed seems determined to raise interest rates before the end of this year. Fresh data between now and then may cause it to delay. And any move in interest rates, if it comes, is expected to be tiny.
But an increase, however small, would signal that Fed policy makers are basically satisfied with the economy's performance. Coupled with Congress's long failure to provide adequate fiscal support to the economy, that message would be a setback for Americans who are still not getting ahead.
In recent years, the Fed has generally been good at communicating the reasons for its actions. If it really intends to move ahead soon with interest-rate increases, it needs to explain how an economy in which wages are stagnating is as good as it gets.

Full text:   TO some, millennials -- those urban-dwelling, ride-sharing indefatigable social networkers -- are engaged, upbeat and open to change. To others, they are narcissistic, lazy and self-centered.
I'm in the first camp, but regardless of your opinion, be fretful over their economic well-being and fearful -- oh so fearful -- for their prospects. The most educated generation in history is on track to becoming less prosperous, at least financially, than its predecessors.
They are faced with a slow economy, high unemployment, stagnant wages and student loans that constrict their ability both to maintain a reasonable lifestyle and to save for the future.
Longer term, rising federal debt payments and increased spending on Social Security and Medicare will inflict a tremendous financial burden on them, threatening their own prospect of receiving promised retirement benefits.
To a considerable extent, that's the fault of my generation, the baby boomers. We were the children of the Greatest Generation, but we may also be the most irresponsible generation.
Americans between 18 and 34 are earning less today (after adjustment for inflation) than the same age group did in the past. A typical millennial averaged earnings of $33,883 (in 2013 dollars) between 2009 and 2013. That was down 9.3 percent (after adjustment for inflation) in just a decade and is the lowest since 1980. Older Americans have fared considerably better; earnings of all full-time workers were roughly flat between 2000 and 2011.
Still more striking is that millennials have endured falling earnings even though they have attended college in record numbers.
So what's going on? A major reason is the recession. Those who graduate in weaker economic times typically earn less than those who enter the work force during more robust periods. Starting behind often means never catching up.
Millennials who didn't attend college have found their wages particularly squeezed, perhaps because of the decline of middle-skilled jobs in sectors like manufacturing, a clear consequence of globalization.
The wealth of millennials has been hit even harder than their incomes. Their median net worth was just $10,400 as of 2013, down 43 percent from the $18,200 that Gen Xers had in 1995 when they were under 35. With incomes squeezed, millennials are not only not saving much; they are dipping into whatever savings they do have.
That's worrisome when combined with weak incomes and low net worths. Millennials also participate less frequently in 401(k) plans and, scarred by the recession, invest less and keep more than half their money in cash -- not a great long-term strategy.
Another huge drag on the finances of younger Americans is the mountain of student debt that has been piled up in recent years. Members of this year's graduating class left their campuses owing an average of $35,051, about twice the levels borne by their counterparts two decades earlier (after adjusting for inflation).
That's in large part because college is becoming less affordable even as it has become increasingly necessary. Since 1993, average tuition has risen by 234 percent, far above the 63 percent overall inflation rate.
Saddled with debt and thin paychecks, millennials are delaying purchasing cars and new homes, low mortgage rates notwithstanding. By June of this year, homeownership among Americans under 35 fell to 34.8 percent, down from a high of 43.6 percent in 2004.
Some of this may be cultural -- younger Americans seem less interested in major possessions like cars and homes. But they are also delaying marriage and having children, which I believe is an indicator of strapped finances.
Just to complete a dismal picture, millennials will also be the victims of the irresponsible fiscal policies pursued in large part by members of my generation. The massive budget deficits of recent years and projected needs to meet future obligations to retirees will result in a steady increase in federal debt, from less than 80 percent of gross domestic product today to an estimated 181 percent of G.D.P. by 2090.
Rising national debt levels may threaten the ability of millennials to collect on promised Social Security and Medicare benefits. That's not lost on millennials -- only 45 percent expect to receive Social Security benefits during retirement (compared with 68 percent of baby boomers).
We can't completely undo the financial obstacles younger Americans face, such as their weak earnings. But we can start to put in place policies that will ease their burden. First and foremost would be to get the nation's economy onto a stronger growth trajectory.
That's a daunting challenge that would require revamping federal outlays to emphasize areas like education, infrastructure and research and development. Spending more on these areas would require higher taxes on my generation, which is getting a lot more from government than we are paying into it.
As part of redressing this imbalance, we need to reform the entitlement programs, for example, by reducing Social Security benefits for the highest income Americans. And important steps could be taken to both ease the burden of student debt for those who have already graduated and provide less expensive college opportunities for the rising generation.
Let's at least start with a greater acknowledgment of the plight of millennials and the role that we -- in many cases, their parents -- played in creating it.

Full text:   TO appreciate the dumbing down of American politics, consider this: Conservative Republicans, indignant about abortion, are trying to destroy a government program that helps prevent 345,000 abortions a year.
Inevitably in politics there are good ideas and bad ideas. But occasionally there are also moronic ideas -- such as the House Republican proposal to kill America's main family planning program, Title X.
The upshot would be more pregnancies, more abortions, more AIDS, more sexually transmitted infections and more women dying of cervical and breast cancer. Ending the program would impoverish young mothers and impede the formation of stable two-parent families that conservatives rightly argue help overcome poverty.
It's baffling that House Republicans are trying to eliminate a 45-year-old bipartisan initiative that is one of the country's anti-poverty successes -- and also perhaps America's most successful anti-abortion initiative.
Title X began in a Republican administration, that of Richard Nixon. Today, 4,100 clinics supported by Title X provide family planning and also often test for H.I.V., cure sexually transmitted infections and screen for cervical and breast cancer.
I visited a Title X clinic in Baltimore. Republican members of the House, this is what you're trying to destroy:
A tall 16-year-old girl, nicknamed China (she doesn't know why; she's not Chinese), is being treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia.
"The last time you had sex, did you use a condom?" asks Courtney Pate, a nurse practitioner. China shakes her head.
Pate hands her a bag of condoms and warns her that if she doesn't use one every time, she risks serious health problems, "like not being able to have a baby when you want to." Pate also grills her on whether she has told her sexual partners about the infections and whether they are getting treated.
When Pate steps out for a moment, I ask China if her boyfriend will accept condoms. China looks doubtful and says, "Maybe." Pate overhears and comes roaring back. "If he doesn't wear a condom, he doesn't get any sex," Pate declares. "These are the rules: No condoms, no sex."
China tells me she doesn't have any other way of getting birth control or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. Without this clinic, she says, she might well be pregnant and be spreading infections.
As China leaves, Pate cautions her again: "Somebody says, 'Let's have sex without a condom,' you say, 'No, I don't want any needles in my butt! I don't want to see that crazy lady in the clinic again!"
I also met Doretta, who after a pelvic exam at the clinic received a diagnosis of possible cervical cancer. The good news is that it was found early and was treated, and she is expected to be fine.
Title X isn't directly related to the furor over video footage showing Planned Parenthood staff members speaking cavalierly about fetal tissues; the Republican effort to eliminate Title X goes back much earlier. To those offended by the Planned Parenthood videos, if you're infuriated by abortion, you should be channeling more money to Title X, not less.
Since 1980, inflation-adjusted spending on Title X family planning has fallen by two-thirds. Now the House proposes eliminating it altogether, while the Senate proposes a 10 percent cut.
This in a country where half of all pregnancies are unintended, where 30 percent of American teenage girls become pregnant by age 19.
The Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, calculates that Title X family planning centers prevent about one million unintended pregnancies a year, of which 345,000 would have ended in abortion. It says that every year Title X clinics avert some 53,000 cases of chlamydia and 8,800 cases of gonorrhea, and save the lives of 1,100 women who would otherwise die of cervical cancer.
In other words, Title X prevents an abortion about once every 90 seconds.
Family planning investments also offer hedge fund-like returns, for a condom or IUD can avert more than $12,000 in average Medicaid spending on a childbirth. Guttmacher calculates that every $1 invested in public family planning services saves $7 in public expenditures. This is a program that saves money as well as lives.
Opponents of Title X preen and moralize, even as their behavior has dreadfully immoral consequences. Conservatives emphasize that poverty is often linked to personal irresponsibility. Are youths like China irresponsible when they have sex without a condom? Sure they are! They're kids. What's harder to understand is the irresponsibility of Republican House members.
My question to them: Do you really want to increase the odds that kids like China will get pregnant, will spread disease, will become impoverished single mothers, will get mired in a cycle of poverty, will get abortions -- or will die of breast or cervical cancer -- and do you really think this is moral behavior to be proud of?

While Job Market Tightens, Labor Costs Rise at Slowest Pace in 33 Years

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Labor costs in the United States recorded their smallest increase in 33 years during the second quarter as workers were paid less in commissions and bonuses. The tiny gain appeared to be a temporary wage growth setback against the backdrop of diminishing labor market slack.
The employment cost index, the broadest measure of labor costs, edged up 0.2 percent in the quarter, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was the smallest gain since the series began in the second quarter of 1982. The index rose 0.7 percent in the first quarter.
The weakness in compensation was concentrated in sales, information and wholesale trade, occupations where workers are likely to receive incentive pay. Commissions and bonuses helped lift workers' compensation at the start of the year.
Excluding commissions, compensation was up 0.6 percent in both the first and second quarters, according to TD Securities.
Economists forecast that the employment cost index, widely viewed by policy makers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack, would rise 0.6 percent in the second quarter.
At 5.3 percent, the unemployment rate is close to the 5 percent to 5.2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.
That tightening of the labor market, which is expected to translate eventually into faster wage growth, has helped to hold consumer sentiment at lofty levels over the last eight months.
In a separate report released on Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slipped to 93.1 in July from 96.1 in June. Still, the index was up 13.8 percent from July 2014.
Households expected their incomes to rise over the next two years, in sharp contrast with another confidence survey published this week that suggested a deterioration in consumers' perceptions of the labor market.
"On balance, the Michigan survey suggests that consumer sentiment remains broadly stable," said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
In the second quarter, wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.2 percent. That was also the smallest increase on record.
Private sector compensation failed to rise for the first time on record. Compensation in the services industry nudged up 0.1 percent in the second quarter after rising 0.6 percent in the previous period.
Compensation in the goods-producing sector rose a solid 0.7 percent after increasing 0.5 percent in the first quarter.
In the 12 months through June, labor costs rose 2 percent, the smallest 12-month increase since last year and a further slip below the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent medium-term target.
Benefits rose 0.1 percent in the second quarter, but economists said that was mostly because of changes to the definition of retirement benefits.
A third report on Friday, from MNI Chicago, showed that factory activity in the Midwest rose to a six-month high in July. The Chicago Business Barometer rose to 54.7, the first gain since April, from June's reading of 49.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing industries.
Both production and new orders expanded at the fastest pace since the beginning of the year. A special survey question on wage growth showed that 40 percent of respondents said wages had grown 1 percent to 2 percent over the last year.
About 19 percent of respondents reported that wages were up 3 percent to 4 percent, and nearly a quarter said that wage growth was unchanged over the year.

Full text:   In a common pattern of the last few years, the American economy, after a dismal start to 2015, regained its footing in the spring and looked set to continue a modest advance for the rest of the year.
But the lackluster data last quarter and a slight downward revision of the estimated growth rate over the last three years underscored the challenges that still lie ahead for an economy that doesn't seem to be able to move ahead at more than a slow jog.
The rebound in April, May and June was largely expected, but the 2.3 percent annualized rate, adjusted for inflation, that the Commerce Department reported on Thursday in its initial estimate was a bit below what economists on Wall Street predicted before the release.
Investors were not impressed, and major stock market averages moved little.
"I think it's an O.K. performance," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research firm based in Lexington, Mass. "Underlying growth is stable but not spectacular. The economy is plodding along."
While hardly exceptional by the standards of the late 1990s or even compared with the 5 percent burst of growth in the summer of 2014, the pace of expansion is largely in line with the trajectory of the recovery, which began almost exactly six years ago.
In annual revisions that were also part of the Commerce Department report on Thursday, government statisticians lowered their assessment of the economy's performance over the last several years.
The initial estimate of 2.3 percent growth for 2011 through 2014 was lowered to 2 percent, a level that reflects the slow healing of the job market and helps explain why wages and prices have gained so little ground. The pace was below that of most past recoveries.
The rate of expansion in the first quarter of 2015 was revised up to 0.6 percent, reversing earlier estimates that showed a minor contraction.
"The environment has been even more challenging than we thought before," Mr. Behravesh said. "The primary reason is that the U.S. economy had to go through a period of deleveraging, with debt reduction primarily by households and banks."
As for the last quarter, much of the improvement in the economy came from a better trade balance, especially in terms of exports. Mr. Behravesh said he expected growth in the second half of the year to rise to just under 3 percent as the drag from lower energy industry spending diminishes.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that initial unemployment claims last week at the state level increased by 12,000, to 267,000. Despite that slight rise, new jobless claims remain close to a 32-year low, and the more reliable four-week moving average suggests that the labor market continues to improve despite the less-than-impressive overall growth rate.
If output continues to expand and hiring advances at a healthy pace, the Federal Reserve is likely to begin its long-awaited move to raise interest rates from historic lows by year-end, perhaps as early as mid-September.
On Wednesday, Fed policy makers issued an upbeat assessment of the economy's progress after concluding a two-day meeting. But they left interest rates near zero, where they have been since late 2008, when the economy and the financial system were at crisis levels.
Oxford Economics, a research firm, termed the latest snapshot of gross domestic product a "sweet and sour G.D.P. release."
In a note to investors, Oxford said it saw "sweet upward revisions to residential activity and solid Q2 consumer spending momentum, but a sour taste from reduced household outlays on services and lower equipment spending."
Net exports added 0.13 percentage point to overall growth last quarter, a big turnabout after being a significant drag in late 2014 and early 2015.
Hammered by a one-two punch from a stronger dollar and then a labor slowdown at West Coast ports, net exports reduced growth by one percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2014 and nearly two full percentage points in the first quarter of 2015.
That was the worst two-quarter trade performance since 1998, according to a report by Morgan Stanley, but as the ports began functioning normally again this spring and the dollar has stabilized, the drag from trade has faded, at least for now.
In addition to the impact on the headline growth numbers, the trade balance will also be watched by experts who want to gauge the degree by which economic distress overseas is affecting American exporters and importers.
In contrast with the turmoil overseas, the American economy has been an island of relative stability recently. Consumer spending in the second quarter rose 2.9 percent, compared with a 1.8 percent gain in the first quarter. Investment in residential real estate rose 6.6 percent, compared with 10.1 percent over January, February and March.
The next crucial reading for the economy will come Aug. 7, when the Labor Department reports the latest figures on hiring and unemployment for July. The unemployment rate in June stood at 5.3 percent, the lowest level since April 2008, although that figure did not take into account the large number of jobless Americans who gave up the search for work and dropped out of the labor force entirely.
The Fed and Wall Street are keeping an eye on the falling unemployment rate, but they are also looking for signs that more unemployed Americans are being drawn back into the labor force by the prospect of finding a decent job.
Looking ahead, Michael Gapen, the chief United States economist at Barclays, said the 2.9 percent increase in consumer spending last quarter bodes well for the rest of the year because consumers are responsible for the bulk of overall economic activity.
Weakness elsewhere in the world, however, may act as a ceiling on American output despite growing demand at home.
"One thing that would help would be if the rest of the world were doing better," Mr. Gapen said. "About 15 percent of growth is from trade, so without that, it's hard to get a growth rate of 3 percent or better."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve remains on track to raise interest rates later this year, and perhaps as soon as its next policy meeting in mid-September, as economic growth continues to meet its expectations.
The Fed issued an upbeat assessment of economic conditions on Wednesday after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. While growth remains disappointing by past standards, the Fed said the economy continued to expand at a "moderate" pace, which is driving "solid job gains and declining unemployment."
The statement suggested officials didn't need to see much more progress before they started to increase their benchmark rate, which they have held near zero since December 2008. The Fed, which said after the last meeting, in June, of the Federal Open Market Committee that it wanted to see "further improvement" in labor markets, said on Wednesday that "some further improvement" would now suffice.
"The addition of the word 'some' may appear minor, but the Fed doesn't add words willy-nilly to the F.O.M.C. statement," wrote Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. "It leaves the door wide open to a September liftoff, but still retains the optionality to delay hiking if the jobs reports disappoint between now and mid-September."
The decision to keep rates near zero for at least a few more weeks was unanimous, supported by all 10 voting members of the committee. But a number of those officials have said in recent months that they do not think the Fed should wait much longer.
The Fed's policy committee next meets Sept. 16 and 17.
Surveys of economic forecasters show that most expect the Fed to start raising interest rates at that September meeting. But measures of market expectations point to a December liftoff.
Investors appeared to parse the Fed's statement as somewhat reducing the chances of a September increase. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after it was released, though it posted a small increase for the day, closing at 2.286 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.7 percent to close at 2,108.57.
"Our expectation is that they will do something in September, but we wouldn't be surprised if they found a reason to push it back toward December," said Roger Bayston, director of the fixed-income group at Franklin Templeton, an investment firm based in San Mateo, Calif.
The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate near zero as the main element in its campaign to revive economic growth and increase employment after the Great Recession. And it has repeatedly extended that stimulus campaign in the face of disappointing economic news, to avoid raising rates too soon.
In recent months, however, officials including Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, have suggested they are growing more worried about waiting too long.
Economic growth has increased after a rough winter, and employment expanded by an average of 208,000 jobs a month during the first half of the year, dropping the unemployment rate to 5.3 percent.
"If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds target," Ms. Yellen said in congressional testimony this month.
Wednesday's statement described economic progress on multiple fronts, but it noted some persistent concerns. Business investment remains weak. The relative strength of the American economy also has increased the value of the dollar, weighing on exports.
And inflation remains sluggish. Prices rose just 0.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, according to the Fed's preferred measure, a Commerce Department index of personal consumption expenditures. It was the 37th consecutive month that inflation has remained below the Fed's declared target of 2 percent annual growth.
Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials, however, say they are increasingly confident that continued growth will push up prices.
In a recent research note, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said that the sluggishness of inflation did not amount to a "statistically significant departure" from the Fed's target, and that inflation was likely to increase with economic output and employment.
Ms. Yellen, in her recent testimony, also pointed to signs that wages were starting to rise more quickly, which she has identified as an important indicator that the economy is nearing full strength.
The state of the economy may become clearer before the Fed's next policy-making meeting. Fed officials will be able to review two government estimates of second-quarter economic activity, as measured by the gross domestic product, and a pair of monthly labor market reports, among other data.
The Fed, however, has signaled that it wants to preserve some uncertainty about its own plans. Officials say they will not prejudge the timing of an increase, focusing on the latest economic data. By contrast, the last time the Fed started a round of rate increases, back in 2004, it put markets on notice at the meeting before it took action.
"While the tone was a bit more positive, there was no clear signal on when normalization will begin," Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote about Wednesday's statement. "We continue to forecast a start in September, but, of course, a lot can happen in seven weeks."
Correction: July 31, 2015, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the Federal Reserve's most recent assessment of the nation's economic prospects misstated the location of the headquarters of the investment firm Franklin Templeton, an executive of which speculated on when the Fed might begin raising interest rates. It is based in San Mateo, Calif., not New York.

Full text:   Stocks rose on Wednesday after Federal Reserve policy makers voted to keep interest rates unchanged and gave no indication that a rate increase was imminent.
A modest rebound in Chinese stocks also helped push the market higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 121.12 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,751.39. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 15.32 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,108.57, and the Nasdaq gained 22.53 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,111.73.
The Fed said the United States economy continued to improve in numerous aspects, but it signaled that it wanted to see further economic gains and higher inflation before raising rates. Low interest rates have been good for stock investors, helping to fuel a bull market that has lasted more than six years.
"Yeah, the economy is improving, but they are not really saying that the economy is taking off here," said Tom di Galoma, head of rates trading at ED&F Man Capital. "If the Fed doesn't raise rates in September, I think we're looking at some time mid-next year."
Bond investors seemed to agree with the idea that the Fed was in no rush to raise rates. Bonds rose, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to a yield of 2.29 compared with nearly 2.30 percent before the Fed statement.
Investors had a second day of relative calm in the Chinese stock market. The Shanghai composite index rebounded 3.4 percent to close at 3,790.26 after flitting between gains and losses for most of the day. Alarm over the sharp fall in Chinese shares has abated somewhat as the Shanghai index has steadied since Monday's 8.5 percent drop.
A strong batch of corporate earnings also helped lift the market. Gilead Sciences rose $2.64, or 2.3 percent, to $115.71. The company's profits jumped 23 percent compared with a year ago, helped by its new blockbuster hepatitis C medicine Harvoni. The company also raised its 2015 forecasts.
Northrop Grumman led defense companies higher after it posted a stronger-than-expected profit in the second quarter and raised its outlook for the year. Northrop's stock jumped $10.10, or 6.2 percent, to $173.44, its biggest one-day gain in at least five years.
In other markets, the price of United States crude oil rose Wednesday after the government reported a drop in oil inventories and oil production. Benchmark United States crude rose 81 cents to settle at $48.79 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, rose 8 cents to $53.38 in London.
In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 1.9 cents to $1.822 a gallon.
The euro fell to $1.0980 from $1.1058.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The fight for a $15 minimum wage has gained momentum in New York, California and other places around the country in recent months. But as a national strategy to raise incomes at the bottom of the pay scale, it faces major obstacles, both political and economic.
In many states, particularly those governed by Republicans in the South and the Midwest, there is little chance of raising the minimum wage above the federal level, which has stood at $7.25 since 2009. Congressional Democrats have introduced a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020, but Republicans typically argue that raising the wage floor costs jobs and hurts the very people it is intended to help.
Even where the proposals are politically viable, the economic challenge could prove daunting. That is because the sheer magnitude of the recent minimum wage increases sets up an economics experiment the country has rarely if ever seen before.
"There could be quite large shares of workers affected, and research doesn't have a lot to say about that," said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economist now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who generally favors higher minimum wages. "We can't assume that because the proposal is out of sample it's going to blow up. But we have to be less certain about the outcome."
A number of researchers have found that modestly higher minimum wages can raise incomes for low-wage workers without reducing the number of jobs in an area.
Their evidence rests largely on comparisons between neighboring areas with different minimum wages. The seminal study in this vein examined fast-food restaurants on both sides of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey border before and after New Jersey raised its minimum wage in the early 1990s. It found no evidence that employment there fell as a result.
While economists using other methods continue to find a range of job losses, some of their recent estimates of losses in the restaurant business tend to be small.
But the $15-an-hour proposals go far beyond the experience of the last few decades, and the recommendations of a panel appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to raise the minimum wage for workers at fast-food chains to such a level thrust New York State to the forefront of the current experiment.
To appreciate the nature of the recommendations, which the state's acting labor commissioner is expected to formally accept within the next few months, it is helpful to compare the new fast-food minimum wage to the wage of a typical worker in a given metropolitan area, an exercise that is common among economists. The closer the minimum wage is to the median wage -- the amount earned by workers in the middle of the pay scale -- the greater the likely impact, for better or worse, though the effect of singling out one industry is unclear.
Based on projections from government data, the proposed $15 minimum wage for fast-food workers could represent more than 60 percent of the wage of a typical New York City worker when it takes effect at the end of 2018, though rising wages for middle-income workers could diminish that figure somewhat.
Such a ratio lies at the outer limit of the country's historical experience with the minimum wage, at least before the recent increases in cities like Seattle and Los Angeles, most of which have yet to be fully phased in.
In 2003, a citywide minimum wage increase in Santa Fe, N.M., was roughly as steep, though it exempted small businesses. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the local minimum wage stood at over 60 percent of the local median wage in several Southern and low-population states thanks to increases in the federal minimum wage, according to data compiled by Ben Zipperer of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.
Several economic analyses of the Santa Fe increase suggested it had little effect on employment, while the effects of the earlier increases have not been extensively studied with modern tools.
Still, as ambitious as the proposed increase is for fast-food workers in New York City, it pales in comparison to the increase in the rest of the state, where the new $15-per-hour minimum for fast-food workers would take effect in July 2021. The minimum wage for fast-food workers could rise to 75 percent or more of the wage for a typical worker in a number of cities across the state, like Binghamton, Buffalo and Utica. There is little precedent for an increase of this magnitude.
There are other reasons to believe that employers in expensive cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles are better able to adapt than employers in other cities and less populated areas, economists say.
Most important, because rent is far more expensive in these cities, wages are a smaller fraction of a business's overall costs. A given increase in the minimum wage typically has a smaller effect on the bottom line of a business there than in an area with cheaper rent.
Likewise, businesses in high-cost cities often have transient customers who are less price-sensitive, making it easier for them to partly offset higher wages through price increases.
"Some of these cities are tourist destinations," said David Cooper of the Economic Policy Institute. "Folks go and spend the money anyway." Businesses in less-frequently visited places do not have the same luxury.
Wanda Austin-Peters, who owned a Subway franchise in Albany for 10 years until she sold it in May, said labor normally accounted for 50 percent or more of her costs in a given year -- relatively high compared with an industry average of around one-third. She added that she had little ability to raise prices.
"It would be stupid to charge $7 for a footlong sandwich that everyone else has for $5," Ms. Austin-Peters said. "There's a Subway cropping up in every corner."
Even when they don't lead to job losses over all, minimum wage increases can be disruptive, driving a number of operations out of business even as they give rise to a largely offsetting increase in new businesses and jobs.
The businesses best suited to the higher-wage world often lean more heavily on machines than their competitors or derive greater economic benefits from paying their workers a higher wage.
Cole Hardware, a chain of five Bay Area stores, four of which are in San Francisco, is an example of the latter. Rick Karp, the owner, said his business was largely unaffected when the local minimum wage rose to $12.25 per hour in May because his lowest-paid employees already made $13 per hour, while veteran workers made $17 and higher.
According to Mr. Karp, paying higher wages has reduced turnover and allowed him to provide higher-quality service with employees who are more experienced. "If you come into our business, we want our staff to recognize you, treat you as a friend," he said. "We can't do that with minimum-wage employees."
Mr. Karp, who estimated that his prices were about 10 percent higher than those at Amazon, his most intense competitor, said he believed that his customers were willing to pay a small premium in return for knowledgeable and personal service.
"We'll spend 20 minutes with you helping to find a faucet washer or an expensive grill," he said. "It's a different experience."
A number of studies co-written by the Berkeley economist Michael Reich show that mandated wage increases for low-income workers do significantly reduce turnover. Other studies show that the cost savings can be substantial.
Still, the uncertainty of the new $15-per-hour world is why even economists relatively sympathetic to minimum wage increases, like Arindrajit Dube, Mr. Reich's frequent collaborator, argue that it makes the most sense to treat cities like New York and San Francisco differently from other parts of their states, to say nothing of less populous states where wages are much lower.
Others, like David Neumark, an economist at the University of California, Irvine who has long emphasized the costs of minimum wage increases, argue that it would be far more efficient to help lift people out of poverty using wage subsidies like the earned-income tax credit than to rely on the minimum wage, which frequently helps workers in families whose incomes are already above the poverty level.
Recent research suggests that the earned-income tax credit is highly effective at reducing poverty, although far fewer people claim it than are eligible, often because the working poor have little experience claiming tax benefits.
Activists say they have nothing against measures like the tax credit, though they say that Congress is not exactly tripping over itself to expand the credit, whereas organized political action can raise the minimum wage today.
In any case, they add, the narrow economic logic of the minimum wage misses the broader rationale for their efforts.
"Raising the minimum wage for everyone says something profound and profoundly good about the society we want to live in," said Dan Cantor, national director of the Working Families Party, which has helped secure minimum wage increases in several cities and states across the country. "That all work has dignity and worth, and people deserve a living wage."

Full text:   Goodbye, Chicago boys. Hello, M.I.T. gang.
If you don't know what I'm talking about, the term "Chicago boys" was originally used to refer to Latin American economists, trained at the University of Chicago, who took radical free-market ideology back to their home countries. The influence of these economists was part of a broader phenomenon: The 1970s and 1980s were an era of ascendancy for laissez-faire economic ideas and the Chicago school, which promoted those ideas.
But that was a long time ago. Now a different school is in the ascendant, and deservedly so.
It's actually surprising how little media attention has been given to the dominance of M.I.T.-trained economists in policy positions and policy discourse. But it's quite remarkable. Ben Bernanke has an M.I.T. Ph.D.; so do Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, and Olivier Blanchard, the enormously influential chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Blanchard is retiring, but his replacement, Maurice Obstfeld, is another M.I.T. guy -- and another student of Stanley Fischer, who taught at M.I.T. for many years and is now the Fed's vice chairman.
These are just the most prominent examples. M.I.T.-trained economists, especially Ph.D.s from the 1970s, play an outsized role at policy institutions and in policy discussion across the Western world. And yes, I'm part of the same gang.
So what distinguishes M.I.T. economics, and why does it matter? To answer that question, you need to go back to the 1970s, when all the people I've just named went to graduate school.
At the time, the big issue was the combination of high unemployment with high inflation. The coming of stagflation was a big win for Milton Friedman, who had predicted exactly that outcome if the government tried to keep unemployment too low for too long; it was widely seen, rightly or (mostly) wrongly, as proof that markets get it right and the government should just stay out of the way.
Or to put it another way, many economists responded to stagflation by turning their backs on Keynesian economics and its call for government action to fight recessions.
At M.I.T., however, Keynes never went away. To be sure, stagflation showed that there were limits to what policy can do. But students continued to learn about the imperfections of markets and the role that monetary and fiscal policy can play in boosting a depressed economy.
And the M.I.T. students of the 1970s enlarged on those insights in their later work. Mr. Blanchard, for example, showed how small deviations from perfect rationality can have large economic consequences; Mr. Obstfeld showed that currency markets can sometimes experience self-fulfilling panic.
This open-minded, pragmatic approach was overwhelmingly vindicated after crisis struck in 2008. Chicago-school types warned incessantly that responding to the crisis by printing money and running deficits would lead to 70s-type stagflation, with soaring inflation and interest rates. But M.I.T. types predicted, correctly, that inflation and interest rates would stay low in a depressed economy, and that attempts to slash deficits too soon would deepen the slump.
The truth, although nobody will believe it, is that the economic analysis some of us learned at M.I.T. way back when has worked very, very well for the past seven years.
But has the intellectual success of M.I.T. economics led to comparable policy success? Unfortunately, the answer is no.
True, there have been some important monetary successes. The Fed, led by Mr. Bernanke, ignored right-wing pressure and threats -- Rick Perry, as governor of Texas, went so far as to accuse him of treason -- and pursued an aggressively expansionary policy that helped limit the damage from the financial crisis. In Europe, Mr. Draghi's activism has been crucial to calming financial markets, probably saving the euro from collapse.
On other fronts, however, the M.I.T. gang's good advice has been ignored. The I.M.F.'s research department, under Mr. Blanchard's leadership, has done authoritative work on the effects of fiscal policy, demonstrating beyond any reasonable doubt that slashing spending in a depressed economy is a terrible mistake, and that attempts to reduce high levels of debt via austerity are self-defeating. But European politicians have slashed spending and demanded crippling austerity from debtors anyway.
Meanwhile, in the United States, Republicans have responded to the utter failure of free-market orthodoxy and the remarkably successful predictions of much-hated Keynesians by digging in even deeper, determined to learn nothing from experience.
In other words, being right isn't necessarily enough to change the world. But it's still better to be right than to be wrong, and M.I.T.-style economics, with its pragmatic openness to evidence, has been very right indeed.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Americans bought homes in June at the fastest rate in over eight years, pushing prices higher as buyer demand eclipsed the availability of houses on the market.
The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that sales of existing homes rose 3.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the highest rate since February 2007. Sales have increased 9.6 percent over the last 12 months, while the number of listings has risen just 0.4 percent.
Median home prices climbed 6.5 percent over the last 12 months to $236,400, the highest level reported by the association, not adjusted for inflation.
Home buying has recently surged as more buyers have entered the market. Robust hiring over the last 21 months and an economic recovery now in its sixth year have enabled more Americans to set aside money for down payments. But the rising demand has failed to draw more sellers into the market, causing tight inventories and escalating prices that could cap sales growth.
"The recent pace can't be sustained, but it points clearly to upside potential," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
A mere five months' supply of homes was on the market in June, compared with 5.5 months a year ago and an average of six months in a healthy market.
Some markets are barely adding listings. The condominium market in Massachusetts contains just 1.8 months' supply, according to a Federal Reserve report this month. The majority of real estate agents in the Atlanta Fed region, which ranges from Alabama to Florida, said that inventories were flat or fell over the last year.
Some of the recent increase in sales appears to have come from the prospect of mortgage rates beginning to rise as the Federal Reserve considers raising an important interest rate from its near-zero level this year. That possibility is prompting buyers to complete sales before higher rates make borrowing more expensive, noted Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac, a housing analytics firm.
The premiums that the Federal Housing Administration charges to insure mortgages are also lower this year, further propelling buying activity, Mr. Blomquist said.
Properties typically sold last month in 34 days, the shortest time since the Realtors began tracking the figure in May 2011. There were fewer all-cash, individual investor and distressed home sales in the market, as more traditional buyers have returned.
Sales improved in all four geographical regions: Northeast, Midwest, South and West.
Still, the limited supplies could eventually prove to be a drag on sales growth in the coming months.
Low mortgage rates have also helped, although rates are starting to climb to levels that could slow buying activity.
Average 30-year fixed rates were 4.09 percent last week, according to the mortgage company Freddie Mac. The average has risen from a 52-week low of 3.59 percent.

Full text:   As complaints grow about exorbitant drug prices, pharmaceutical companies are coming under pressure to disclose the development costs and profits of those medicines and the rationale for charging what they do.
So-called pharmaceutical cost transparency bills have been introduced in at least six state legislatures in the last year, aiming to make drug companies justify their prices, which are often attributed to high research and development costs.
"If a prescription drug demands an outrageous price tag, the public, insurers and federal, state and local governments should have access to the information that supposedly justifies the cost," says the preamble of a bill introduced in the New York State Senate in May.
In an article being published Thursday, more than 100 prominent oncologists called for support of a grass-roots movement to stem the rapid increases of prices of cancer drugs, including by letting Medicare negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies and letting patients import less expensive medicines from Canada.
"There is no relief in sight because drug companies keep challenging the market with even higher prices," the doctors wrote in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. "This raises the question of whether current pricing of cancer drugs is based on reasonable expectation of return on investment or whether it is based on what prices the market can bear."
Pressure is mounting from elsewhere as well. The top Republican and Democrat on the United States Senate Finance Committee last year demanded detailed cost data from Gilead Sciences, whose hepatitis C drugs, which cost $1,000 a pill or more, have strained the budgets of state and federal health programs. The U.A.W. Retiree Medical Benefits Trust tried to make Gilead, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Celgene and other companies report to their shareholders more about how they set prices and the risks to their businesses from resistance to high drug prices.
The trust cited the more than $300,000 per year price of Vertex's cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco and roughly $150,000 for Celgene's cancer drug Revlimid.
Even former President Bill Clinton, in a speech to pharmaceutical executives in Philadelphia last month, said it would be in the industry's best interest to say more about its costs and pricing.
"Explain, explain, explain and disclose, disclose, disclose," Mr. Clinton said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. "Don't expect everybody to love you, but at least they will hear your side of the story."
The pharmaceutical industry has already had the veil lifted on various practices. Drug companies now have to report the payments, including meals and entertainment, that they make to doctors for research, consulting and giving promotional speeches. The companies have also had to disclose more results of their clinical trials and in some cases have started to provide raw data to outsiders.
It is unclear if cost and pricing will become the next such area. The state bills, which are supported by some health insurers and consumer groups, have not progressed. The two senators, Republican Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, have not reported the results of their inquiry. And shareholders of Gilead, Vertex and Celgene voted down the resolutions proposed by the U.A.W. trust, though the trust says it reached settlements with Eli Lilly and with two other drug companies it would not identify.
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry trade groups say the transparency bills would be costly to comply with and would provide misleading information.
Even some people concerned about drug prices say that the cost to develop a particular drug has little to do with that drug's price and that knowing such information will not keep prices down.
"The past R&D cost is really kind of a red herring," said Len Nichols, a health care economist at George Mason University, referring to research and development. "The current revenue doesn't pay for past R&D; it pays for current R&D."
Prices for cancer drugs, some of which extend lives by only a couple of months, routinely exceed $100,000 a year, and some new ones exceed $150,000. And it is not unusual for the list prices of existing drugs to rise 10 percent or more year after year, far beyond the rate of inflation. The prices of older drugs for multiple sclerosis have risen from about $10,000 per year in the late 1990s to more than $60,000 now, according to a study, even as competition in the market has intensified with the introduction of new products.
Cost transparency bills have also been introduced in California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
Three of the bills require disclosures for drugs costing $10,000 or more per year. The others have different criteria. Besides development costs, some of the bills would require disclosure of the costs of manufacturing, marketing and advertising. At least some of the bills also ask for a history of price increases, the profit attributable to the drug and how much a company spends in providing financial assistance to patients using the drug.
Two of the bills would allow the states to act on the information, not just require disclosure. Pennsylvania's would allow insurers to refuse to pay for a drug if the manufacturer did not file the required report. In Massachusetts, a state commission would be able to set a maximum price for a drug if it determined that the price set by the manufacturer was significantly high compared with the benefits, costs or prices in other countries.
Most of the bills have not been acted upon, though hearings were held in California and Oregon.
The sponsor of the California bill, Assemblyman David Chiu, pulled it back shortly before a committee was to vote on it, apparently because it did not have sufficient support. The bill could be picked up again next year.
"This is a new topic for many of my colleagues to grapple with," said Mr. Chiu, a Democrat from San Francisco. He said the bill was necessary because "greater transparency leads to better policy results."
Mitch Greenlick, a Democrat from Portland who is chairman of the Health Care Committee in Oregon's House of Representatives, said the bill was prepared with input from the health insurance industry, but was "not ready for prime time." He added that the issue would be further studied.
"What are we going to do with that information?" he said. "It's interesting to have, I suppose, but the drug companies are shameless, and they charge what they can get away with."
Insurers and consumer groups told the Oregon Legislature that more disclosure was needed because the state had to decide whether to pay for certain drugs. Representatives of the pharmaceutical industry said the bill was unfair and would discourage industry investment in Oregon.
Lori Reilly, executive vice president for policy and research at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's main trade group, said it was misleading to look only at the cost of developing a particular drug because that ignored the money spent on the drugs that fail during development. Only about 12 percent of drugs tested in people reach the market, she said.
Ms. Reilly said that publicly traded drug companies already disclosed their overall research and development costs, as well as other financial information. She also said that focusing on costs ignored the value of the drugs. Some drugs, for instance, can save money for the health system over all by keeping people out of the hospital, she said.
Pharmaceutical executives do not typically tie the price of any particular drug to its development cost. But they do say that their sales have to recoup their investment in research and development if the companies are to stay in business.
They often cite the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University, which last year said companies spent an average of $2.6 billion to bring a drug to market, up from an estimate of $800 million in 2003. That includes the cost of failures. And almost half the figure is opportunity cost, the amount a company might have earned if it had invested money elsewhere rather than spending it on drug development.
Critics are skeptical of that figure, saying that the Tufts center gets funding from the pharmaceutical industry and uses data supplied by the drug companies, but does not disclose which drugs are used as the basis of the estimates.
Pharmaceutical executives often say they price the drugs based on the value they provide, though often a detailed explanation of that is not provided. In many cases, it appears, the price of new drugs is set in comparison to rival drugs already on the market, and usually a bit higher. Companies then can raise their prices for the older drugs.
"We all look at each other and keep pace with each other," said a director of one multiple sclerosis drug developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Honestly, there is no science to it."
John Rother, chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, a group of insurers, consumer organizations, labor unions and employers concerned about drug prices, said his group hoped to introduce transparency legislation in Congress, but aimed at determining how drug companies estimate the value of their drugs, not the research and development costs.
"The industry has used R&D costs for the justification, but anyone who is reasonably sophisticated understands those are sunk costs and have little to do with pricing," Mr. Rother said. "The more important information is any calculation of value. If the drug actually cures people, then what costs in health care are you saving?"
Dr. Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School and critic of some drug company practices, said the industry "has brought this on itself by charging prices that are so astonishing, it makes citizens wonder, 'Where did this figure come from?' "

Abstract: Pointing to the looming new tax on high cost insurance plans imposed under the federal health care law, KapStone wants to replace its existing policies with plans that could prove far more expensive for workers and their families. Because the thresholds for activating the tax are linked to overall inflation rather than the faster pace of rising medical costs, more insurance plans are likely to be affected.

Full text:   At the paper mill in Longview, Wash., Kurt Gallow and his wife, Brenda, are worrying about his company's proposed new health care plan, which would require workers to pay as much as $6,000 toward their families' medical bills.
Mrs. Gallow's diabetic condition almost certainly will mean thousands of dollars more a year for her care alone, if the new plan is put in place, which may happen as early as next year.
"Some of the people with health problems will definitely pay more," said Mr. Gallow, who is president of the local unit of the Association of Western Pulp & Paper Workers.
The union is now in heated negotiations with the mill's owner, KapStone Paper and Packaging, over benefits, among other issues. The couple and many other employees have been enrolled in a popular Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization, which charged just $25 for a doctor's visit.
But that may change by January. Pointing to the looming new tax on high cost insurance plans imposed under the federal health care law, KapStone wants to replace its existing policies with plans that could prove far more expensive for workers and their families. By doing so, the company would save almost $3 million in additional taxes in just the first two and a half years.
Called the Cadillac tax, it applies to an individual policy costing more than $10,200 a year and a family policy over $27,500. The tax goes into effect in 2018.
With less than three years before the tax is imposed, KapStone and other employers are weighing their options.
"If you look into the future, it's part of the reason they want out," Mr. Gallow said. And while companies have long been trimming their benefits as a way to lower costs, they now have another reason.
KapStone declined to comment.
For its part, Kaiser thinks its plans will continue to appeal to many employers, despite the tax. "Kaiser Permanente is confident that we can continue to offer our customers comprehensive, affordable health care coverage regardless of how this tax provision is ultimately applied," said a spokesman, Chris Stenrud.
"As a general matter, it has become a pretty prominent part of the discussion in many of the negotiations," said Shaun O'Brien, a policy official with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
But the tax is also galvanizing many employers and their unions to push for its repeal. The 40 percent excise tax has always been controversial, and opposition to it is gaining traction.
"As we get closer to 2018, we're starting to hear the organic resistance out there," said Representative Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat who has proposed a bill to repeal the tax. The bill has gained nearly 130 co-sponsors, including more than 100 fellow Democrats, and with supporters ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
In New Hampshire, Representative Frank Guinta, a Republican, has a similar bill that has almost 70 co-sponsors from his side of the aisle. A former mayor of Manchester, Mr. Guinta says he has been hearing from local governments about the potential impact of the tax. He says he thinks Congress can agree on the need for repeal.
"There is very significant bipartisan support," he said.
A new coalition comprising major corporations, including Cigna and Pfizer, as well as union groups and associations, called the Alliance to Fight the 40, plans to begin a formal campaign against the tax later this month.
"Business and labor are united in their opposition and concerned about the impact of the tax," said Katy Spangler, a health policy executive with the American Benefits Council, a member of the alliance. It is also in discussions with members of the Senate about a bill.
Because the thresholds for activating the tax are linked to overall inflation rather than the faster pace of rising medical costs, more insurance plans are likely to be affected.
Both the employer and the worker's contributions are counted toward the cost, and the tax is levied on the amount above the $10,200 threshold. A plan that costs $15,200, for example, would be taxed on the $5,000 that it was above the threshold, resulting in a $2,000 liability.
About two-thirds of employers recently surveyed by Aon Hewitt, a consultancy, estimate they will have at least one health plan that will be taxed within five years, and three-quarters think the majority of their plans will be subject to the tax after 2028. "Every employer is going to face a decision point," said Jim Winkler, a health benefits executive at the consultancy.
While Mr. Winkler said employers had been slow so far to make significant changes, many have begun accelerating efforts to contain costs as a way to avoid the tax.
Some companies, like Cummins, the engine manufacturer, have already taken steps to reduce benefits as a way of avoiding the tax. And universities like Harvard and George Washington have also made changes to their coverage. Public employers like the City of Manchester are also scrambling to figure out how to handle the potential liability.
Over the last year, employers and unions have both been studying the impact of the tax on the plans now being offered, said Edward Kaplan, a benefits expert at Segal Consulting. "No one wants to pay it," he said.
Proponents argue that the tax is a useful antidote to overly generous health plans, which they contend encourage people to get more medical care than they need. Supporters of the tax also see it as a way for the country to move away from the tax exclusion of health benefits, one reason there is such a heavy reliance on employers to provide health coverage.
It is also an important source of funding for the Affordable Care Act. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the tax will generate $87 billion over a decade.
But critics argue that the tax penalizes employees with plans that are expensive rather than generous. "Geography, age, gender and occupation are much more significant in how you come up with the cost of the premium," Mr. Courtney, the Connecticut representative, said. "It's such a blunt instrument."
Employers that have unusually high medical costs, like a premature baby whose care costs $5 million, or that have a work force with a large number of people with expensive illnesses, could also be liable for the tax.
Mr. Courtney also questions whether the tax will raise nearly as much as projected. Most of the revenue is estimated to come from taxes on the higher wages workers are supposed to get in lieu of benefits, but there is substantial disagreement over whether companies will pay their employees more.
Saving a dollar on health benefits doesn't necessarily translate to an extra dollar of wages, Ms. Spangler said. "That's just not something we're seeing with our members."
Many employers have been taking steps like offering only high-deductible plans to their workers, said Brian Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health. Others are looking at less expensive plans with a much more limited network of hospitals and doctors, or are considering initiatives like on-site health clinics or programs to improve workers' overall health as a way of lowering costs.
But Mr. Marcotte emphasized that employers feel that the tax represents an unfair penalty on coverage. "Employers would rather see it repealed," he said.
Because of the way the tax calculates the cost of coverage, employers are also splitting off their dental and vision plans and separating coverage of early retirees from active employees to lower the dollar amount counted. Health savings accounts, if funded by an employer, appear to be counted as part of the total cost, although the final rules are not yet in.
At this stage, it is unclear whether Congress will coalesce around a repeal. When the health care law was passed in 2010, many thought the provision would go away, said Timothy S. Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. People thought "this will never go into effect," he said, but, with 2018 only a few years away, "It looks like it might happen."
Representatives Courtney and Guinta say they are confident Congress will vote to repeal the tax, and foresee mounting pressure from constituents to do so.
"Members are going to hear a lot of noise," Mr. Courtney said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the low-key conservative majority leader, and Senator Barbara Boxer, a brash liberal Democrat, reached an unlikely compromise Tuesday to increase highway spending over the next three years and set transportation policy through 2022.
But little more than an hour after the 1,000-page bill was unveiled, 56 senators voted to block its immediate consideration. The vote, with 41 senators supporting moving to the bill, was not fatal; Democrats said they just needed time to read it. Still, it was a warning that the measure faces a rough road over the next two weeks.
House Republican leaders are leery of the Senate bill. Democrats worry about the way it is paid for, including expanding the power of private debt agencies to collect taxes and cutting Social Security benefits for people with felony warrants.
And presidential candidates in the Senate see an opportunity to raise their profiles. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has vowed to do all he can to derail efforts to attach language to the bill resurrecting the Export-Import Bank, the federal export credit agency shuttered June 30 by a conservative Republican campaign. Senator Rand Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky and another Republican White House hopeful, has vowed to use the bill to defund Planned Parenthood.
"Just slow down," Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, told Mr. McConnell before his united Democratic caucus blocked the bill's consideration.
Still, for Mr. McConnell and Ms. Boxer -- two senators who are ideological opposites -- the delicate deal, reached over days of intense negotiations, is real progress. On 33 occasions in the last six years, Congress has been able to muster only short-term extensions of the highway trust fund. Lawmakers in both parties have been unwilling to raise the federal gas tax, the most obvious funding source, and other ways to pay for longer-term bills have proved elusive.
In the meantime, patchwork repairs have snarled the nation's roads. Breakdowns have become routine on aging transit systems. Bridges have collapsed, and airports have been mired in congestion.
The Associated General Contractors of America reported on Tuesday that construction employment fell in 25 states this summer as state agencies awaited word from Congress on the future of highway and transit spending.
"I'd love to get on this bill, get moving on it and keep this economy moving in the right direction," Ms. Boxer said.
Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said, "This is a big moment for economic opportunity in this country."
Mr. McConnell vowed to bring the bill back to the floor as early as Wednesday and work through the weekend to get it passed.
The bill's funding increases are modest, around 2 percent above current levels. But it would give priority to bridges considered "of national importance" and focus added revenue on the interstate highway system. It would establish a new federal freight transport program, promote rail safety technology in the wake of May's deadly Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia, and increase public transportation funding by almost $2 billion over current levels. It also includes $162 million, a 7.5 percent increase, for next year to rush repairs to creaking transit systems.
In all, the measure would spend more than $300 billion on infrastructure over six years, almost $50 billion more than federal fuel taxes will bring in over that time.
Senators, facing little interest in raising the gas tax, which has not been increased since 1993, turned to novel ways to make up for fuel tax receipts that fall well short of demand. Tax law compliance changes would crack down on rich families who fudge the value of property inheritances to dodge estate taxes. The government would be allowed to deny or revoke passports for people with more than $50,000 in unpaid taxes. Private debt collection agencies would be empowered to bring in an estimated $2.4 billion over the next decade.
Some $3.5 billion in transportation security fees would be diverted to infrastructure spending. Customs user fees would rise with inflation. The 6 percent dividend rate the Federal Reserve pays to large banks on their deposits with the Fed would be lowered to 1.5 percent, with the savings -- $16.3 billion -- going to highways.
The bill also calls for 101 million barrels of oil to be sold from the federal strategic petroleum reserve, nearly 15 percent of the total, to raise $9 billion.
"It's shortsighted, but it's the reality of the Republican majority," Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said. "That's where they are."
In the Senate, concerns about the bill are broad, though not likely to doom the legislation. Northeastern Democrats say it would badly shortchange safety grants for commuter railroads, so much so that the railroads most likely would not be able to meet the federal deadline to put an automatic speed control system on passenger trains.
In a letter to fellow Democrats, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said that he wanted more limits on allowing semi trucks to haul twin 33-foot trailers on the nation's highways, and that he would press to require used car dealers to fix defective Takata airbags before reselling automobiles.
A separate fight is looming over the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that gives government loan guarantees to foreign customers of United States exporters. A bipartisan group of at least 65 senators has vowed to reopen the bank. But three of the Republican presidential candidates, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Paul and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, have banded together to try to block that effort. They do not have the votes, but they can stretch out the fight.
The biggest problem might be the House, which is supposed to leave for its August recess on July 30. Last week, the House passed a five-month patch to the highway trust fund, hoping to keep pressure on Congress to pass a rewrite of the corporate tax code by the end of the year. That business tax overhaul would include a measure to tax overseas corporate earnings to fund a huge infrastructure program, a plan high on ambition and backed by President Obama.
House leaders said they would "closely review the emerging agreement announced in the Senate," but they made it clear that they liked their approach better.
Mr. Reid was more blunt: "I don't think there's a chance in the world they're going to take up this bill."

Abstract: [...]the economy of neighboring Russia, with which Finland has deep trade ties, has collapsed because of plummeting oil prices and Western sanctions. Because Finland has used the euro since its inception, the value of its currency cannot adjust in ways that would cushion the overall Finnish economy from those shocks. In his telling, the integration with Western Europe -- of which the euro currency is a crucial element -- deepened trade and diplomatic relations, making Finland both more powerful on the world stage and its industries better connected to the rest of the global economy.

Full text:   ESPOO, Finland -- Finland is, in many ways, the anti-Greece.
Like Greece, it is geographically far from the core Western European powers of Britain, France and Germany. And like Greece, it uses the euro currency. But unlike Greece, it is a model of sound governance and responsible use of debt.
Yet Finland's economy is also not doing so great, with an 11.8 percent unemployment rate and with contracting G.D.P. in each of the last three years.
A number of American commentators have looked at Finland's current economic troubles as a clear sign that what ails the eurozone is far deeper than profligate spending by the Greeks. Paul Krugman has made that case at The New York Times, Tim Worstall at Forbes and Matt O'Brien at The Washington Post.
Alexander Stubb, the Finnish finance minister, thinks they're wrong. I brought this up with him Sunday at a waterside restaurant in Espoo, the Helsinki suburb where he lives. His comments -- a vigorous defense of what the euro has done for Finland -- help explain why elite opinion about the euro is so different on the two sides of the Atlantic.
There are three main causes of Finland's economic weakness. Nokia has gone from the world's largest mobile phone maker to an afterthought, costing thousands of Finnish jobs and many more when its supply network is counted. Demand for paper, another major export, has fallen. And the economy of neighboring Russia, with which Finland has deep trade ties, has collapsed because of plummeting oil prices and Western sanctions.
Because Finland has used the euro since its inception, the value of its currency cannot adjust in ways that would cushion the overall Finnish economy from those shocks. If Finland still had its old currency, the markka, it would have fallen in value on international markets. Suddenly other Finnish industries would have had a huge cost advantage over, say, German competitors, and they would have grown and created the jobs to help make up for those lost because of Nokia and the paper industry and Russian trade.
"Rubbish," Mr. Stubb said. To evaluate the euro, you can't just look at what he calls a current "rough patch" for the Finnish economy. You have to look at a longer time horizon. In his telling, the integration with Western Europe -- of which the euro currency is a crucial element -- deepened trade and diplomatic relations, making Finland both more powerful on the world stage and its industries better connected to the rest of the global economy. That made its people richer.
"In the early 1990s in the middle of a Finnish banking crisis and economic depression, we were a top 30 country in the world in per capita G.D.P.," he said. "Then we opened up; we became members of the E.U. Now we're always up there in G.D.P. per capita or whatever other measure you look at with Sweden, Denmark, Australia and Canada."
As to whether the ability to devalue its currency would help deal with the current economic downturn, Mr. Stubb is similarly skeptical. "Devaluation is a little like doping in sports," he said. "It gives you perhaps a short-term boost, but in the long run, it's not beneficial. Just like anyone else, we need structural reform, structural adjustment; we need to increase our competitiveness, and a little bit of luck."
Looking at the numbers, does Mr. Stubb have a point? It really is the case that Finland was an astounding success story from the time it joined the euro to the onset of the global financial crisis. Its inflation-adjusted per-capita G.D.P. rose 33 percent from 1998 to 2008, compared with 17 percent in both Germany and the United States.
It is also the case that the last several years have been harder on Finland than on other advanced economies, with real per-capita G.D.P. having fallen 8 percent from 2008 to 2014 (Germany is up 5 percent; the United States is up 4 percent).
So just as the Finland story from 1998 to 2008 is something wonderful to behold, it has also underperformed other advanced economies badly since the crisis. Being locked in a currency with larger and economically stronger Germany probably is an important part of the reason.
Of course, correlation is not causation. Maybe the Finnish economy did so well from 1998 to 2008 not because of the euro and broader European integration, but because it was a well-governed nation with industrious workers that was poised to rise to the top of the league tables of global income regardless. This is in the realm of things that are hard to prove in any definitive way, but the case that the euro was crucial isn't without merit.
At the same time, you can see in the debate over the Finnish economy a broader divide between the American thinking about economics and how European leaders process their continent's economic woes.
The Europeans are thinking about the long run, and what the euro and the broader integration it symbolizes will do for Europe's potential. Many of us who write about economics every day are looking at the cyclical ups and downs, and want to see policies that are effective at smoothing them out.
The euro has not shown itself to be very good at helping the economies that use it stay on an even keel. Whether it has been good at driving long-term growth is a more subjective judgment. The answer may depend on whether the vantage point is an office in Washington or New York, or a waterside restaurant in Espoo.

Full text:   Marvel's quirky "Ant-Man" over the weekend provided a told-you-so moment for supporters (Marvel can do no wrong) and naysayers (the movie is about ... ants), while Amy Schumer and "Trainwreck" demonstrated the increasing power of female ticket buyers at the box office.
"Ant-Man," starring Paul Rudd as a tiny superhero who can control ant behavior, was easily the No. 1 movie in the United States and Canada, taking in about $58 million -- Marvel's 12th consecutive first-place opening. Overseas, the 3-D movie, which received strong reviews, took in an additional $56.4 million.
But "Ant-Man," which cost Disney-owned Marvel an estimated $130 million to make, also delivered the lowest opening total in North America for any movie directly produced by Kevin Feige, Marvel's president. After adjusting for inflation, "The Incredible Hulk" took in $61.4 million in 2008.
"Minions" (Universal) was second, collecting $50.2 million, for a two-week domestic total of $216.7 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data.
"Trainwreck," starring and written by Ms. Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, generated roughly $30.2 million in ticket sales. That total exceeded prerelease expectations of box-office analysts by several million dollars, affirming Ms. Schumer as an ascending movie star. "Trainwreck" received strong reviews, and it cost roughly $35 million to make.
While very strong compared with other R-rated comedies anchored by female stars -- Melissa McCarthy's "Spy" arrived to $29.1 million in ticket sales in June -- "Trainwreck" did not set a record for Mr. Apatow. His raunchy "Knocked Up" collected an initial $35.3 million in 2007, after adjusting for inflation.
Universal said on Sunday that an estimated 66 percent of "Trainwreck" ticket buyers were female. Hollywood has recently begun aiming more films at women or girls, finding success with movies like "Maleficent," "Fifty Shades of Grey," "The Divergent Series: Insurgent," "Pitch Perfect 2" and, now, "Trainwreck."

Full text:   When it comes to elections, fundamentals matter. A lot.
A wide range of political science research suggests that if you want to know who will win the presidency, the state of the economy -- and especially how economic conditions are changing -- matters a great deal, perhaps even more than how charismatic the candidates are or how much money they raise.
The election is 16 months away, but knowing what we know now, what should we expect the economic backdrop to be when Americans choose their next president?
To answer that question, The Times asked leading forecasters from economic consultancies, financial firms and universities for their predictions on where key economic variables will stand on Nov. 8, 2016 -- Election Day. The 17 who participated replied with a relatively strong consensus.
They said they believed that unemployment would be the lowest it has been during an election since George W. Bush and Al Gore faced off in 2000, when it stood at 3.9 percent. The median forecast for the unemployment rate when voters go to the polls in November 2016 was 4.8 percent (which would be down from 5.3 percent last month). They saw only a 15 percent chance of a recession starting by next Election Day. Interest rates, inflation and gasoline prices should all be a bit higher than they are now, they said, while staying quite low by historical standards.
"All in all, I'd guess it should be as close to a feel-good time as any we've seen in the past several years," said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.
On its face, all of that points to an election with dynamics similar to 1988 or 2000, when the nominee of the incumbent party (George H. W. Bush in 1988 and Mr. Gore in 2000) could promise continued prosperity. That bodes well for the Democratic nominee, though as Mr. Gore's loss despite winning the popular vote shows, even a favorable economy doesn't assure victory, given the workings of the Electoral College.
"On Election Day November 2016, voters should be feeling quite a bit better about where they stand economically and looking at their economic future a bit more optimistically," said Scott Anderson, chief economist of Bank of the West.
In the voluminous research on the connection between economic performance and election outcomes, one important finding is that what matters is less an absolute level of economic activity or the unemployment rate, and more the speed and direction of economic change. That might explain, for example, why President Obama was re-elected in 2012 despite a 7.8 percent unemployment rate on Election Day. That is a poor number historically, but it was down from 8.6 percent a year earlier.
Some research has found that the economy matters less when the race for the presidency is wide open, as it will be in 2016, than when there is an incumbent on the ballot for whom the vote can be viewed as a referendum. In other words, if Hillary Rodham Clinton is the Democratic nominee, she probably won't own President Obama's economic successes and failures to the degree the president himself did in 2012.
The forecasters' projections also point to a soft underbelly in the economy that the Republican nominee could exploit.
Their consensus was 2.8 percent growth in average hourly wages in the 12 months before the election, slightly higher than the 2 percent rise in prices. That implies that the weak spot of the Obama economy, in compensation for ordinary workers, will remain that way heading into 2016.
The forecasters saw only a 25 percent chance of an economic boom -- defined as G.D.P. growth greater than 3 percent maintained for a year -- happening between now and Election Day. This slow-moving expansion generally hasn't resulted in the kind of explosive growth that was seen in the late Reagan or late Clinton administrations, and there's a slim chance of that changing soon.
It's against that backdrop that Jeb Bush and other Republican contenders have pledged to attain 4 percent annual economic growth; if they can pull it off, that would be a step up from the roughly 2.5 percent that has been typical of the Obama years.
Sustained growth of 4 percent or greater has been seen only rarely in American history, most recently from 1997-2000 and 1983-5. And those years had more favorable demographic trends driving that growth than the coming presidential administration is likely to encounter.
That helps explain why forecasters' consensus was 2.8 percent G.D.P. growth in the year before the election, and why they were skeptical that 4 percent growth would prove attainable.
"The 4 percent G.D.P. goal of some candidates is unrealistic with the baby boom generational wave retiring and spending less," said Christopher Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
The forecasters could be wrong, of course. Surveys of economic prognosticators in the past have shown plenty of mistakes, including failing to predict the severity of the 2008-9 recession and offering overly optimistic projections during the sluggish recovery.
On the side of pessimism, forecasters failed to predict the economic acceleration of the late 1990s.
In elections that have been dominated by shifts in the economic winds, there tended to be evidence of what was to come by this point in the cycle. The subprime mortgage crisis that would spiral into a recession that characterized the 2008 election was well underway by July 2007, with foreclosures mounting. Though a recession in July 1991 had technically ended by Election Day 1992, the rebound was not swift enough to secure re-election for the first President Bush.
The forecasters, who were surveyed in early July, identified a number of threats that might undermine their forecasts of sunny economic skies in late 2016.
The Greek debt crisis was mentioned often, though the potential ripple effects for the United States economy appear much weaker than they did a few years ago when Greece's position in the eurozone was first at risk. They mentioned the possibility of a Middle East crisis causing an oil shock, and a Chinese economic slowdown that seemed plausible given a recent sharp sell-off in its stock market. But the economic threat that the forecasters mentioned most often -- the Federal Reserve raising interest rates -- would be driven by domestic policy.
If the Fed moves too quickly to raise interest rates, it could have any number of adverse effects: potentially stomping on the housing recovery, undermining exports by strengthening the dollar or causing dangerous volatility in financial markets.
The consensus of the forecasters was that the Fed's target interest rate would be 1.37 percent on Election Day 2016; the consensus of Fed officials themselves was that the rate would be 1.625 percent at the end of 2016. (Those views aren't mutually inconsistent, as there could be a rate increase in December after the election.) In effect, rates have been so low for so long that forecasters lacked confidence about exactly how robust an economic expansion would be in the face of tighter money.
Still, the forecasters said that they thought the Fed would move cautiously enough that incumbents could breathe easier than they have in years.
"Odds are good that by Election Day the economy will be at full employment, growing strongly," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "The economic winds will be at the back of incumbents."

Full text:   When people learn that I have spent many years writing about the Federal Reserve, there is almost always one question I get: Are mortgage rates going up or down?
It's understandable why a person might think that the way to understand where mortgage rates are going -- and thus whether to lock in a home loan now, or refinance, or whatever major borrowing decision he or she is facing -- is to know what is going on inside the brain of Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, and her colleagues. It's also ... wrong.
For most people, trying to parse the intentions of the Fed should play nearly no role in a decision of when to take out a mortgage or other loan. You should make your borrowing decisions based on current market rates and whether they make a given home purchase or refinancing decision affordable or not. Assume that neither you, nor your mortgage broker, nor your Uncle Ned, who watches a lot of Wall Street sharpies on CNBC, has any predictive capacity to know whether rates will be higher or lower a month from now.
Why would this be? Doesn't the Fed set interest rates? Well, yes. But there are a lot of complexities that stand between that basic fact and the reality of what it will cost you to take out a home loan.
The Fed indeed sets a target for overnight bank lending rates, and buys and sells securities in order to keep market rates at that level. It has kept that rate near zero since the end of 2008, and is now making noises about raising it later this year, perhaps as soon as September.
That's all well and good, but there are two things to remember. 1) Mortgages are usually based on long-term interest rates, not short-term interest rates, and 2) The Fed is not on some preordained path; rather, its policy will adjust depending on how the economy evolves.
The first point is crucial. When lenders make you a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, they are essentially making a bet on the value of money for quite a long time. And in practice, that rate is set not by the whims of the banker at your local strip mall, but by the $21 trillion global bond market.
No matter whom you deal with for the mechanics of your mortgage, in other words, the rate you pay is ultimately set by asset managers, hedge funds, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and countless other players who are buying and selling securities in hopes of getting the best deal. In effect, if you try to time your mortgage decision based on a hunch about the future direction of rates, you are betting that you have outsmarted the entire global bond market!
There's no doubt that the Fed's immediate plans factor into bond prices and hence the interest rate you pay for your mortgage. But it is a safe bet that people at BlackRock and Pimco and the Investment Corporation of Dubai, with hundreds of billions of dollars on the line, have spent a lot more time and brainpower thinking about what the Fed is going to do than you can possibly hope to.
By the time you see people on cable television or in the newspapers debating when the Fed is going to raise rates, it is a safe bet that those probabilities are already priced into the market.
That's not to say markets are already priced exactly right. If they were, we wouldn't see the kinds of swings in bond markets we have this year. It's just that consistently predicting in what direction they are wrong is extraordinarily difficult, so much so that the people who pull it off become billionaires.
In short, I have met many elite fixed-income managers. If you think you have outsmarted them, you are probably wrong.
But it's not just that in trying to outsmart the bond market you are betting against the most sophisticated investors on the planet. It's also that many, many factors go into setting longer-term bond prices -- and hence mortgage rates -- beyond the outlook for Fed policy in the near future.
Among those factors, in no particular order: inflationary pressures now and in the future; long-term deficits (and hence debt issuance) by the United States government; future bond issuance by other governments and companies with excellent credit; long-term demand for safe assets; long-term economic growth in the United States and abroad; how the American government reforms (or doesn't reform) the government-sponsored mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and, whew, the evolving role of the dollar as global reserve currency.
Those are all things that the Fed has little or no control over, and they all are as important, and arguably more important, to any forecast of what mortgage rates should be as when the Fed does its first rate increases.
Because there is so much uncertainty over all of those factors, Fed insiders don't even agree on what their short-term interest rate should be at the end of next year. Their predictions range from under half a percent to about 3 percent, a range that implies significantly different expectations for American and global growth and inflation trends. Fed officials themselves have no idea how quickly they will raise rates. It's a fool's errand to think that you do.
So how should people make the decision on whether to take out or refinance a mortgage, if not by parsing Ms. Yellen's speeches? By taking a deep breath, and running the calculations to decide whether they are better off taking action at current prices or not.
That doesn't mean you'll necessarily get it right. But sometimes even the most knowledgeable people about Fed policy get it wrong. I know of a guy whose insights into the Fed are better than almost anybody else's. He refinanced his mortgage on a house in Washington in 2011, getting a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4.25 percent.
He should have waited a year. By late 2012, average rates were almost a full percentage point lower. But by then Ben Bernanke was stuck with his higher mortgage rate, and, presumably, a bit of regret.

Abstract: The impact of those job gains and the unemployment rate dropping to 5.3 percent has surfaced in housing, where demand is outpacing the supply of homes and creating more pressure to build houses and apartments.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Builders in the United States broke ground on apartment complexes last month at the fastest pace in nearly 28 years as developers anticipated that recent jobs gains would create a wave of renters. Also in June, rising gasoline prices pushed inflation up modestly, leaving overall consumer prices higher than they were a year earlier for the first time since December.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that housing starts in June climbed 9.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million homes. All of that growth came from a 28.6 percent surge in multifamily housing that put apartment construction at its highest rate since November 1987. Starts for single-family houses slipped 0.9 percent last month.
The gains show that what had been a sluggish construction sector is now running on economic adrenaline. Strong job growth and a rebounding economy have increased the numbers of buyers and renters searching for homes, while gradually rising mortgage rates have spurred homeowners to complete deals.
"The residential market recovery is here, and it is strong and sustainable," said Peter Ciganik, managing director at the real estate investor GTIS Partners.
Housing starts increased 35.3 percent in the Northeast because of apartments, while climbing 13.5 percent in the South. Home construction slumped in the Midwest and West in June.
Nationwide, housing starts have risen 10.9 percent year-to-date.
Over the last 12 months, employers have added 2.9 million jobs, meaning there are that many more people with paychecks to spend across the broader economy. The impact of those job gains and the unemployment rate dropping to 5.3 percent has surfaced in housing, where demand is outpacing the supply of homes and creating more pressure to build houses and apartments.
The market for new homes for sale had just 4.5 months of supply in May, compared with six months in a healthy market.
But the financial distress has also left more Americans renting instead of owning, creating a need for more apartments. The share of Americans owning homes has fallen so far this year to a seasonally adjusted 63.8 percent, the lowest level since 1989.
Approved building permits increased 7.4 percent to an annual rate of 1.34 million in June, the highest level since July 2007. The bulk of that increase came for apartment complexes, while permits for houses last month rose just 0.9 percent.
Also on Friday, the Labor Department said that its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month. Prices at the gas pump rose 3.4 percent in June on top of a 10.4 percent increase in May. An outbreak of avian flu drove egg prices up 18.3 percent in June, but overall food prices rose just 0.3 percent. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation was 0.2 percent last month.
Overall consumer prices rose just 0.1 percent the last year; core prices are up 1.8 percent. Gasoline prices are down 23.3 percent over the last year; they hit bottom in January, then rebounded.

Full text:   After a strong week, the stock market could manage only a small gain on Friday.
But a few companies made big moves. Among the biggest, Google surged more than 16 percent a day after reporting strong results, pushing the Nasdaq to another nominal high.
It was a quiet end to an eventful week. Markets around the world rallied on Monday after Greece and its creditors agreed to a broad framework for a new loan program. Stronger quarterly earnings reports from a range of major companies in the United States, including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, added encouragement.
"It appears the sky is clearing," said Linda A. Duessel, senior equity strategist at Federated Investors.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 2.35 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,126.64. The broad market measure finished the week with a gain of 2.4 percent, its best performance in four months.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 46.96 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,210.14, closing out its best week in nine months. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 33.80 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,086.45.
Google's shares jumped after it reported quarterly earnings on Thursday that topped analyst estimates for the first time since late 2013. On Friday, Class A shares of Google gained $97.84, or 16 percent, to close at $699.62, leaving the company with a market value of about $469 billion, a distant second among American companies to Apple's $747 billion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
On paper, it translated to an additional $65.1 billion in wealth for Google's shareholders. Not adjusting for inflation, that barely topped the one-day gain of $65 billion in 2000 by Cisco Systems, the computer networking equipment maker, after a steep drop in the previous week, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The enthusiasm also buoyed shares of Etsy, which was briefly praised during Google's call with analysts. Etsy jumped more than 30 percent to close at $21.98.
Shares of Mattel fell 3.3 percent after the company reported a second-quarter loss, as another decline in Barbie sales and a strong dollar cut into revenue.
Hertz's stock jumped 12 percent after it completed some financial restatements and increased its annual cost savings expectations to $300 million from $200 million. The filings mean Hertz is up-to-date with the S.E.C., as well as listing requirements for the New York Exchange
The markets in Europe finished mixed after rallying earlier this week. Germany's DAX lost 0.4 percent, while France's CAC edged up 0.1 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.3 percent.
In the U.S., bond prices barely moved, leaving the 10-year Treasury note at 2.35 percent. The dollar dropped to 124.04 yen while rising to $1.0838 for every euro.
In commodities trading, precious and industrial metals sank. Gold fell $12 to settle at $1,131.80 an ounce, while silver sank 15 cents, to $14.92 an ounce. Copper fell 3 cents, to $2.50 a pound.
Benchmark United States crude oil fell 3 cents to close at $51.21 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 18 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London.
In other trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline rose 3.2 cents to close at $1.929 a gallon; heating oil fell 0.2 cent to close at $1.664 a gallon; and natural gas increased 1.6 cents to close at $2.870 per 1,000 cubic feet.

BBC, a Target of Conservatives, Faces a Review of Its Mission

Abstract: Some believe that the BBC currently has become much more than a broadcaster -- running a news service on the web that rivals newspapers, for example -- and competing too avidly with private companies to create popular entertainment of the lowest common denominator, both on radio and television, while paying its top talent salaries that dwarf those of the most senior government officials.

Full text:   LONDON -- The Conservative government in Britain has set its sights on remaking the BBC, the broadcaster supported by a national license fee, after a political campaign in which the Conservatives complained that the BBC's news coverage has a left-wing bias.
On Thursday, the government's secretary of state for culture, media and sport, John Whittingdale, presented a "green paper" to Parliament, the opening of a comprehensive study of the BBC's future, suggesting that the corporation could become smaller, less costly and less competitive with British newspapers and private television channels.
The BBC, which is currently financed by an annual payment of 145.50 pounds, or $227.50, from nearly every household that owns a color television or that can watch television in real time, is up for its 10-year charter review next year. Mr. Whittingdale, a known critic of the corporation, said he wanted to examine the nature, funding, reach and governance of the corporation, considered one of the finest, if not necessarily the most efficient, broadcasting networks in the world.
"With so much more choice in what to consume and how to consume it, we must at least question whether the BBC should try to be all things to all people, to serve everyone over every platform or if it should have a more precisely targeted mission," Mr. Whittingdale told Parliament.
The review would look at how the BBC is financed, the scale of its output and whether it needs tougher oversight by a new regulatory body, replacing the much-criticized BBC Trust, he said. It would also include a period of consultation with the public.
The fight is ideological and philosophical, as well as political. The BBC was founded more than 90 years ago as a state broadcaster with a mission to "inform, educate and entertain." Some believe that the BBC currently has become much more than a broadcaster -- running a news service on the web that rivals newspapers, for example -- and competing too avidly with private companies to create popular entertainment of the lowest common denominator, both on radio and television, while paying its top talent salaries that dwarf those of the most senior government officials.
There have also been parliamentary hearings into large severance packages the corporation awarded to senior management in what was meant to be an effort at cost-cutting.
Those on the right believe that the BBC is biased toward London and the left. Many on both the left and the right believe that the BBC is too afraid to offend anyone and takes "political correctness" to an absurd degree.
In other words, critics believe that "Auntie," as the BBC is sometimes affectionately known, should stick to her knitting -- documentaries, middlebrow programming, "objective" broadcast news, filling niche segments and gaps in the market that profit-driven companies would never bother to fill.
Or as Mr. Whittingdale suggested, "The BBC, as a public institution, should not have the same imperatives as commercial companies, such as trying to maximize audience share." He distinguished between programs the BBC itself creates and those it competes with other companies to buy, like "The Voice," a singing talent show, in order to counter a similar program on the private network ITV and improve ratings.
Others, of course, believe that competition from the BBC produces better programming and content all around.
But there is no question that the BBC is a huge operation, employing close to 19,000 people and with an annual budget of about £4.8 billion ($7.5 billion).
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, noted that the BBC News website "is a good product, but it is becoming a bit more imperial in its ambitions," he said, "crowding out national newspapers." Most of Britain's newspapers are on the right and support the Conservatives, and have complained about the BBC's move into nonbroadcast news reporting.
As for financing, with the increase in people watching television programs after broadcast on devices that are not televisions, like computers and smartphones or tablets, the government wants to study whether the current license fee should remain and increase with inflation, or whether there should be a subscription model, or some hybrid. For instance, the BBC is proud of its iPlayer, which allows viewers to see programs already broadcast for a set period of time without cost; some suggest that the BBC should charge for such broadcasts, as iTunes does.
Another idea in the green paper is for a core BBC that is free and a premium BBC that is paid. Another is that the license fee simply be applied to every household as a universal levy.
There has already been a major controversy over a deal that the BBC should pay for license fees for anyone older than 75, a bill previously pushed by the government and estimated at £750 million, or $1.1 billion -- a boon to the government and a real-term cut to BBC funding of between 10 percent and 15 percent.
Tony Hall, the director general of the BBC, went along with the idea in return, he said, for assurances that the license fee would remain and would increase in line with inflation -- it has been unchanged since 2010. For those so inclined, the license for a black and white television costs only £49 ($77).
But Mr. Hall has been criticized for giving up too much to the government by agreeing to absorb part of the state's budget, and committing to spending that the corporation cannot control in an aging population. Mr. Hall has defended the deal as necessary and said he would ask older citizens who can afford the license fee to pay it regardless.
As for the larger changes suggested in the green paper, the BBC said in a statement that it would fight them, while praising itself as "a creative and economic powerhouse for Britain." The green paper, the BBC said, "would appear to herald a much diminished, less popular, BBC. That would be bad for Britain and would not be the BBC that the public has known and loved for over 90 years."
As part of its defense, the BBC admitted to having organized a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron against any changes from some well-known actors and personalities, including Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, J.K. Rowling, Mark Rylance and David Attenborough. The letter called the broadcaster "the envy of the world" and said, "A diminished BBC would simply mean a diminished Britain."
The government has also criticized the BBC's commercial ventures, including BBC Worldwide, which sells programs abroad. But Mr. Hall argued that it made the corporation £226.5 million ($354 million) last year.
The government has appointed a panel of eight people to work on the renewal of the BBC's charter. Some of the group come from commercial broadcasting, and the former chairman of the BBC Trust, Christopher Patten, called the panel "a team of assistant gravediggers" appointed to help Mr. Whittingdale "bury the BBC that we love."

Full text:   Hillary Clinton gave her first big economic speech on Monday, and progressives were by and large gratified. For Mrs. Clinton's core message was that the federal government can and should use its influence to push for higher wages.
Conservatives, however -- at least those who could stop chanting "Benghazi! Benghazi! Benghazi!" long enough to pay attention -- seemed bemused. They believe that Ronald Reagan proved that government is the problem, not the solution. So wasn't Mrs. Clinton just reviving defunct "paleoliberalism"? And don't we know that government intervention in markets produces terrible side effects?
No, she wasn't, and no, we don't. In fact, Mrs. Clinton's speech reflected major changes, deeply grounded in evidence, in our understanding of what determines wages. And a key implication of that new understanding is that public policy can do a lot to help workers without bringing down the wrath of the invisible hand.
Many economists used to think of the labor market as being pretty much like the market for anything else, with the prices of different kinds of labor -- that is, wage rates -- fully determined by supply and demand. So if wages for many workers have stagnated or declined, it must be because demand for their services is falling.
In particular, the conventional wisdom attributed rising inequality to technological change, which was raising the demand for highly educated workers while devaluing blue-collar work. And there was nothing much policy could do to change the trend, other than aiding low-wage workers via subsidies like the earned-income tax credit.
You still see commentators who haven't kept up invoking this story as if it were obviously true. But the case for "skill-biased technological change" as the main driver of wage stagnation has largely fallen apart. Most notably, high levels of education have offered no guarantee of rising incomes -- for example, wages of recent college graduates, adjusted for inflation, have been flat for 15 years.
Meanwhile, our understanding of wage determination has been transformed by an intellectual revolution -- that's not too strong a word -- brought on by a series of remarkable studies of what happens when governments change the minimum wage.
More than two decades ago the economists David Card and Alan Krueger realized that when an individual state raises its minimum wage rate, it in effect performs an experiment on the labor market. Better still, it's an experiment that offers a natural control group: neighboring states that don't raise their minimum wages. Mr. Card and Mr. Krueger applied their insight by looking at what happened to the fast-food sector -- which is where the effects of the minimum wage should be most pronounced -- after New Jersey hiked its minimum wage but Pennsylvania did not.
Until the Card-Krueger study, most economists, myself included, assumed that raising the minimum wage would have a clear negative effect on employment. But they found, if anything, a positive effect. Their result has since been confirmed using data from many episodes. There's just no evidence that raising the minimum wage costs jobs, at least when the starting point is as low as it is in modern America.
How can this be? There are several answers, but the most important is probably that the market for labor isn't like the market for, say, wheat, because workers are people. And because they're people, there are important benefits, even to the employer, from paying them more: better morale, lower turnover, increased productivity. These benefits largely offset the direct effect of higher labor costs, so that raising the minimum wage needn't cost jobs after all.
The direct takeaway from this intellectual revolution is, of course, that we should raise minimum wages. But there are broader implications, too: Once you take what we've learned from minimum-wage studies seriously, you realize that they're not relevant just to the lowest-paid workers.
For employers always face a trade-off between low-wage and higher-wage strategies -- between, say, the traditional Walmart model of paying as little as possible and accepting high turnover and low morale, and the Costco model of higher pay and benefits leading to a more stable work force. And there's every reason to believe that public policy can, in a variety of ways -- including making it easier for workers to organize -- encourage more firms to choose the good-wage strategy.
So there was a lot more behind Hillary's speech than I suspect most commentators realized. And for those trying to play gotcha by pointing out that some of what she said differed from ideas that prevailed when her husband was president, well, many liberals have changed their views in response to new evidence. It's an interesting experience; conservatives should try it some time.

4-Day Rally Ends on Falling Oil and Anxiety Over Greece

Abstract: The stock market edged a hair lower Wednesday, ending a four-day rally, as a drop in energy shares and anxiety over Greece outweighed encouraging earnings reports from banks.

Full text:   The stock market edged a hair lower Wednesday, ending a four-day rally, as a drop in energy shares and anxiety over Greece outweighed encouraging earnings reports from banks.
Energy stocks slumped with the price of oil after a report showed that a drop in United States supplies last week was less than expected.
The market's pause follows strong gains. Stocks have surged in the last week as a slump abated in China's stock market and a deal was reached on a possible bailout for Greece.
Greece's agreement with its creditors still requires approval by the country's lawmakers. As investors waited for a vote in the nation's Parliament, protesters in Athens clashed with police. The protesters want an end to the harsh austerity measures demanded by Greece's creditors in exchange for more loans.
"You come in some days and it looks like it's all clear and that Greece has been resolved, and the next day it hasn't," said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager with John Hancock Asset Management.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged down 1.55 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,107.40. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 3.41 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,050.17. The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,098.94.
The market started the day higher after encouraging second-quarter results from banks, including Bank of America. The bank said its profit more than doubled thanks to lower legal bills. It also said an increase in deposits, lower expenses and an improving balance sheet helped offset a decline in revenue.
Bank of America rose 55 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $17.68.
There was economic data to sift. The Federal Reserve said U.S. factory production was unchanged for a second straight month in June as a sharp drop in auto manufacturing was offset by greater output of furniture and chemicals.
The cutback in auto production comes after three months of healthy gains and is probably temporary. Still, manufacturers are struggling to overcome several challenges, including a strong dollar, weak overseas growth, and cheaper oil.
The Fed said that overall industrial production -- which includes mining output and utilities, as well as manufacturing -- rose 0.3 percent, the best showing since November. Mining, which includes oil and gas wells, rose 1 percent, as oil output increased. Utility output jumped 1.5 percent, the most since February, as people ramped up air conditioning in the summer.
Also Wednesday, the Labor Department said that its producer price index increased 0.4 percent in June, another sign that inflation remains tame.
Producer prices have fallen 0.7 percent over the past 12 months due to lower oil and gasoline costs. Core prices, which exclude energy and food, rose 0.3 percent in June.
Fed officials are monitoring measures of inflation as they weigh whether to raise a key short-term interest rate. The central bank's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, gave an indication of those plans Wednesday when she appeared before the House Financial Services Committee.
Ms. Yellen told Congress she saw encouraging signs that the economy was reviving after a harsh winter. If the improvements continue, she said, policy makers will most likely start raising interest rates later this year. The Fed has kept its benchmark rate near zero since December 2008, pushing up bond and stock prices.
Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial, said Ms. Yellen was flagging the possibility of higher rates so as not to surprise investors when the Fed does eventually lift them.
"That's the last thing she wants to do," Ms. Krosby said. "That's why we have to pay attention when she says" that a rate increase is on the table.
Among individual stocks, Macy's was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500. The stock jumped 7.9 percent on reports that the activist investment firm Starboard Value had said Macy's could raise its share price by spinning off its real estate into a separate company.
In energy trading, benchmark United States crude fell $1.63, or 3 percent, to close at $51.41 a barrel, as a report on supplies showed a smaller-than-expected decline last week. The price of oil has fallen 13 percent this month.
Oil has come under further pressure after Iran reached a nuclear deal with world powers. That paves the way for sanctions on the country to be lifted, allowing Iran to export oil and add to a glut in global supply.
In government bond trading, prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.36 percent from 2.40 percent on Tuesday.
The dollar rose to 123.78 yen from 123.35 yen. The euro was down slightly to $1.0950 from $1.1010.
In metals trading, silver fell 27 cents to $15.03 an ounce. Gold dropped $6.10 to $1,147.40 an ounce. Copper declined 1.4 cents to $2.53 a pound.
In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gas fell 7 cents to close at $1.86 a gallon; heating oil slipped 5.6 cents to close at $1.67 a gallon; and natural gas rose 8 cents to $2.92 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Full text:   SINKING SPRING, Pa. -- As the end of each month nears, Megan Short frets. Her 1-year-old daughter, Willow, cannot afford to miss even a single dose of a drug she takes daily to prevent her body from rejecting her transplanted heart.
Because of stringent rules from her drug plan and the pharmacy she is required to use, Ms. Short cannot order a refill until her monthly supply is three-quarters gone. Yet processing a refill takes about seven days, making it touch and go whether the new shipment will arrive before the old one runs out.
"You just feel like every month, you're hoping that they don't mess it up," said Ms. Short, who lives in this town about 70 miles northwest of Philadelphia.
Ms. Short is not dealing with her corner drugstore but with a so-called specialty pharmacy, a new breed of drug dispensary that has arisen to handle the exploding number of medicines that cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and are used to treat complex or rare diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia and H.I.V.
Such specialty medications, as they are called, now account for one-third of all spending on drugs in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2004 and heading toward 50 percent in the next 10 years, according to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions.
The trend has led to a corresponding boom in the specialty pharmacy business, which by one estimate grew to $78 billion in sales last year from $20 billion in 2005. Insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, hospitals, retail drugstores -- even supermarkets -- are scrambling to start or acquire specialty pharmacies or to expand the ones they have.
And the pharmacies have an alluring pitch: They promise to help save health plans money by teaching patients how to inject their medicines when necessary, helping them deal with side effects and ensuring the drugs are not wasted. Some studies, usually paid for by the pharmacies themselves, show that patients served by specialty pharmacies are more likely to keep taking their medicines and have better health outcomes than those dealing with a retail pharmacy.
"We generally find that people have high satisfaction rates with any specialty pharmacy, and a lot of that is because they're getting very hands-on, personalized care," said Dr. Alan M. Lotvin, an executive vice president at CVS Health, whose specialty pharmacy Ms. Short uses.
But as specialty pharmacies proliferate, questions are emerging about their role and business practices.
Interviews with patients, patient advocates and doctors suggest that specialty pharmacies do not always live up to their billing. There can be onerous refill policies that require hours on the phone, shipments that are delayed or error-ridden, and difficulty reaching a pharmacist or other representatives.
Moreover, many patients are limited to one specialty pharmacy -- often one owned by their insurer or pharmacy benefit manager and requiring delivery of drugs by mail. That leaves patients without options if they are dissatisfied.
Consumer Watchdog, a consumer advocate group, has sued four insurance companies over their policies of restricting the pharmacies that patients can use to obtain drugs for H.I.V. Three of the companies -- Anthem Blue Cross of California, UnitedHealthcare and Aetna -- have since changed their policies to provide more options for H.I.V. patients. The most recent of the lawsuits, against Cigna, was filed in April.
There are also questions of potential conflicts of interest, since many of the bigger specialty pharmacies are owned by insurers or pharmacy benefit managers like CVS and Express Scripts. Pharmacy benefit managers, or P.B.M.s, are supposed to help health plans control drug costs. But will they have the zeal to do that if they are making money dispensing these expensive medicines?
"Forcing people to use a P.B.M.'s own specialty pharmacy creates a situation where the fox is guarding the henhouse," said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington. He represents independent specialty pharmacies, some of which claim that insurers and pharmacy benefit managers funnel business to their own pharmacies, even if others may provide better service.
Yet another issue is that some drug companies are choosing only a few specialty pharmacies to handle their products. That could give pharmacies an incentive to position themselves as allies of the manufacturer more than of the patient or health plan.
Federal prosecutors are seeking as much as $3.3 billion in a whistle-blower lawsuit against the drug maker Novartis, saying it provided financial incentives to specialty pharmacies to keep patients on two of its drugs, or to switch them to a Novartis drug. The prosecutors say that nurses hired by the specialty pharmacies to call patients read scripts that neglected to mention certain serious side effects of one of the drugs, Exjade, which is used to treat iron overload in the blood.
Accredo, the specialty pharmacy owned by Express Scripts, agreed in April to pay $60 million to settle civil fraud charges in this matter. BioScrip, a smaller specialty pharmacy, settled previously for $15 million. Novartis disputes the charges, saying incentives were to help the pharmacies do a better job in patient care, one aspect of which is to help patients stay on their medicines. It says that doctors, not the pharmacies, decide which drugs patients should get and how long they should take them.
Diplomat Pharmacy provides a glimpse into the explosive growth and financial workings of the industry because, unlike many specialty pharmacies, it is publicly traded and not part of a bigger company. Started as a single drugstore in Flint, Mich., in 1975, Diplomat now is a nationwide business with $2.2 billion in revenue last year and a stock price that has nearly quadrupled since its initial public offering in October.
The average prescription Diplomat fills cost nearly $2,800 in 2014, up from about $1,300 in 2011, in part because of drug price inflation. Of the $2,800, it kept $167, the difference between what it paid for the drug and what it sold it for. That is about 10 times the gross profit of a retail pharmacy, according to Adam J. Fein, of Pembroke Consulting, an expert on drug distribution.
However, most of that money was absorbed by the cost of services, like nurses, that Diplomat provided. In the end, its overall profit margin was not that much different from that of a retail pharmacy, Mr. Fein said.
Executives at the specialty pharmacies say their surveys show more than 90 percent customer satisfaction. They say their pharmacists and nurses, who specialize in particular diseases, are more knowledgeable about those conditions than general pharmacists and nurses.
They say the health plans often require patients to use a single specialty pharmacy to keep costs down, just as health plans are limiting the choice of doctors, hospitals and drugs. They also say it is often the health plans that restrict early refills, so that the expensive drugs are not wasted.
"You don't want people to be stockpiling drugs in their house," said Dr. Lotvin of CVS. But he added, "None of us want people to get down to their last dose."
Still, executives concede there is room for improvement. Many specialty pharmacies are going through a voluntary accreditation process to demonstrate that they meet certain standards for patient care, such as providing 24/7 customer service.
Dr. Lotvin said CVS was working to allow nearly everyone to renew prescriptions online. CVS also has started to allow customers to pick up their specialty drugs at a nearby CVS retail pharmacy rather than have them delivered by mail. Some patients prefer that because they do not want to wait at home for delivery and do not want a package worth thousands of dollars left on their porch if they are away. CVS has found that offering a choice made patients more likely to keep taking their medicine compared with mail delivery only.
Mariah Leach of Louisville, Colo., said she would have preferred to pick up Enbrel, the drug for her rheumatoid arthritis, at her grocery store pharmacy, along with all her other prescriptions. But her insurer required her to get that one drug by mail from a specialty pharmacy. She said she did not need the hand-holding provided by specialty pharmacies. "I feel that's really more my rheumatologist's job," she said.
Ms. Leach recently switched to a drug that does not require her to deal with a specialty pharmacy. But when she did, she said, she was constantly frustrated by the inability to reach people on the phone or by errors in shipments or billing.
"Too bad my insurance forces me to get my Enbrel though this particular pharmacy, otherwise I'd have ditched this place after strike two," she wrote in a blog post in October 2013. "By my count, we are on about strike six, but I have no choice but to stick with them."
Some customers, however, praise the service they receive. Susan Day, a fourth-grade teacher in Williamsport, Md., has been using Accredo for more than 15 years for her son, John, who has pulmonary arterial hypertension and needs a drug pumped into his lungs.
Accredo sent a nurse to the Days' home to teach Ms. Day and her husband the complicated process of mixing her son's medication and putting it into the pump. It also helped set up a plan with John's school when he entered kindergarten.
"This is life-sustaining medication," said Ms. Day, who spoke to a reporter at the request of Express Scripts. "I want someone who knows this medication inside and out."
Ms. Short, meanwhile, continues to struggle with CVS Health. Last month, after she filled syringes of Willow's medication, Ms. Short discovered that the pharmacy had mistakenly sent enough for only 14 days, not 30. CVS mailed some overnight, but the experience left Ms. Short rattled.
"Every single month it seems like it's something," she said.

Full text:   VIENNA -- Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States reached a historic accord on Tuesday to significantly limit Tehran's nuclear ability for more than a decade in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions.
The deal culminates 20 months of negotiations on an agreement that President Obama had long sought as the biggest diplomatic achievement of his presidency. Whether it portends a new relationship between the United States and Iran -- after decades of coups, hostage-taking, terrorism and sanctions -- remains a bigger question.
Mr. Obama, in an early morning appearance at the White House that was broadcast live in Iran, began what promised to be an arduous effort to sell the deal to Congress and the American public, saying the agreement is "not built on trust -- it is built on verification."
He made it abundantly clear he would fight to preserve the deal from critics in Congress who are beginning a 60-day review, declaring, "I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal."
Almost as soon as the agreement was announced, to cheers in Vienna and on the streets of Tehran, its harshest critics said it would ultimately empower Iran rather than limit its capability. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called it a "historic mistake" that would create a "terrorist nuclear superpower."
A review of the 109-page text of the agreement, which includes five annexes, showed that the United States preserved -- and in some cases extended -- the nuclear restrictions it sketched out with Iran in early April in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Yet, it left open areas that are sure to raise fierce objections in Congress. It preserves Iran's ability to produce as much nuclear fuel as it wishes after year 15 of the agreement, and allows it to conduct research on advanced centrifuges after the eighth year. Moreover, the Iranians won the eventual lifting of an embargo on the import and export of conventional arms and ballistic missiles -- a step the departing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, warned about just last week.
American officials said the core of the agreement, secured in 18 consecutive days of talks here, lies in the restrictions on the amount of nuclear fuel that Iran can keep for the next 15 years. The current stockpile of low enriched uranium will be reduced by 98 percent, most likely by shipping much of it to Russia.
That limit, combined with a two-thirds reduction in the number of its centrifuges, would extend to a year the amount of time it would take Iran to make enough material for a single bomb should it abandon the accord and race for a weapon -- what officials call "breakout time." By comparison, analysts say Iran now has a breakout time of two to three months.
But American officials also acknowledged that after the first decade, the breakout time would begin to shrink. It was unclear how rapidly, because Iran's longer-term plans to expand its enrichment capability will be kept confidential.
The concern that Iran's breakout time could shrink sharply in the waning years of the restrictions has already been a contentious issue in Congress. Mr. Obama contributed to that in an interview with National Public Radio in April, when he said that in "year 13, 14, 15" of the agreement, the breakout time might shrink "almost down to zero," as Iran is expected to develop and use advanced centrifuges then.
Pressed on that point, an American official who briefed reporters on Tuesday said that Iran's long-term plans to expand its enrichment capability would be shared with the International Atomic Energy Agency and other parties to the accord.
"It is going to be a gradual decline," the official said. "At the end of, say, 15 years, we are not going to know what that is." But clearly there are intelligence agency estimates, and one diplomat involved in the talks said that internal estimates suggested Iran's breakout time could shrink to about five months in year 14 of the plan.
Secretary of State John Kerry, who led the negotiations for the United States in the final rounds, sought in his remarks Tuesday to blunt criticism on this point. "Iran will not produce or acquire highly enriched uranium" or plutonium for at least 15 years, he said. Verification measures, he added, will "stay in place permanently."
He stressed that Tehran and the International Atomic Energy Agency had "entered into an agreement to address all questions" about Iran's past actions within three months, and that completing this task was "fundamental for sanctions relief."
Compared with many past efforts to slow a nation's nuclear program -- including a deal struck with North Korea 20 years ago -- this agreement is remarkably specific. Nevertheless, some mysteries remain. For example, it is not clear whether the inspectors would be able to interview the scientists and engineers who were believed to have been at the center of an effort by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to design a weapon that Iran could manufacture in short order.
In building his argument for the deal, Mr. Obama stressed that the accord was vastly preferable to the alternate scenario: no agreement and an unbridled nuclear arms race in the Middle East. "Put simply, no deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East," he said. He said his successors in the White House "will be in a far stronger position" to restrain Iran for decades to come than they would be without the pact.
In an interview Tuesday with Thomas L. Friedman, an Op-Ed columnist with The New York Times, Mr. Obama also answered Mr. Netanyahu and other critics who, he said, would prefer that the Iranians "don't even have any nuclear capacity." Mr. Obama said, "But really, what that involves is eliminating the presence of knowledge inside of Iran." Since that is not realistic, the president added, "The question is, Do we have the kind of inspection regime and safeguards and international consensus whereby it's not worth it for them to do it? We have accomplished that."
As news of a nuclear deal spread, Iranians reacted with a mix of jubilation, cautious optimism and disbelief that decades of a seemingly intractable conflict could be coming to an end.
"Have they really reached a deal?" asked Masoud Derakhshani, a 93-year-old widower who had come down to the lobby of his apartment building for his daily newspaper. Mr. Derakhshani remained cautious, even incredulous. "I can't believe it," he said. "They will most probably hit some last-minute snag."
Across Tehran, many Iranians expressed hope for better economic times after years in which crippling sanctions have severely depressed the value of the national currency, the rial. That in turn caused inflation and shortages of goods, including vital medicines, and forced Iranians to carry fat wads of bank notes to pay for everyday items such as meat, rice and beans.
"I am desperate to feed my three sons," said Ali, 53, a cleaner. "This deal should bring investment for jobs so they can start working for a living."
National dignity, a major demand of Iran's leader, did not matter to him, he said. "I really do not care if this is a victory for us or not," he said. "I want relations with the West. If we compromised, so be it."
Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, who was elected in 2013 on a platform of ridding the country of the sanctions, said that the Iranian people's "prayers have come true."
One of the last, and most contentious, issues was the question of whether and how fast an arms embargo on conventional weapons and missiles, imposed starting in 2006, would be lifted.
After days of haggling, Secretary of State Kerry and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, agreed that the missile restrictions would remain for eight years and that a similar ban on the purchase and sale of conventional weapons would be removed in five years.
Those bans would be removed even sooner if the International Atomic Energy Agency reached a definitive conclusion that the Iranian nuclear program is entirely peaceful, and that there was no evidence of cheating on the accord or any activity to obtain weapons covertly.
The provisions on the arms embargo are expected to dominate the coming debate in Congress on the accord.
Even before the deal was announced, critics expressed fears that Iran would use some of the billions of dollars it will receive after sanctions relief to build up its military power. Iranian officials, however, have said that Iran should be treated like any other nation, and not be subjected to an arms embargo if it meets the terms of a nuclear deal.
Defending the outcome, Mr. Kerry told reporters here that China and Russia had favored lifting the entire arms embargo immediately, suggesting he had no choice but to try to strike a middle ground.
Mr. Kerry appeared to secure another commitment that was not part of a preliminary agreement negotiated in Lausanne. Iranian officials agreed here on a multiyear ban on designing warheads and conducting tests, including with detonators and nuclear triggers, that would contribute to the design and manufacture of a nuclear weapon. Accusations that Tehran conducted that kind of research in the past led to a standoff with inspectors.
Diplomats also came up with unusual procedure to "snap back" the sanctions against Iran if an eight-member panel determines that Tehran is violating the nuclear provisions. The members of the panel are Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United States, the European Union and Iran itself. A majority vote is required, meaning that Russia, China and Iran could not collectively block action.
With the announcement of the accord, Mr. Obama has now made major strides toward fundamentally changing the American diplomatic relationships with three nations: Cuba, Iran and Myanmar. Of the three, Iran is the most strategically important, the only one with a nuclear program, and it is still on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism.
While the agreement faces heavy opposition from Republicans in Congress, and even some Democrats, Mr. Obama's chances of prevailing are considered high. Even if the accord is voted down by one or both houses, he could veto that action, and he is likely to have the votes he would need to override the veto. But he has told aides that for an accord as important as this one -- which he hopes will usher in a virtual truce with a country that has been a major American adversary for 35 years -- he wants a congressional endorsement.
Mr. Obama will also have to manage the breach with Mr. Netanyahu and the leaders of Saudi Arabia and other Arab states who have warned against the deal, saying the relief of sanctions will ultimately empower the Iranians throughout the Middle East.

Full text:   DETROIT -- When American carmakers negotiated their existing contract with the United Auto Workers union four years ago, the domestic auto industry was just recovering from a deep recession.
But conditions have vastly improved since then. Sales in the United States are roaring toward 17 million vehicles this year and the bankruptcies and bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler are fading in the rearview mirror.
Instead of closing plants and cutting workers, G.M., Ford and the newly merged Fiat Chrysler have been adding jobs, made possible by big profits on surging sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
On Monday, G.M. became the first of the three Detroit automakers to open talks on a new contract with the union to replace the current pact that expires in September.
And if the upbeat tone of the opening ceremony is any indication, this summer's discussions are all about keeping the good times rolling.
"We are going to truly listen to each other and understand the issues we need to work through," said Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive.
The president of the U.A.W., Dennis Williams, said the union was seeking wage increases and more job security, and closing the gap between veteran workers earning $28 an hour and entry-level jobs that pay up to $19.
Mr. Williams, however, was unusually generous in his praise for G.M.'s comeback, and played down the notion that the union was gearing up for a battle or even a strike against any of the three automakers.
"I am not afraid of confrontation, but I don't want one and our members don't want one," Mr. Williams said to the cheers of union workers packing the ceremony at the sprawling G.M.-U.A.W. human resources center in Detroit.
Fiat Chrysler will open its talks with the union on Tuesday, and Ford Motor will follow next week. Together, the three Detroit automakers employ about 138,000 blue-collar workers across the country -- about one-third of which have been hired since 2011.
The new jobs have come at a price and entry-level workers have become increasingly vocal about the disparity in pay with longtime union members. And while G.M. and Ford have distributed big profit-sharing checks to workers in recent years, the union has not had an across-the-board wage increase in more than a decade.
"The real issue for all U.A.W. members is about sharing in the gains the companies have made," said Harley Shaiken, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who has worked with the union in the past. "And there is considerable pressure to close the divide between legacy workers and the two-tier people."
Still, industry executives note that U.A.W. wages and benefits are still higher than those of nonunion workers employed by foreign carmakers like Volkswagen and Nissan in the United States.
Analysts suggest that the auto companies will be hard-pressed to avoid wage increases, even though higher structural costs will take a toll on profits when vehicle sales inevitably cool off.
"They'll likely get a contract that not only doesn't address longer-term structural issues, but also results in mild wage inflation," said Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital.
The automakers are expected to push for reductions in health care costs, possibly by adjusting deductibles, co-pays on doctors' visits and prescription medication coverage.
Mr. Williams has previously said he would consider pooling hourly employees into a health care plan with salaried workers if that would save the corporations money.
But any concessions by the union on health care will most likely be offset by the U.A.W.'s demands for bigger paychecks in the factories.
"We have stagnant wages," he said on Monday, adding that entry-level workers deserve a large increase. "Some of them are not part of the middle class the way they should be."
The two-tier system itself has come under added scrutiny because of how different companies have taken advantage of it.
G.M. and Fiat Chrysler have had unlimited freedom to hire lower-paid workers because of agreements struck by the companies and the union with the Obama administration as part of their government bailouts.
Ford, which did not go bankrupt or require a bailout, is required by its U.A.W. contract to begin bumping new workers up to the higher pay grade when lower-tier employees make up 25 percent of its overall work force.
G.M.'s percentage of lower-paid workers is about 20 percent. By contrast, more than 40 percent of Fiat Chrysler's American employees are entry-level workers.
"I'm happy to have a job, but I wouldn't expect to be treated like less of a human being," said Darlene Rau, an entry-level employee at Fiat Chrysler's assembly plant in Detroit. "I don't make enough to pay all of my bills."
Besides shrinking the wage gap in the United States, the union is also intent on preventing the automakers from moving production of some vehicles to lower-wage nations. Last week, Ford said it would shift production of small cars to Mexico from a Michigan factory.
"There is a very difficult balancing act ahead for both sides," Mr. Shaiken said. "They both want a strong industry and more jobs, but what is the cost going to be to get there?"
The positive vibe on Monday was different than at the same event in years past, when the ceremonial handshakes between labor and management were often tense affairs.
Still, the tone of Monday's ceremony, unlike during previous events, had a sense of unity between two camps that have often been adversaries. This time, Ms. Barra and her executives arrived in starched blue shirts that were nearly identical to those worn by the union negotiators. And both the G.M. and union leaders emphasized that the company and the U.A.W. had survived because they stuck together during the last recession.
"Many people counted us out," Mr. Williams said. "But we came back."

Full text:   When the California Labor Commissioner's Office ruled last month that an Uber driver was an employee deserving of a variety of workplace protections -- and was not, as the company maintained, an independent contractor -- it highlighted the divided feelings many Americans have about what is increasingly being called the "gig economy."
On one hand, start-ups like Uber, which is appealing the decision, and Lyft make it possible to conjure up rides on a smartphone in a few seconds' time.
On the other, Uber -- which directly employs fewer than 4,000 of the more than 160,000 people in the United States who depend on it for at least part of their livelihood -- and similar companies pose a challenge to longstanding notions of what it means to hold a job.
As it happens, though, Uber is not so much a labor-market innovation as the culmination of a generation-long trend. Even before the founding of the company in 2009, the United States economy was rapidly becoming an Uber economy writ large, with tens of millions of Americans involved in some form of freelancing, contracting, temping or outsourcing.
The decades-long shift to these more flexible workplace arrangements, the venture capitalist Nick Hanauer and the labor leader David Rolf argue in the latest issue of Democracy Journal, is a "transformation that promises new efficiencies and greater flexibility for 'employers' and 'employees' alike, but which threatens to undermine the very foundation upon which middle-class America was built."
Along with other changes, like declining unionization and advancing globalization, the increasingly arm's-length nature of employment helps explain why incomes have stagnated and why most Americans remain deeply anxious about their economic prospects six years after the Great Recession ended.
Last year, 23 percent of Americans told Gallup they worried that their working hours would be cut back, up from percentages in the low to midteens in the years leading up to the recession. Twenty-four percent said they worried that their wages would be reduced, up from the mid- to high teens before the recession.
Even if the economy continues to improve, the lingering malaise will almost certainly be the central issue in next year's presidential election.
On Monday, Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to give a speech outlining her vision for improving the economic fortunes of the middle class. Leading Republicans, like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, have framed their policy ideas as an attempt to solve economic insecurity and the erosion of middle-class incomes.
But the tidal wave sweeping through the American economy has already reshaped the political landscape -- from the rise of an anti-Wall Street movement on the left to the Tea Party on the right -- and is sowing frustration among a large mass of voters.
"Whether America will be America or not hinges on whether we have a downward spiral around wages," said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a think tank closely aligned with Mrs. Clinton. "People know things are changing. They don't feel like anyone has a handle on it. There's a yearning for a political vision that addresses that."
In retrospect, the Uberization of the economy began innocently enough back in the late 1970s.
David Weil, who runs the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Labor Department, describes in his recent book, "The Fissured Workplace," how investors and management gurus began insisting that companies pare down and focus on what came to be known as their "core competencies," like developing new goods and services and marketing them.
Far-flung business units were sold off. Many other activities -- beginning with human resources and then spreading to customer service and information technology -- could be outsourced. The corporate headquarters would coordinate among the outsourced workers and monitor their performance.
Cost was unquestionably an advantage of the new approach: Workers were typically cheaper when off the corporate payroll than on it, and the arrangement allowed a company to staff up as needed rather than employ a full complement of workers at all times.
But simply cutting costs wasn't the primary motivation. The real advantage was to enable the organization to focus on what it did best rather than distract itself with tasks for which it had little expertise and which were not especially profitable.
Since the early 1990s, as technology has made it far easier for companies to outsource work, that trend has evolved beyond what anyone imagined: Companies began to see themselves as thin, Uber-like slivers standing between customers on one side and their work forces on the other.
"In the past, firms overstaffed and offered workers stable hours," said Susan N. Houseman, a labor economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. "All of these new staffing models mean shifting risk onto workers, making work less secure."
The hospitality industry has led the transformation. In the 1960s, according to data cited by Dr. Weil, only a small fraction of United States motels were franchised, meaning they weren't owned and typically weren't managed by the chains that branded and marketed them. As of 1986, the franchised figure was 68 percent worldwide for the top hotel chains, like Hilton and Marriott. By 2006, it was 78 percent.
The hotels are frequently owned by outside investors and run by separate management companies, which, in turn, contract out a variety of other functions, like housekeeping, maintenance and janitorial services. Industrywide, wages have fallen since 2000, and labor law violations are rampant.
Though the broader phenomenon of shifting work to nonemployees is difficult to quantify, data on contingent workers suggests rapid growth in the last decade.
The number for the category of jobs mostly performed by part-time freelancers or part-time independent contractors, according to Economic Modeling Specialists Intl., a labor market analytics firm, grew to 32 million from just over 20 million between 2001 and 2014, rising to almost 18 percent of all jobs. Surveys, including one by the advisory firm Staffing Industry Analysts of nearly 200 large companies, point to similar changes.
Apple is a vivid example of the trend toward relying on outsiders, directly employing fewer than 10 percent of the more than one million workers around the world who are involved in designing, making and selling all those iMacs and iPhones.
The leaner, more flexible workplace is unquestionably a boon to many workers. A company called HourlyNerd, based in Boston, connects alumni of top business schools and other specialized programs to companies with projects in need of completing, like market analysis or examinations of pricing strategy. The most sought-after experts enjoy a steady stream of work, earn well into six figures and can winter in Buenos Aires if they choose.
"I had an offer from another consulting firm, but I wanted more flexibility with my life," said Carlos Castelán, who started taking on HourlyNerd projects while still at Harvard Business School and now plans to build his career around the platform. "I can work from home, have more control of my schedule."
It is not just people with advanced degrees who can benefit. Corey Becker spent a few years working as an independent contractor for a company called Cascom, which in turn contracted with Time Warner Cable to install cable, Internet and phone service. Mr. Becker was paid by the task, not by the hour.
He was hard-working and efficient, and had no family obligations. He recalled that he made $1,000 to $1,500 in a typical 60-hour week, before taxes and expenses on tools, gas and vehicle upkeep, which he shouldered himself. "I thought it was a great deal," Mr. Becker said.
But many of his colleagues did not fare so well. "Some of the techs were slow, not as good at it," he said. "Or the home was a mess and you had to fix it -- you're working longer for the same result, same payout."
Mr. Becker estimated that in some cases, these technicians' hourly pay would fall below minimum wage. In 2009, the Labor Department sued Cascom for misclassifying workers as independent contractors; a judge ruled against the company in 2011 and later awarded some 250 installers nearly $1.5 million in back wages and damages.
Such arrangements can send even highly skilled workers into a precarious state. Unlike many of their colleagues in the fast-growing legal outsourcing and temping market, lawyers who work for Axiom, one of the industry's leading players, receive health insurance, paid time off, 401(k)'s and money comparable to what they would make at a traditional firm or corporation. Yet many live with the uncertainty of not knowing how long they will go between assignments, during which time they earn no income from the company.
"When I'm done with this job, it could be a month, two months" before another one, said a lawyer who worked for Axiom until 2013 and requested anonymity to avoid drawing attention to her current employer. "It was a stress point for me. My family depends on me." (An Axiom official said the company worked hard to minimize unwanted downtime, which he said had fallen significantly in the last few years.)
Contingent workers still represent a limited corner of the nation's approximately $17.5 trillion economy. But even many full-time employees share an underlying anxiety that is a result, according to the sociologist Arne L. Kalleberg, author of "Good Jobs, Bad Jobs," of the severing of the "psychological contract between employers and employees in which stability and security were exchanged for loyalty and hard work."
All of which helps explain a discouraging trend in incomes. According to a study by the economists Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney, most men were earning substantially less in 2009 than men of similar ages and education did in 1969, adjusted for inflation.
Sara Horowitz, founder and executive director of the Freelancers Union, an advocacy organization, puts the scale of the dislocation on a par with that caused by the spread of railroads before and after the Civil War and the boom in the mass production of goods during the early 20th century.
"The economic argument is that those who have power in the labor market do better, and traditionally it's been higher-skilled workers," Ms. Horowitz said. "Today, it's unclear who has the skills necessary to remain relevant amid all the disruptions."

Abstract: The wild card for banks like Bank of America, which reports on Wednesday, could be results from their bond, currencies and commodities trading operations. The session before the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee is expected to cover a wide variety of issues, including whether global banks have become too large and complex to manage and if large fines against financial institutions are the right way to improve ethics in the industry.

Full text:   Seeking Relief in Puerto Rico
Monday afternoon, Puerto Rico's creditors are invited to meet at Citigroup's Park Avenue office for a presentation by the Commonwealth's top financial official and a former chief economist at the World Bank. The meeting, which will be streamed online to the public, is being billed as the first face-to-face meeting between Puerto Rico and its creditors since the governor declared that the island's debts were not payable. --Michael Corkery
Labor Talks for Carmakers
Contract talks begin this week between the United Automobile Workers and two of Detroit's automakers. Negotiations start on Monday with General Motors and on Tuesday, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Negotiations at Ford begin later this month. The union is hoping for wage increases in a new contract. The current labor agreements expire in September. --Bill Vlasic
Expected Growth in Consumer Spending
Retail sales figures due from the Census Bureau on Tuesday are likely to show that spending climbed in June for a fourth straight month, buoyed by the lowest unemployment the country has experienced in seven years and strong payroll growth. Spending at auto dealers and home improvement stores has jumped in recent months, evidence that households feel confident enough to make longer-term investments in their cars and homes. Consumers are also starting to spend more at the pump, reflecting the higher costs of gas since April, though that could divert dollars away from other retailers. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity in the United States. --Hiroko Tabuchi
Banks Post Earnings
The nation's largest banks report their second-quarter results this week, starting with JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo on Tuesday. Analysts are expecting relatively ho-hum earnings despite the stable economy in the United States. The wild card for banks like Bank of America, which reports on Wednesday, could be results from their bond, currencies and commodities trading operations. Trading revenue tends to swing wildly each quarter. Also reporting earnings this week are the private equity firm Blackstone Group and the asset manager BlackRock. --Michael Corkery
Assessing Banking Culture
A British Parliament committee on Tuesday will question Stephen Green, the former chairman of HSBC, and Winfried Bischoff, the former chairman of Lloyds Banking Group and Citigroup, on the culture of the banking industry. The session before the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee is expected to cover a wide variety of issues, including whether global banks have become too large and complex to manage and if large fines against financial institutions are the right way to improve ethics in the industry. The committee will also examine misconduct in HSBC's Swiss and Mexican operations and whether the bank took rules against money laundering seriously. --Chad Bray
A Giant Slows
All eyes will be on the Chinese economy this week, as the country reports its second-quarter gross domestic product. The economy is expected to have grown by 6.8 percent, the slowest rate since 2009. If the numbers prove weak, that could add to the pressure on the stock market, which has been slumping in recent weeks. On Friday, Premier Li Keqiang expressed confidence in the economy, although he also alluded to the market troubles. "Though there will be various challenges and risks along the way," he said in a statement, "we will never let down our guard, and we have the capability and confidence to prevent regional and systemic risks." --Adrienne Carter
Questions for Fed's Chief
Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, heads across town on Wednesday to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. On Thursday, she will repeat the performance before the Senate Banking Committee. The biannual appearances are billed as reports to Congress on monetary policy, but the questions tend to range widely. House Republicans, in particular, are likely to press Ms. Yellen for details about a 2012 leak of confidential information about the Fed's bond-buying plans, now the subject of multiple investigations. --Binyamin Appelbaum
Oil Auction for Mexico
Mexico's new oil regime will undergo a major test on Wednesday when the government holds the first auction for private oil companies of 169 oil blocks that are both onshore and offshore. At least 17 companies are expected to participate, though the auction comes as oil prices are low. Pemex, the old national oil company, has decided not to participate. The Mexican Congress passed legislation last year to end Pemex's monopoly and open the country's oil patch to international competition. --Clifford Krauss
Eyes on a New Executive
When Google reports its second-quarter earnings on Thursday, analysts will be focused less on the results than the person delivering them. That is because this will be the first earnings report for Ruth Porat, Google's chief financial officer, who joined the company from Morgan Stanley in May. Google's stock is down 9 percent from a year ago, and analysts are likely to ask Ms. Porat about her plans for Google's $65 billion cash pile -- specifically, if she may be willing to give some of it back to investors. --Conor Dougherty
Gauging Health of American Economy
Two indicators of the health of the overall economy last month will come out Friday morning, when the Labor Department reports the latest data on prices for consumers in June, while the Commerce Department releases data on housing starts. The Consumer Price Index is expected to show a gain of 0.3 percentage point, with core prices that exclude the volatile food and energy sectors rising just 0.1 percent. Both suggest there is little current threat from inflation. Housing starts for June are expected to rise slightly to an annual rate of 1.12 million, as construction rises and the real estate sector continues to be among the economy's bright spots. --Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Amtrak said in a court filing on Friday that the railway would not contest lawsuits seeking compensation for damages caused by the May 12 derailment of its passenger train that crashed shortly after leaving 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, killing eight and injuring more than 200.
The railroad company also admitted that the train was "traveling in excess of the allowable speed" when it derailed. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said the train was going 106 miles per hour on a curve where the speed limit is 50.
The admissions were part of a filing in the United States District Court in Philadelphia in connection with the first two passenger cases against the passenger rail company. The claims are among nearly two dozen that have been filed against Amtrak in connection with the fatal crash.
Thomas Kline, a lawyer with the firm Kline & Specter in Philadelphia, said Friday's filing was the deadline for Amtrak to respond to his client's claim for damages related to the derailment.
"The admission of liability by Amtrak in the first two filed cases is an important step in a longer process in front of the injured and the families of the victims of this horrible tragedy," Mr. Kline said.
Robert J. Mongeluzzi, a lawyer in the Philadelphia-based firm Saltz, Mongeluzzi, Barrett & Bendesky who represents several victims, added: "We now will move forward to seek compensation and a full accounting of how this accident occurred and, importantly, how future derailments can be prevented."
Christina Leeds, a spokeswoman for Amtrak, said, "from the beginning, Amtrak has taken responsibility for this tragic incident, covering initial medical costs, transportation and lodging for passengers and their families."
In the reauthorization of Amtrak in 1997, Congress capped the liability against the company at $200 million for any single train accident. The provision, which does not account for inflation, was aimed at keeping railroad companies in operation when hit with major lawsuits.
The liability cap has long been a source of controversy among lawyers, lawmakers and judges who say it does not properly compensate victims for the pain and suffering they experience and will not cover past and future medical bills or compensate children and spouses of those killed in rail accidents.
A bill passed last month by the Senate Commerce Committee would raise the cap to $295 million and index it every 10 years for inflation. The bill was co-sponsored by Senators Roger Wicker, a Republican of Mississippi, and Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat.
Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, in May, introduced separate legislation that would raise the liability cap to $500 million.
"We can't allow anyone to suffer additionally due to an outdated cap based on mid-1990 dollars," Mr. Nelson said after the announcement of the legislation. The Senate has yet to take up the legislation.
Mr. Nelson's legislation follows previous attempts to raise the liability cap for Amtrak and other railroad companies. In the wake of a deadly 2008 California commuter rail crash, Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both California Democrats, also sought to raise the liability cap to $500 million. But their legislation never came up for a vote.
"This is a good start but the liability cap remains a problem," said Fredric Eisenberg, a Philadelphia lawyer who represents a Brooklyn couple injured in the accident. "While an admission of liability is a welcome step, Amtrak should join in our effort to raise the almost 20-year-old cap which is clearly insufficient to compensate the victims of this crash."

Abstract: [...]Greece has nonetheless played an outsized role in U.S. political debate, as a symbol of the terrible things that will supposedly happen -- any day now -- unless we stop helping the less fortunate and printing money to fight unemployment. The people now saying that Greece offers an object lesson in the dangers of government debt, and that America is headed down the same road, are the same people who predicted soaring interest rates and runaway inflation in 2010; then, when it didn't happen, they predicted soaring rates and runaway inflation in 2011; then, well, you get the picture.

Full text:   Greece is a faraway country with an economy roughly the size of greater Miami, so America has very little direct stake in its ongoing disaster. To the extent that Greece matters to us, it's mainly about geopolitics: By poisoning relations among Europe's democracies, the Greek crisis risks depriving the United States of crucial allies.
But Greece has nonetheless played an outsized role in U.S. political debate, as a symbol of the terrible things that will supposedly happen -- any day now -- unless we stop helping the less fortunate and printing money to fight unemployment. And Greece does indeed offer important lessons to the rest of us. But they're not the lessons you think, and the people most likely to deliver a Greek-style economic disaster here in America are the very people who love to use Greece as a boogeyman.
To understand the real lessons of Greece, you need to be aware of two crucial points.
The first is that the "We're Greece!" crowd has a truly remarkable track record when it comes to economic forecasting: They've been wrong about everything, year after year, but refuse to learn from their mistakes. The people now saying that Greece offers an object lesson in the dangers of government debt, and that America is headed down the same road, are the same people who predicted soaring interest rates and runaway inflation in 2010; then, when it didn't happen, they predicted soaring rates and runaway inflation in 2011; then, well, you get the picture.
The second is that the story you've heard about Greece -- that it borrowed too much, and its excessive debt led to the current crisis -- is seriously incomplete. Greece did indeed run up too much debt (with a lot of help from irresponsible lenders). But its debt, while high, wasn't that high by historical standards. What turned Greek debt troubles into catastrophe was Greece's inability, thanks to the euro, to do what countries with large debts usually do: impose fiscal austerity, yes, but offset it with easy money.
Consider Greece's situation at the end of 2009, when its debt crisis burst into the open. At that point Greek government debt was near 130 percent of gross domestic product, which is definitely a big number. But it's by no means unprecedented. As it happens, Greece's debt ratio in 2009 was about the same as America's in 1946, just after the war. And Britain's debt ratio in 1946 was twice as high.
Today, however, Greek debt is over 170 percent of G.D.P. and still rising. Is that because Greece just kept on borrowing? Actually, no -- Greek debt is up only 6 percent since 2009, although that's partly because it received some debt relief in 2012. The main point, however, is that the ratio of debt to G.D.P. is up because G.D.P. is down by more than 20 percent. And why is GDP down? Largely because of the austerity measures Greece's creditors forced it to impose.
Does this mean that austerity is always self-defeating? No, there are cases -- for example, Canada in the 1990s -- of countries that slashed their debt while maintaining growth and reducing unemployment. But if you look at how they managed this, it involved combining fiscal austerity with easy money: Canada in the '90s drastically reduced interest rates, encouraging private spending, while allowing its currency to depreciate, encouraging exports.
Greece, unfortunately, no longer had its own currency when it was forced into drastic fiscal retrenchment. The result was an economic implosion that ended up making the debt problem even worse. Greece's formula for disaster, in other words, didn't just involve austerity; it involved the toxic combination of austerity with hard money.
So who wants to impose that kind of toxic policy mix on America? The answer is, most of the Republican Party.
On one side, just about everyone in the G.O.P. demands that we reduce government spending, especially aid to lower-income families. (They also, of course, want to reduce taxes on the rich -- but that wouldn't do much to boost demand for U.S. products.)
On the other side, leading Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan incessantly attack the Federal Reserve for its efforts to boost the economy, delivering solemn lectures on the evils of "debasing" the dollar -- when the main difference between the effects of austerity in Canada and in Greece was precisely that Canada could "debase" its currency, while Greece couldn't. Oh, and many Republicans hanker for a return to the gold standard, which would effectively put us into a euro-like straitjacket.
The point is that if you really worry that the U.S. might turn into Greece, you should focus your concern on America's right. Because if the right gets its way on economic policy -- slashing spending while blocking any offsetting monetary easing -- it will, in effect, bring the policies behind the Greek disaster to America.

Minutes of Meeting Show Fed Is Still Looking at Raising Interest Rates This Year

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials spent their most recent policy meeting, in June, preparing to raise interest rates later this year.
Officials liked the look of recent economic data, including early signs that wages were starting to rise more quickly, according to an official account the Fed released on Wednesday after a standard delay.
The meeting predated the collapse of negotiations between Greece and its creditors, and the continuing descent of the Chinese stock market, but its tone and more recent public remarks of Fed officials suggest that the central bank is still likely to raise rates this year unless the domestic economy is significantly disrupted by global events.
John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, said on Wednesday in Los Angeles that he was just waiting to make sure the economy actually improves in line with the Fed's expectations.
"While my forecast looks great, I am wary of acting before gathering more evidence that inflation's trajectory is on the desired path," he said.
The account did not address the exact timing of an initial interest rate increase. Some analysts said the description of the meeting suggested the Fed remained on course to raise rates as soon as September.
"By September, Greece will either be a ward of the eurozone or out," wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, referring to the group of nations that use the euro currency. "Either way, the dust will have settled and the Fed will focus on domestic data.
"Growth will be stronger than they expect, unemployment will be lower and wage gains will be faster."
Fed officials have concluded that economic problems during the winter months were overstated, reflecting methodological problems in the government's measuring sticks rather than an actual downturn.
"Real activity in the first quarter was likely stronger than the then-current official estimate," the Fed's meeting account said.
Mr. Williams said on Wednesday that his staff had calculated that the economy actually expanded by about 1.5 percent in the first quarter, compared to the most recent report by the Commerce Department, which estimated a slight decline in economic activity.
The account also cited a "substantial" improvement in labor market conditions over the last year. In particular, it noted signs that increased demand for labor had "begun to result in a firming of wage increases."
The pace of wage increases remains slow by historical standards. But officials have said that faster wage growth would offer an important indication that the labor market was finally returning to full health, and also that higher rates might be necessary to control inflation.
"Members thus saw economic conditions as continuing to approach those consistent with warranting a start to the normalization of the stance of monetary policy," the minutes of the meeting said.
The Fed, however, is not ready to move just yet.
The minutes, which do not identify the views of Fed officials by name, suggested that even those officials most eager to raise rates were willing to wait until September.
One member, most likely Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, was described as ready to act. Nonetheless, the minutes noted that he "expressed a willingness to wait another meeting or two for additional data before raising the target range."
Officials continue to predict that inflation will begin to pick up, rising back toward the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy.
The internal debate about the timing of rate increases is focused in part on whether the Fed should start moving as inflation begins to pick up, or whether it should wait until inflation is rising more quickly.
Officials also anticipated the possibility of new problems in Europe and China. "Many participants expressed concern that a failure of Greece and its official creditors to resolve their differences could result in disruptions in financial markets in the euro area, with possible spillover effects on the United States," the account said.
The International Monetary Fund has argued in a series of publications that the Fed should wait until next year to start raising interest rates. There is little evidence, however, that Fed officials are listening.
"All in all, things are looking good," Mr. Williams said in his speech Wednesday. "I can't tell you the date of liftoff, but I can say that it's going to be an interesting rest of the year for monetary policy."
Fed policy makers continued at the June meeting to fine-tune their plans for the first rate increase in almost a decade.
The committee agreed to release an "implementation note" alongside its normal policy statement, detailing the technical steps the Fed would take to raise its benchmark interest rate. That would allow the Fed to adjust those details at subsequent meetings without changing its stated goals.
The Fed also said it would tweak the way that it calculates its benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, reporting the median rather than the average interest rate for loans between banks in the federal funds market. Volume in that market has diminished since the financial crisis. The change may reduce reported volatility.

Full text:   When the financial crisis hit Iceland seven years ago, Gudmundur Kristjansson, a 55-year-old fisherman with a wide smile, weathered face and mischievous eyes, almost lost his business. Interest payments on his loans soared 300 percent. He had to sell his two fish factories and two of his five fishing boats. "We didn't invest for many years," he said, "because we were only paying interest."
His tribulations were shared by the whole country. After Iceland's three largest banks fell in the space of three days, the currency collapsed, the stock market fell 95 percent and nearly every business on the island was bankrupt.
Short-term suffering followed, but today, Iceland is buzzing: Unemployment is 4 percent, the International Monetary Fund is predicting 4.1 percent G.D.P. growth for 2015, and tourism is booming. Mr. Kristjansson has just bought Nanoq, a used boat from Russia that recently was being prepared for a fishing trip to Greenland.
But just as Iceland returns to the fold, Europe is again bracing for a financial catastrophe in a renegade nation. Greece, having missed crucial debt payments, has in recent days moved closer than ever to an exit from the euro. Leaving the common currency -- and having to suddenly create its own new money -- could plunge Greece into an even deeper economic downturn.
The Greek people may vote for a deal with the creditors in a referendum that is scheduled for Sunday, and Greece and Europe may have announced the contours of a settlement before then.
But even if that happens, uncertainty will hang over Greece for a long time, raising important questions about whether it makes sense for a country to go it alone, as Iceland did.
Iceland is not Greece. As a tiny island with a population of 320,000, it was able to muster political will more easily than most countries. (Meeting the prime minister is no big deal to locals.) Greece has a population of 11 million, a gross domestic product that is $242 billion, or 16 times Iceland's, and a history of political antagonism and government corruption. The two countries blew themselves up, though in different ways. Greece, as a nation, spent too much; in Iceland, the private banks went on a bender that ended badly.
But Iceland came out the other side of disaster in part because it had its own currency, which devalued, and it imposed draconian capital controls. If Greece ends up with its own currency, it would most likely descend into an economic Hades in the months after dumping the euro before even having a chance to emerge on the other side.
Yet, even as Iceland is in the bloom of health, its comeback is about to be tested again. The government recently announced it would start to lift capital controls imposed at the peak of the crisis. Meant to last a few months, the controls have been in place for seven years, creating a shelter under which Iceland has mostly thrived.
Their success, paradoxically, has made their removal all the more precarious.
"They worked better than anyone expected them to work," said Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, the prime minister. "But they of course are not a sustainable situation for an economy."
The Aftermath of the Collapse
To say the case for capital controls was strong in 2008 would be a huge understatement. If the United States and Europe got drunk on easy money, Iceland was the guy at the party who was unconscious in the corner.
When the Icelandic krona crashed in 2008, the country's three largest banks had assets worth 10 times the country's G.D.P. Eighty-five percent of the financial system collapsed.
Iceland's banks got into the international banking business in a big way, despite having very little international banking -- or regulatory -- experience.
"Iceland wanted to be a big financial player, which was crazy for a population of 320,000," said Bogi Thor Siguroddsson, chairman of Johan Ronning, an electrical wholesaler.
At the same time, Iceland became a target for hot money. Because Iceland had high interest rates, international traders -- and plenty of ordinary people -- would borrow dollars at, say, 5 percent, convert them to Icelandic krona and buy Icelandic bonds paying 9 percent. They would profit from the difference between the 5 and the 9 percent.
At the time of the collapse, the carry traders' positions were estimated to be 41 percent of G.D.P. Without capital controls, that money would flee, further depressing the krona.
There was no chance Iceland could bail out its banks, so it let them fail. But first it saved local depositors by moving them to new "good" banks.
The Icelandic government, with the support of the International Monetary Fund, imposed strict capital controls, barring capital from leaving the country and prohibiting individuals from buying foreign currency or foreign stocks.
As real wages fell 11 percent from 2007 to 2010, the government did not take a hacksaw to social services, but instead raised taxes and also offered debt relief to the country's mortgage holders.
And Iceland did what no other developed country has seemed particularly eager to do: It jailed a bunch of bankers.
When the banks collapsed -- combined, the third largest corporate bankruptcy in world history in one of the smallest countries -- shareholders were wiped out. Foreign creditors lost billions, but hoped to recover some assets. International hedge funds spotted opportunity and bought some of those claims, reportedly for cents on the dollar.
As the economy improved, the claims -- including positions in two of the country's "good" banks -- increased in value. That meant that the hedge funds effectively owned a significant part of Iceland's financial system.
"We are the only country to let crazy hedge funds own our banks for seven years," Mr. Kristjansson, the fisherman, said.
The capital controls caused a lot of other weird things to happen. Overnight, the central bank gained enormous powers over how money could be spent. Mr. Siguroddsson, the chairman of the electrical wholesaler, was in Japan with his family when his credit card was rejected because he hit his foreign currency limit. He had to call a special number in the middle of the night.
"You have the feeling that there's a system watching you and telling you what you can do with your money," he said.
Iceland's pension funds, which are nearly fully funded, were suddenly prevented from investing in new foreign assets; today a whopping 75 percent of pension fund assets are in krona-based investments. Overnight, homegrown private equity and real estate funds were born as a place to invest the rapidly expanding pot of local money.
Individuals faced foreign currency limits. When Magnus Arni Skulason's son had a confirmation celebration five years ago, his son asked to invest his savings of $2,000 in Apple stock (the price was $32.50). "It's illegal, Jonatan, we have capital controls," his father recalled telling him. (The stock is now at $127.)
There were, however, salutary effects to capital controls and currency devaluation.
Devaluation made exports cheaper and imports more expensive. It became cheaper to travel to Iceland. And, if wages fell, Iceland did not face the crippling unemployment of many European countries.
"In my opinion the last six to seven years have been an open class on the discussion of whether or not to have your own currency and what it means to be a member of a common currency that is not taking your economic situation under consideration," said Bjarni Benediktsson, Iceland's finance minister.
But the capital controls also caused pain for businesses. Investors, worried about how the controls would affect them, stayed away. Foreign investment fell and is still only about 16 percent of G.D.P., far below precrisis levels.
Mr. Kristjansson, the fisherman, wants to buy a new, more energy-efficient fishing boat. But he can borrow only in local currency at high rates, and most banks have not been keen on lending, hence the purchase of the secondhand boat.
"We are losing competition with companies coming from the outside," he said.
Mr. Benediktsson, the finance minister, sees that problem.
"We are enjoying the longest sustainable growth period in recent history," he said. But the capital controls "are very damning for investment interest in Iceland but also very damaging to the real economy where we are losing opportunities."
Paving the Way to Lift Controls
Iceland is a place of stunning natural beauty. Visitors can hike down a volcano and across glaciers, and see Niagara-Falls-like cataracts.
Since the financial crisis -- and, weirdly, since the 2010 eruption of a smallish volcano that darkened the skies on airline pathways to Europe -- tourism has flourished.
"When you enjoy the right conditions -- lower exchange rates, more attention because of eruptions in Iceland -- the stars align and things start happening," said Mr. Benediktsson. In 2014, tourism was up 100 percent from 2006.
"It's a much healthier place than it used to be," Gylfi Magnusson, a professor of finance at the University of Iceland, said, sitting in a cafe in downtown Reykjavik.
The city center used to be peppered with banks and finance companies; now there are cafes and shops catering to tourists. Among Iceland's current concerns: Wage increases are expected to lead to higher inflation.
Tourism has helped the recovery, but Iceland was built on fishing and power industries. Iceland's capital controls worked because there was a real economy underlying its temporary bout of insanity as a global banking giant.
And Iceland was willing to prescribe itself tough medicine to repair its tattered reputation.
"There was a consensus that they did not want to be seen as the village idiot," said Jon Danielsson, co-head of the Systemic Risk Center at the London School of Economics, and an Icelander. As the economy recovered, however, Iceland's capital controls became more and more of an albatross.
Recently, after years of acrimonious facing off, the hedge funds and the estates came to an agreement that prepares for lifting capital controls.
The government offered creditors the choice of taking a loss on their claims of about 3 billion euros, or 22 percent of G.D.P., by the end of the year.
If they do not accept those conditions, they would face a one-time "stability" tax that is estimated to reach [euro]4.6 billion, or 34 percent of G.D.P. It also put forward a plan to resolve the leftover carry trades.
While everyone agrees lifting the controls is necessary, the settlement has also stoked fear about what life will be like on the other side and whether Iceland can survive with its own currency.
The prime minister and finance minister -- who are from different parties -- say having its own currency allowed Iceland to save itself and stage a remarkable comeback. Greece, Spain and Italy, which use the euro, have not been so lucky, they note. Their adjustment has not been only through wage deflation, but also through job losses, which have proved more intractable.
But others think the world is too global for an island nation of 320,000 with a free-floating currency.
"It's crazy for us to keep our own currency," said Mr. Siguroddsson, the chairman of the electrical wholesaler. He advocates joining another currency, though he sees the struggles of Greece. "We need options."
While the government hopes to lift the controls next year, individuals, businesses and pension funds will still face limits.
Mr. Kristjansson, the fishing executive, is looking forward to borrowing money in international markets at lower rates, as in Norway where his competitors borrow at 1 percent.
"We are fishing for the same mackerel," he said.

Full text:   Stocks ended a tumultuous trading week with slight losses Thursday as investors sought safety ahead of an extended holiday weekend.
Investors bought at the opening of trading after a Labor Department report on job creation suggested the economy was improving, though not fast enough to raise the specter of inflation and higher interest rates. But the gains vanished after a downbeat report from the International Monetary Fund on Greece's finances as the country heads to a vote this weekend on its financial bailout.
It was a quiet end to an eventful week. The markets plunged worldwide on Monday over worries that a Greek default could spread losses throughout the global financial system. A continued drop in Chinese stocks added to the fears, as did a statement from Puerto Rico's governor that the commonwealth would not be able to pay back its large public debt.
Stocks rose a bit over the next two days, but by Thursday's close the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was still down 1.2 percent for the week, its biggest weekly loss in three months.
United States markets will be closed Friday in observance of the Independence Day holiday.
The S.&P. 500 slipped Thursday by 0.64 point, less than 0.1 percent, to 2,076.78. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.8 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,730.11. The Nasdaq fell 3.91 points, less than 0.1 percent, to 5,009.21.
"We've got Greece, we've got China and Puerto Rico," said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "Investors want to take some risk off the table."
In other data, orders to United States factories fell in May by 1 percent from April, the largest amount in three months, the Commerce Department reported. Much of the weakness reflected a big 35.3 percent fall in demand for commercial aircraft. But even outside the volatile transportation category, orders were up only 0.1 percent.
The lackluster showing suggests that manufacturing is still struggling with challenges like lower energy prices and a strong dollar, which dampen exports.
Investors bought bonds in anticipation that inflation and interest rates will remain low. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose, pushing down its yield to 2.39 percent from 2.43 percent just before the jobs report came out.
"There is no wage pressure and therefore no inflationary pressure. The Fed should just let the economy run," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. "Maybe instead of hiking rates in September, maybe it'll be in December, maybe March."
Six of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 fell Thursday. Utilities stocks, considered a conservative investment because of their big dividends, rose 1.4 percent.
Among stocks making big moves, Health Net rose $6.51, or 10 percent, to $71.57 after Medicaid coverage provider Centene said it will pay about $6.3 billion to buy the company. The deal is more evidence of managed-care companies looking to bulk up in response to the federal overhaul of health care.
BP shares listed in the United States rose $2.02, or 5 percent, to $41.29 after the oil driller reached an $18.7 billion settlement with several states to resolve litigation over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Tesla Motors rose $10.87, or 4 percent, to $280.02 after announcing second-quarter deliveries of its electric car surged 52 percent, exceeding 11,000 vehicles to set a company record. The stock has gained 26 percent so far this year despite consistently losing money.
The price of oil erased early gains and closed down slightly after a closely watched count of working drilling rigs had its first increase since December. Benchmark United States crude fell 3 cents Thursday to close at $56.93 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, rose 6 cents to close at $62.07 a barrel in London.
In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline rose 2.7 cents to close at $2.034 a gallon; heating oil rose 0.1 cent to close at $1.840 a gallon; and natural gas rose 3.9 cents to close at $2.822 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Precious and industrial metals futures closed mostly lower. Gold lost $6.00 to settle at $1,163 an ounce, silver fell two cents to $15.54 an ounce and copper was little changed at $2.63 a pound.

Full text:   Not too hot, not too cold. But not, alas, just right.
The economy added a healthy 223,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department reported Thursday, but with other indicators showing wages flat and many Americans remaining on the sidelines, the overall economic picture for workers was not nearly as bright.
Although the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent, the lowest in seven years, that was driven largely by an exodus from the work force, rather than more people finding jobs. Moreover, the strong payroll gains for April and May, which had led many analysts to conclude that the economy might finally be gaining momentum, were revised downward by 60,000 jobs.
"This was an O.K. report, but the unemployment rate didn't go down for the right reasons," said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.
Perhaps most discouraging, average hourly earnings didn't budge in June despite the drop in the unemployment rate from 5.5 percent in May, disappointing hopes that wages were finally increasing for most workers. It was a strong sign that plenty of slack remains in the job market, and that companies do not yet feel much pressure to raise pay to attract needed employees.
The share of American adults either working or looking for a job, which in many ways is a better gauge of economic strength than the oft-cited unemployment rate, fell 0.3 percentage point in June. With June's drop to 62.6 percent, the so-called labor participation rate is now at its lowest since 1977. Among prime-age adults, those 25 to 54, there has been no improvement in participation this year.
The latest jobs report is likely to sharpen debate among Federal Reserve officials about when to start raising the Fed's benchmark interest rate. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, and other officials have pointed to the healthy pace of job growth as a reason to raise rates later this year. They say a stronger labor market will inevitably result in faster inflation, and the Fed needs to start moving in anticipation of that trend.
Some officials, however, point to the weak pace of wage growth, which also continued in June, as evidence that concerns about inflation are premature.
The Fed has already indicated that it does not plan to raise rates before September, and some analysts said that remained the most likely scenario.
"Altogether, we do not view this report as significantly shifting opinions within the Fed about the timing of the first rate hike," Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, wrote on Thursday. "We continue to look for the first rate hike in September."
Investors, however, responded to the jobs report by increasing their bets that the Fed will not move until December, and perhaps not until next year. In New York, stocks initially rose after the report but finished the day modestly lower. Bond yields fell.
The Fed and private economists have been watching participation in the labor market closely for any sign that millions of people who dropped out of the work force after the recession are being lured back as hiring picks up.
That did not happen last month. Although seasonal factors and the timing of the survey of households by government pollsters in June may have exacerbated the drop in the size of the labor force, "we're not running out of slack," said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS.
The fall in the participation rate and the failure of hourly earnings to grow at all last month also suggest that the Fed still has plenty of room to maneuver as it waits for the right moment to move on rates, he said.
"The good news is that we are not on the verge of an inflation spiral and we can put people back to work for quite some time without the danger of inflation," Mr. Berger said.
Wage growth has picked up slightly this year, but gains remain relatively restrained. Over the last 12 months, wages are up 2 percent, only modestly ahead of inflation, which is running at around 1.5 percent, according to the latest data.
While the American economy is not delivering as many gains to workers as hoped for six full years into the recovery, conditions are better here than in many other advanced economies. Europe has been rocked by the continuing drama over whether Greece will exit the eurozone, and concerns are rising about the fallout from the slowdown in China's once white-hot economy.
As a result, exporters have had to contend with the headwinds from Europe, China and a stronger dollar, leaving domestically focused sectors like health care, education and professional services to supply much of the labor market's oomph.
White-collar workers in fields like insurance, software and marketing have been in especially high demand, a turnaround from the early days of the recovery, when many new jobs tended to be concentrated in low-wage sectors like retailing and restaurants.
But there is still a feast-or-famine quality in many corners of the American economy.
Since last summer, for example, the financial sector has added more than 100,000 new positions, bringing total employment in finance to just over eight million, the highest since the fall of 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed. In June alone, insurers, investment companies and other financial institutions added 20,000 workers.
"This is the best it's been since the recession," said Robert DeMeola, chief operating officer of CohnReznick, a midsize accounting firm based in New York and with offices nationwide. Referring to the competition he faces from deep-pocketed hedge funds and private equity firms looking for specialized talent, Mr. DeMeola said, "You can walk five blocks and get 50 jobs."
That may be poetic exaggeration, but CohnReznick is definitely hiring and paying up for the right people, those with the necessary degrees, accounting credentials and licensing. So far this year, CohnReznick has hired 90 directors and managers, whose salaries range from $100,000 to $300,000 and who tend to be either certified public accountants or lawyers.
There are similar tales around the country. "We're seeing companies put money into the back office," said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago-based staffing firm. "They want to hire for permanent positions in areas like marketing, human resources and accounting."
Even as those back-office, white-collar jobs are filled with workers who nearly always have bachelor's degrees, he noted, employers also want college graduates for positions where a high school diploma used to suffice, like call center operators.
As the pool of college graduates has grown larger, younger workers have found themselves forced to take jobs they once would have turned down cold.
"More kids are going to college and some of them don't have any choice," Mr. Gimbel said. Students from less prestigious colleges or candidates with lower grade point averages are taking jobs at call centers, earning $25,000 to $30,000 a year, he said.
On the brighter side, the Labor Department's broadest possible measure of unemployment, which includes people forced to take part-time jobs because full-time work was not available, fell 0.3 percentage point to 10.5 percent.

Full text:   The unicorns are multiplying, but if Andreessen Horowitz is right, the highflying venture capital community will have cause for concern when the inevitable thinning of the herd takes place.
The unicorns, of course, are the 60-odd technology start-ups that have taken investments valuing them at more than $1 billion each. The $50 billion valuation of Uber, the car-hailing service, has been held up as an illustration that Silicon Valley is in the middle of another bubble.
Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital giant, disagrees.
In a presentation made by three partners at Andreessen Horowitz -- Morgan Bender, Benedict Evans and Scott Kupor -- to the firm's limited partners last month, the three argued that the most recent exuberance was different from that of the dot-com era. The firm released the document -- "U.S. Tech Funding -- What's Going On" -- to the public, and it is worth a look, not just for the debate over whether a bubble exists but also because it leads indirectly to the fate of the unicorns and the eventual fallout.
The presentation is chock-full of statistics justifying high valuations: E-commerce is only 6 percent of retail revenue in the United States, so there is room to grow. Four billion people are online compared with 40 million in 1995. And technology funding as a percentage of gross domestic product is only 2.6 percent of the economy compared with 10.8 percent in 1999, so the market is not flooded with cash.
So maybe this time is different, but the presentation also talks up the unicorns as the big factor.
The Andreessen Horowitz partners argue that the gains that used to go to the public through initial stock offerings are now being transferred to private investors. For instance, Facebook went public with a valuation of more than $100 billion, and all of its gains went into private hands. For Facebook to match Microsoft's public market returns, it would have to be worth $45 trillion, according to the presentation.
The unicorns are an extension of this and would have simply gone public earlier in a previous age. But now that the small I.P.O. has essentially vanished, it is the venture capitalists who profit by building a diversified portfolio and investing in these "quasi I.P.O.s," which grab even more of the gains than Facebook.
It's easy to dismiss this presentation as Andreessen Horowitz simply talking its book. After all, the firm is at ground zero of the unicorn frenzy and has been accused of bidding up valuations and inflating the bubble. And the presentation may miss the main point in its claims about changing markets. Namely, even if markets are shifting, that doesn't mean that Instacart is worth $2 billion.
Additionally, these unicorns are not like big public companies, which normally have low bankruptcy rates. They are big bets on the future. If the Andreessen Horowitz partners are right, then the unicorns would have failure rates like big public companies', namely only 1 to 3 percent. And that is unlikely. Instead, they are more likely to have small company and venture capital failure rates of about a third.
And markets may not be shifting as much as people think. The aphorism about the decline of the small initial public offering has been running for about a decade now. But the truth is that the small I.P.O. went away in 1998. In 1997, there were 180 small I.P.O.s, defined as those with net proceeds of less than $31 million in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to Thomson Reuters. By 2000, there were only 24 as the Internet bubble pushed everyone to invest in bigger companies. Once there, investors continued to invest in bigger companies.
This preference may be because the smaller companies weren't that great. About a third of the companies that went public after 1996 went bankrupt, and the remainder didn't grow for the large part. There were no big home runs like Microsoft from previous years that compensated for companies that fizzled. The days when a Microsoft could go public with little or no revenue are gone. Investors now want big initial public offerings with real businesses, not speculation.
The venture capital market now looks like the defunct small I.P.O. market without the big upside. About a third of the companies make money, compensating for the rest of the investments, which either stagnate or go bankrupt.
And this is where the Andreessen Horowitz presentation inadvertently highlights the problem of the unicorns: No exit.
Competition among venture capitalists to get in on technology start-ups is driving up prices exponentially. But that pricing is justified only if there is an exit. And as Dan Primack noted recently in Fortune, there isn't one for unicorns. There have been only eight technology I.P.O.s and two unicorn sales this year, including Lynda.com to LinkedIn.
During the dot-com bubble, venture capitalists could exit their investments through the public markets, foisting the eventual losses on them. But with valuations skyrocketing this time around and gains being captured by private investors, there is no I.P.O. or sale potential for many of these companies. Even a sale to Google or Facebook is a flier. And let's face it -- these giants may already have buyer's remorse. Does Nest still look as if it is worth $3 billion?
Of course, some will be successful and go public. Uber and Airbnb will surely have billions of dollars in value. And Google and Facebook may throw a few billion dollars more at some of these companies. But even the tech giants are wary of these valuations, and many more unicorns are likely to fail as venture capital companies run their normal life cycle. And there will not be much to salvage, especially with companies increasingly agreeing to cover some investors' losses as part of late-stage financing.
The documents for these financings will make for ugly trench warfare between old investors and new when these unicorns seek to raise more financing as their valuations deflate. Andreessen Horowitz may profit if Uber and a few others make it, but it will most likely have to fight it out in many other investments.
The Andreessen Horowitz presentation may be right that the private markets have crowded out the public ones in Silicon Valley, but it does not justify the valuation spiral or identify who will buy these unicorns. Perhaps most important, it is silent on how to salvage a unicorn investment when it sours.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- For all the ambition of President Obama's plan to significantly expand the number of Americans eligible for overtime pay, the proposal falls well short of helping substantially increase middle-class wages, its chief advertised benefit.
"This rule will raise wages and lead to better lives for millions of working people in the lower middle part of the labor market," said Damon Silvers, policy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Of course it's necessary, but it's not sufficient. Not by a long shot. Wage stagnation is a problem for 90 percent of workers." The rule would raise the salary threshold for workers to automatically receive time-and-a-half pay after working 40 hours in a week, lifting it from its current level of $23,660 to $50,440, where it last stood in the mid-1970s in terms of purchasing power. The new threshold would also rise over time so that inflation does not significantly erode its value.
"This proposed overtime rule goes to the heart of what it means to be middle-class in America," Labor Secretary Thomas Perez told reporters Tuesday. As the threshold for overtime pay has "atrophied," he said, "it's no coincidence that so too has the middle class's ability to get ahead and stay ahead."
Given the political hurdles, the White House and its allies argue, the overtime rule represents a major advance.
"This is the middle-class equivalent of raising the minimum wage," said Senator Charles Schumer of New York. "It's about the only thing that can be done by the president with the stroke of the pen that will have a significant effect."
Still, Senator Schumer acknowledged that substantially raising the income of typical workers would require a much more robust agenda, including expanding access to community college, a highway bill to create more construction jobs, incentives for companies to raise wages and strengthening unions.
There are three main categories of workers who stand to benefit from the overtime change. They tend to be white-collar workers in industries like finance, professional and business services, and wholesale and retailing.
The first category includes workers in the $23,660 to $50,440 salary range who, under the current federal rules, are legitimately exempt from receiving overtime pay because their jobs involve some professional, managerial or supervisory duties. The administration estimates that there are nearly five million workers who fit this description, and that many companies will simply raise their salaries above the new threshold to keep them exempt. Others will become eligible for overtime or have their hours cut back, or both.
The second category includes workers in the targeted salary range, like clerks, who should already be eligible for overtime pay because their jobs feature no bona fide managerial or supervisory component and no independent responsibility, but whom employers have misclassified and denied overtime pay.
The third category includes workers in the targeted salary range who are eligible to receive overtime and currently receive it, but who are vulnerable to such reclassification.
The administration has circulated documents showing that there were roughly 10 million workers combined in the latter two categories. The new rule would make it substantially more difficult to deprive them of the extra pay to which they are legally entitled.
Critics representing business complain that the change will raise costs for employers and lead to less hiring. "Making more employees eligible for overtime by severely restricting the exemptions will not guarantee more income, but instead will negatively impact small businesses and drastically limit employment opportunities," Randel Johnson, a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.
At the very least, many such critics contend, the new rule will cause employers to reduce hours so as not to set off the overtime pay scale.
But whatever its ultimate impact, the proposed overtime change only scratches the surface of the bigger problem: While a broad range of workers once reaped the benefits of economic growth, the affluent have captured a rising share in recent decades, leaving the wages of everyone else to stagnate.
"We've had a full breakdown between productivity gains and wage increases," said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a research group aligned closely with Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign. "It becomes very sharp from 2000 on."
According to detailed tax data compiled by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty, the top 10 percent of families captured just under 90 percent of the total growth in income between 2009 and 2014. All other families split the remaining 10 percent.
To overcome this disparity, labor advocates and other experts say, there are two main approaches that promise to increase middle-class wages considerably. The first would be to improve the bargaining power of workers, so that they could claim more of the wealth generated by productivity gains, which the affluent are keeping primarily to themselves.
"I do believe the single biggest factor contributing to middle-class wage stagnation is the erosion of unions and collective bargaining rights," said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, who has studied the effect of the decline.
The second type of policy change would be to limit the incomes of those nearest the top of the ladder -- by reining in the favorable tax treatment of executive pay, for example, or raising income tax rates.
"It's really about preventing the top from grabbing too large a share of the economic pie," Mr. Saez said in an email. "Restraining the top would boost bottom incomes by making economic growth more equitable to start with."
Given the resistance in Congress to the president's agenda, however, it is hard to imagine much progress on these fronts in the remaining year and a half of his term. And given the obstacles Mr. Obama encountered even when his party controlled both houses of Congress, a new Democratic president would undoubtedly face huge obstacles as well.
Some states like Wisconsin and Michigan have recently passed laws that undermine collective bargaining rights for certain workers, drain unions of membership fees and remove incentives for workers to join them.
The day after the president announced his overtime rule, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case, known as Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, that could bring so-called right-to-work arrangements to public sector workers, like teachers.
Research published by the Economic Policy Institute this year showed that wages in right-to-work states, where workers can opt out of paying union fees even though they benefit from union protection and collective bargaining, were, controlling for relevant factors, 3.1 percent lower than those in other states.
To some of his allies, the president has even muddied his own efforts to help lift the middle class by aggressively promoting trade promotion authority, which Congress approved last week. The measure will make it easier to pass the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement the administration is negotiating, which progressives fear will throw blue-collar Americans into even greater competition with low-wage workers abroad.
The debate over wages is emerging as the key battleground of the 2016 presidential campaign. Republicans like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have styled themselves fixers of middle-class wage stagnation, casting many of their views on limited government and free enterprise as solutions to the problem.
Among Democrats, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has pressured the front-runner, Mrs. Clinton, with his bluntness about the need to strengthen unions and rein in the wealthy.
"What I'm going to say to the top 1 percent and the top 0.1 percent is, 'Sorry, you have to pay your fair share of taxes,' " Mr. Sanders said in an interview. "The American people do not look kindly on a society where they can't afford to send their kids to college and the richest people in the country become phenomenally richer."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil said at the White House on Tuesday that the spying scandal that damaged ties with the United States had been surmounted because telephones between Brasília and Washington work both ways.
In 2013, Ms. Rousseff canceled a planned state visit, a rare honor, because of revelations that the National Security Agency had hacked into her cellphone and private email. While the Brazilian government demanded a written explanation and an apology, no expression of regret ever came.
But on Tuesday, Ms. Rousseff said that President Obama's promise that such spying had ended was enough for her, in part because he had told her that "should he ever need nonpublic information about Brazil, he would just pick up the phone and call me."
Ms. Rousseff's change of heart could also be a result of a series of crises that have enveloped her administration almost from the moment she won a second term late last year. Her approval rating was only 10 percent in a poll conducted in June by the Brazilian firm Datafolha, a major drop from 42 percent last December.
Brazil's economy is widely thought to be in recession, unemployment is rising along with inflation and consumer debt, and the central bank continues to raise interest rates, further hurting growth. So fixing Ms. Rousseff's relationship with the United States and wooing American investors are widely seen as vital to Brazil's recovery.
Ms. Rousseff spent Monday in New York speaking to investors, had dinner Monday night with Mr. Obama in the White House, and will be in California on Wednesday for meetings with technology, biotechnology and air-and-space executives.
Midday on Tuesday, she stood beside Mr. Obama and declared that Brazil would, like the United States after the 2008 recession, emerge from its present problems. "We will do so very sure-footedly, very decisively, with a great sense of commitment," she said.
Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy analysis group, said that Ms. Rousseff was hoping that a successful trip could help stop the bleeding from a miserable year.
"She's in real trouble," Mr. Shifter said.
Besides a poor economy, Ms. Rousseff must contend with a huge corruption scandal involving a onetime jewel, the state-owned oil company Petrobras, which continues to widen. Marcelo Odebrecht, the powerful chief executive of the construction and chemicals conglomerate Odebrecht -- a major backer of Ms. Rousseff's political party -- was arrested and charged with leading a bribery scheme this month.
In response to a question about the scandal, Ms. Rousseff gave a rambling answer in which she insisted that "people have the right of proving that they are innocent," that "the burden of proof lies on the accusing party," and that anything less "would send us back to the Middle Ages."
Ms. Rousseff also complimented Mr. Obama on his decision to open diplomatic relations with Cuba, praise that came a day before the United States and Cuba are expected to announce the opening of embassies in Havana and Washington.
"It is really about putting an end to the last lingering vestiges of the Cold War, and it ultimately elevates the level of the relations between the U.S. and the entire region," Ms. Rousseff said. "May I acknowledge the importance of that gesture to all of Latin America and also to world peace at large."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. President Obama announced Monday night a rule change that would make millions more Americans eligible for overtime pay.
The rule would raise the salary threshold below which workers automatically qualify for time-and-a-half overtime wages to $50,440 a year from $23,660, according to an op-ed article by the president in The Huffington Post.
"Right now, too many Americans are working long days for less pay than they deserve," the president wrote.
The administration has the power to issue the regulation, which would restore the overtime salary threshold to roughly where it stood in 1975 in terms of purchasing power, without congressional approval.
Advocates for the change immediately hailed the decision.
"The president said he wanted to go big here and he did," said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economist who co-wrote an influential report on the benefits of expanding overtime pay after leaving the administration in 2011. "I can't think of any other rule change or executive order that would lift more middle-class workers."
At least two candidates for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have urged action on the overtime regulations.
Conservatives and business groups have bitterly opposed the idea, warning that it will cost jobs. The National Retail Federation, a trade group, has argued that expanded overtime will "add to employers' costs, undermine customer service, hinder productivity, generate more litigation opportunities for trial lawyers and ultimately harm job creation."
The rule, which would most likely be completed in 2016, would give workers whose salary is between the current threshold and the new threshold a raise if they work more than 40 hours a week. Advocates on both sides of the issue expect the policy to be challenged in court and perhaps in Congress as well.
Republicans could, for example, attach a so-called rider undoing the change to must-pass appropriations measures later this year.
The momentum for the rule change increased after Mr. Bernstein and a colleague, Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute, wrote their report in late 2013, one of a number of papers the Labor Department commissioned to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
By March 2014, the president had been won over, ordering the department to revise federal overtime rules. What followed was escalating pressure from labor, liberal activists, and Democratic politicians encouraging the administration to expand overtime eligibility as broadly as possible, despite pushback from businesses.
That was particularly true after reports last fall that the administration was considering a more modest rule change.
"We made it known that critics are going to criticize them no matter what they do," said Kelly Ross, deputy policy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "If what they want to do is have an impact on wages, they need to go big here."
Assuming the rule is put in place, economists believe that many employers will most likely reduce workers' hours so as to save on overtime pay. Even so, the White House believes the rule could affect nearly five million workers in the short term. Meanwhile, any attempt to scale back hours could increase hiring.
Over the longer term, the effect of the rule could diminish substantially as employers offer new hires a lower base wage. This could make their overall pay, including the higher overtime wage, equivalent to what comparable employees make today in the absence of the overtime rule.
In that case, Mr. Bernstein said, future workers would only benefit if they end up working more overtime hours than the employer expected when negotiating their wage. Under the proposed rule, the overtime threshold will be indexed to some measure to rise over time, although the exact measure isn't likely to be settled until after a public comment period.
Correction: July 1, 2015, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a proposed overtime rule change announced by President Obama misidentified which workers would be covered. The change would affect salaried workers earning below $50,440 a year, not hourly workers. The article also overstated plans to adjust the wage threshold over time. Adjustments to the $50,440 figure have yet to be determined; it is not necessarily the case that the wage threshold would be indexed to some measure of inflation.

Full text:   While nothing to brag about, the economy's performance in early 2015 was not quite as bad as the number crunchers in Washington had thought.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015, an upward revision from the 0.7 percent contraction reported last month.
The result, which was the third estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product, is hardly good news, but with the final revision now out, the prevailing view that the weakness was caused mostly by temporary factors -- not more fundamental ones -- seems to have been borne out.
Cold weather hurt retail sales in early 2015 as shoppers stayed home, while a labor dispute at ports on the West Coast hurt the trade balance. The repeated pattern of first-quarter weakness has also prompted government economists and statisticians to review how they compile the data for growth.
"Activity is bubbling beneath the surface, and the economy seems to be resilient in the face of global headwinds," said Gregory Daco, who is based in New York, the head of United States macroeconomics for Oxford Economics, a private forecasting firm.
The final revision was driven largely by improved data for consumer activity, continued gains in the housing industry and additional restocking of shelves and warehouses by businesses.
"The first quarter was soft, but growth through the rest of the year should be much better," said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn.
In recent months, fresher economic indicators have shown retail activity picking up, as well as healthy gains in payrolls and new-home sales. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that new-home sales last month reached their highest level since 2008.
The good news in the real estate market is an important step forward. Housing led the rest of the economy down in the recession, and a plunge in construction contributed to the loss of millions of jobs.
While new-home sales remain well below their peak during the housing boom of the mid-2000s, their gradual recovery bodes well for overall economic growth. After shedding more than two million jobs during the recession and afterward, construction companies have regained about a half-million positions in the last two years.
Most economists are looking for the annual rate of growth to rebound to between 2 and 3 percent in the second quarter, which will end on Tuesday. That is a significant shift from the beginning of June, when many economists predicted that growth would barely top 2 percent for the April, May and June period.
Still, Mr. Berger cautioned that it remained to be seen whether some of the headwinds that hurt growth in the first quarter -- like the stronger dollar -- would persist throughout 2015. "The dollar's impact isn't played out," he said. "Drags from trade tend to take a while to fully materialize."
Over the next three quarters, Mr. Berger expects the economy to expand at an annual rate of about 3 percent. Given the contraction in the first quarter, that would bring the annual growth rate for 2015 to 2.2 percent. Last year, when the economy registered an even deeper dip in the first quarter, the annual rate of growth was 2.4 percent.
While the trade picture will remain cloudy as exporters feel the pinch from the strong dollar, the steady pace of gains in the labor market should bolster the American economy's overall health this year. Next week, the Labor Department will report on hiring and unemployment in June. Economists estimate that payrolls will grow by well over 200,000 and that the unemployment rate will fall slightly.
"We're very focused on the labor market -- that's the single most important bellwether for the economy," Mr. Berger said. "As long as the job market remains healthy, that should spill over into healthier consumer spending."

Abstract: The Fed is expected to hold off on raising interest rates until it feels confident that such a move won't undermine the economic recovery -- and, as a result, it may put off any rate increases until next year.

Full text:   Greed and fear are the primal forces that in the past have driven the stock market to its highs and lows. Now the dominant emotion among investors seems to be lukewarm enthusiasm.
The power of this barely positive thinking can be seen as Greece and Europe appear to edge closer to a debt deal. Avoiding a financial disaster on the Continent would remove a pressing worry that has been hanging over the market for months.
Instead of cheering, however, investors will most likely return to fretting over a long list of concerns. And if recent trends continue, they will keep grudgingly buying stocks anyhow.
The worries that investors have are numerous and endlessly debated: the impact of the Federal Reserve's increasing interest rates, tepid earnings in corporate America, a stronger dollar, conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, and that perennial favorite of the pessimists, something bad happening in China.
The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 3.2 percent so far this year. But in a testament to the low-energy vibe of this market, the index has not risen or fallen by 2 percent or more on any single trading day in 2015.
"The market would have a heart attack if we did 3 percent," said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Still, this unappreciated bull market has carried stocks 214 percent higher since March 2009 -- and it recently became the third-longest bull market in the postwar period, according to S.&P. It is now 75 months long, just ahead of the ascent that took place between 1974 and 1980. (It still lags the 86-month rally between 1949 and 1956 and the nearly 10-year bull run that ended in 2000.)
Yet as stocks keep rising, investors keep shrugging.
A survey by the American Association of Individual Investors shows that 40 percent of individual investors are "neutral" about where the stock market is headed in the next six months. And those two-fifths saying "meh" about the market eclipse the 25 percent who said they were bullish.
"One thing that has been quite striking about stocks is the lack of participation of the retail investor," said Gina C. Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.
The Wall Street professionals who prognosticate about the broader stock market are also wanly optimistic. Right now, stock strategists, on average, are recommending that investors have 52 percent of their portfolios in stocks, well below the 60 to 65 percent share that brokerage firms typically recommend as a basic allocation, according to Savita Subramanian, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
But stocks actually tend to do well when analysts have a low level of conviction. "In the past when strategists have been as or more bearish than they are today, the market has moved higher over the next 12 months 98 percent of the time," Ms. Subramanian wrote in an email.
At some point, however, something will most likely trip up the market -- and it may be some of the concerns that analysts have anguished over in recent years.
With a Greek exit from the euro possibly receding as a fear, the Fed's interest rate policies will most likely now loom as the most immediate concern. The Fed is expected to hold off on raising interest rates until it feels confident that such a move won't undermine the economic recovery -- and, as a result, it may put off any rate increases until next year. In theory, if the economy is then stronger than it is today, corporate earnings will also be more robust, potentially offsetting the anxiety among investors caused by a rise in interest rates.
But all sorts of negative chain reactions can take place when the Fed lifts rates. If the European economy is still weak when it happens, the region will most likely have lower interest rates than in the United States. This could prompt a rally in the dollar against the euro. And when that happened earlier this year, it caused an unexpected hit to many United States companies, particularly exporters.
Higher interest rates could also upset the delicate balance that has helped keep stocks elevated. Company earnings, which typically undergird stock prices over the longer term, have not grown at a strong pace. Investors have been happy to tolerate that at a time when low interest rates have meant investors get low payouts in the bond market.
If the Fed were to raise rates, bond yields would also go up, making bonds look more attractive. In the adjustment, the valuations on stocks may come down -- and stay down.
And after so many years of low inflation, some analysts are now starting to account for the possibility of inflation rising to a level that causes a big sell-off in the bond market.
Productivity indicators are currently low for the United States economy, which means that companies may not absorb a rise in wages, but pass it on to consumers in the form of higher prices, stoking inflation. The Fed may then have to apply the brakes more sharply than investors anticipated, roiling the wider market.
"I think the inflation story is turning around," said David Rosenberg, an economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. "If we get into an interest rate cycle, things are going to change. Very few Fed tightening cycles ended well."
Even then, the shakeout may not be as bad as the one in, say, 2008. The worst busts in the market tend to follow times of untrammeled excess. The so-so economy of the last few years could stop stocks from tipping into a long slough in the market.
Or as Mr. Rosenberg put it: "Without the boom, you don't get the bear."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices in the United States rose in May at the fastest clip in over two years, as gasoline prices surged, suggesting the impact of lower oil prices on inflation probably is fading.
Other data on Thursday showed the economy gaining speed after stumbling in the first quarter. New applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to a near 15-year low and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a six-month high in June.
The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in April, the Labor Department said. That was the largest increase since February 2013, and left the index unchanged in the 12 months through May after a 0.2 percent yearly decline in April.
While energy prices are stabilizing, a strong dollar is weighing on underlying inflation pressures. The so-called core C.P.I., which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent, the smallest increase in five months, after a 0.3 percent jump in April.
In the 12 months through May, the core C.P.I. rose 1.7 percent, slowing from a yearly increase of 1.8 percent in April.
In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week that ended June 13. It was the 15th straight week that claims held below 300,000, a threshold usually associated with a firming labor market.
The claims data covered the period in which the government surveyed employers for the payrolls portion of June's employment report.
"The labor market appears to be in good health through the June payroll survey period," said Guy Berger, an economist at R.B.S. in Stamford, Conn. "This ongoing labor market resilience is important, because it underpins our forecast of a rebound in the economy during the remainder of 2015."
Growth prospects were further bolstered by a third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank showing its business activity index jumped to a reading of 15.2 in June, the highest level since December, from 6.7 in May.
A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's factories. Measures of new orders and shipments also rose to their highest levels since November.
While manufacturers reported a rise in the cost of inputs, they were also increasing prices for their goods, a trend that supports the view that inflation will creep higher in the months ahead.
The economy's gains were underscored by yet another report from the Conference Board showing its Leading Economic Index rose 0.7 percent last month after a similar gain in April.
"Both reports provided some support to the current underlying narrative that the positive momentum in domestic economic activity is being sustained," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
A 10.4 percent jump in gasoline prices in May accounted for most of the increase in the C.P.I. It was the biggest increase since June 2009, and followed a 1.7 percent decline in April.

Relieved by Fed's Signals, Markets Rise

Abstract: "The Fed's likely to raise rates later this year, but maybe not as aggressively as some market participants worried," said Michael Baele, managing director and senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Private Client Reserve.

Full text:   U.S. stocks notched their biggest gains in a week Thursday, pushing the Nasdaq index to a new nominal high.
The rally came a day after the Federal Reserve suggested that it wasn't planning to raise interest rates right away. Ultra-low rates over the past six years have helped drive a bull market in stocks.
"The Fed's likely to raise rates later this year, but maybe not as aggressively as some market participants worried," said Michael Baele, managing director and senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Private Client Reserve.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 180.10 points, or 1 percent, to 18,115.84. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 20.80 points, or 1 percent, to 2,121.24.
The Nasdaq added 68.07 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at 5,132.95, surpassing the most-recent high for the index of 5,106.59 set May 27. Adjusted for inflation, it would have to climb close to 7,000 to actually set a record.
Most major U.S. stock indexes are up for the year, but the Nasdaq is turning in the best performance. It's up 8.4 percent this year, compared with a gain of 3 percent for the S.&P. 500 index and 1.6 percent for the Dow.
The Nasdaq's rise has been driven by technology and health care. In a slow-growth world, investors are favoring stocks where earnings will be better than average. Faster-growing companies should also fare better should rates eventually rise, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital.
While the Nasdaq, which tracks 2,500-plus stocks, has been steadily climbing since 2011, its ascent isn't the crazed surge that drove it to its dot-com bubble-era highs in 2000. This time the gains are underpinned by solid companies said Stephen Freedman, senior investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas.
The average price-earnings ratio of the Nasdaq, a measure of how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of earnings the companies in the index generate, is 21. When the Nasdaq was at its highest, the ratio reached 194.
Drug developer BioMarin Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company Radius Health were among the big gainers in the index on Thursday. Both companies reported positive news on treatments still in development. BioMarin vaulted $15.06, or 12.2 percent, to $138.66, while Radius added $7.91, or 15.3 percent, to $59.64.
Investors also welcomed the market debut of fitness-tracking gear company Fitbit on Thursday. The company's stock jumped $9.68, or 48.4 percent, to $29.68 after pricing its initial public offering at $20 per share.
Traders also got an indication that the economy was recovering from its weak start to the year. An index designed to predict the future health of the economy posted a second straight strong increase in May, indicating the economy should gain strength in the second half of this year.
Separately, weekly applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to a seasonally adjusted 267,000, near 15-year lows reached two months ago.
Despite the upbeat day, investors still haven't forgotten about Greece.
The debt-stricken nation and its international lenders are deadlocked in bailout talks. Greece needs more loans from its creditors before June 30, when its current bailout program expires and a 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) debt repayment is due. Greece and its creditors blame one another for an impasse in the talks. A default could result in Greece leaving the euro currency bloc, dealing a blow to the project.
Bonds edged lower, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up to 2.33 percent from 2.32 percent late Wednesday.
The dollar weakened as traders priced in a lower trajectory for Fed rate increases. The U.S. currency dropped to 122.83 yen from 123.58 yen on Wednesday. The euro strengthened slightly to $1.1404 from $1.1354.
The price of oil rose Thursday as the dollar weakened, making oil more attractive to holders of foreign currencies. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 53 cents to close at $60.45 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oil used by many U.S. refineries, rose 39 cents to close at $64.26 in London.
In metals trading, gold rose $25.20 to $1,202 an ounce. Silver climbed 21 cents to $16.15 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.60 a pound.
In other futures trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline rose 1 cent to close at $2.111 a gallon; heating oil rose 0.5 cent to close at $1.915 a gallon; and natural gas fell 7.8 cents to close at $2.777 per 1,000 cubic feet.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Almost all the 17 Fed officials on the Federal Open Market Committee expect to raise rates this year, but seven now expect no more than a single increase, compared with three who held that view in March. Ms. Yellen described these reductions in the expected level of interest rates over the next several years as more important than the month the central bank chooses to start raising rates.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The era of easy money is not ending yet.
The Federal Reserve indicated on Wednesday, following a meeting of its policy committee, that it plans to raise interest rates even more slowly than its officials had previously predicted.
The Fed still plans to start raising rates before the end of the year. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said that growth had rebounded after a difficult winter, and that the Fed was simply waiting to make sure the economy was finally ready for higher rates. But she emphasized that even after rate hikes began, borrowing costs would remain low for years.
"It's not an ironclad guarantee, but we anticipate that that's something that will be appropriate later this year," Ms. Yellen said at a news conference on Wednesday, referring to raising rates above zero for the first time since December 2008.
For years, Fed officials said they expected to begin the process in June, but they are now delaying at least until September in part because economic growth has once again disappointed. In a retreat that has become a ritual for the overly optimistic central bank, officials said in a new round of economic forecasts published Wednesday that they expected the economy to grow this year by 1.8 percent to 2 percent. In March, they predicted growth of 2.3 percent to 2.7 percent.
Almost all the 17 Fed officials on the Federal Open Market Committee expect to raise rates this year, but seven now expect no more than a single increase, compared with three who held that view in March.
Officials also predicted they would raise rates more slowly in subsequent years. On average they now expect rates to reach 1.75 percent by the end of 2016. Last June, the average prediction was that rates would reach 2.5 percent by the end of 2016.
Ms. Yellen described these reductions in the expected level of interest rates over the next several years as more important than the month the central bank chooses to start raising rates.
"I want to emphasize sometimes too much attention is placed on the timing of the first increase," she said. "What should matter to market participants is the entire trajectory of expected policy."
Investors appeared to accept the argument. Even without any apparent change in the timing of the first increase, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to 2.306 percent after the announcement, from 2.315 percent on Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 0.2 percent to close at 2,100.44.
"The real question is not when they start but how fast and how high they go," said Kim Schoenholtz, an economist at New York University. "And what we've seen is they keep scaling back the equilibrium rate they intend to reach and the pace they intend to get there."
Analysts continued to predict that the Fed would most likely start raising rates when it meets in September, but many investors remain skeptical.
The prices of interest-rate-sensitive assets continue to reflect an expectation that the Fed will wait until December, or possibly until next year, before it increases rates. And that strategy of betting against the Fed's optimism has been consistently profitable in recent years.
But Gene Tannuzzo, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said skepticism had run its course.
"The market is pricing in some doubt that they will get started," he said. "Looking forward from here, I think Ms. Yellen will do what she has said."
The economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the first quarter, and forecasters outside the Fed have also reduced their expectations for the year.
Job growth, however, has remained relatively strong. The economy added a monthly average of 217,000 jobs in the first five months of the year.
Officials predicted that the unemployment rate would decline more slowly in coming months than they had previously anticipated. It sat at 5.5 percent in May, and the Fed now expects that it will end the year at 5.2 to 5.3 percent, compared with an expectation in March that it might go as low as 5 percent. That is a significant change, because it means officials now expect that rate to end the year at or above its estimated long-term equilibrium rate of 5.0 to 5.2 percent.
But Ms. Yellen said the change actually reflected the increased strength of the economy. She said that participation in the labor force appeared to be stabilizing as people became more optimistic about finding work, and that she saw "tentative signs of stronger wage growth."
A small group of Fed officials has already concluded that a rate increase this year would be premature, pointing to the sluggish pace of inflation. The Fed's preferred measure of prices rose by 1.2 percent in the 12 months ended in April, and it has remained below the Fed's 2 percent target for three straight years. The International Monetary Fund has also urged the Fed to wait.
But officials who want to start raising rates this year remain optimistic about coming years, at least for now, predicting economic growth of up to 2.7 percent in 2016 and up to 2.5 percent in 2017.
They argue that growth will be strong enough to justify their expectation that inflation will rebound. Officials made little change in the inflation forecasts, predicting that prices would rise no more than 0.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent next year. They also continued to predict that inflation might reach the Fed's 2 percent target in 2017.
"If you'd gone to sleep a few years ago and someone had said to you unemployment is at 5.5 percent and the economy is growing, yet interest rates are at zero, you'd be a bit surprised," Mr. Schoenholtz said. "There are good reasons why rates are at zero, but the Fed has been very cautious in postponing rate hikes as long as it has."
The Fed's stance contrasts with that of major central banks in Europe and Asia, which remain deeply immersed in efforts to revive their economies. For the United States, the weakness of the global economy has weighed on growth, driving up the value of the dollar and limiting demand for American exports. "If foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the U.S. economy could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise," Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, said last month.
Raising interest rates also could disrupt financial markets, although the consequences are hard to predict. There have been only a handful of tightening cycles in the Fed's hundred-year history, and the differences outweigh the similarities. "Our experience suggests that it's hard to have great confidence in predicting what the market reaction will be" to Fed decisions, Ms. Yellen said at her news conference.
As if to emphasize those differences, Ms. Yellen said that it was possible the Fed should have raised rates more quickly during the last tightening cycle, from 2004 to 2006, even as she underscored the Fed's intention to move more slowly this time.

Full text:   WESLEY CHAPEL, Fla. -- Donte and Anjoli Hill postponed their honeymoon indefinitely and squirreled away cash wedding gifts in order to afford the down payment on the four-bedroom house they bought a few months ago in this Tampa suburb.
In the process, they weren't just securing a home where they could start a family one day. They were helping the United States housing market return to normal pricing after 15 years of yo-yoing insanity.
A decade ago the market was unquestionably too hot. Four years ago it was too cold. Now, by a wide range of measures, nationwide home prices look relatively normal when compared with incomes, rents and other fundamentals -- and are rising at similar low, single-digit rates.
In contrast to the periods of irrational optimism and pessimism, the market is settling into a balance in which buyers are comfortable spending what they can afford given their income and savings, but aren't willing (or able to persuade lenders) to stretch beyond that. Among buyers there is neither a sense of desperation to buy now on the assumption prices will rise rapidly, nor of fear they will plummet.
For a while in 2013 and early 2014, national home prices were rising at a double-digit percentage rate, which if sustained could have rapidly led housing back to its bubble-era extremes. But the reality -- of caution on the part of home buyers and their lenders -- soon set in. In the 12 months ended in March, the S.&P. Case-Shiller national home price index rose only 4.1 percent, not much higher than the rise in Americans' incomes and broadly consistent with longer-term trends.
"The market is coming back, but we're not having astronomical growth," said Thomas O'Bryant Jr., the chief executive of the Greater Tampa Association of Realtors. "We're having the kind of growth that is going to be sustainable, and any time you have steady growth it's much better than having bubble growth."
Prices have risen faster than incomes and rents since the beginning of the last decade, and by those measures remain high by historical standards. But a downward march in mortgage rates has made housing more affordable on a typical American's income. Add it all up, and Fitch Ratings calculates that American housing is currently 3 percent overvalued, which counts as sustainable in the firm's analysis. (It was 26 percent overvalued versus economic fundamentals in early 2006 and 7 percent undervalued at the end of 2011). Similar calculations by economists at the real estate website Trulia this year found the national housing market was 2 percent undervalued.
As always with housing, each local market has its own dynamics. Analysis from Fitch suggests that there are signs of excessive home prices in the Bay Area and other coastal markets, and of continued underpricing in parts of New England and the industrial Midwest. And there are plenty of markets where both rents and home prices have risen much faster than incomes over the last generation, so affordability is an issue in much of the nation.
But to see how home prices are now lining up better with fundamentals, consider the transaction history of the yellow 2,700-square-foot house on Spoonflower Circle where the Hills have been busy installing new door fixtures and a ceiling fan with help from how-to videos on YouTube.
It was built in 2006 and sold for $304,388, then was in foreclosure limbo for years before selling for $141,000 last year while it was in need of improvements. The Hills, who married last September, paid $192,000 in March, and were able to move in to a house with new appliances and fresh paint.
A person earning the 2006 average weekly wage in Pasco County, where the house is, would have had to pay 73 percent of her income to buy the house, assuming prevailing mortgage rates and a 10 percent down payment. At its foreclosure last year, that fell to 22 percent, given the lower sale price and mortgage rates, along with inflation and income growth. The mortgage on the price the Hills paid in March equaled 29 percent of an average county resident's income, about the level financial planners recommend.
After a long round trip, the price of the house in this particular middle-class suburban subdivision pretty much makes sense given the incomes of middle-class people in the surrounding county.
Donte Hill, 31, sells insurance for a living; Anjoli, 33, works in marketing. Their decision to buy after years of renting embodies the new era of balance in the housing and rental markets.
"You want stability, and so you want to make sure you can afford it and sustain the debt you're taking on, so that you have something no one can take away from you," Ms. Hill said.
She made spreadsheets to figure out what they could afford; he researched risks of things like sinkholes and flooding. By their math, renting a house with the equivalent of their mortgage payment would have covered a somewhat smaller house, and the total costs of renting versus buying -- incorporating things like homeowners' association fees -- are roughly equivalent.
Their lender, they said, carefully vetted their income and where the down payment had come from.
"They verified three years of employment and checked all our stocks, mutual funds, bank accounts," Mr. Hill said. "They wanted to know where it came from, why we transferred it. That helps you feel comfortable that they're looking at it in depth."
A decade ago, Brenna Eddins, who was the Hills' real estate agent for the home purchase, worked for a builder. Every Saturday morning, a line of people would be at their model homes, to ensure their names were first on the list to purchase newly released houses for sale. "It was the most frenzied situation I'd ever seen," she said, "like a Walmart on Black Friday."
In 2005, home prices in Wesley Chapel rose 29 percent, according to data from Zillow. The same year, rents in the Tampa area rose less than 3 percent, according to Labor Department data, meaning that homes became far less affordable relative to a similar-size rental that year. Over long periods of time, those numbers would be expected to move roughly in tandem.
The collapse that began in 2007 created a different set of problems, as the lengthy process of foreclosures and short sales dragged out, and the only buyers in the market seemed to be investors looking to buy cheap houses to rent out. Wesley Chapel home prices fell 49 percent from mid-2006 to early 2012, a span in which Tampa-area rents rose 10 percent.
Now, investors are retreating as prices recover, and people buying houses to live in are returning -- though not with the fervor and pay-anything sensibility of a decade ago. "I'm seeing younger buyers being more cautious and approaching this as a longer-term investment," said Ms. Eddins, who works at Seven Oaks Realty. "I don't see a mind-set of 'We'll be here a couple of years and we'll flip it.' "
Still, the fact that the relatively balanced housing prices of today are dependent on mortgage rates being near record lows does create some risks, argues Michelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. An abrupt rise could sharply reduce housing affordability and push down prices.
It all depends on why rates rise, and how quickly. "If rates are rising because of stronger economic growth, the housing market should be able to absorb the hit and it will be perfectly manageable," she said. "But if mortgage rates rise for external factors or for reasons not warranted by growth in the economy, it would be damaging."
In other words, a reversal in the era of low interest rates and cheap money wouldn't have consequences just on Wall Street. It could matter a lot on Spoonflower Circle as well.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- As large as the nation's postrecession debt is, American taxpayers could catch a break for years to come from continued abnormally low interest rates, which hold down the cost of financing that debt and in turn limit the debt's growth, congressional analysts said on Tuesday.
Still, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in its annual long-term budget outlook, projected that by the fiscal year 2040 the government's debt would be equal to 107 percent of the country's annual economic activity -- up from the current 74 percent of gross domestic product. Last year the budget office projected the 2040 debt level would reach 111 percent of G.D.P.
The current level of public debt -- exceeding $13 trillion and in large part a hangover from the 2007 to 2009 recession -- is higher as a proportion of the economy than at any point in United States history except for seven years during and after World War II. Debt growth to the projected levels would be unsustainable, as the budget office warned, in what has become a regular feature of its reports.
The favorable projections on interest rates provided the most significant and positive news. The effect of interest rates in tamping down or, conversely, worsening the growth of government debt underscores why market and government analysts pay such close attention to those rates. It also suggests how quickly taxpayers' costs could pile up if economic conditions change, altering the current projections for low rates.
While acknowledging "enormous uncertainty" about long-term projections, the budget office said its review of economic models and market analysts' work strongly "suggests that participants in financial markets expect low interest rates well into the future, and the paths that they anticipate have fallen notably in the past year."
That downward revision in expectations for already low interest rates, while small, has a significant effect on the 25-year outlook for the cost of financing the government's borrowing. Those interest payments on the debt are an expanding share of federal spending, squeezing allocations for domestic and military programs. But the budget office shaved a half-percentage point from its forecast of last year, putting the cost of interest on the debt at 4.2 percent of G.D.P., down from a projected 4.7 percent last year.
By comparison, interest costs in this fiscal year are 1.3 percent of G.D.P.
The budget office projected that real, inflation-adjusted interest rates on Treasury notes would average 2.3 percent in the next 25 years, down from a projected average of 2.5 percent in last summer's annual report. Similarly, interest rates for all government debt would average 2 percent, down from 2.2 percent, the budget office projected.
The budget office projected that the economy would grow on average 2.2 percent a year over 25 years, down slightly from the 2.3 percent projected last year -- a forecast that continues to suggest an unimpressive contrast with the average 3.1 percent growth of the period of 1970 to 2007.
The slight reduction in the economy's predicted growth is "primarily because of the slowdown that C.B.O. anticipates in the growth of the labor force," the office said, as "the fraction of the population that is of working age shrinks."

Full text:   Just over 10 years ago, researchers at the University of Michigan added three questions to their Health and Retirement Study, a biennial survey of Americans over 50:
If $100 earns 2 percent per year, in five years will you have more than $102, less than $102 or $102?
If the interest rate on your savings is 1 percent per year and annual inflation 2 percent, could you buy more, less or the same with your money in a year's time?
Is it true or false that buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than the stock of a mutual fund?
(To see the answers, take the quiz below.)
Researchers aimed to gain some sense of the financial literacy of older Americans, a matter of vital importance as the defined-benefit pensions that had been managed for decades by employers for their workers were giving way to defined-contribution plans like I.R.A.s and 401(k)'s, for which workers had to make their own savings and investment decisions.
The results were not encouraging: Only one-third of respondents answered all three questions right.
These were adults who had been making financial decisions most of their lives. They had experienced high inflation, not once, but twice. And yet only about half correctly answered both the question about inflation and the one on compound interest.
Financial illiteracy is not limited to the 50-plus set. And it has not improved much over the last decade. It underscores just how much the political debate over how to prepare for the aging of the population has misunderstood what is at stake.
Consumed in political argument over the demographic pressure on Social Security, we have bypassed a much more consequential threat: For the first time in generations, a large number of older Americans can expect to suffer a sharp drop in living standards in retirement.
In this light, the standard conservative prescription to address the stress on Social Security -- taking it off the government's books and handing control to individual workers -- would only compound the problem for most retirees.
Preventing a demographic catastrophe may require, instead, taking more of the decisions out of workers' hands. That might require enhancing Social Security rather than limiting it. Or it might require employers to take back more of the responsibility for employee's retirement savings.
Consider the following calculation by James Poterba, a professor of economics at M.I.T.
If inflation-adjusted investment returns averaged 2 percent a year -- not an unreasonable assumption given low interest rates and a stock market likely to deliver subpar returns over the next decade or so -- a worker would have to save almost 15 percent of each paycheck for 40 years to get an annuity stream equal to half of final earnings at retirement, assuming a 2 percent risk-free rate of return. A late starter who saved for only 20 years would need to set aside a full third of earnings.
Matters would be easier if investments yielded 4 percent: With a 4 percent risk-free rate, affording an annuity equal to half the last paycheck upon retirement would require saving less than 10 percent for 40 years, or just over 25 percent for 20.
How does that compare with what workers actually save? From 1990 to 2010, the typical contribution to 401(k) accounts ranged from 4.7 to 5.2 percent of earnings.
The typical savings rate of the thriftiest cohort -- aged 65 to 69 -- topped out at 7.5 percent in 2005. Even adding an employer top-up worth half of workers' contributions wouldn't get them anywhere near where they must be.
Low savings rates aren't the only problem. Another is early withdrawals from retirement savings accounts -- which often happen when workers change jobs and must roll their old retirement plan into something else. Another are the large fees eating away at savers' returns.
The most urgent question seems to be, How can workers and their employers be convinced, cajoled or compelled to consistently save more?
John N. Friedman, an economist at Brown University, has two suggestions: First, assign every worker a single lifetime retirement savings account, into which each successive employer will deposit retirement savings. Second, instead of just offering tax breaks to encourage workers to save more, why not offer incentives to their employers too?
In a study for the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project, scheduled to be presented next week, Professor Friedman proposes that the government cap the tax deductibility on workers' retirement savings -- which are relatively inefficient at mobilizing additional saving -- and use the money saved to provide tax credits for employers that increase their workers' pension contributions.
Employers are more financially sophisticated. Giving them money to ensure that their workers build up an adequate nest egg is not an unreasonable choice. "Tax credits would directly link worker savings to the company bottom line," he writes, "increasing firms' interest in getting their employees to save."
Under not unreasonable assumptions, Mr. Friedman estimates his proposal could increase the share of private sector workers with retirement savings to at least 65 percent, from 41 percent, mostly among the middle class. By retirement day, a typical working household would have $400,000 in savings, compared to $100,000 today.
That might be enough to buy an annuity of $35,000 a year, which, combined with $25,000 from Social Security, could come close to covering the median household income for a couple. The additional cost to the government, in Mr. Friedman's analysis, would be slight. And government subsidies, today tilted sharply toward affluent workers, would shift toward lower-income workers.
"People who are now coming in with nothing would come in with enough to make a difference in retirement readiness," Professor Freidman said.
Could this be enough?
Prodding workers to save more when real wages have not increased in a quarter-century is not a particularly promising avenue. Conscripting companies to raise workers' savings may help, but it could well fall short.
Maybe the government should do the job.
At a conference hosted by the International Monetary Fund, Brad Delong, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, argued that private markets were ill suited to handle the sort of long-term assessments needed to ensure a decent retirement.
"The 21st century will see longer life expectancy, and thus a greater role for pensions," he wrote. "Yet here in the United States the privatization of pensions via 401(k)'s has been an equally great disaster."
Rather than shrink Social Security, some experts and liberal politicians like Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders propose expanding it.
Today, more than half of working households do not have enough assets to avoid a drop in consumption in retirement, according to analyses by Alicia H. Munnell from Boston College and her colleagues. The proportion of households in that group has increased by 10 percentage points in just the last 10 years.
Addressing this challenge would require somewhat higher taxes, tilted toward those most able to afford them, not lower taxes on the wealthy in a fruitless bid to encourage them to invest more. That may seem an uphill battle in today's political climate. But the alternative could prove calamitous. Ignoring the problem will condemn a generation of elderly Americans to the kind of poverty we believed we had eradicated long ago.

Full text:   OAK PARK, Ill. -- MILLIONS of Americans lack crucial legal services. Yet enormous numbers of lawyers are unemployed. Why can't the supply of lawyers match the demand?
In Nebraska, 20 out of 93 counties have fewer than four lawyers. Eleven counties have no lawyers at all. The Montana Legal Services Association, a nonprofit group that is partly federally funded, reports having only 13 case-handling lawyers for the entire state. Throughout the country, millions of low-income people have no access to free or affordable lawyers, even for life-altering civil matters like child-custody disputes or home foreclosures, where legal representation really matters.
This "justice gap" is vast. According to the World Justice Project's latest Rule of Law Index, which gathers primary data on people's practical experience of the law in 102 countries, the United States ranks 65th for the accessibility and affordability of its civil justice. We're tied with Botswana, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, not far behind Moldova and Nigeria.
In most service industries, such an epic imbalance of supply and demand would entice more entrepreneurs. But the legal profession has failed to do so.
More than two decades ago, I tried to bridge the gap in the Chicago suburbs where I grew up by starting the Citizen Advocacy Center, a nonprofit to provide civic training and free legal services for citizens seeking local government accountability. I could begin a career in public advocacy because I graduated with low debt, thanks to a public-interest scholarship from New York University School of Law.
To help us start up, we had a crucial founding grant from the Nader family trust, renewed annually. That, together with other foundation support, excellent mentors and individual contributions, made it possible to sustain the center.
Even so, this was community lawyering on a lean budget. Our first office was below ground, with an old pink carpet. We cleaned up secondhand chairs from my high school and used my parents' old kitchen table. My father painted, my stepdad provided accounting help and my mom answered the phones.
She also begged me to hang my diplomas on the wall. She worried that no one would believe I was a lawyer.
Nonetheless, people poured in once they learned there was a free community lawyer available, and more volunteers came. Over the years, I hired and trained other community lawyers; in turn, we mentored hundreds of law students and helped thousands of people achieve justice in everything from tax and zoning issues to First Amendment matters and government procurement.
To create the entire sector of sustainable, affordable legal service providers that the legal profession needs will take much more entrepreneurship. There's no shortage of lawyers to bridge the justice gap. For the last four years, less than 60 percent of law-school graduates have found full-time jobs requiring a bar qualification.
The problem is twofold. First, school fees have consistently outpaced inflation over the last 30 years, and on average, 86 percent of law students graduate with six-figure debt. Without help, the drag of this debt makes it near-impossible for willing graduates to take lower-paying legal services jobs.
Second, even for those graduates who are able to serve those who lack affordable legal representation, the jobs are few and much fought-for -- despite the often less than chic locales. Recent graduates rarely have the training or resources to create jobs for themselves.
The Legal Services Corporation is the closest thing we have to a corps of lawyers for low-income litigants. Yet Congress has consistently underfunded it. For 2015, the corporation received less than $400 million -- adjusted for inflation, roughly half its funding in the early '80s. The result is that every year about two million citizens eligible for its help do not get served.
This is only part of the justice gap. There are far too few public interest advocates. We must help law students graduate without a ball and chain of debt. And we need to create jobs that let new graduates practice law either pro bono or "low bono" (cut-price) for clients who can't afford most attorneys' rates.
The profession remains over-focused on training lawyers to serve the needs of corporations. And the law schools have lunched off the high tuition rates enabled by this arrangement for far too long.
Law schools that trumpet their public-interest programs for recruiting should hire professors who have actually represented clients and who can train practice-ready lawyers. The schools could also offer public-interest tracks with tuition assistance or loan forgiveness, and fund these through development campaigns.
Congress should continue the program that forgives debt for those who make 10 years of repayments while working in the nonprofit or government sector. This would at least allow lawyers to take a position with lower wages without defaulting on their debts.
Bar associations, philanthropic foundations, law schools and firms could also increase funding for more low bono positions and postgraduate fellowships. There are now some fine examples of such incubator programs: the law schools of the City University of New York and Arizona State University, New York State's Pro Bono Scholars program and the Chicago Bar Foundation's Justice Entrepreneurs Project all provide training for students or graduates that seeks to create affordable legal services jobs.
Prestige and professional success need not be defined by income or office space. With help, we can do a far better job of matching legal talent with human need.

Full text:   Suleyman Demirel, who served seven times as Turkey's prime minister, dominating the nation's politics when the country struggled with violence, economic stagnation and military rule, died early Wednesday in Ankara, Turkey. He was 90.
Guven Hospital in Ankara, Turkey's capital, confirmed the death in a statement.
In a career that spanned nearly half a century, Mr. Demirel, who became Turkey's president after his many reprises as prime minister, was the nation's most remarkable political survivor.
Depending on the mood of the moment, he could be a European-oriented progressive or a harsh opponent of diversity. At various times he made common cause with social democrats, Islamists and crypto-fascists of the extreme right. Twice overthrown in coups, he never questioned the right of generals to play a leading role in Turkish politics.
Mr. Demirel was a glad-handing politician and powerful orator renowned for his encyclopedic knowledge of Turkey. It was said he could fly over any village and name its mayor.
"He was a supreme pragmatist. He wanted to stay in power," said Morton Abramowitz, a former United States ambassador to Turkey. "Whether he achieved much or not wasn't important."
Suleyman Gundogdu Demirel -- his last name means "iron hand" -- was born Nov. 1, 1924, in Islamkoy in southwestern Turkey. The airport in the provincial capital, Isparta, was later named for him, as was the local university.
Like several other Turkish leaders of his generation, Mr. Demirel was trained as an engineer. He oversaw many hydroelectric projects and became director general of the State Hydraulic Works at 31. He became known as "the king of dams."
In 1954, Mr. Demirel was the first Turk selected for an Eisenhower Fellowship, a program that brought emerging leaders to the United States for several months of traveling, seminars and classes.
He spent years representing the American engineering and machine-tool firm Morrison Knudsen, leading some leftists to refer to him with scorn as "Morrison Demirel."
After a military coup in 1960, Mr. Demirel's political ambitions were encouraged by armed forces commanders who wanted to turn the government over to civilians, whom they believed they could control. In 1965, he was elected prime minister, the country's youngest at 40.
Perhaps mindful of the fate of Adnan Menderes, the prime minister overthrown by the military and hanged, Mr. Demirel worked closely with the officers who had seized power. Still, violence shook the country, with political gangs staging killings, bombings and kidnappings.
Mr. Demirel's coalition frayed, and on March 12, 1971, his military patrons demanded that he form a government that could "neutralize the current anarchical situation." He resigned later that day, allowing the military to take control of the country once again.
After civilian rule was re-established in the late 1970s, Mr. Demirel served as head of three governments. It was during this period that Turkey fell into an economic crisis. Inept handling of foreign debts, compounded by the effects of increasing global oil prices, led to triple-digit inflation, a sharp rise in unemployment and a crash in industrial production. It took a decade for Turkey to make the structural changes -- under the leadership of Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, a former Demirel protégé -- that laid the basis for its current prosperity.
After the military staged its third coup in 1980, it banned Mr. Demirel and other party leaders from politics. The ban was lifted in 1987, and in 1991, Mr. Demirel became prime minister again.
Two years later, Mr. Ozal, then president, died of a heart attack. Mr. Demirel succeeded him, becoming the country's ninth president. When his term expired in 2000, he tried and failed to have the Constitution amended to allow his re-election.
By that time, many younger Turks had come to view Mr. Demirel as a political figure worthy of scorn. When Parliament rejected the amendment, effectively ending his career, the left-leaning commentator Omer Madra wrote a newspaper column containing just two words: "I'm happy." The rest of the column was left blank, suggesting that all Turks could understand the reason for his happiness.
Information on survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Demirel and his wife, Nazmiye, who died in 2013, had no children.
"He was always secretive, nontransparent and utterly defensive," said Yavuz Baydar, a Turkish news commentator. "He was a true sort of Eastern politician with a Western outlook, closer to those of Central Asia than southeastern Europe, a local figure who deliberately stood away from globalism."
The last years of Mr. Demirel's career were marked by the emergence of Kurdish nationalism, which developed into civil war. He endorsed the military's scorched-earth tactics, which included torture of detainees, the assassination of suspected militants and an absolute rejection of Kurdish demands.
"Demirel understood the art of Turkish politics better than anyone of his generation," said Andrew Finkel, an American journalist who interviewed Mr. Demirel many times. "His flaw was that he was unable to put that understanding to good use."
Mr. Demirel described his country as one dedicated to "tolerance and freedom of opinion," and insisted that "all Turkish citizens are fully free and have equal rights." Yet he urged the Kurds to consider themselves Turks above all. Allowing them to maintain their ethnic identity, he warned, "would lead to the destabilization of Turkey."
Mr. Demirel also followed the military's lead in foreign affairs. He was ardently anti-Soviet and promoted good relations with the United States and Israel. When the German Parliament voted in 1992 to cut off military aid because of the harshness of the Kurdish conflict, he declared, "Today, the opinion of the West no longer interests us."
Interviewers often asked Mr. Demirel how he justified jumping with such alacrity from one political position to another. He would reply, "Dun dundur, bugun bugundur," which means "Yesterday was yesterday, today is today." It became his best-known slogan.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- This is not the moment the Federal Reserve will start to raise interest rates. But that day is coming, and investors are getting nervous.
Karissa McDonough, director of fixed-income strategy for People's United Wealth Management, the investment arm of a Connecticut bank, said her firm had chased higher returns in recent years by amassing assets like emerging-market debt and high-yield bonds that it would not have considered a decade ago.
She thinks "all the time" about selling those assets and heading for safety. The firm sold some in January. But she does not want to retreat too soon.
"We're all looking at each other to figure out who's going to blink first," Ms. McDonough said. "You don't want to give up while the market is still strong and supportive. You'd be giving up on a significant amount of income."
The Fed and the central banks of the major European and Asian economies have presided over an extraordinary period of low interest rates and minimal volatility, seeking to increase economic growth by encouraging risk-taking.
Now the Fed is poised to become the first of its peers to head for the exit. Fed officials, who are meeting here Tuesday and Wednesday, have said they would like to start raising short-term rates later this year, lifting the Fed's benchmark rate from its hibernation near zero for the first time since December 2008. (Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, will discuss the Fed's latest thinking at a news conference Wednesday afternoon after the Fed wraps up its conclave.)
Fed officials have portrayed these plans as a testament to the progress of the economic recovery, and they have emphasized they plan to raise rates slowly -- more slowly than the Fed's past practice -- so that they do not put the brakes on growth too soon.
Not everyone is worried. Richard Davis, chief executive of U.S. Bancorp, based in Minneapolis, argues that raising rates could actually help encourage growth, at least for a while, by spurring companies and individuals to borrow money ahead of higher rates in the future, just as potential home buyers often plunge into the market only after mortgage rates start to rise.
But whatever the impact on the economy, Fed officials have emphasized that they expect rate increases to disrupt financial markets, increasing volatility after a long period of tranquility.
"My own view is that there likely will be some turbulence," William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said earlier this month. "After all, lift-off will represent a regime change after more than six years at the zero lower bound."
Bond markets do not respond predictably to interest rate increases. There have only been a handful of tightening cycles in the Fed's 100-year history, and on the whole, the differences have outweighed the similarities. "Events unique to the particular period appear to be much more important" than the Fed's actions, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch concluded in a recent report.
In the present case, some Fed officials have suggested investors are behaving with too much complacency, for example by keeping the yields of rate-sensitive securities at levels that indicate they do not think the Fed will raise rates this year. If the Fed does what it says, they could be taken by surprise.
Investors also continue to gobble up new corporate bonds that carry very low interest rates, which are likely to lose value when rates start to increase. American corporations issued $757 billion in debt from January through May, a record volume 12 percent higher than during the first five months of last year, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group.
And there is concern that changes in financial markets since the crisis have reduced liquidity, or the ability of sellers to find buyers. The International Monetary Fund warned in its Global Financial Stability Report in April that central banks, by pumping money into markets, were concealing the decline of private participation in those markets. "Markets could be increasingly susceptible to episodes in which liquidity suddenly vanishes and volatility spikes," it concluded.
Ms. McDonough said she worried particularly about the flight of investors who have entered new markets since the crisis, and have never experienced the kind of volatility that disrupts trading even during periods of normal activity.
"My fear is that the junkiest investors will no longer have access to capital and that all of that money is going to fly out and exacerbate this tightening," she said. "I'm not worried about the Fed moving too early in terms of the U.S. economy. I am very concerned about the market impact."
Gibson Smith, chief investment officer for fixed income at Janus Capital Group, said his firm was positioning itself to take advantage of the fire sales that might result as sellers cut prices to attract scarce buyers.
Mr. Smith said Janus was reducing its holdings of high-yield debt and its exposure to the mortgage market, and instead was accumulating easy-to-sell short-term Treasuries.
"There is a high level of complacency among investors right now," he said. "In their quests for yield they are really turning their heads to some of the risks that exist."
Mr. Smith said Janus would make less money than rivals if the Fed continued to postpone rate increases, or if the market reaction was relatively calm, but he said the foregone opportunity was small compared to the risks.
"There are times when it is very important to be defensive and cautious, and that's what we're doing with our portfolios right now," he said.
Others, however, are standing pat, regarding the fears of disruption as overstated.
John Bellows, a portfolio manager at Western Asset Management, said that he did not regard investors as overly complacent. He said current prices largely reflected economic conditions, and he did not think the Fed would seriously disrupt markets by modestly increasing its benchmark interest rate.
"It doesn't represent a sea change," he said. "It wouldn't surprise me to see a little volatility, but even over a month or a few months' time frame I think the economic fundamentals will drive markets. Inflation is quite low, growth is not accelerating and central banks around the world are easing."
Mr. Bellows said the greatest risk to market stability was that investors would ignore the Fed's insistence that it intended to raise rates slowly. In past periods of policy tightening, as in the mid-1990s, investors reacted to the Fed's initial moves by driving up rates in the expectation that the Fed was just getting started.
But he said here, too, he saw reason for confidence.
"The Fed losing credibility in terms of their hiking pace is the real risk," Mr. Bellows said. "But I don't think that's going to happen in the coming cycle. They've been clear that they intend to hike slowly and moderately."

Abstract: Under the Affordable Care Act, nonprofit hospitals are required to provide charity care or discounts to low-income people but that mandate does not apply to for-profit hospitals.

Full text:   Two reports published this month provide fresh evidence of the hard-to-justify high prices that many hospitals charge for common procedures. The prices drive up premiums for many privately insured patients and can be ruinously expensive for those who are uninsured or inadequately insured or who go to a hospital or doctor outside their insurance network.
A study published in the June issue of Health Affairs, a policy journal, found that the 50 hospitals with the highest prices in 2012, the latest data available, charged an average of 10 times what is allowed by Medicare, which was used as a baseline for cost. Although hospitals routinely complain that Medicare pays too little, the allowable charges under Medicare are what the government, after extensive analysis, considers the cost of the procedure plus a reasonable amount to invest in hospital improvements and keep up with medical inflation.
Of the 50 highest-charging hospitals, 49 were for-profit institutions, most of them operated by big chains like Community Health Systems and Hospital Corporation of America. Under the Affordable Care Act, nonprofit hospitals are required to provide charity care or discounts to low-income people but that mandate does not apply to for-profit hospitals.
Some for-profit hospitals offer discounts voluntarily, and several states have laws or regulations requiring all hospitals, including for-profit hospitals, to offer price discounts to eligible uninsured patients. No federal law regulates what hospitals can charge; only two states, Maryland and West Virginia, have such laws. The highest-charging hospitals were in 13 states, mostly in the south. Prices varied greatly depending on the specialty. Anesthesiology and diagnostic radiology had very high markups, nursery services were much lower.
The typical response from the hospitals is that their list prices are not relevant to most patients because they don't pay the full price. The two big government insurance programs, Medicare and Medicaid, pay far less than the list prices; private insurers typically bargain for discounts. Even so, high list prices raise the ceiling from which discounts are negotiated and thus drive up premiums for many privately insured patients.
High prices will hit millions of people who will remain uninsured in coming years for one reason or another despite passage of the Affordable Care Act, according to the Health Affairs study. Patients with private insurance who receive care out-of-network don't generally benefit from their insurer's negotiated discounts may have to pay a high proportion of the full charges.
A second report, released on June 1 by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, showed a similar pattern. For a major joint replacement, the most common reason for hospitalization, the average hospital charged more than $54,000 in 2013 while Medicare on average paid less than $15,000. In addition, the list prices that hospitals asked traditional Medicare patients to pay rose by more than 10 percent between 2011 and 2013, more than double the rate of inflation.
Market forces are often not powerful enough to restrain very high prices in areas where dominant hospitals and chains can pretty much charge what they please. The best remedy might be legislation, at the federal and state levels, to limit hospital prices that have no connection to the cost of delivering the services.

Abstract: "The Great Recession was really a double whammy in the sense that there were more individuals who had greater need -- there were more people who were unemployed, more people who were hungry, more people who were homeless -- at the same time that there were substantially fewer resources," said Patrick Rooney, associate dean for research and academic affairs at Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University, which researched and wrote the report.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Charitable giving rose for the fifth year in a row in 2014, rebounding past a prerecession peak to an estimated $358 billion, according to an annual report from the Giving USA Foundation.
The report, "Giving USA 2015: The Annual Report on Philanthropy for the Year 2014," shows that contributions rose in all categories -- individuals, corporations, foundations and bequests -- making up for ground lost during the economic downturn. After reaching $355 billion in 2007, giving dropped 15 percent to $303 billion in 2009, according to the Giving USA data, which is figured in inflation-adjusted dollars.
"The Great Recession was really a double whammy in the sense that there were more individuals who had greater need -- there were more people who were unemployed, more people who were hungry, more people who were homeless -- at the same time that there were substantially fewer resources," said Patrick Rooney, associate dean for research and academic affairs at Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University, which researched and wrote the report. "We're now back to where we were before that. All the sources are growing, some more rapidly than others, but they're all growing at pretty reasonable rates."
The increase in individual giving, at $258.5 billion, accounted for 54 percent of the growth, up from $249 billion in 2013. Donations included several large gifts from the high-tech world, such as a $1.9 billion contribution from Bill and Melinda Gates to their foundation, according to a report in The Chronicle of Philanthropy on America's 50 most generous donors. Younger entrepreneurs also gave big, the report said: Sean Parker donated $550 million to his foundation and his donor-advised fund at Fidelity, and Jill and Nicholas Woodman gave $500 million and Jan Koum gave $556 million to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.
"People are giving at relatively early points in their life cycle," Mr. Rooney said. "If they're making these big commitments early, it's a bold step. That's pretty different than doing that on your deathbed."
The overall increase in giving of 5.4 percent over 2013 was not spread evenly over all categories. Arts, culture and humanities enjoyed the highest increase, 7.4 percent, and international affairs accounted for the only drop, 3.6 percent. Increases were about 3 to 5 percent for other categories like education, the environment, public-society benefit and health.
The increase for arts, culture and humanities is in part a reflection of donors reallocating gifts away from human services, where needs are now seen as less dire as the economy recovers. Giving in that category grew by only 1.9 percent in 2014, a slowdown from the recession years.
Giving to religious organizations has declined over time as a share of the total, the report shows, as fewer Americans identify with a religion, attend worship services or give to houses of worship, a trend the researchers expect to continue. Giving to education remained robust, with several multimillion-dollar gifts. Two gifts exceeding $100 million went toward medical research on university campuses.
Still, Mr. Rooney said there was room for contributions to grow. Corporate giving, for instance, grew by 12 percent, to $17.8 billion, but represented 0.7 percent of profits. Giving over all grew to 2.1 percent of gross domestic product from 2 percent. It has hovered between 2.1 and 1.7 percent for 40 years.
"We're still talking about this very narrow bandwidth," he said. "Philanthropy is a voluntary activity so we can't say you have to give more, but the question is, For the most affluent nation in an affluent period, should we be giving more?"
Correction: June 17, 2015, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a rebound in charitable giving after the financial crisis omitted credit for some data on gifts from donors in the technology industry. The data on gifts from Bill and Melinda Gates, Sean Parker, Jill and Nicolas Woodman and Jan Koum came from a special report in The Chronicle of Philanthropy.

Full text:   WAXAHACHIE, Tex. -- Most Americans suffered serious losses during and after the recession, knocked off balance by layoffs, stagnant pay and the collapse of home values. But apart from the superrich, one group's fortunes appear to have held remarkably steady: seniors.
Supported by income from Social Security, pensions and investments, as well as an increasing number of paychecks from delaying retirement, older people not only weathered the economic downturn that began in 2007 but made significant gains, a New York Times analysis of government data has found.
As a result, America's middle class is graying.
People on the leading edge of the baby boom and those born during World War II -- the 25 million Americans now between the ages of 65 and 74 -- have emerged as particularly well positioned in the nation's economic timeline. While there are plenty of individual exceptions, as a group they are better off financially than past generations and may well enjoy a more successful old age than future ones, even those merely a decade younger.
"These are people who have been blessed with good economic circumstances, especially those who were able to ride the wave of postwar economic growth," said Gary V. Engelhardt, an economist at Syracuse. "They're definitely in a sweet spot."
Older Americans' ability to rise during the postrecession years when most households were falling reflects a broader trend that has unfolded in recent decades.
In the past, the elderly were usually poorer than other age groups. Now, they are the last generation to widely enjoy a traditional pension, and are prime beneficiaries of a government safety net targeted at older Americans. They also have profited from the long rise in real estate prices that preceded the recession. As a result, more seniors now fall into the middle class -- defined in this case between the 40th and 80th income percentile -- than ever before.
Median income for people 75 years and older has also risen, but not as much as it has for people in the 65-to-74 age group.
One of this relatively fortunate group is Monette Berryhill, 72. Six days a week she descends from her second-floor apartment for a treadmill workout in the poolside fitness room of her gated complex here in Waxahachie, south of Dallas.
A widow who says she enjoys her freedom too much to date, Ms. Berryhill dines out with friends from time to time and recently took in a country music concert. Her yearly vacation is a San Diego trip to see grandchildren, but this year she expects to splurge on an Alaskan cruise.
Ms. Berryhill's past career in customer service at two banks did not make her rich. But her retirement is comfortable.
"I feel like I'm doing all right," said Ms. Berryhill, whose red-framed glasses offset her snowy, spiked hair. "I really enjoy it."
Gains Mask Inequality
Some researchers have found that the economic success of seniors is masking an even deeper gulf in income inequality between the upper tier and everyone else than what is evident in the overall statistics.
"It's not so much that older people are experiencing unseemly gains in income," said Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. "It's more that middle-aged people are not seeing income growing or even keeping pace with inflation."
Nearly half of seniors ages 65 and up consider themselves in excellent or good shape financially, according to a Pew survey last month, in contrast to younger baby boomers, who view their circumstances less favorably.
More secure in their finances, many older Americans have congregated in traditional retirement communities. The Villages -- a Central Florida haven for seniors with its low crime and dozens of golf courses -- has been the fastest-growing American metropolitan area for the last two years. Millions of other elderly people have settled in middle-income suburban and exurban areas like Waxahachie.
Living in the muggy weather and neighborhoods of classic gingerbread houses, most seniors here are thriving, riding an overall population boom. But the current crop reflects some different choices from those who lived in the area three decades ago. For one thing, many more of them are working to supplement their income.
"The whole meaning of retirement is changing," said Gary Koenig, vice president for economic and consumer security at the AARP Public Policy Institute. "People are living longer; they have to fund more years of retirement."
Charles Kozlovsky, 73, retired from his job driving an 18-wheeler in 2009. Two years later he went to work as a school bus driver. The job keeps him busy but the work can be stressful; on a recent day a student was suspended from his bus for bad behavior.
In between routes, Mr. Kozlovsky goes to the senior center, a popular hangout for its 1,350 members that offers everything from poker games to Zumba for anyone 50 and up. For holidays, he and his wife play host to grandchildren who live nearby, setting up tables in the garage and back porch to squeeze everyone in.
The couple tend their backyard lemon and peach trees; sometimes they take trips to Branson, Mo., to see musical shows. Mr. Kozlovsky particularly enjoys his meticulously restored, shiny red 1957 Chevy, which he shows off in the parade at the annual National Polka Festival in nearby Ennis.
"Things got a little bit better when I started driving a school bus," Mr. Kozlovsky said.
As recently as the late 1990s, only one in five Americans in their late 60s had a job. Now, that number has jumped to almost one in three. And unlike in their parents' generation, more women are earning paychecks than in the past, contributing to household income.
Researchers say these factors are in large part responsible for the substantial rise in median household income that seniors in their late 60s and early 70s have experienced since 1989, even as Americans in their prime working years have mostly treaded water or lost ground.
Not everyone, of course, can work later in life. Health problems and age discrimination present major hurdles. And many of those who find jobs consider them barely adequate.
Pat Cherry, 72, has been earning minimum wage at a job in the library of the city-run Waxahachie Senior Activity Center. Ms. Cherry, who is divorced, had to retire early from a bookkeeping job after an autoimmune disease caused her to miss too much work. She could barely pay her bills until she found the part-time job through a government-sponsored work program, but it expired last month.
Ms. Cherry is worried no one will hire her again. "I need the money desperately," she said.
Still, for those seniors who manage to work longer, the benefits can be significant, providing a much-needed enhancement to retirement income. And for those with enough money from a job to postpone receiving their monthly checks from the government, the value of future Social Security payments rises by about 8 percent for each year of waiting, up to age 70.
Social Security benefits make up more than half the total income for a majority of the nation's elderly -- 52 percent of married people and 74 percent of unmarried people, according to the federal government.
Kathleen McGarry, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles whose research focuses on the well-being of seniors, calls Social Security "the single most important tool in combating poverty among the elderly."
For Jim Engel, 72, his government benefit offered a lifeline after he lost his bakery business during the recession. The checks let him put off the sale of his nest egg, a Tennessee walking horse barn, allowing time for property values to recover.
"I feel blessed," he said.
Extra Responsibilities
To be sure, many older people have trouble making ends meet and some are saddled with responsibilities that exceed the reaches of the safety net. Mary Walker, 74, who fled New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina with no more than an extra pair of underwear in her purse, is now raising two young great-grandchildren on her own not far from Waxahachie. "At this age I shouldn't be struggling," she said.
But older Americans in general are significantly wealthier compared to previous generations.
The median assets of people ages 65 to 74 doubled between 1989 and 2013, a far greater gain than other age groups experienced. And while there has been a decline from the peak since 2007, largely because of the real estate bust, this age group lost less than others.
Ms. Berryhill, the widow in the gated complex, had no debt on her home on three acres when real estate prices were plummeting. By the time she put her house on the market in 2011, it sold in one week, at a significant profit. Besides that cushion, she gets about $1,600 a month in Social Security and has proceeds from retirement accounts.
She pays nearly $900 a month for a spacious, one-bedroom apartment decorated in red -- the sofas, the computer mouse, the plates and even the napkins carefully folded into wine glasses are all red. On a recent day she bought an inflatable palm tree for her granddaughter's luau-themed birthday party.
Government data on consumer spending reflects the new reality. Adjusted for inflation, older Americans spent 18 percent more per household in 2013 than in the late 1980s, while spending for other age groups remained relatively flat. Higher health care costs, which fall more heavily on the elderly, accounted for a portion of the difference, but seniors spent 57 percent more on entertainment, and significantly more on a wide range of items, including homes, rental cars and alcoholic beverages.
Ms. Berryhill was 66 when she retired. Her husband, Warren Berryhill, died of heart problems seven years ago. At age 68, he was still working full time as a debt collector.
"We thought it would give us more money to retire on when we did retire," Ms. Berryhill said.
Ms. Berryhill is much better off than her parents, who grew up during the Depression. Her father, who was a gasoline truck driver, had to retire at age 61 because of a heart ailment. Her mother did not work outside the home. They were always able to pay their bills, but Ms. Berryhill said they never took a vacation trip, let alone left Texas.
"We weren't rich but we didn't hurt for being hungry or anything like that," Ms. Berryhill said.
She worries how her two children will fare. Their paychecks are bigger, but Social Security payouts, she fears, could be smaller when her children reach retirement age. They might have to take out loans to help pay for their children's college educations. They have 401(k) savings plans at work but those are not as generous as her employer-sponsored pension.
But she always taught her children to save, and she cannot do much more now, she says, than hope for the best.
Articles in this series focus on the reshaping of the American economy and its effects on the work force and the middle class.

Full text:   Oxford, Britain -- One thing we've learned in the years since the financial crisis is that seriously bad ideas -- by which I mean bad ideas that appeal to the prejudices of Very Serious People -- have remarkable staying power. No matter how much contrary evidence comes in, no matter how often and how badly predictions based on those ideas are proved wrong, the bad ideas just keep coming back. And they retain the power to warp policy.
What makes something qualify as a seriously bad idea? In general, to sound serious it must invoke big causes to explain big events -- technical matters, like the troubles caused by sharing a currency without a common budget, don't make the cut. It must also absolve corporate interests and the wealthy from responsibility for what went wrong, and call for hard choices and sacrifice on the part of the little people.
So the true story of economic disaster, which is that it was caused by an inadequately regulated financial industry run wild and perpetuated by wrongheaded austerity policies, won't do. Instead, the story must involve things like a skills gap -- it's not lack of jobs; we have the wrong workers for this high-technology globalized era, etc., etc. -- even if there's no evidence at all that such a gap is impeding recovery.
And the ultimate example of a seriously bad idea is the determination, in the teeth of all the evidence, to declare government spending that helps the less fortunate a crucial cause of our economic problems. In the United States, I'm happy to say, this idea seems to be on the ropes, at least for now. Here in Britain, however, it still reigns supreme. In particular, one important factor in the recent Conservative election triumph was the way Britain's news media told voters, again and again, that excessive government spending under Labour caused the financial crisis.
It takes almost no homework to show that this claim is absurd on multiple levels. For one thing, the financial crisis was global; did Gordon Brown's alleged overspending cause the housing busts in Florida and Spain? For another, all these claims of irresponsibility involve rewriting history, because on the eve of crisis nobody thought Britain was being profligate: debt was low by historical standards and the deficit fairly small. Finally, Britain's supposedly disastrous fiscal position has never worried the markets, which have remained happy to buy British bonds despite historically low yields.
Nonetheless, that's the story, generally reported not as opinion but as fact. And the really bad news is that Britain's leaders seem to believe their own propaganda. On Wednesday, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer and the architect of the government's austerity policies, announced his intention to make these policies permanent. Britain, he said, should have a law requiring that the government run a budget surplus -- with current revenue paying for all spending, including investment outlays -- when the economy is growing.
It's a remarkable proposal, and I mean that in the worst way. Mr. Osborne isn't offering the wrong answer to Britain's problems; he's offering an answer to problems Britain doesn't have, while ignoring and exacerbating the problems it does.
For Britain does not have a public debt problem. Yes, debt rose in the wake of economic crisis, but it's still not high by historical standards, and borrowing costs have rarely been lower. In fact, interest rates adjusted for inflation are negative, even on very long-term borrowing. Investors, in other words, are willing to pay the British government to make use of part of their wealth.
Meanwhile, Britain's real economy is still ailing. It's true that employment has held up surprisingly well, but that's only because of a spectacular, unprecedented productivity bust: adjusting for labor quality, output per person-hour has declined around 7 percent since early 2008.
Nobody fully understands either why this slump has happened or how to reverse it, but surely the combination of a still-weak economy, terrible productivity performance and negative borrowing costs says that this is a time to increase investment in things like infrastructure. (Passenger trains here make rail service in the United States look good, and traffic congestion is getting ever worse.) Yet the Osborne proposal would kill any such initiative.
But Mr. Osborne sounds very serious, and, if history is any guide, the Labour Party won't make any effective counterarguments.
Now, some readers are probably thinking that I'm giving the likes of Mr. Osborne too much credit for sincerity. Isn't all this deficit obsession just an excuse to slash social programs? And I'm sure that's part of it. But I don't think that's the whole story. Seriously bad ideas, I'd argue, have a life of their own. And they rule our world.

Fighting the Derp

Abstract: The first line of defense, I'd argue, is to always be suspicious of people telling you what you want to hear. [...]if you're a conservative opposed to a stronger safety net, you should be extra skeptical about claims that health reform is about to crash and burn, especially coming from people who made the same prediction last year and the year before (Obamacare derp runs almost as deep as inflation derp).

Full text:   When it comes to economics -- and other subjects, but I'll focus on what I know best -- we live in an age of derp and cheap cynicism. And there are powerful forces behind both tendencies. But those forces can be fought, and the place to start fighting is within yourself.
What am I talking about here? "Derp" is a term borrowed from the cartoon "South Park" that has achieved wide currency among people I talk to, because it's useful shorthand for an all-too-obvious feature of the modern intellectual landscape: people who keep saying the same thing no matter how much evidence accumulates that it's completely wrong.
The quintessential example is fear mongering over inflation. It was, perhaps, forgivable for economists, pundits, and politicians to warn about runaway inflation some years ago, when the Federal Reserve was just beginning its efforts to help a depressed economy. After all, everyone makes bad predictions now and then.
But making the same wrong prediction year after year, never acknowledging past errors or considering the possibility that you have the wrong model of how the economy works -- well, that's derp.
And there's a lot of derp out there. Inflation derp, in particular, has become more or less a required position among Republicans. Even economists with solid reputations, whose professional work should have made them skeptical of inflation hysteria, have spent years echoing the paranoia of the goldbugs. And that tells you why derp abides: it's basically political.
It's an article of faith on the right that any attempt by the government to fight unemployment must lead to disaster, so the faithful must keep predicting disaster no matter how often it fails to materialize.
Still, doesn't everyone do this? No, and that's where the cheap cynicism comes in.
True, the peddlers of politically inspired derp are quick to accuse others of the same sin. For example, right at the beginning of the Obama administration Robert Lucas, a Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago, accused Christina Romer, the administration's chief economist, of intellectual fraud. Her analysis of fiscal policy, he declared, was just "a very naked rationalization for policies that were already, you know, decided on for other reasons."
In general, anyone practicing some kind of Keynesian economics -- an approach that, among other things, correctly predicted quiescent inflation and interest rates -- is constantly accused of just looking for reasons to expand government.
But derp isn't universal. There's also plenty of genuine, honest analysis out there -- and you don't have to be a technical expert to tell the difference.
I've already mentioned one telltale sign of derp: predictions that just keep being repeated no matter how wrong they've been in the past. Another sign is the never-changing policy prescription, like the assertion that slashing tax rates on the wealthy, which you advocate all the time, just so happens to also be the perfect response to a financial crisis nobody expected.
Yet another is a call for long-term responses to short-term events -- for example, a permanent downsizing of government in response to a recession.
And here's the thing: if you look at what Ms. Romer and many other Keynesians had to say, none of those telltale signs were present. They advocated deficit spending as a response to a severe downturn, not a universal elixir, and the measures they called for, like infrastructure spending and budget aid to state governments, were designed to be temporary rather than a permanent expansion (and the 2009 stimulus did, in fact, fade away on schedule.)
So derp isn't destiny. But how can you -- whether you're a pundit, a policy maker, or just a concerned citizen -- protect yourself against derpitude? The first line of defense, I'd argue, is to always be suspicious of people telling you what you want to hear.
Thus, if you're a conservative opposed to a stronger safety net, you should be extra skeptical about claims that health reform is about to crash and burn, especially coming from people who made the same prediction last year and the year before (Obamacare derp runs almost as deep as inflation derp).
But if you're a liberal who believes that we should reduce inequality, you should similarly be cautious about studies purporting to show that inequality is responsible for many of our economic ills, from slow growth to financial instability. Those studies might be correct -- the fact is that there's less derp on America's left than there is on the right -- but you nonetheless need to fight the temptation to let political convenience dictate your beliefs.
Fighting the derp can be hard, not least because it can upset friends who want to be reassured in their beliefs. But you should do it anyway: it's your civic duty.

Full text:   Apple Upgrades, Minus TV
Apple is set to kick off its annual conference for software developers on Monday. The company is expected to show new and improved versions of OS X, its Mac operating system, and iOS, the mobile software system powering iPhones and iPads. The company will also introduce a new streaming music service that it developed with Beats Electronics, the company it acquired last year for $3 billion. Absent from the unveilings will be a long-anticipated upgrade for the Apple TV set-top box, which was pulled from the conference because of issues related to content and technology. --Brian X. Chen
Hopes Dim for China Growth
Economists will be looking for signs that China's growth slowdown is bottoming out when the country releases its May economic data this week, but expectations are not high. Trade figures, to be released on Monday, are expected to show that imports remain under pressure because of weak domestic demand. Inflation data on Tuesday is likely to highlight feeble increases in prices of consumer goods. On Thursday, the government is expected to report that industrial production remains near a 10-year low, partly because of the slumping housing market. Data on land purchases by developers and new construction starts is forecast to continue to show a sharp contraction. --Neil Gough
Sales and Kale at McDonald's
The McDonald's Corporation will report its sales for May on Monday, the next-to-last time it will give Wall Street a monthly look at the performance of its roughly 37,000 stores. Interest in the company has been intense over the last six months, as sales have slid despite a smorgasbord of initiatives and food tests. Menu tweaks like adding kale to salads in some stores and toasting buns longer for some burgers are being closely watched but have not yet had a chance to have an effect on sales. Sara Senatore, a Sanford Bernstein investment analyst, said the firm does not usually preview sales, but based on trends over a two-year adjusted calendar, sales in McDonald's stores in the United States in May might be down 1.5 percent, compared with a 2.3 percent decline in April. --Stephanie Strom
G.M., Beyond the Switches
In the wake of a record year for auto safety recalls, General Motors will hold its annual meeting on Tuesday at the company's headquarters in Detroit. G.M. executives hope the company has largely weathered the storm created by its defective ignition switches and decade-long cover-up of the problem and its scope. Investors will hear about new efforts like the company's framework, announced in March, for investing in capital projects, which among other things will aim for a return of 20 percent or greater on invested capital, and a cash balance of $20 billion. Investors will also get a chance to vote on a shareholder proposal to split G.M.'s chief executive and chairman functions. The proposal, by James McRitchie, a small shareholder from Elk Grove, Calif., is opposed by the company's board of directors. --Aaron M. Kessler
Netflix May Add Shares
Netflix will hold its annual stockholders' meeting on Tuesday in Los Gatos, Calif., during which investors will vote on a proposal to increase the number of shares in what is seen as a precursor to a stock split. Netflix shares now trade above $633, almost double where they were at the start of the year. More proposals include the election of three directors, the appointment of an auditing firm and other stockholder proposals. Analysts are also hoping that executives will provide more details about the company's international rollout, which is expected to be complete by the end of 2016. The company is also expected to face questions on its position on a series of recently announced mergers, including Charter Communication's pair of $67.1 billion deals for Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. --Emily Steel
HSBC Reconsiders Address
HSBC will hold a strategic update for investors on Tuesday and may give more insight into its review of whether to keep its headquarters in Britain. The lender, which traces its roots to Hong Kong, announced a formal review earlier this year of its domicile as it faces a shifting regulatory environment and a tax that hit British banks particularly hard. --Chad Bray
Cholesterol Drugs at F.D.A.
Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration this week will discuss whether the agency should approve the first two drugs in a new class of powerful cholesterol-lowering agents. Praluent, also known as alirocumab, from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, will be discussed on Tuesday. Amgen's Repatha, or evolocumab, will be considered on Wednesday. A big question is whether lowering of LDL-C, the so-called bad cholesterol, is enough for approval or whether the companies need to demonstrate that the drugs actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes, something that will not be known for another two years or more. --Andrew Pollack
Trade Vote in Europe
The European Parliament is expected to vote on Wednesday on the plans for a landmark trade deal between the United States and the European Union. The vote focuses on a report prepared by the lawmakers that is meant to guide officials leading the negotiations on Europe's behalf. But the lawmakers have been squabbling for months over whether to allow multinational companies to sue governments that fail to adhere to a future Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Last month, the Parliament's trade committee voted in favor of allowing a reformed version of that system, known as investor-to-state dispute settlement. The system is common in other trade agreements, and American and European negotiators have insisted it should part of the trans-Atlantic deal. But some political groups have vowed to vote against the final report unless it contains language explicitly rejecting the system. The 751-member Parliament has only an advisory role in the negotiations. But it has the power to veto any eventual deal, and that gives the lawmakers' vote significant political weight, even at this stage. --James Kanter
It's Zuckerberg's Call
Although Facebook stockholders will be able to question management at the company's annual meeting on Thursday, the votes they cast will be essentially meaningless. That is because the company's co-founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, controls 54 percent of the votes through a special class of stock and has made it clear that he will run the company as he sees fit. So a proposal on the ballot to strip Mr. Zuckerberg of his super-voting power is more symbolic than real. At the moment, shareholders have little to complain about, with Facebook's revenue and profits soaring, and the stock up about 31 percent over the last year, although some have expressed concerns about Mr. Zuckerberg's costly acquisitions. In another event on Thursday, Oculus, a virtual reality company owned by Facebook, will lay out its product plans, including its first headset that plugs into a personal computer, due out in early 2016. --Vindu Goel
Ready to Spend?
On Friday morning, the University of Michigan's preliminary survey of consumer sentiment for June is due out, with Wall Street economists expecting a slight improvement from the May level. Consumers have been cautious about spending the windfall from lower energy prices this year, and economists are looking for signs of whether that is changing. --Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text:   Live in the moment: If you're skiing, surfing or scuba diving, that's the way to go. But if you're investing, that approach can lead to disaster.
The numbers show that most people who are lucky enough to have money to invest end up underperforming the markets by staggering margins. A big reason for that is living in the moment -- acting in response to ephemeral events. Most of us would be much better off we focused relentlessly on the far horizon, sticking with a simple and cheap plan for getting there.
"When investors think short-term and try to time the market, they haven't done very well," Louis S. Harvey, the president of Dalbar, a Boston research firm, said in an interview. "They have been leaving a lot of money on the table."
His company has been chronicling mutual fund investors' efforts to beat financial markets for many years, and it has found that as a group, typical investors almost invariably lose.
The numbers are devastating.
For the two decades through December, Dalbar found, the actual annualized return for the average stock mutual fund investor was only 5.19 percent, 4.66 percentage points lower than the 9.85 percent return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Bond investors did even worse, trailing the benchmark Barclays Aggregate Bond index by 4.71 percentage points.
In isolation, these figures, which aren't adjusted for inflation, may seem small. But they aren't when they recur year after year. In fact, because of the effects of compounding -- in which a positive return in one year adds to your stash and can grow further in subsequent years -- those annualized numbers translate into life-changing disparities.
Consider a $10,000 investment in the S.&P. 500 index. Using the Dalbar rates, my calculations show that with dividends, that $10,000 would grow to $65,464 over 20 years, compared with only $27,510 over the same period for the return of the average stock mutual fund investors.
That gap grows over time. At those rates after 40 years, with compounding, the nest egg invested in the plain vanilla stock index would grow to about $428,550, compared with only $75,680 for the average returns of stock mutual fund investors, a $352,870 difference. Disparities of this order have been showing up year after year in the Dalbar numbers. And with so many Americans forced to rely on their own investing acumen because of the decline of traditional pension plans and lax government rules about financial advice, these awful returns really matter.
Why do typical mutual fund investors do so badly? For multiple reasons, and I've written about some of them in recent columns. Briefly, actively managed mutual funds over long periods tend to underperform the market, and, as a group, don't do markedly better than would be expected from flipping coins. Expenses eat into returns. Buying -- and holding -- a low-cost index fund over an extended period would improve the returns of most people radically, the Dalbar numbers suggest.
That's where living in the moment comes in. People tend to make big mistakes in periods of big up or down market moves, when finance is in the news, Dalbar has found. And while chasing better returns, investors often buy into funds that don't match market returns, once costs are included. When you factor in those choices, typical investors actually earn less "in many cases, much less -- than mutual fund performance reports would suggest," the Dalbar report says.
By buying and selling too frequently and at the wrong times and not benefiting fully from compounding, people typically do even worse than they would have done if they simply held on to their investments -- even if those investments were in mutual funds that themselves trailed the market, Dalbar found. In short, investors have been penalized multiple times -- for buying funds that underperform, for selling those funds at the wrong times and, often, by generating unnecessary costs by trading relatively frequently.
Some clues as to why this happens year after year appear when you review long-term market returns. I did that, using historical data from Morningstar's Ibbotson unit. I examined the monthly returns of a large capitalization stock index and an index modeling the medium-term United States Treasury market over hundreds of rolling one-, five-, 10- and 20-year periods going back to 1926. I also looked at the blended returns of those two indexes in simple asset allocation portfolios.
On the positive side, the numbers show the beneficial effects of simply buying and holding portfolios based on the simplest and most straightforward of plain vanilla market indexes over long periods. Over 20-year periods, if investors had been patient enough to wait that long, they could have had remarkably consistent, favorable returns, as the Dalbar study suggests. Over short stretches, though, the data shows that the pure stock portfolio produced stomach-churning variations. Looking at these numbers, it's no wonder that investors have been alternately frightened and enticed, driving up their own costs by shifting their holdings incessantly into hot funds, usually at inopportune times. But if you had lengthened your perspective, it would have been easier to stay in the market. As the holding periods extended, the growth in the $10,000 portfolio became more consistent. The $10,000 stock portfolio, after 20 years of compounding, ranged in size from a bonanza of $286,386 in the two decades through March 2000, to the modest sum of $14,539 in the 20 years through August 1949. In every rolling 20-year period -- and there were 833 of them -- the returns were positive.
Bond returns were generally lower but steadier, and when you mixed bonds with stocks, as modern portfolio theory suggests you should, you had extremely smooth returns. In fact, a simple portfolio composed of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds never produced a loss over any 10-year stretch in nearly 90 years. The average annual return for those periods was nearly 9 percent, and it was more than 9 percent for the 20-year periods.
It isn't hard to set up a portfolio like this, either. It can be done by buying low-cost index funds, either as exchange-traded funds or mutual funds, and rebalancing them every so often; many asset allocation funds will do all the work for you. Investors can diversify further by including foreign stocks and bonds but, as John Rekenthaler, vice president for research at Morningstar, said in an interview, "It's not just about buying hot mutual funds. It's important not to chase hot asset classes, either. Long-term and steady, both of them, are important."
But to pull off a strategy like this, you would need to ignore the moment and take the long view. If you had done that, you would have beaten most investors and most comparable mutual funds, and you would have an impressive stash.
Past performance definitely does not guarantee future returns, and this approach might not work as well over the next five, 10, or 100 years. But it's a baseline. I'm not sure that anything else is better, at least not for those of us who don't invest full time. The beauty of this method is that it can be accomplished at low cost by anyone with enough money and discipline, or obliviousness, to take a really long view.
Live in the moment, by all means. But invest in the future.

Full text:   You could almost hear the sighs of relief.
Worries about the American economy's momentum were blunted on Friday by the government's announcement that e mployers added a hefty 280,000 jobs in May, well above the monthly average logged over the last year.
The official unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 5.5 percent as more Americans jumped back into the labor pool and began the job hunt. Hourly wages, which have grown fitfully, rose 0.3 percent last month, possibly helping to lure back some discouraged workers who had been staying on the sidelines.
The new data is likely to buttress the argument that the economy's modest contraction in the first quarter and other pasty-faced reports were a blip, partly a casualty of the harsh winter, rather than evidence of a more fundamental slowdown.
The return of stronger job growth is also likely to bolster the resolve of Federal Reserve officials who hope to start raising interest rates from their near-zero level later this year.
"This is the best combination of numbers we have seen in many months," said Tara M. Sinclair, an associate professor of economics at George Washington University and an economist at Indeed.com. She was unconcerned about the bump up in the jobless rate because "wages are ticking up and attracting people back into the labor force; we are still seeing strong employment growth."
Still, as the recovery reaches its sixth anniversary, there are signs that the gains have not been spread evenly.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes part-time workers who want full-time jobs and those too discouraged to even search, remained at 10.8 percent, a figure that has not dropped as much over the past year as economists had hoped. Although nearly two-thirds of Americans surveyed said they were either "doing O.K." or "living comfortably," the rest reported they were "just getting by" or struggling, according to the Federal Reserve's recently released annual survey on families' financial well-being.
Americans' mixed economic fortunes have been sounded as a theme by the growing ranks of candidates entering the 2016 presidential race. Rick Perry, a Republican and a former Texas governor who announced this week, talked about "unleashing economic growth and reviving the American dream." Rick Santorum, a Republican former senator from Pennsylvania, pledged to restore the "hollowed out" middle class during his announcement a week earlier.
Education and skills have become even more highly prized by employers, experts said. "It's a tale of two economies, the economy of the unskilled, and the economy of the semiskilled and the skilled," said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City that operates nationally.
There is pent-up demand for those with skills, like machinists, engineers and information and technology workers, he said, but those without that edge are continuing to have a tough time.
"We're out here on Main Street, not Wall Street," said Mr. Funk, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. "We get a feel of medium and small companies and their attitudes. They are reticent to hire because they are not sure which way the economy is going to go."
Investors were jittery, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note reached an eight-month high of 2.43 percent after the report was published. It closed at 2.41 percent.
The Fed's assessment in the coming months will carry the most weight, as it considers whether to raise its benchmark rate.
On Friday, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said, "I continue to expect that monetary policy normalization is likely to begin later this year."
That declaration was more optimistic than some of the concerns recently voiced by Fed officials after a string of lackluster economic reports.
This week, James B. Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said that he expected the economy to improve enough to justify a rate increase this year, but the frail first quarter made everyone doubly cautious.
"We should be and are appropriately talking about how to normalize monetary policy," Mr. Bullard said. "On the other hand, you've got near-term concerns -- the first-quarter negative G.D.P. number and maybe some consumption numbers, including retail sales -- that look weaker than we had anticipated."
"I think that will all be transient," he added.
On Thursday, the International Monetary Fund asked the Fed to hold off raising rates until the first half of 2016 because of disappointing growth and a lack of inflation.
Strong job gains and wage increases through the summer would go a long way toward easing such anxieties.
Some employers were showing their optimism by hiring. Dave Maxheimer, director of human resources at Hagie Manufacturing in Iowa, which builds high-tech farm equipment, said his firm was expanding its 450-person work force by 5 percent, and was most in need of highly skilled technicians to make service calls.
"Now crops are in the ground and everything is starting to go in the right direction," he said. "We're sold out into August and building everything to order."
Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, called Friday's data "undeniably the best report of 2015." He said that the jobs gains in May were distributed across several sectors including health care, education and leisure and hospitality.
"People don't go on vacation unless they have some disposable income," Mr. Perez said. He also noted that more workers were quitting voluntarily "because they have confidence they can get a better job."
That sentiment was echoed on the ground. Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm, said: "We've seen permanent hiring kick in in the second quarter. People are now not afraid to make a move. They'll leave their existing companies for a new job."
For Mr. Gimbel, the most convincing sign of an upswing in the labor market was missing, however. Employers are still reluctant to convert their temporary hires into permanent workers. "When that's happened, the economy is killing," he said, "but we're not seeing that yet."
That "good, but" description applied to other elements of the jobs report. The proportion of the working-age population that is employed -- which some economists consider a bellwether of how the economy is performing -- rose to 59.4 percent. It is the highest point since the recovery began six years ago, though still significantly below its prerecession levels.
Similarly, the labor participation rate inched up to 62.9 percent in May. But it continues to be mired in a historically low range, with millions of workers staying out of the work force.
Consumers appear to remain on guard, choosing to bank their savings from low gasoline prices, for example, rather than spend the money. And daily financial challenges manifest themselves in small ways and large.
Nearly half of respondents in the Fed survey, for example, said they lacked the resources to cover an unexpected emergency that cost $400. Nearly one-third said they had skipped some form of medical care last year because they could not afford it.
Productivity growth, too, has been disappointing, economists say, dragging down overall growth and hampering further wage increases.
Job growth without any gains in productivity "is fine for a month, but it's not a lifestyle," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right public policy institute, and a former Congressional Budget Office director. "That is where we get increases in our standard of living."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund said Thursday that the Federal Reserve should wait until next year before raising its benchmark interest rate, citing the stubborn persistence of sluggish inflation.
In an annual review of the United States economy, the I.M.F. said growth had been slower than it expected, and it cut its 2015 forecast to 2.5 percent, from 3.1 percent. While growth is likely to strengthen in the coming months, the I.M.F. said the Fed risked moving too quickly if it started raising rates this year.
"We are saying that the economy would be better off with a rate hike in early 2016," Christine Lagarde, the fund's managing director, said at a news conference Thursday.
The I.M.F.'s cautionary message comes as Fed leaders continue to indicate that they would like to start raising rates this year. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said last month that she anticipated raising rates as long as growth remained on track.
The Fed plans to release its own updated economic and policy forecasts after the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 17.
The Fed has held rates near zero since December 2008, and officials have said that they are eager to begin the long, slow journey back toward normalcy. But growth continues to disappoint their expectations. The economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the first quarter, according to the latest government estimate. Job growth has weakened. And the Fed's preferred measure of inflation rose just 1.2 percent during the 12 months through April, the government said this week.
The I.M.F. said that the strength of the dollar, caused partly because of weakness in the rest of the developed world, was dragging on domestic growth and that things could get worse.
"There is a risk that a further marked appreciation of the dollar -- particularly one that takes place in an environment where policies to address growth deficiencies languish both in the U.S. and abroad -- would be harmful," it said.
Given that the American economy has room to grow, the I.M.F. said that the risks of raising rates too quickly outstripped the risks of waiting too long.
Ms. Lagarde said it also made sense for the Fed to raise rates slowly.
Fed officials, too, have expressed concern about the global economy. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said in a speech this week that "foreign headwinds" were causing problems that could lead the Fed to delay interest rate increases.
She said the Fed should adopt a stance of "watchful waiting" and offered the cautious assessment that "liftoff could come before the end of the year."
Only a few Fed officials, however, have suggested that the Fed should wait until next year.
One of those officials, Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, reiterated Wednesday in Chicago that the Fed should wait to raise rates until inflation strengthens.
"The hurdle is pretty high for raising rates at the moment," Mr. Evans told reporters.
That remains a minority view among Fed officials. Surveys of Wall Street analysts show that most expect the Fed to start raising rates in September. Goldman Sachs said last week that it expected the Fed to start either in September or December.

Full text:   PARIS -- Consumer prices in the eurozone rose for the first time in six months, an official report showed on Tuesday, but they remain far below the European Central Bank's target level.
Prices in the currency region used by 19 European Union member nations rose 0.3 percent in May from a year earlier, according to a preliminary report from Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, slightly better than economists had expected.
Jennifer McKeown, an analyst at Capital Economics in London, said in a research note that the latest price data offered "some relief" to the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, which meets on Wednesday in Frankfurt to set monetary policy. Still, she added, "with underlying price pressures still very weak and the recovery seemingly slowing, strong monetary policy support will be needed for the foreseeable future."
Fears had been building since last year that the region could lapse into deeper economic stagnation and unemployment as the annual rate of inflation turned negative in December and hit its lowest point, minus 0.6 percent, in January. Consumer prices have been improving in recent months, and they were flat at the last reading, in April.
Energy costs, which began falling sharply in June 2014, weighed on prices in May and were down 5 percent from a year earlier. But the so-called core inflation rate, which strips out energy and food prices, rose 0.9 percent; economists and policy makers favor the core measure as a truer indicator of price trends than the headline figure.
While lower fuel prices have been a boon for consumers, economists have expressed fears that Europe is headed for a broad decline in prices known as deflation, which saps growth and punishes borrowers by raising the real cost of loan repayment.
The current level of inflation, which International Monetary Fund economists have termed "lowflation," is too weak for comfort and far below the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent. With unemployment in the region above 11 percent and output well below potential, the central bank has not been able to hit that target since January 2013.
To address those concerns and restart growth, the central bank in March began buying bonds on a large scale in a policy known as quantitative easing. The bank has pledged to buy 60 billion euros, or about $66 billion, in bonds each month through at least September 2016, hoping that lower yields and a weaker euro will restore momentum and break the deflationary pressures.
That policy, along with the fall in energy prices, appears to be giving a push to a recovery in the region.
The eurozone economy grew at a 1.6 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, sharply outpacing the United States economy, which contracted.
Deflationary pressures are a concern to policy makers across the globe. Some analysts expect that the Federal Reserve, for instance, may hold off until late this year on its expected campaign to raise interest rates, until United States growth moves to firmer footing and prices begin to rise.
A report on Tuesday from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the group of 34 industrialized nations, showed that consumer prices in the group rose just 0.4 percent in April from a year earlier.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- John Koskinen, the head of the Internal Revenue Service, on Tuesday attributed a recent online attack that exposed the information of more than 100,000 taxpayers to the agency's inability to keep up with increasingly sophisticated threats.
Appearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Koskinen said the agency faced the same pressure as those in the private sector to stay ahead of nimble, international criminals intent on stealing people's identities.
"What worked yesterday, what worked a year ago may not be working anymore today, so you continually have to attack that problem," he said.
The I.R.S. revealed last week that an attack had exposed tax returns of thousands of people through Get Transcript, an application on the agency's website. Mr. Koskinen said the agency had contacted those whose information had been compromised and offered them free credit monitoring.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the committee's chairman, was critical of the I.R.S..
"Put simply, your agency has failed these taxpayers," he said.
J. Russell George, a Treasury Department inspector general who oversees tax administration, said his office identified protecting personal data as the agency's greatest challenge in 2011, offering recommendations for how the I.R.S. could improve its practices. He declined to say whether following those suggestions could have prevented the recent breach.
"I can say it would have been much more difficult had they implemented all of the recommendations that we made," he said.
Mr. George acknowledged the difficulties facing the agency and other entities in today's "ever-changing and rapidly evolving hacker world."
"It's a true challenge for the I.R.S. to make a balance between ease of access and security," he said.
Mr. George said reports that the attack had come from Russia alone were inaccurate, though he would not specify where else the hackers may have been based. Mr. Koskinen said it appeared to be the work of a global criminal operation.
"Our experience looking at syndicates around the world is they cooperate when it's in their interest, and they cross boundaries," Mr. Koskinen said.
Mr. Hatch said discussions about the agency's funding should be delayed until the cause of the breach could be determined. But Democrats said that Congress -- which has cut the I.R.S. budget by 18 percent since 2010, adjusted for inflation -- should do more to help.
Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said the best way to defend against such attacks was to ensure that the agency had the funding to hire skilled employees and keep its software updated.
"If you have I.T. from the dark ages, you are not going to be able to stay on top of these problems," Mr. Wyden said.
Mr. Koskinen said they were hamstrung by "an antiquated system," adding that sometimes upgrades were not available for their software because the software's creator no longer offered updates. He asked lawmakers to fully fund President Obama's latest budget request, including about $101 million to protect taxpayers' information.
But emphasizing the scope of the problem in a culture where one leak can compromise security for governments and companies all over the globe, Mr. Koskinen pointed out that the hackers were able to complete a multistep authentication process using personal information about taxpayers that they had collected elsewhere.
"This particular problem was not a question of resources," he said.

Full text:   The market remains stuck in a rut.
On Tuesday, U.S. stocks ended the day with a slight loss as gains for the energy sector were offset by a slump in utilities. Treasury notes fell for a second day after a report showed that consumer prices rose in Europe for the first time since November, a sign that global inflation is picking up from a low base.
Stocks have been treading water for a month now as a series of modest gains and losses have canceled each other out. The market remains close to record levels after a six-year bull-run, but investors appear reluctant to push prices any further without first seeing evidence that the economy is recovering from its winter slump.
"It's still a decent market," said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust. "We're up for the year but it's not flying off the roof like it has been for the last five, or six years."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,109.60. The index has gained 0.1 percent in the past month.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 28.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,011.94. The Nasdaq fell 6.40 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,076.52.
Utilities led declines for stocks as bond yields climbed for a second day.
Last year, investors bought dividend-rich utility stocks as bond yields plunged, but that trend has reversed as bond yields have edged higher in the last four months. The sector has dropped 7.6 percent this year, making it the worst performer among the 10 industry groups that make up the S.&P. 500.
The slump in that sector on Tuesday was offset by a gain in energy stocks, which benefited from higher oil prices.
Oil closed at its highest level since December as the dollar fell against the euro. Oil is priced in dollars, and a drop in the value of the U.S. currency pushes up the price that producers demand for oil.
Despite the recent lack of momentum for stocks, the trend still points for higher prices, said Karyn Cavanaugh, a senior vice president at Voya Investment Management. She believes that stocks will resume their ascent as the economy strengthens and company earnings keep rising.
"The tendency is up, but it's not always a straight line," said Ms. Cavanaugh.
Among the day's biggest winners on Tuesday was PVH, the company behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. The stock jumped after the company reported earnings that beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts. The company also announced that its board had approved a $500 million share buyback program.
Investors were also following developments involving Greece's fiscal troubles, a day after an emergency meeting of the nation's international creditors.
Greece has submitted a proposal it hopes will secure a deal to get more funds from its lenders. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said it was now up Europe's leaders to accept a deal or risk potentially disastrous consequences for the region. For four months, Greece and its creditors have been locked in a standoff over what reforms the country needs to make to get more loans.
In bond trading, prices fell, pushing yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.27 percent from 2.18 percent on Monday. European government bond yields also rose broadly. The yield on the 10-year German government bond rose to 0.72 percent from 0.55 percent, a large move.
The dollar weakened against the Japanese yen. Earlier, it climbed above 125 yen for the first time since 2002. The U.S. currency also weakened against the dollar after the consumer prices report. The currency traded up at $1.1153, from $1.0934 the day before.
In metals trading, gold was little changed at $1,194.40 an ounce. The price of silver rose 12 cents to $16.80 an ounce. Copper climbed 1.6 cents to $2.74 per pound.
In other futures trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline rose 2.3 cents to close at $2.065 a gallon; heating oil rose 2 cents to close at $1.946 a gallon; and natural gas rose 4.9 cents to close at $2.698 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The Risk of Over-Thanking Veterans

Abstract: In Washington, this knee-jerk support has resulted in policy decisions that will hurt both vets and the larger public over time. Since 2000, the Department of Veterans Affairs has seen its budget nearly triple. Over the last 14 years of war, America has experienced a perfect storm of sympathy for veterans: a combination of unmet needs like vets waiting for care, an admiring but ultimately disengaged public and a political class with almost no military experience that feels it lacks the moral authority to say no.

Full text:   TRAVELING through an airport recently, I witnessed a now-commonplace ritual: military personnel getting head-of-the-line privileges in the boarding area. As we complete the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, one of the legacies of the longest war in our history is how the public has rallied to support those who served.
While this can seem superficial at times, there is not a vet alive who would prefer the other extreme. My father served in Vietnam, and the welcome home his generation received was a national disgrace.
Unfortunately, the modern-day lionization of veterans has itself gone too far. In Washington, this knee-jerk support has resulted in policy decisions that will hurt both vets and the larger public over time.
Since 2000, the Department of Veterans Affairs has seen its budget nearly triple. Its programs run the gamut from burial benefits to job training. But among the biggest cost drivers is the disability-compensation system, which now approaches $60 billion per year.
These disability payments are separate from medical costs associated with treating an injury, and are set at varying levels to compensate injured veterans for an assumed inability to work. The average payout has risen 60 percent (inflation-adjusted) since 2000, and the proportion of veterans receiving some form of compensation has nearly doubled.
And while most vets who receive disability checks deserve them, one of the worst kept secrets among those seeking a disability rating is that the system can be beaten. Claim the right combination of symptoms, whether you are suffering or not, and there is a decent chance you can get a monthly disability check, tax free, for the rest of your life. There are even blogs out there to walk you through the process of claiming an injury that cannot be disproved.
Sometimes it takes no effort at all. When I left the Navy in 2005, I filled out a form and got a medical exam in order to document a fractured shoulder that I had sustained in the line of duty. Soon after, I received a rating and my first monthly direct-deposit payment.
Not feeling entitled to anything other than medical care, I attempted to discontinue the payment, but was told there was no process for doing so. Even my ability to hold a full-time job had no bearing on my disability rating.
As a nation, we have no greater duty than to care for those who have fought our battles. But the current disability-compensation regime demands a closer look, not only for the sake of financial prudence but also to avoid creating a culture of dependency. A recent study by Mark Duggan, an economist at Stanford, linked rising disability payments to increased unemployment among veterans. The author suggests that such payments may reduce the "recipient's propensity to work" because disability checks obviate the need for a job.
Someday, once all the backlogs at Veterans Affairs are cleared, many will declare "mission accomplished." But this is when the real problem will emerge. The annual cost of disability compensation is rising steadily, to $60 billion today from $20 billion in 2000. That curve continues to bend upward. The American public will move beyond superficial expressions of support and ask, "Is this bill too high?" They are the ones, after all, who are stuck with the tab. Payouts set to top $100 billion are going to draw attention.
So how did we get here? Over the last 14 years of war, America has experienced a perfect storm of sympathy for veterans: a combination of unmet needs like vets waiting for care, an admiring but ultimately disengaged public and a political class with almost no military experience that feels it lacks the moral authority to say no. Today, it is taboo to question the honor of a veteran seeking compensation, and those who dare challenge the benefits system are deemed insufficiently patriotic.
Policy updates can address some of this. Veterans Affairs should look harder at ways the system is being gamed, and abuses should be ended much as we go after phony workers' compensation claims. There should be an option for those who want to document injuries to guarantee medical care, but who do not want a compensation payment. And we should double down on programs like job training that empower veterans as opposed to creating dependencies.
We have come a long way since Vietnam, and for that we should be grateful. But over time, an act as simple as honoring service members at the airport can morph into something altogether dishonorable. As veterans, we should not demand more than we are owed. As a society, we should have the guts to push back when necessary, and elect leaders who can make tough choices about issues such as Veterans Affairs spending. Above all, we must guard against the day when the benefits veterans have rightfully earned become a source of resentment to those they have faithfully served.

Full text:   U.S. Economic Snapshots
On Monday at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department reports on personal income and consumption growth in April. Economists estimate that consumption spending rose 0.2 percent, while personal income rose 0.3 percent. Despite the big fall in energy prices over the last year, consumers have been cautious about spending, one reason that experts think consumption in April was muted.
In a separate report on Monday, the private Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index reading for May is expected to show little change from April, with the strong dollar hurting manufacturers that sell overseas. --Nelson D. Schwartz
Gulf Oil Spill Trial
David Rainey, a former BP executive, goes on trial Monday in a New Orleans federal court on charges of making false statements to congressional investigators in which he played down the rate of oil flowing from the well after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010.
According to prosecutors, Mr. Rainey, who was BP's vice president for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, falsely claimed in statements that the leaky Macondo well was releasing oil at a flow rate of only about 5,000 barrels a day and deliberately left out documents that contradicted that figure. --Clifford Krauss
Eyes on the E.C.B.
The European Central Bank holds a monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt on Wednesday, followed by a news conference with Mario Draghi, the central bank's president. Analysts expect Mr. Draghi to reinforce the E.C.B.'s determination to maintain its stimulus of the eurozone economy at least until September 2016. Mr. Draghi will also be questioned closely about Greece and the central bank's willingness to continue extending emergency credit to Greek commercial banks suffering from an outflow of deposits. --Jack Ewing
House Takes Up Trade Bill
The battle over President Obama's ambitious trade agenda moves to the House this week, where only 17 of 188 Democrats have come out in favor of the bill. Republicans generally support a trade deal, but many of the most conservative Republicans do not want to give Mr. Obama anything. The legislation would be the first to grant a president trade promotion authority since 2002.
British Benchmark
The Bank of England holds a monetary policy meeting on Thursday. Analysts expect the central bank to leave its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent. Although growth is strong, there is little sign of inflation, giving the Bank of England space to keep rates low to encourage borrowing and compensate for spending cuts that the re-elected conservative government is expected to make. --Jack Ewing
U.S. Employment Picture
On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will report the latest data on hiring and the unemployment rate for May. Wall Street economists are looking for a gain of nearly 230,000 in payrolls, although some experts think the number could be higher because data on weekly initial jobless claims have signaled stronger hiring lately.
On the other hand, new figures on Friday showed that the economy shrank in the first quarter. So investors will be watching closely to see if the economy gained steam in May or remains in the doldrums. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 5.4 percent. --Nelson D. Schwartz
OPEC Sets Target
Officials of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are scheduled to meet in Vienna on Friday. Analysts do not expect the 12-member group to change its target for production of 30 million barrels a day. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, decided in November not to cut output to try to bolster falling prices.
The new strategy is intended to preserve OPEC's roughly 30 percent share of the global oil market and to force higher-cost producers like the Canadian tar sands projects and some shale oil drillers in the United States to cut their output. --Stanley Reed
Greek Debt Deadline
Greece, which has been locked in tough negotiations with its international creditors, faces a critical debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund on Friday. The country's dwindling finances have fueled fears that it may default on its huge debt burden over the summer. Top eurozone and I.M.F. officials have indicated that a Greek exit from the single currency bloc cannot be ruled out, as speculation mounts about the global repercussions of such a development.
The Greek authorities have given mixed messages about whether they will be able to pay the sum of 300 million euros, or $330 million, on Friday -- the first of some [euro]1.5 billion in repayments due to the I.M.F. in June. Even if it meets its June commitments, Greece will be unable to repay [euro]6.7 billion owed to the European Central Bank in July and August without additional bailout funding. The country's lenders have said Greece must commit to economic reforms to secure further loans. But the government, which was elected in January on a pledge to roll back years of austerity, is reluctant to impose further cutbacks. --Niki Kitsantonis

Full text:   The government reckons that the American economy shrank over the winter, but no one really believes it.
Specifically, the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday revised the nation's gross domestic product to a new estimate that it contracted by 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year from its initial guess that the economy grew over the winter at an annual rate of 0.2 percent.
There seem to be as many asterisks on this report as might apply to Barry Bonds's baseball records. A better reading is that the economy continued to grow through the winter, albeit at a slower rate than in late 2014. While it is unlikely that growth was actually negative, it was still disappointing.
As I reported before the initial release of these numbers, many economists believe that there's a glitch in how government statisticians calculate these numbers. At issue is problems with how they adjust for the economy's usual seasonal ups and downs. These problems -- which the government statisticians have acknowledged and promise to fix -- mean that the official numbers have year after year understated economic growth in the winter quarter.
A reasonable guess is that this problem subtracted one or two percentage points from the headline measure. So this glitch alone explains why the numbers recorded a shrinking economy even when it probably grew.
Fortunately, there's a more reliable measure of economic growth, although it remains scandalously underappreciated. The headline that attracts all the attention is based on adding up each dollar of spending across the whole of the economy. But because every dollar you spend is a dollar of income to someone else, you can also measure the size of the economy by adding up people's incomes. In theory, the two measures should be identical. In practice, they differ because they're based on different surveys. An impressive body of research has demonstrated that the income-based measure is more reliable.
This alternative measure, called gross domestic income, grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the winter, after growing at an impressive 3.7 percent the previous quarter. This alternative measure bears special emphasis right now because it appears to be unaffected by the seasonal adjustment problems that are muddling the spending-based estimate.
Here at The Upshot we have been emphasizing this alternative measure for some time. It's a point that the Bureau of Economic Analysis has recently endorsed, announcing that as of July it will publish a new measure of gross domestic product: a simple average of the spending- and income-based measures. Economic commentary will be enormously improved if this becomes the new headline that analysts focus on. Right now, it suggests that the economy grew a healthy 3.1 percent over the past year.
The other asterisks on this report are less about problems with measurement and more about what the measurements represent. For instance, this winter was especially snowy in heavily populated areas, and international trade was disrupted by a port strike. Jason Furman, the White House economist, estimates that the snow alone "reduced annualized growth by about a full percentage point this quarter." The port strike might be worth another quarter or perhaps half a percentage point. But the snow has melted, and the ports are open again, so this is the sort of setback that should not cause too much worry.
Moreover, much of our economic weakness occurred in types of spending where weakness is often fleeting. To get a sense of the underlying momentum of business and consumer spending, economists often focus on those components that tend to predict future momentum. In particular, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will soon emphasize a measure called "final sales to private domestic purchasers."
It's a dreadful mouthful, but it's basically a measure that discards the volatile parts of G.D.P. -- inventories, international trade and government spending. That measure grew by 1.2 percent in the winter quarter. Even as the headline estimate of economic growth was revised downward, this measure of underlying momentum was revised up a tick, suggesting that all of the bad news in this report occurred in volatile measures that do not much speak to the economy's prospects.
All of this suggests that the economy is growing faster than this extremely pessimistic report suggests. This isn't an argument for optimism, though, so much as reduced pessimism.
However you view the numbers, economic growth looks to have slowed through the winter to a disappointing pace. More worryingly, the one-off factors that slowed the economy in winter should cause faster growth in the spring, as the economy snaps back on track, but this has yet to materialize.
Given the statistical fog, the best forecast I can muster is to expect uncertainty to continue to cloud the outlook.

I.R.S. Breach Exposes Data of Taxpayers

Abstract: [...]the breach is also likely to prompt the Obama administration to redouble its efforts to increase the I.R.S.'s budget, which has been cut 18 percent since 2010, adjusting for inflation. Since 2010, the agency has shed more than 13,000 employees, or 14 percent of the work force, with nearly 10,000 lost jobs coming from the enforcement staff, which is down 20 percent since 2010.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Criminals used stolen data to gain access to past tax returns of more than 100,000 people through an application on the Internal Revenue Service's website, the agency said on Tuesday.
Using Social Security numbers, birth dates, street addresses and other personal information obtained elsewhere, the criminals completed a multistep authentication process and requested the tax returns and other filings, the I.R.S. said. Information from those forms was used to file fraudulent returns, the I.R.S. said, and the agency sent nearly $50 million in refunds before it detected the scheme.
"We're confident that these are not amateurs," John Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner, said. "These actually are organized crime syndicates that not only we but everybody in the financial industry are dealing with."
The agency has opened an investigation into the breach and has temporarily shut down the Get Transcript application, which was used to gain access to the information. Old tax returns are sometimes needed to apply for college loans or mortgages, and taxpayers can still request the records by mail.
More than 200,000 attempts to view the past returns using stolen information were made from February to mid-May, and about half were successful. It is unclear whether the criminals were operating inside or outside the United States.
Dealing with fraudulent tax claims has been a challenge for the I.R.S. as online crime has grown more sophisticated in recent years. The agency paid $5.8 billion in falsely claimed refunds in 2013.
"Eighty percent of the identity theft we're dealing with and refund fraud is related to organized crime here and around the world," Mr. Koskinen said at a news conference on Tuesday. "These are extremely sophisticated criminals with access to a tremendous amount of data."
The I.R.S. said the attackers exploited data, like email addresses and passwords gleaned from other breaches, to answer basic authentication questions about subjects like birth dates or the names of family members. After recent breaches at the health insurer Anthem and Home Depot, security experts note that users' personal information is now widely available to hackers, who can buy it from criminal websites.
"This is a wake-up call that breaches have a compounding effect and the stakes are getting higher," said Eric Chiu, a security expert who is the president of HyTrust, a cloud computing security company. "Attackers are on the hunt for our personal and financial information using data stolen from other breaches to gain a larger amount of information on those same individuals."
The consequence, Mr. Chiu said, "could be devastating to consumers -- attacks can potentially open new accounts, siphon off funds and ultimately steal identities of victims."
After the I.R.S. disclosed the breach, security experts criticized the agency for not adding more context to the authentication questions, or using a so-called multifactor system that sends users a second password via their mobile phone. Experts also criticized the agency for not deploying technology that looks for suspicious activity, such as multiple sign-in attempts from the same device, or encrypting sensitive information.
But Mr. Koskinen said that the I.R.S. had stopped almost three million suspicious returns this year, and officials say that new computer filters that look for anomalies have helped prevent identity theft.
Senate Finance Committee aides said Mr. Koskinen called the committee's chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, late last week to notify him of the breach. The committee kept it quiet while law enforcement officials opened the investigation.
Word of the breach prompted Republicans to increase their attacks on the tax collection agency, which has faced criticism since revelations that the I.R.S. had intentionally targeted political organizations for extra scrutiny of their tax-exempt applications.
"That the I.R.S. -- home to highly sensitive information on every single American and every single company doing business here at home -- was vulnerable to this attack is simply unacceptable," Mr. Hatch said. "What's more, this agency has been repeatedly warned by top government watchdogs that its data security systems are inadequate against the growing threat of international hackers and data thieves."
But the breach is also likely to prompt the Obama administration to redouble its efforts to increase the I.R.S.'s budget, which has been cut 18 percent since 2010, adjusting for inflation. Since 2010, the agency has shed more than 13,000 employees, or 14 percent of the work force, with nearly 10,000 lost jobs coming from the enforcement staff, which is down 20 percent since 2010.
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he had spoken with Mr. Koskinen, who assured him that the I.R.S. was getting to the bottom of the problem. "It is important that members of Congress work together to ensure that the I.R.S. has adequate resources to carry out the vital priority of protecting confidential taxpayer information," Mr. Levin said.
The agency sent letters to the taxpayers whose accounts had been compromised, and it will offer them free credit monitoring. The I.R.S. said its main computer system, which handles tax filings, had not been breached.
"During this filing season, taxpayers successfully and safely downloaded a total of approximately 23 million transcripts," the agency said.

Jury Is Still Out on European Central Bank's Stimulus Program

Abstract: The main purpose of quantitative easing, or Q.E. in economists' jargon, is to push inflation closer to the 2 percent rate that the European Central Bank considers optimal for healthy growth. At a conference of high-ranking central bankers and economists held by the European Central Bank here late last week, quantitative easing was nowhere on the official agenda.

Full text:   SINTRA, Portugal -- By some measures, the European Central Bank is confounding the naysayers.
When the eurozone's central bank started its stimulus program in March, critics warned that its planned monthly infusions of 60 billion freshly minted euros would not be enough to jolt the economy back to life.
But growth is picking up. Eurozone inflation, whose dangerously low level helped spur the central bank to action, is showing signs of life. Borrowing costs for businesses and individuals have fallen, though any growth in lending has been slow to emerge.
And if the eurozone's weakest member, Greece, tips into bankruptcy and its economy collapses -- a danger looking increasingly likely -- the stimulus program could give the currency bloc a safety cushion. The central bank's huge purchases of eurozone government debt, known as quantitative easing, would help calm bond markets if Greece is forced out of the eurozone.
Still, there are reasons to doubt how much credit the European Central Bank can take for the improved economic outlook -- and, more important, how long the good times will last.
At the very least, "quantitative easing removes the risk of another shock," said Stefano Micossi, director general of Assonime, a business association and research organization in Rome.
A lot of the positive effect from the stimulus program, though, comes from the declining interest rates it provoked -- which translated into a plunge in the euro's value as investors turned to other shores in search of better returns. A weak currency is good for exports, because it makes eurozone products cheaper for customers paying in other currencies like the dollar.
But gains for eurozone exporters come at the expense of competitors in the United States and elsewhere. It's a zero-sum game. In the long run, the eurozone has no interest in undercutting the American economy, a huge market for its goods and services.
What's more, the stimulus from a weak euro could prove only temporary. The euro is still down 11 percent compared with November, when the European Central Bank began sending strong signals that quantitative easing was imminent. But the currency was much lower than that earlier this year, and it has risen 6 percent against the dollar since mid-April, as there are signs that the United States economy is not growing as fast as expected.
As of May 22, the European Central Bank had bought government debt valued at [euro]134 billion, or about $147 billion. It plans to keep buying [euro]60 billion of eurozone government debt each month through at least September of next year -- and beyond that, if deemed necessary.
The main purpose of quantitative easing, or Q.E. in economists' jargon, is to push inflation closer to the 2 percent rate that the European Central Bank considers optimal for healthy growth. Inflation in the eurozone was zero in April -- not good, but progress compared with the negative rates seen in previous months.
The central bank's objectives "are still a long way off," economists at Commerzbank said in a note to clients. "We still believe that the E.C.B.'s hopes of far-reaching Q.E. success will be disappointed."
And yet, given the lengthy debate that preceded the European Central Bank's decision in January to begin the stimulus program, the aftermath has been remarkably quiet. The feared political backlash has not materialized yet.
At a conference of high-ranking central bankers and economists held by the European Central Bank here late last week, quantitative easing was nowhere on the official agenda. The research papers that economists presented focused on the conference theme of inflation and unemployment.
Before announcement of the stimulus program in January, Germany's opposition to central bank bond buying had been intense -- and a reason the European Central Bank did not adopt the program much sooner.
But Jens Weidmann, the president of the German central bank, who was one of the most vocal critics of bond buying, has been notably restrained since the program began. Mr. Weidmann told the German newspaper Handelsblatt this month that he remained skeptical of quantitative easing, but that it would damage the credibility of the European Central Bank "to repeatedly call its decisions into question."
The timing of the bond-buying program proved to be fortunate. The European Central Bank began its stimulus just as the Federal Reserve was winding down its similar, yearslong program in the United States. The beneficial effect on the euro exchange rate was immediate.
Another dose of stimulus came from the sharp decline in fuel prices, which merely coincided with the quantitative easing program. But that positive impetus to growth could also prove temporary, now that global oil prices have started edging back up.
Mr. Micossi, of the Assonime business association, said the stimulus program had had a particularly strong impact in Italy, one of the eurozone's shakiest economies. During the first three months of this year, the Italian economy grew for the first time since 2013. Registrations of new passenger cars in Italy surged 24 percent in April, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.
The European Central Bank cannot take all the credit for Italy's resurgence, given that the bond buying began only in March. But even the announcement of quantitative easing two months earlier provided an immediate boost to confidence, making businesses more willing to invest and consumers more willing to spend, Mr. Micossi said.
"Demand is coming back," he said. "The effect is very visible."
A key objective of the bond-buying program is to drive down market interest rates and ease a credit squeeze in Italy and other countries like Spain and Portugal.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, told an audience in Washington this month that lower rates were trickling down to private borrowers. "Our purchases have a direct and indirect effect across the whole financial system," he said.
And yet, so far there are only weak indications that banks are writing more loans. True, lending to businesses and households in the eurozone rose in March compared with a year earlier, the first annual increase in three years. But the gain was meager -- just 0.1 percent. Many banks are still struggling with many problem loans and are reluctant to issue new ones. More than a quarter of loans in Italy are classified as nonperforming.
Even quantitative easing's biggest fans do not think that the European Central Bank can revive the eurozone economy by itself. Mr. Draghi said at the conference here in Sintra that growth in the eurozone was chronically lower than in the United States, while unemployment is persistently higher, because political leaders have not done enough to create a better climate for entrepreneurs.
Most of the 19 countries in the eurozone rank poorly in the World Bank's index of how easy it is to do business, well below countries like the United States, Britain and South Korea.
Mr. Draghi urged political leaders to take advantage of the space that the central bank stimulus had given them to undertake what he called structural reforms -- a broad range of steps that would increase the eurozone's potential to grow.
"Monetary policy can steer the economy back to its potential," Mr. Draghi said in Sintra. "Structural reform can raise that potential. And it is the combination of these demand and supply policies that will deliver lasting stability and prosperity."

Abstract: [...]unlike the Fed, which has a broad mandate to fight inflation, contain unemployment and ensure moderate borrowing costs, the European Central Bank is required to make price stability its top priority, incorporating other concerns only if they do not interfere with the prime directive. In March, the European Central Bank followed a precedent set by the Fed and began buying tens of billions of euros worth of government bonds, a form of money printing intended to raise inflation closer to the official target of nearly 2 percent and stimulate the eurozone economy.

Full text:   SINTRA, Portugal -- Only a few years ago, the European Central Bank was regarded as relatively powerless when compared with its counterpart in the United States.
But as it has struggled to hold the eurozone together, the bank has become more like the Federal Reserve. And that was on view this weekend as top central bankers and economists gathered here to discuss economic issues that extended beyond the bank's mandate of containing inflation.
The title of the two-day gathering at a coastal golf resort here, "Inflation and Unemployment in Europe," offered a clue. With the eurozone's unemployment rate at 11.3 percent, the subject signaled concern among members of the European Central Bank's Governing Council about the persistence of a high rate of joblessness.
The European Central Bank's charter does not prohibit it from taking unemployment and other factors into consideration when setting interest rates. But unlike the Fed, which has a broad mandate to fight inflation, contain unemployment and ensure moderate borrowing costs, the European Central Bank is required to make price stability its top priority, incorporating other concerns only if they do not interfere with the prime directive.
Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, has sidestepped that restraint by arguing that the bank could not guarantee price stability unless it considered joblessness and other issues, like the state of the banking system.
At the conference, Catherine L. Mann, chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and other economists said the European Central Bank had to assume greater responsibilities because eurozone economies had not adjusted fast enough to the crisis that began in 2008.
"The single mandate is dead," Ms. Mann said.
The de facto expansion of the European Central Bank's mandate has occurred without any enabling legislation or formal endorsement from elected leaders. Some of the economic specialists in Sintra warned that the central bank risked a backlash at a time of widespread public disenchantment with the European Union.
Charles Wyplosz, a professor at the Graduate Institute Geneva, reminded conference participants of "how unpopular the European construction has become outside this room."
He criticized a proposal by Mr. Draghi that would put more pressure on European political leaders to overhaul their economies.
"If it's top down, if it's forced against public opinion, there's a backlash," Mr. Wyplosz said.
Mr. Draghi disputed that the European Central Bank had expanded its mandate. But he agreed that the bank had evolved substantially. "The crisis changed forever the E.C.B.," Mr. Draghi said at the conference, which was held at a former monastery converted into a luxury golf resort.
"The mandate is always the same, namely price stability in the euro area," he said. "But the instruments had to change."
All of the major central banks expanded their monetary policy arsenals after the financial crisis. In March, the European Central Bank followed a precedent set by the Fed and began buying tens of billions of euros worth of government bonds, a form of money printing intended to raise inflation closer to the official target of nearly 2 percent and stimulate the eurozone economy.
Michael C. Burda, a professor at the School of Business and Economics at Humboldt University in Berlin, said that the bond buying could become a permanent feature of eurozone monetary policy, as it is with Fed policy. Previously, the main way that the European Central Bank steered interest rates was by lending to banks. The rate it offered banks became a benchmark.
But when banks had no appetite to borrow, as has been the case in the eurozone in recent years, the central bank had problems influencing market interest rates.
The official program featured only passing reference to Greece, despite its increasingly acute financial problems.
The expansion of the European Central Bank's powers began under Mr. Draghi's predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, who was also vocal in advising governments. But in monetary policy, Mr. Trichet stuck close to the playbook inherited from the German central bank, the Bundesbank, with its fixation on price stability.
"We only have one needle in our compass," Mr. Trichet often said.
The Bank of Japan, the Japanese central bank, has also become more aggressive after two decades of falling prices and little growth. It has begun a bond buying program that is intended to reinforce a government spending program to stimulate the economy.
Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said here that the bond buying, known as quantitative easing, was not a quid pro quo agreement with the government but simply "a division of labor." The statement hinted at the discomfort that central bankers, who prize their independence from political influence, feel about interacting too closely with governments.
The actions of the European Central Bank have been crucial in holding the eurozone together, especially when political leaders could not agree on actions.
Mr. Draghi drew criticism at the conference, though, when he called for tougher measures to ensure that political leaders do more to improve the performance of their economies. While he did not fault any individual eurozone countries, he said that leaders needed to be bolder in dismantling regulations that prevented entrepreneurs from starting businesses and made it difficult to dismiss unwanted workers. Such action should be a condition of eurozone membership, he said.
Top officials of the Fed are more restrained in advising American political leaders. Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of the Fed, said at the conference that if central bankers told elected officials what to do, the elected officials would be emboldened to meddle in monetary policy.
"What do we say about things that aren't under our control but that matter from the viewpoint of the economy?" Mr. Fischer said during a panel discussion. "The answer is, you can talk about it from time to time, but you can't make this your main talking point."
But unlike the United States, the eurozone has no strong central government and few programs that automatically transfer money to economically distressed countries like Greece. No Europewide unemployment insurance exists, for example. The European Commission has limited power to coerce national governments to make changes economists say are necessary, but that are unpopular with voters or powerful interest groups.
Mr. Draghi said the European Central Bank had trouble doing its job because eurozone governments had not done enough to promote growth. Therefore he has a duty to speak up, he said.
"Central bank governors," he said, "should be quite clear about policies, or lack of policies, that hamper their mandates, that make their mandates more difficult or impossible."

Abstract: "If the economy continues to improve as I expect, I think it will be appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy," Ms. Yellen said. In a research note published on Monday, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said the government's seasonal adjustment was too large.

Full text:   Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that she still expected the Fed to start raising its benchmark interest rate later this year.
Weak growth during the first part of the year most likely reflected temporary disruptions, including the impact of winter weather, Ms. Yellen said in a speech delivered to the Chamber of Commerce in Providence, R.I. She added that government estimates also may have overstated the impact on the economy.
"If the economy continues to improve as I expect, I think it will be appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy," Ms. Yellen said.
Ms. Yellen's speech is the latest indication that the Fed's plans have shifted only slightly in recent months even as disappointing data has piled up. While reflecting her personal view, it largely echoes an account published on Wednesday of the Fed's most recent policy meeting. The Fed has backed away from the possibility of raising rates as soon as June, but officials have made clear that they do not see a reason to wait much longer.
"Assuming that economic growth does rebound, and particularly now that there are signs of a pickup in underlying price inflation and wage growth, we don't think the Fed can wait any longer than September," Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Friday after Ms. Yellen's speech.
The Fed has held rates near zero since December 2008 as the centerpiece of its effort to strengthen the economy. Low rates encourage borrowing by businesses and consumers, and risk-taking by investors seeking higher returns.
Higher rates would be aimed at gradually withdrawing further stimulus, cooling off the economy to help keep future inflation from rising much above the Fed's target rate.
A minority of Fed officials argue that the economy is not yet strong enough to lift rates. They point to the sluggish pace of inflation, which since the recession has lagged below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as most healthy. Some investors also expect economic weakness will force the Fed to wait.
Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, argues that the Fed should be patient until inflation rebounds, which he regards as unlikely before next year. "I see no compelling reason for us to be in a hurry to tighten financial conditions before then," Mr. Evans said on Wednesday in Munich.
In her speech, Ms. Yellen explained why she and other officials were inclined to move sooner, so long as they see the expected improvement in the economic data.
She noted that the economy added more than three million jobs last year, and that other signs also suggested labor market conditions were improving, including an increase in workers who are quitting their jobs in pursuit of better opportunities.
She said lower gas prices had yielded savings of about $700 a household.
And she said some of the economy's problems appeared to be getting smaller.
Home prices are rising and mortgages have become a little easier to obtain. State and local governments have stopped cutting back on spending. And Ms. Yellen said that she expected economic growth in the rest of the world to strengthen.
"With the waning of the headwinds that I have discussed, the U.S. economy seems well positioned for continued growth," she said.
Ms. Yellen also said the economy might be stronger than suggested by recent economic data, including the government's estimate that gross domestic output increased just 0.2 percent in the first three months of the year.
"Some of this apparent weakness may just be statistical noise," she said.
The government has consistently reported weak first-quarter growth in recent years, leading some economists to question its methodology. The reported numbers are seasonally adjusted, meaning the government tries to strip away predictable seasonal variations, like holiday hiring around Christmas and declines in construction in the middle of winter, to reveal the underlying trend.
In a research note published on Monday, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said the government's seasonal adjustment was too large. The actual pace of growth in the first quarter was about 1.8 percent, they concluded.
That view, however, does not yet command a consensus. A group of Fed economists based in Washington published a research note earlier this month concluding that "our analysis here does not find convincing evidence" of a problem.
Even the optimists among Fed officials see evidence of nothing more than moderate growth. Ms. Yellen noted that wages continued to rise slowly, notwithstanding recently announced pay raises at large companies with many low-paid workers, including Walmart and Target.
She also noted that the recovery remained uneven. She laced her speech with references to the Rhode Island economy, which suffered outsize losses during the recession and has since recovered more slowly than the country as a whole.
While the overall American economy is returning to health, she said, "We are not there yet."

Full text:   The stock market capped a quiet week of trading on a down note.
Major indexes fell from the start on Friday as oil drillers and other energy-related companies followed oil prices lower. Stocks spent much of the rest of the day drifting between losses and gains as investors considered a mixed bag corporate earnings and a report showing a slight increase in inflation.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 4.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,126.06. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.72 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,232.02. The Nasdaq edged down 1.43 points to 5,089.36.
Trading was light ahead of the Memorial Day weekend in the U.S. Just 2.5 billion shares changed hands on the New York Exchange, three-quarters of the normal level.
Nine of the 10 industry sectors of the S.&P. 500 were lower, led by a 0.8 percent drop in telecommunications stocks.
Among stocks making big gains, Deere rose $3.89, or 4.3 percent, to $93.35 after the equipment maker beat analysts' estimates for its latest quarterly earnings. The company also raised its profit forecast for the year.
Campbell Soup rose 98 cents, or 2 percent, to $47.91 after reporting better-than-expected results, too.
In economic news, the Labor Department reported that inflation rose 0.1 percent in April, its third straight increase. The report also noted that core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.3 percent, the biggest one-month increase in more than two years.
The numbers suggest that an improving economy could be setting the stage for the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate. The central market has held the rate near zero for more than six years.
"We don't think inflation is really a problem, but the uptick is a cover for the Fed to do what it wants to do anyway: Get off zero rates," said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust.
Later in the day, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, said in a speech that she expected the Fed to begin raising rates later this year if the job market improves. But she cautioned that the economy is still facing challenges, including disappointing wage growth and too many people working part-time.
Despite the drop for the day, the S.&P. 500 still closed up for the week, its third weekly gain in a row. The index has closed at record highs recently, though the gains have been tiny as investors fret over unimpressive earnings and an uncertain global economy.
"It continues to be the rally that no one respects," said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. "Despite headwinds, it continues to plug along."
Among other stocks making moves Friday, Gap fell 55 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $38.01 on news late Thursday that first-quarter earnings plunged 8 percent as it tries to turn around its Banana Republic and Gap chains. The company also cited a surge in the value of the dollar, which makes sales abroad worth less when translated back to the U.S. currency.
Overseas, the Shanghai Composite Index jumped 2.8 percent to close at its highest level since 2008. Investors are betting that the economic stimulus that has powered the rally will continue after several poor indicators, including a disappointing manufacturing index on Thursday.
Markets in Europe were mixed. Germany's DAX slipped 0.4 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.3 percent.
Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1 to close at $59.72 a barrel in New York as traders worried about supplies of oil outstripping demand. U.S. oil finished the week between $59 and $60 for the fourth straight week. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oil used by many U.S. refineries, fell $1.17 to close at $65.37 a barrel in London.
The national average retail price of gasoline reached its high for the year of $2.74 a gallon just before the Memorial Day weekend, according to AAA, though it remains nearly $1 cheaper than last year at this time.
In other futures trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline fell 2.8 cents to close at $2.054 a gallon; heating oil fell 3.3 cents to close at $1.953 a gallon; and natural gas fell 6.2 cents to close at $2.887 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The rise in consumer prices sent U.S. bond prices lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.21 percent from 2.19 percent late Thursday.
Precious and industrial metals futures closed little changed. Gold edged down 10 cents to $1,204 an ounce, silver rose two cents to $17.13 an ounce, and copper fell four cents to $2.81 a pound.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices in the United States moderated in April on weak gasoline prices, but rising housing and medical care costs bolstered underlying inflation pressures.
The Labor Department said on Friday that its Consumer Price Index gained 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in March. In the 12 months through April, the index fell 0.2 percent, the largest decline since October 2009. In the 12 months through March, it dipped 0.1 percent.
The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.3 percent, the largest rise since January 2013. The advance in March was 0.2 percent.
In the 12 months through April, the core C.P.I. advanced 1.8 percent after a similar gain in March.
A fading dollar rally also was seen keeping core inflation on an upward trend. The dollar surged about 15 percent against the currencies of the main American trading partners between June last year and mid-March. It has handed back some of those gains and is now up only 10 percent.
"If sustained, that should help weakness in core goods prices continue to moderate," said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
The overall C.P.I. edged up 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in March. It was held back by a 1.7 percent drop in gasoline prices and no change in food prices.
In the 12 months through April, the C.P.I. fell 0.2 percent, the largest decline since October 2009, after dipping 0.1 percent in March.
Core inflation was lifted by a 0.3 percent increase in shelter costs, which followed a similar gain in March.
Shelter inflation could continue to increase in the months ahead as rising household formation lifts demand for housing. That, together with a tightening labor market, should put upward pressure on the core C.P.I.

Full text:   If you happen to trade bonds for a living, it is entirely understandable if you are feeling a little anxious these days.
Prices for United States Treasuries, German bunds and most other securities on the multitrillion dollar global bond market have been exceptionally volatile in the last couple of months. In this environment, someone who buys and sells them for a living could lose a fortune by taking an ill-timed bathroom break.
But what happens in bonds matters for the rest of us, too. Bond prices translate into the price to borrow money for practically every family and business on earth, which, in turn, determines savings and investment patterns. In the latest bout of volatility, long-term interest rates in the United States have climbed by almost 0.4 percentage points. Since the interest rate is in an inverse relationship to a bond's price, the value of bond investors' portfolios has taken a hit.
And that helps explain why there has been so much hand-wringing over the ups and downs of the market in the last few weeks, as my colleague Peter Eavis has reported.
Bankers are warning that tighter regulations may preclude them from playing their traditional role of stepping in to buffer the ups and downs of markets. Regulators worry that asset managers are engaging in herd behavior that will fuel an unnecessary roller coaster in markets. And there is plenty of worry out there that years of central bank interventionism have dulled the proper functioning of markets.
These arguments all have merit, and they aren't mutually exclusive. And when you look closely at what has been happening with bond prices, what it says about the economy is pretty much benign. What it says about how some of the markets at the core of the global financial system are working is far scarier.
So first, what does the shift mean for the economy?
Ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds were yielding 2.26 percent Wednesday, up from 1.87 percent in late March; those higher rates have also rippled through to higher mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs. Some international long-term interest rates, particularly in Germany, have climbed steeply. Some economists are even raising the possibility that a generation-long shift toward ever-lower global interest rates might have finally run its course.
Not so fast. Interest rates are still extraordinarily low by any historical standard and still below where they were in the fall of 2014. Viewed in a longer time horizon, it looks as if the bond boom of late 2014 and the start of 2015 went too far and is now partly reversing, not that some new trend of higher rates is taking hold.
The factors that fueled those low rates to begin with -- very low global inflation, vast pools of global savings looking for a place to be parked, central banks trying to use easy-money policies to restore growth -- have changed after all.
You don't have to believe there is an epochal shift going on, only modest changes in the last couple of months that can justify the move.
It looks as if higher rates are coming. The Federal Reserve appears relatively committed to its plans to raise short-term interest rates sometime this year. Oil prices have risen after falling to recent lows over the winter, so inflation should be a bit higher than it had seemed in February. And the dollar has weakened on currency markets, which also signals higher inflation.
Those all point to higher bond yields, and that's exactly what we've gotten, with no major mystery.
What is more of a mystery is why we've seen such abrupt turns in a market that historically has been slow-moving and not prone to overreactions.
Usually it's the stock market that is always rising and falling for reasons that are hard to explain (or justify). The bond market, dominated by sophisticated, grown-up institutions like pensions and sovereign wealth funds as opposed to individual investors, has traditionally seemed less prone to irrational jitters.
In other words, there are perfectly plausible, fundamental reasons the 10-year Treasury yield should be 2.26 percent right now. But reasons it should have risen by half a percentage point since the start of February, with many jaw-dropping days in between? They are hard to fathom when nothing terribly dramatic about the economy or policy outlook has changed since then.
And that's where we get to those explanations mentioned above involving the technical details of the bond market: things like banks being restricted from trading operations by new regulations, and asset managers crowding in and out of trades.
We're in a world where the supply of bonds is relatively fixed. It has always been true that governments don't quickly adjust their deficit spending plans based on a move in rates. But in a normal state of affairs when prices rise, private bondholders are more willing to sell, helping restrain the size of swings.
But now global central banks, having bought trillions of dollars' worth of bonds in executing their quantitative easing programs, are not inclined to exploit price moves opportunistically. Rather, they are moving glacially, based on economic fundamentals, and with lots of advance communication on their intentions.
Count other institutions that hold bonds as insurance against economic catastrophe -- not because they are hoping for meaningful return -- and the number of players in the market responding to prices in an economically rational way is small.
This is a long way of explaining the common term of art in markets: There is less liquidity than there once was.
One result is big swings based on small pieces of information, as the buffers that would normally sell into price increases and buy into price drops are nowhere to be found.
And there's not much reason to think that the forces driving this -- the expansive role of central banks in the market, the structures of banks and asset managers and so on -- are going to change anytime soon.
In other words, bond traders may just want to get used to postponing those perilous bathroom breaks.

Full text:   Home building across the nation accelerated in April, far exceeding expectations and suggesting that the economy was getting back on track after overall growth ground to a halt during the first quarter of the year.
Home construction last month rose 20.2 percent over March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.135 million, the highest number since 2007 and the biggest percentage jump in almost 24 years, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
The sunny report wiped out a particularly dismal showing in March and offered a measure of optimism for a housing market that has been slow to recover since the recession.
But most economists were cautious in their reading of the month's data, seeing it as a sign that the housing market was simply returning to a more normal state after the cold and snowy start to the year that kept many builders from breaking new ground.
"It's a hell of a rebound in housing, there's no denying it," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. But "you have to keep it in perspective," he added.
"It brings us back to about a million units, which is where it should be," he said.
Housing data is always volatile, subject to weather and labor supplies. But numbers from the past year echo the trends of the overall economy, which has maintained a slow upward trajectory, interrupted by relatively brief hiccups.
"And I emphasize the word slow," said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR Inc. "I don't think second-quarter G.D.P. numbers will be any great shakes."
Some analysts, however, were more upbeat about what the housing rebound may portend about the broader economic outlook.
"This report demolishes the idea that the economy -- outside the oil sector -- suffered some sort of real seizure in the first quarter," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients. "It didn't; it was just battered badly by a winter nearly as grim as last year."
Mr. Shepherdson predicted that new housing construction would continue to rise in coming months, though not as rapidly, and that investment in housing would contribute to economic activity during the second quarter, helping to bring the economy out of its winter stall.
The Commerce Department, in its first of three estimates, reported last month that the American economy grew at a mere 0.2 percent annual rate during the first three months of the year. But trade and other data released since then suggest the economy may actually have shrunk over the winter.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department last week reported that the producer price index for final demand, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, fell by 0.4 percent in April.
Economists predict the Labor Department's release on Friday of its April consumer price data will show prices rose barely, if at all. One reason for the slow pace is that food costs are little changed.
Given the current economic climate, April's positive housing numbers were not expected to change the Fed's thinking on when to raise interest rates. Most analysts now do not expect the Fed to act until September at the earliest.
"The Fed will look at this as a normalization rather than the beginning of a trend that suggests a housing bubble," said Blerina Uruci, United States economist at Barclays. "We've seen very strong changes in many regions but we have to think what was the basis we started from. It was very weak in February and now is returning to normal."
Tuesday's report showed single-family housing starts in April were at a rate of 733,000, which is 16.7 percent above the revised March figure. Starts for apartments and condominiums rose to 389,000.
Permits for new housing in April -- considered a predictor of construction in months to come -- were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,143,000, an increase of 10.1 percent over March.
Housing data was strong across many regions of the country but especially in the Northeast, which is where the winter storms were concentrated.
In the South, however, growth was not quite as strong as some economists had expected. "That is important to note because it indicates that the winter did not mask or limit a near-term acceleration in starts in the South," David Nice, an economist at Mesirow Financial, said in a note to clients.
The South, he said, makes up about half of single-family housing starts.
"In order to see any substantial acceleration in starts in the months to come," Mr. Nice said, "we'll need to see further strengthening in the South."

Abstract: "In reality, Nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters," the report concluded. Since Nafta, the United States has made trade agreements with 17 other countries, but the estimated impact of those deals, taken together, is even smaller -- a few snowflakes added to a snowball already rolling downhill.

Full text:   GALESBURG, Ill. -- Even in this city of abandoned factories, it is possible to see some of the benefits the United States reaps from increased foreign trade: At the rail yard, where boxcars of bargain-price Asian goods are routed to American consumers; at the nearby slaughterhouse, where pigs are packaged for the global market; and at Knox College, where almost 10 percent of the students now come from foreign countries.
It is also hard to miss the enduring costs. In 2004, Maytag shut down the refrigerator factory that for decades was Galesburg's largest employer and moved much of the work to Mexico. Barack Obama, then running to represent Illinois in the Senate, described the workers as victims of globalization in his famous speech that year at the Democratic National Convention.
A decade later, many of those workers are still struggling. The city's population is in decline, and the median household income fell 27 percent between 1999 and 2013, adjusting for inflation.
George Carney, who drove a forklift until the day the factory closed, and then found work as a bartender, is now receiving federal disability benefits. He says he is bitter that American policy makers smoothed Maytag's road to Mexico by passing the North American Free Trade Agreement in the early 1990s.
"I don't believe in laying someone off, in taking away someone's livelihood just so other people can make more money," Mr. Carney said as he nursed a beer in a windowless bar on the banks of the Mississippi River. "Why would I want to destroy that person? Why would I want to destroy lives?"
It is one of the basic principles of economics that trade is good and more trade is better. But as Mr. Obama presses Congress for the authority to negotiate a new generation of trade deals, the struggles of Galesburg illustrate why some economists have come to doubt the relevance of that orthodoxy. The costs of globalization have been greater and more enduring than they expected, and government efforts to mitigate the impact on American workers have often proved insufficient.
"I think what we've learned is that U.S. labor markets aren't as flexible and self-correcting as I think we had presumed," said Gordon Hanson, an economist at the University of California, San Diego. "The uneasiness I have about the way we've handled globalization is not so much globalization itself. It's that if you don't have the right safety net, you're going to impose an enormous amount of hardship."
There is also mounting evidence that the benefits of globalization have accrued disproportionately to upper-income households, while the costs have fallen heavily on the less affluent, contributing to the rise of economic inequality.
The Obama administration has presented the proposed agreements -- one with nations that border the Pacific Ocean, the other with Europe -- as, in part, a shield against globalization that would require other nations to move closer to American standards for environmental protection, worker rights and intellectual property.
But the administration and many outside economists say further trade, despite the negatives, is still clearly beneficial.
David Weinstein, a Columbia University economist, said the image of downtrodden Galesburg should be set alongside the prosperity of Silicon Valley, because the decline of manufacturing in the United States helped free resources to feed the high-tech boom.
"There was a sense that by losing the ability to produce computer chips, we were going to see the American electronics industry collapse, and it turns out that those cheap imported electronic components were just the thing that all of these companies needed," he said. "What these critiques miss systematically is that the losers know who they are, but the winners don't know who they are yet."
Drop in the Bucket
Trade deals are at the center of the political debate about globalization, but for all the sound and fury they generate, recent deals have played only a small role in the expansion of global trade. In 2013, on the 20th anniversary of Nafta, the Congressional Research Service reviewed the research and concluded it was not that big a deal.
"In reality, Nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters," the report concluded.
Since Nafta, the United States has made trade agreements with 17 other countries, but the estimated impact of those deals, taken together, is even smaller -- a few snowflakes added to a snowball already rolling downhill.
The seismic shift came after World War II, when the United States and other developed nations began to minimize tariffs and other barriers. Global trade grew as industrialization spread, particularly in China, and thanks to innovations including the standardized shipping container and the Internet.
Just as individuals benefit by working in one field and using their earnings to pay for other goods and services, economists contend that nations, too, prosper by specializing: exporting what they have and importing what they want.
A 2005 study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington that is a strong proponent of trade deals, estimated that embracing trade had added about 7.3 percent to America's economic output -- or about $10,000 in annual income for every household in the United States.
But the benefits are not distributed evenly. Trade increases overall prosperity by eliminating less productive jobs. In theory, the workers find new jobs. In practice, studies by Mr. Hanson and other economists show that in cities like Galesburg, global competition is increasing unemployment and reducing wages.
Josh Bivens, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, estimates that increased globalization, aided by a strong dollar that led to a persistent trade deficit, reduced the annual earnings of the roughly 70 percent of American workers without college degrees by about $1,800.
Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University economist and Nobel laureate, said the magnitude of these losses was large enough that increased trade may now be harming the American economy.
"The argument was always that the winners could compensate the losers," Mr. Stiglitz said. "But the winners never do. And that becomes particularly relevant when we have a society with as much inequality as we have today."
Few Job Options
Richard Lindstrom, whose family has owned an appliance store on Galesburg's Main Street for the last 89 years, said sales fell when Maytag left. But that was about the same time he started selling many imported high-definition televisions.
"We rode that crest, and it really offset the drop in appliance sales," he said.
Some Maytag workers were able to find better jobs. Mark Semande is now a foreman on the BNSF railroad, which has prospered greatly from increased trade. He made $14.50 an hour at the factory. Now he makes $28.93. With overtime, he estimates that his pay has tripled.
But many of the 1,600 Maytag workers were not as fortunate, according to Chad Broughton, a lecturer in public policy at the University of Chicago who chronicled Galesburg's struggles in his book, "Boom, Bust, Exodus."
Tracy Warner, who worked at the factory for 15 years, has not come close to matching her former salary of about $37,000 a year. She works as a teacher's assistant by day and a janitor by night and makes about $21,000.
Mr. Semande -- whose father also worked at the factory -- said he expected that his two daughters, ages 13 and 15, would move away when they grow up. "Maybe they could find jobs and live in the community," he said, "but not if they want to do as well as us."
Trade also tends to reduce prices, and there is evidence that lower-income households may benefit disproportionately, because they spend a larger share of income than wealthier households on the goods with the largest price declines. This Walmart effect may partly offset the distribution of income gains.
A study published last year estimated that international trade had lifted the purchasing power of lower-income American households, at the 10th percentile of the income distribution, about 62 percent. For wealthy households, at the 90th percentile of the income distribution, the power increase was 3 percent.
The variety of imports has also roughly tripled since the 1970s, according to a 2006 study that Mr. Weinstein, the Columbia economist, helped write. "We benefit from the fact that it's no longer just a choice between Maxwell House and Folger's," he said.
Walmart opened a supercenter in Galesburg in 2007, but Mr. Broughton said the arrival of the store could hardly offset the loss of the factory.
"The decline in the quality of life for working-class families has not been nearly matched by the low, low prices," he said. "Maybe those diffuse benefits have benefited America more generally. But it's not the case in Galesburg."
Lying Idle
President Obama returned to Galesburg in 2013 to deliver an economic policy speech at Knox College. "Let's tell the world that America is open for business," he said. "I know there's an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard -- let's put some folks to work."
But most of the old factory has been demolished. The last trace of its former life is a "Maytag Drive" street sign. The last refrigerators to roll off the line sit in a makeshift museum at the back of a downtown antiques mall.
Michael Patrick, who started working at the factory in 1959 and became a senior union official representing workers throughout the region, said job losses were nothing new. Companies went out of business, mechanized, moved to new cities. He recalled that in the 1970s, the workers who made the shells of refrigerators were replaced by a new machine the size of a football field.
The difference in recent decades, he said, is the absence of new companies.
But Mr. Patrick is not sentimental about what he views as the end of manufacturing in Galesburg. He said he focused on getting as much funding as possible to help his members train for new careers. He went to work after high school, he said, partly because there was no junior college in Galesburg. Now there is.
"Manufacturing was for people like me," Mr. Patrick, who is now 73, said.
When Ms. Warner, 49, learned that the plant would close, she finished an associate's degree at the local community college, then won a share of that training money to pursue a degree in communications at Western Illinois University.
But two years of tuition was not enough to reconstruct her life.
She is proud of the degree, but it has not helped her find a job. She lacks professional experience, and jobs in Galesburg are scarce. She has a teenage son and she does not want to move.
"I just needed a little more help," she said. "I didn't ask for my job to be taken out of the country."

Abstract: Netflix was among the big gainers in the S.&P. 500, climbing 4.5 percent after a published report said that the video streaming service is in talks to begin doing business in China. The Federal Reserve said factory activity in New York increased slightly in May, suggesting that manufacturers are beginning to adapt to the challenges caused by a stronger dollar, lower oil prices and restrained consumer spending.

Full text:   Stock indexes spent Friday drifting between tiny gains and losses, but the small moves were enough to nudge the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its second closing high in two days.
Shares of utilities were among the biggest gainers as investors weighed a mix of American economic data and corporate earnings news. The price of oil fell slightly, ending a second consecutive week nearly flat just under $60 a barrel.
In contrast to Thursday's big rally, it was a mostly listless day on Wall Street.
"Often, in fact, there's a bit of selling pressure in these situations as many people want to book some profits after these days," said JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist.
The Dow rose 20.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,272.56. That's within 16 points of its record set on March 2. The S.&P. 500 index gained 1.63 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,122.73. The Nasdaq slipped 2.5 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,048.29. The three indexes remain up for the month and year.
Netflix was among the big gainers in the S.&P. 500, climbing 4.5 percent after a published report said that the video streaming service is in talks to begin doing business in China. The stock rose $26.40 to $613.25.
Companies reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings or outlooks were among the big gainers on Friday. Darling Ingredients climbed $1.55, or 11 percent, to $15.64.
Others failed to live up to expectations, however. Dillard's reported weak first-quarter financial results, which pulled the department store's shares down 7.04 percent. The stock fell $8.74 to $115.46.
Keurig Green Mountain sank 8.55 percent as investors worried that the company's new cold-drink machine is priced too high. The stock fell $8.81 to $94.26.
Separate reports on Friday offered a mixed assessment of manufacturing in the United States.
The Federal Reserve said factory activity in New York increased slightly in May, suggesting that manufacturers are beginning to adapt to the challenges caused by a stronger dollar, lower oil prices and restrained consumer spending.
United States industrial output fell for the fifth straight month in April. The trend suggests that weakness in manufacturing and mining are weighing heavily on the economy.
Other reports this week have also shown diverging trends for the American economy. The Commerce Department's retail sales report for April fell short of Wall Street's forecasts. But the latest figures on applications for unemployment aid and inflation were more encouraging.
"This week, on balance, the economic reports have been a little soggy," said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. "We're muddling through, and the market is just fine with that."
Investors are gauging how well the economy is doing as they try to anticipate when the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates for the first time in more than six years. Many economists don't expect the central bank to increase rates before September.
Seven of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 index rose, led by utilities, though that sector remains down 6.7 percent this year. Financials fared the worst. The sector is down 0.3 percent for the year.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.15 percent from 2.24 percent late Thursday.
In energy trading, benchmark United States crude fell 19 cents to close at $59.69 a barrel in New York. Oil ended last week at $59.39 and the week before at $59.15. Brent crude for July delivery, a benchmark for international oil used by many refineries, fell 11 cents to close at $66.81 in London. The June Brent contract expired Thursday at $66.59.
In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline fell 0.1 cent to close at $2.057 a gallon. Heating oil fell 0.1 cent to close at $2.005 a gallon. Natural gas rose 0.8 cents to close at $3.016 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Precious and industrial metals futures edged mostly higher. Gold increased 10 cents, to $1,225.50 an ounce; silver also rose 10 cents, to $17.56 an ounce; and copper was unchanged at $2.92 a pound.

Abstract: Ctrip.com International, a Chinese travel services company, surged 8.8 percent after it reported better-than-expected first-quarter financial results and a strong outlook. First-quarter earnings at the company, which makes clothing, trumped Wall Street forecasts and the company also raised its earnings forecast for the year.

Full text:   Stocks rebounded Thursday, snapping a three-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Encouraging data on the United States job market and inflation helped lift the market, pushing the S.&P. 500 to a record high. The Dow came within 36 points of its own record. The indexes are up for the month and year.
Technology and consumer staples stocks were among the biggest gainers. The price of oil in the United States fell on continuing concerns about high global supplies.
The Dow rose 191.75 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,252.24. The S.&P. 500 index gained 22.62 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,121.10. That is three points higher than its previous closing high of 2,117.69 on April 24.
The Nasdaq added 69.10 points, or 1.4 percent, to 5,050.80.
The 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 closed higher, with technology stocks leading the pack. The sector is up 4.8 percent this year.
"We've been at roughly this level of the S.&P. for almost three months," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas. "We're up 1 percent today and that's a decent move."
After a mostly downbeat week in the markets, trading got off to a strong start early Thursday as investors weighed two Labor Department reports.
The government said fewer people applied for unemployment aid last week, pushing the four-week average down to its lowest level since April 2000. Unemployment benefit applications are a proxy for layoffs, so the low level is evidence of greater job security among workers.
It is also a sign that employers are confident enough in the economy to hold on to their employees, despite signs of sluggish growth.
A separate index that tracks the prices of goods and services before they reach consumers declined 0.4 percent last month. That could signal that the Federal Reserve will hold off on raising its key interest rate until this fall, said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank.
"Inflation is not a big issue," he said. "The market consensus has to be that it will be September or later that the Fed will move."
Investors are trying to gauge when the Fed will move to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in more than six years. The central bank has said it wants to see annual inflation heading toward 2 percent, a sign of a healthier economy.
A range of retail shares, including Kohl's, J. C. Penney and Target, fell as most other sectors were posting gains. The day before, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales were unchanged in April after rising 1.1 percent in March.
While investors may be unnerved by the broad sell-off, a closer look at retailers shows they may merely be grappling with issues they have dealt with for quite some time.
Brian Sozzi, chief executive and chief equities strategist at Belus Capital Advisors, said that the recent financial results suggest consumers will need attractive deals in the spring and summer to push them to make purchases. Mr. Sozzi also said retailers' profits had been weighed down by the decision of many companies to reinvest in their businesses.
Burt Flickinger III, a managing director at Strategic Resource Group, said he did not view the sell-off in retail stocks Thursday as a reason to be concerned, calling it an overreaction. He said he thought shoppers' spending had been affected by several factors, like tax refund delays because of short staffing at the Internal Revenue Service.
He said that the savings people were receiving from lower gasoline prices wound up going toward repairs and bills, but once those matters were resolved, consumers would be able to use their gas savings for retail spending.
Kohl's shares dropped more than 13 percent, Target shares were down 3.2 percent, and J. C. Penney shares lost 7.7 percent.
Beyond economic data, traders had their eye on the latest batch of corporate earnings and deal news.
Ctrip.com International, a Chinese travel services company, surged 8.8 percent after it reported better-than-expected first-quarter financial results and a strong outlook. The stock gained $5.78 to $71.14.
Traders also bid up the shares of Perry Ellis International. First-quarter earnings at the company, which makes clothing, trumped Wall Street forecasts and the company also raised its earnings forecast for the year. Perry Ellis shares climbed $2.06, or 8.6 percent, to $26.09.
In energy trading, benchmark United States crude oil fell 62 cents to settle at $59.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oil used by many refineries in the United States, fell 22 cents to settle at $66.59 in London.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.24 percent from 2.29 percent late Wednesday.
Wholesale gasoline rose 1.7 cents to close at $2.058 a gallon, while heating oil rose 0.1 cent to close at $2.006 a gallon. Natural gas rose 7.3 cents to close at $3.008 a 1,000 cubic feet.
Precious and industrial metals futures closed mixed. Gold was up $7 to $1,225.20 an ounce, silver rose 24 cents to $17.47 an ounce and copper edged down less than a penny to $2.92 a pound.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. MOSCOW -- The Russian economy is sliding into a recession. Consumers are retreating. Corporate profits are suffering.
But the ruble is having a strangely successful year. Since January, the ruble has been the best performer of any currency, up 21 percent.
The ruble has risen so robustly that the central bank on Thursday reversed a long-running policy of propping it up. Under a new plan, the central bank will buy foreign currencies to replenish its reserves, a move that will effectively weaken the ruble.
It represents a stark turnabout.
Last year, the central bank spent billions defending the currency, which sank to a post-Soviet low as Russia was hit with the dual blow of sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and the weakness in oil prices. The ruble was the second-worst-performing currency in 2014, just behind the Ukrainian hryvnia.
The underlying economic prospects for the country have not changed. Russia is headed into a deep recession, and Western trade and financial sanctions are still biting into consumer confidence. But the markets, at least, are finding a glimmer of hope.
"Certainly sentiment has improved for Russia," said Boris Erenburg, a portfolio manager with the Spinnaker Capital Group in London. "A lot of things have been working so far this year."
Oil prices have bounced off their lows. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on energy exports, and the fate of the ruble has historically followed the price of a barrel.
Tensions, too, are easing over the Ukraine crisis, even if sanctions have not. The threat that the crisis will blow up into a major war in Europe seems to be diminishing.
Even a diplomatic thaw now looks possible. Secretary of State John Kerry met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this week.
It also helps that the United States dollar is weakening on worries that the American economy is losing momentum. As the dollar's rally has faded, currencies around the world have surged. The euro, which early this year was flirting with parity to the dollar, reached a three-month high on Thursday.
"It's a broader dollar move that we're seeing in the light of the disappointing data out of the U.S.," said Phyllis Papadavid, a senior foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas in London. "This isn't a euro move."
Given the confluence of events, investors have been broadly more optimistic about the opportunities in Russia.
The benchmark Russia index, the Micex, is up more than 20 percent this year, although it has given up some of its gains in recent weeks. Yields on Russian bonds have been falling over the last few months, reflecting increased demand from investors.
On Thursday, the ruble hit 50 against the dollar. At its lowest point last year, it traded briefly around 80.
"Everyone is saying it has been developing surprisingly better than expected," Vladimir Miklashevsky, an economist at Danske Bank, said of the ruble's rise. "You have a better equation for your profits."
So far this year, Danske Bank's two Russian stock funds are the best in the bank's portfolio, taking into account the appreciation of the ruble. The bank's broad stock fund is up 47 percent year to date, and the small capitalization fund is up 45 percent.
Russia's central bank's new plan, though, may put a crimp in the currency. The central bank said it intended to buy $100 million to $200 million a day on Russia's currency market.
In doing so, Russia will restock its foreign currency reserves. Since the start of the Ukraine crisis in January 2014, those reserves have dropped by $143 billion, as the central bank tried to prop up the ruble.
While not the central bank's stated goal, the move will also limit the ruble's rise. It has good reason to do so.
An overly strong currency hurts exports and could tip the budget into a deficit. Revenue from its biggest export, oil, is taxed in rubles, while the commodity is priced in dollars.
Weakening the currency, said Mr. Miklashevsky, ensures that the government will have sufficient revenue to avoid cuts to pensions and the military this year. If the ruble were allowed to appreciate, both outlays might have been reduced in ruble terms.
Yaroslav Lissovolik, chief economist for Russia at Deutsche Bank, said the weak ruble policy was also intended to prop up domestic industry and agriculture in these geopolitically uncertain times, albeit at the cost of leaving inflation high.
"There's still the hope a weaker ruble will still deliver import substitution" -- a switch to buying domestic products from some imports -- he said. "The weaker ruble creates these conditions for an easy life for local enterprises, so they don't have to engage in active restructuring and actively try to increase productivity and efficiency."
The ruble's value -- and helping to stabilize those industries -- is especially critical at this economic juncture.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development predicts that Russia's economy will contract 4.5 percent this year. The World Bank predicts a 3.5 percent drop.
In short, Russia is facing a recession. Although the Russian government predicts that the economy will return to growth in 2016, both groups expect the downturn to continue next year.
"We're not at the bottom of the crisis," Mr. Miklashevsky said of the central bank's shift on Thursday. High inflation and interest rates, only now made worse by the bank's intervention, are still "murder for the real economy."
Correction: May 22, 2015, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about Russia's changing policy on support of the ruble referred incorrectly to the chief economist for Russia at Deutsche Bank, who commented on the policy. The economist, Yaroslav Lissovolik, is a man.
