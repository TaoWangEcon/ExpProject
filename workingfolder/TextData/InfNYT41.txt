Abstract: Nearly every other big developing country, be it Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia or Iran, had a bigger increase over that span, despite much slower economic growth. Since 2000, most of Western Europe, Australia and Israel, all of which started with higher life expectancy, have also outpaced China.

Full text: A quick quiz: Which of the following countries has had the smallest increase in life expectancy since 1990 -- Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, South Korea or Sudan?
The answer is not war-torn Sudan or tumultuous Pakistan. It isn't South Korea, which started from a higher level than any of the others. And it isn't abjectly poor Bangladesh.
It's China, the great economic success story of the last two decades and the country that inspires fear and envy around the world. Yet when measured on one of most important yardsticks of all, China does not look so impressive.
From 1990 to 2008, life expectancy in China rose 5.1 years, to 73.1, according to a World Bank compilation of United Nations data. Nearly every other big developing country, be it Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia or Iran, had a bigger increase over that span, despite much slower economic growth. Since 2000, most of Western Europe, Australia and Israel, all of which started with higher life expectancy, have also outpaced China.
The moral? Economic growth makes almost any societal problem easier to solve, but growth doesn't guarantee better lives -- or better health -- for everyone. That's been true for centuries. The rate of growth and the kind of growth both matter.
If you scan the globe today, you may end up wondering whether any country has landed on the right mix. Europe offers a good life to many people, with generous vacations, parental leaves and health benefits, but its economies have been growing slowly, which is one reason its debts are so onerous.
The United States grew more quickly than Europe in recent decades, but many of the gains flowed to a small slice of the population. Median household income, adjusted for inflation, actually fell from 2000 to 2007 -- and has fallen more since the financial crisis began in 2007.
China can sometimes look like the economy of the future, having grown stunningly fast for almost 30 years now, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But it, too, has real problems. Above all, its growth has been uneven. The coast has benefited much more than the interior. Almost everywhere, some aspects of life have improved much more than others.
Whether China can switch to a more balanced form of growth, as its leaders have vowed, will obviously have a big effect on the rest of the global economy. Yet it's worth remembering that the biggest impact will be on the one-sixth of the world's population who live in China. And arguably the best example is the fact that the country has grown vastly wealthier but only modestly healthier.
There is an intriguing parallel here to the Industrial Revolution. The eminent economist Richard Easterlin has noted that longevity and health did not improve much when economic growth took off in the early 19th century.
With rising incomes, people could afford better food, clothing and shelter. But they were also exposed to more disease because so many of them were moving to cities. The combined effect appears to have been "stagnation or, at best, mild improvement in life expectancy," Mr. Easterlin has written.
The Mortality Revolution, as he calls it, did not occur for almost another a century. It depended on relatively cheap investments in public health, like sanitation, and on the spread of scientific methods.
Similarly, in today's China, many more people have acquired indoor plumbing, heating, air-conditioning or other basics. Other aspects of the boom, however, have pushed in the opposite direction.
As in the Industrial Revolution, many people have left the countryside and poured into crowded cities. Accidents have become common, like the Shanghai fire last week or a series of workplace tragedies in recent months. Obesity is rising. Pollution is terrible.
I recently spent some time in China, and despite everything I'd heard in advance about the pollution, I was still taken aback. The tops of skyscrapers in Beijing can be hard to see from the street. Breathing the smog can feel like having a permanent low-grade sinus infection. For the Chinese, cancer has displaced strokes as the leading cause of death, partly because of pollution, notes Yang Lu of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.
Finally, there is the medical system itself. The dismantling of state-run industrial companies over the last two decades has ended the cradle-to-grave benefits system known as the iron rice bowl. In its place was a market-based medical system many Chinese could not afford. Even in emergencies, people sometimes had to bring cash to the hospital to get treatment.
Early last year, the Chinese government began expanding health insurance coverage, with the goal of making it universal by 2020. The initial signs look pretty good. The World Bank does not have data past 2008, but numbers published by the C.I.A. suggest that life expectancy has risen in the last two years. In my travels, I visited a simple, clean clinic in rural northern China that seemed to be providing the kind of basic care that could make a huge difference.
Of course, whatever the problems with China's boom, it still has significantly improved the lives of its citizens. Many fewer of them live in grinding poverty, and the population is living longer, even if the gains have not been as large as in many other countries.
Over any extended period, economic growth is probably necessary for higher living standards. It's just not enough. As Tsung-Mei Cheng, a health policy expert at Princeton, argues, "Economists and the media tend to pay too much attention to the growth of G.D.P. over all, and not enough to its distribution."
There is, after all, another large country with unimpressive recent gains in life expectancy, even smaller than China's. That's right: the United States. Since 1990, we have been passed by Chile, Denmark, Slovenia and South Korea, among others. China is still five years behind us, but it's gaining.

Abstract: Corporate profits have been doing extremely well for a while. Since their cyclical low in the fourth quarter of 2008, profits have grown for seven consecutive quarters, at some of the fastest rates in history.

Full text: The nation's workers may be struggling, but American companies just had their best quarter ever.
American businesses earned profits at an annual rate of $1.659 trillion in the third quarter, according to a Commerce Department report released Tuesday. That is the highest figure recorded since the government began keeping track over 60 years ago, at least in nominal or noninflation-adjusted terms.
The government does not adjust the numbers for inflation, in part because these corporate profits can be affected by pricing changes from all over the world and because the government does not have a price index for individual companies. The next-highest annual corporate profits level on record was in the third quarter of 2006, when they were $1.655 trillion.
Corporate profits have been doing extremely well for a while. Since their cyclical low in the fourth quarter of 2008, profits have grown for seven consecutive quarters, at some of the fastest rates in history. As a share of gross domestic product, corporate profits also have been increasing, and they now represent 11.2 percent of total output. That is the highest share since the fourth quarter of 2006, when they accounted for 11.7 percent of output.
This breakneck pace can be partly attributed to strong productivity growth -- which means companies have been able to make more with less -- as well as the fact that some of the profits of American companies come from abroad. Economic conditions in the United States may still be sluggish, but many emerging markets like India and China are expanding rapidly.
Tuesday's Commerce Department report also showed that the nation's output grew at a slightly faster pace than originally estimated last quarter. Its growth rate, of 2.5 percent a year in inflation-adjusted terms, is higher than the initial estimate of 2 percent. The economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Still, most economists say the current growth rate is far too slow to recover the considerable ground lost during the recession.
"The economy is not growing fast enough to reduce significantly the unemployment rate or to prevent a slide into deflation," Paul Dales, a United States economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. "This is unlikely to change in 2011 or 2012."
The increase in output in the third quarter was driven primarily by stronger consumer spending. Wages and salaries also rose in the third quarter, which might help bolster holiday spending in the final months of 2010.
Private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports and federal government also contributed to higher output. These sources of growth were partly offset by a rise in imports.

Abstract: The attacks, coupled with criticism from foreign officials, have introduced enough uncertainty into global financial markets to potentially undercut the Fed's plan to drive down interest rates, which rise or fall as investors anticipate Fed action. Since the Nov. 3 announcement, Treasury yields have risen as the bond markets seemed to be doing what they normally never dare do: fight the Fed.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Faced with unusually sharp ideological attacks after its latest bid to stimulate the economy, the Federal Reserve now faces a challenge far removed from the conduct of monetary policy: how to defend itself in a hyperpartisan environment without becoming overtly political.
Caught off guard by accusations from Congressional Republicans, Sarah Palin, Tea Party activists and conservative economists, the central bank and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, are pushing back, making their case on substantive grounds but also haltingly adopting the tactics of Washington battle, like strategically placed interviews, behind-the-scenes assuaging of opponents and reaching out to potential allies on Capitol Hill.
The stakes are high. Last week, one House conservative announced legislation to strip the Fed of its mandate to promote jobs and have it focus solely on containing inflation.
The attacks, coupled with criticism from foreign officials, have introduced enough uncertainty into global financial markets to potentially undercut the Fed's plan to drive down interest rates, which rise or fall as investors anticipate Fed action.
Since the Nov. 3 announcement, Treasury yields have risen as the bond markets seemed to be doing what they normally never dare do: fight the Fed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, at 2.67 percent on Nov. 3, fell to 2.53 percent on Nov. 5. But then came a reversal that caught traders by surprise. The yield was up to 2.92 percent by Nov. 15, before falling slightly, to 2.80 percent on Monday.
Behind the scenes, Mr. Bernanke has signaled that he is steadfast on the Fed's plan to buy $600 billion of government securities through June in an unorthodox effort to push down long-term interest rates and spur the anemic recovery. In doing so he is trying to make clear to the markets that the Fed will not reverse course unless there is a compelling reason to do so, like a big increase in inflation expectations or a sharp rise in commodity prices.
Whether the uptick in yields represents genuine market anxiety about the Fed's inflation-fighting commitments, or the fact that the Fed's policy has already been effective at accelerating the recovery, the attacks are a distraction and could hurt the Fed's ability to set policy. "That is certainly the effect of Congressional criticism," Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, said.
Mr. Bernanke, who unlike Mr. Greenspan shuns the Washington social circuit, lacks close ties to conservative Republicans, even though he was first appointed by President George W. Bush and served briefly as his top economic adviser.
But lately he has stepped up his outreach, meeting with members of the Senate Banking Committee and explaining the Nov. 3 decision in an opinion-page article and a speech.
But the efforts have only had partial success. After meeting with Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee, said, "The bottom line is that the Fed is attempting to spur job growth because the Obama administration has done so much to inhibit it."
Fed officials concede that they left an opening for their detractors by timing their latest move -- the decision to resume the asset-purchase strategy known as quantitative easing -- for the day after the midterm elections. Operating outside the political calendar, the Fed's policy-making committee had long planned to convene Nov. 2 for two days.
The Fed had signaled its intentions to the markets. Starting in August, when it hinted that the recovery was so weak as to require additional support, stock prices rose and long-term interest rates fell in anticipation of the Fed's announcement.
But Mr. Bernanke and other top officials, unaccustomed to partisan considerations, did not anticipate the political fallout.
"The fact that immediately after an election which was a historic rejection of American liberalism and the borrowing and the spending and the bailout agenda of the recent past, for the central bank, for the Federal Reserve, to unilaterally announce $600 billion in printed money going into the economy, I think is at odds with the goals of the American people," said Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, who is the chairman of the House Republican Conference and has ties to the Tea Party.
Mr. Pence introduced legislation that would strip the Fed of one of its two legally mandated goals -- promoting maximum employment -- and have it focus on fighting inflation and preserving the value of the dollar.
Mr. Bernanke has relied on two aides, Michelle A. Smith, his chief of staff and spokeswoman, and Linda L. Robertson, a former lobbyist for Enron and Johns Hopkins, to manage his political messaging. Both worked at the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration and have had experience handling crises, though they probably could not have foreseen the intensity of the storm the Fed kicked up.
President Obama, who nominated Mr. Bernanke to a second term, has defended the Fed's actions in the face of international criticism.
The Fed has taken criticism over the recession and Wall Street bailouts, but in the financial overhaul this year, it helped defeat proposals to strip away its power to regulate and supervise banks.
Mr. Bernanke, who had thought the worst was behind him, was unsettled by the suddenness of the recent attacks. He has said that the Fed was in a no-win situation; if it had not acted, it would have been criticized for ignoring the painfully slow pace of the recovery.
The situation forms an odd corollary to the early 1980s, when Mr. Greenspan's predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, sharply raised interest rates, setting off back-to-back recessions in a painful but effective war on inflation.
Liberals attacked Mr. Volcker, a Democrat, as an inflation-fighting zealot who disregarded the plight of the unemployed. Now conservatives are portraying Mr. Bernanke, a Republican, as trying too hard to stimulate growth and underestimating the risk of inflation.
Several veterans of the Bush administration signed an open letter to Mr. Bernanke last week, saying the program should be "reconsidered and discontinued."
They included John B. Taylor, a former Treasury under secretary, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional budget director. The letter was the work of a new group, e21: Economic Policies for the 21st Century, led by Christopher Papagianis, a former Bush aide. Its chief supporters include David R. Malpass, who was a Treasury official in the Reagan administration, and Paul E. Singer, a hedge fund manager and prolific Republican donor.
Mr. Bernanke faces at least two years of scrutiny by a Republican-controlled House; the chairman of a subcommittee that oversees the Fed is likely to be Representative Ron Paul of Texas, a libertarian who wants to abolish the central bank.
"The Federal Reserve's decisions are appropriately debated in the public forum and the Fed should explain and be held accountable for them," said Donald L. Kohn, who retired this year as the Fed's vice chairman. "But I have the sense that this is being turned into a partisan issue and that is worrisome to me."
Mr. Kohn added, "The verbiage has gotten intense and extreme -- out of line, in my view, with the decision itself."
Mr. Greenspan, who recently suggested that the Fed was weakening the dollar, expressed sympathy for his successor. "The Fed in recent years has been facing far greater policy challenges than I, or my colleagues, had to confront during the whole of my tenure," he said.

Investors Get Wise On Offerings

Full text: Conventional wisdom holds that investors have poor memories: they can be duped every few years with variations on the same financial trick. Refreshingly, the market for initial public offerings may be prove to be an exception. In what's shaping up as the year of the see-through public offering, or C3PO for short, a record number of companies look set to abort their market debuts as investors wise up.
That's mainly because of the nature of the offerings they are being asked to evaluate. Many of the biggest deals will be familiar to investors, having been taken private in leveraged buyouts not so long ago. But unlike, say, General Motors, they aren't necessarily renewed businesses. Many, like Harrah's, are over-indebted and offer little growth. Investors are seeing through the marketing pitch.
So far this year, 121 companies aiming to raise $46 billion have pulled plans to go public, according to Thomson Reuters data. The last time so many I.P.O.'s were withdrawn was in the financial crisis of 2008, though the volume then was just two-thirds of what has already been abandoned.
This newfound discernment doesn't mean investors should reject all private equity-backed deals. Some big companies that have boomeranged back to the public may be suitable investments. Take the hospital chain HCA, for example. In the last three years, it has increased revenue by 11 percent, improved earnings by 20 percent and reduced debt by around 6 percent. Assuming this pace continues, HCA should create equity value over time.
That's not obviously the case with a company like Harrah's, whose owners last week shelved I.P.O. plans. TPG, which took the casino group private with Apollo, claims to have radically improved Harrah's operations. In a presentation to investors, TPG says millions of dollars of expenses have been stripped out by, among other things, reducing the number of steps a maid requires to tidy up a room.
But the company's revenue shrank in the first nine months, and Harrah's lost money. Harrah's was too expensive for a company whose fortunes are so tied to the troubled American consumer.
At times, investors may be gullible and their memories can be limited. But they are sufficiently aware to see through stories that don't add up.
Chinese Investment
China is in an inflationary bind. Policy makers need to bring interest rates up, yet are worried about creating debt defaults and attracting speculative money. Two bank reserve requirement increases in two weeks and new measures to stabilize consumer prices will have only marginal effects. A better way would be to let money flow offshore.
China's inflation is caused by excessive liquidity. The broad money supply, or M2, has roughly doubled since 2008, to $10 trillion. Foreign inflows have played a role. The central bank injected the equivalent of $1 trillion into the system just to buy foreign currencies from its citizens. The question is how to let more of that money out.
One way would be to let Chinese investors buy more assets overseas. Citizens have already been allowed to invest $67 billion in foreign equities, 2.5 times more than foreigners can buy in China. Yet Chinese investors aren't terribly eager. Half of the available foreign-linked investment products trade below their net asset value.
Encouraging businesses to invest more abroad would help, too. The United States, for example, might welcome some healthy imported inflation. Outward investment rose 18 times, to $56 billion, from 2003 to 2009, official figures show. But money tends to go where returns are higher. China accepted 70 percent more foreign direct investment than it gave in 2009.
If the private sector won't take the lead, the state might. China's authorities already buy billions of dollars of foreign government bonds every year. They could reduce domestic liquidity by issuing debt, then use the money to invest abroad.
But government investors aren't always welcome abroad. Exporting the Chinese currency, the renminbi, for others to buy Chinese goods hasn't worked either. Beijing has offered to lend billions of renminbi to other governments, but most of its currency swaps remain undrawn.
All of these problems share one root: China's undervalued currency. Domestic investors expect that the renminbi will appreciate, which gives them a strong reason to keep money at home. The market is pricing in a 3 percent increase in the year against the dollar, renminbi forward contracts show. If China wants to fight inflation by letting air out of the balloon, letting the currency rise would be a good start. ROB COX and WEI GU

Full text: James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative
I was sitting in a West Side high school, listening to the mayoral candidate Gery Chico and thinking about Warren Beatty.
Mr. Chico, a former top aide to Mayor Richard M. Daley, on Tuesday unveiled an impressive education plan, including a focus on early childhood education -- birth to age 5 -- and a dramatic lengthening of a shamefully short school day and year, by two hours a day and 24 days a year.
It reflected a strong knowledge of the system -- he was president of the Chicago Board of Education during the mayor's historic mid-1990s takeover. My qualms involve how we'd pay for his high-minded initiatives and how the teachers union would ever agree to work much harder.
Mr. Chico points to potential efficiencies and to achieving revolutionary change via collective bargaining. But while finding his plan commendable, I wondered if he, like candidates at all levels, feels restrained as to how honest he can be on certain combustible issues.
In the 1998 movie "Bullworth," Mr. Beatty plays a down-on-his-luck United States senator liberated by a contract he has put out on his own life. Believing he has only three days to live, he dispenses with platitudes and political correctness.
He tells a black church audience that his appearance, as a white, is only about getting a nice photo taken. This crowd, he proclaims, won't be taken seriously until it forks over the big bucks needed to buy access and clout, like whites.
Similarly, he tells a heavily-Jewish movie industry group in Beverly Hills that it produces junk to get outrageously rich. He even snipes at politicians who pander to the group by disparaging the Rev. Louis Farrakhan.
Ah, imagine something similar in our mayoral election! It's why I asked experts in various areas, including municipal finance, transportation, education and the arts, for help in conjuring Bullworth-like honesty. What might the candidates say if unencumbered by the usual political and tactical restraints of a campaign? "Chicago, we're going bankrupt and have to sharply cut the public work force and benefits paid employees," suggested finance mavens not affiliated with any candidate. "We've got 37,000 workers, and 80 percent of the budget is personnel. When it comes to pensions, raise the retirement age, reduce automatic increases, regardless of inflation, and revisit what pensions are for. Are they deferred compensation for those who can work or a safety net for those who can't?"
The thrust of my education watchers was: "The teachers union is just one part of a complex education problem. But Mayor Daley, and his handmaiden, Arne Duncan, were petrified about a walkout and constantly caved. How many workers do you know, on any continent, getting 4 percent increases this year? Folks, I'm willing to take a strike."
A chat with one Chicago Public Schools official prompts this: "Can it really be that a system with 41,000 teachers saw just two get canned last year for incompetence? And just 41 were involved in the process by which terrible teachers are flagged for possible removal? Those numbers defy the laws of gravity."
Outsiders knowledgeable about municipal manpower inspire this: "Three guys on a garbage truck, 50 ward superintendents and, then, assistants to the superintendents?! Puhleese. Get lean or get out, and give private contractors a chance to compete for trash pickup as they do elsewhere.
"Firefighters can be true heroes. But we're grossly overstaffed, with too many firehouses and relying on a model based on a long-gone era of more fires. They shouldn't serve as a 911 response center. Many have sweetheart jobs, work a second gig and retire early with a nice pension. The party is over.
"As far as cops, we're down by 2,000, but if any of my opponents claims they can fill those positions, they're lying."
When I asked about bosses, not just the too-often-targeted rank-and-file, I got this for a Chicago Bullworth: "In some departments, way too many managers. The era of deputy commissioners stretching to the horizon is over."
Privatization is easy to bash, given the parking meter deal. But smart folks who concede the pros and cons lead to the declaration, "When it comes to Midway Airport, it's smart. Airports worldwide are going private and generating far more retail and restaurant revenue. And, unlike the meter mess, this will bring in strong annual revenue.
"Take Midway revenues and pump them into mass transit. We should have done that with the meters. You just can't keep jacking up C.T.A. fares."
Finally, members of a constituency rarely mentioned in any campaign, the arts, have our liberated candidate concluding, "Cynics will scoff, but make Chicago home for a truly great annual festival of the performing arts. Create an American counterpart to the Edinburgh Festival, using Millennium Park as the focal point.
"We've got godawful poverty, depressing segregation and too much crime. But one has to dream and cultivate the soul. And this would be a lot better than a one-shot Summer Olympics. I ask for your vote."

Full text: HONG KONG -- China's central bank unexpectedly announced on Friday night that it would require commercial banks to set aside a bit more money. It was the second such move by Beijing this month and the clearest sign yet that China means to counter the Federal Reserve's monetary easing in the United States.
Commercial banks were ordered to transfer an additional 0.5 percent of their assets by Nov. 29 to very low-yielding accounts at the central bank, the People's Bank of China. The central bank relies mainly on these reserves for the renminbi to buy about $1 billion a day worth of dollars, euros and other currencies -- purchases that prevent the renminbi from appreciating.
Beijing, which has largely resisted United States pressure to let the renminbi rise, has argued that the Federal Reserve's recent easy-money actions are a de facto devaluation of the dollar.
The central bank ordered commercial banks to increase their reserves after many news reports that Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, would criticize China on Friday for its currency policies. But the Chinese central bank issued its new regulation before Mr. Bernanke actually spoke, in Frankfurt.
The bank did not mention the Federal Reserve in its one-sentence announcement, which described the move as undertaken "in order to strengthen liquidity management and appropriately control money and credit."
But economists were quick to point out that the Chinese central bank had chosen a policy stance particularly well suited to holding down the value of the renminbi against the dollar, at a time when the Federal Reserve was trying to increase the supply of dollars by buying longer-denominated Treasuries.
Qu Hongbin, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC, wrote in a research note on Friday evening that higher reserve requirements for commercial banks showed that the People's Bank was "prepared to do whatever it takes to fend off the impact" of the Fed's monetary easing policies.
Most Western economists, and even some Chinese economists, had been predicting that the Chinese central bank would raise interest rates instead of raising reserve requirements.
Higher interest rates would help cool activity in a Chinese economy that may be overheating. Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent in the 12 months through October, and broadly measured money supply is up 54 percent in the last two years.
Higher interest rates would also reward depositors, many of whom are elderly Chinese. And higher rates would increase costs for borrowers, particularly the state-owned enterprises that account for up to 90 percent of the borrowing in China because of their political clout.
But raising interest rates would also make it even more attractive for international investors to buy renminbi and invest them in China, which would very likely lead to a strong renminbi. The Chinese government is already struggling to continue holding down the value of the renminbi; its relative weakness against the dollar has been crucial to China's emergence as the world's largest exporter.
China's large trade surpluses have created millions of jobs in China, although critics point out that this has been at the expense of employment in its trading partners.
China is also moving rapidly into the manufacture of telecommunications equipment, cars, solar panels and other sophisticated goods in which it competes directly with the United States instead of with emerging economies. That has made it even more important for Chinese companies to have a competitive advantage from a weak currency, and the resulting lower prices of their exports, as they establish footholds in the American market.
To battle inflation, the People's Bank is already trying to limit incoming investments by people and companies that want to buy Chinese stocks, bonds and real estate. The commerce ministry said this week that it was also tightening scrutiny of incoming investment in new factories and other big projects.
The central bank already requires large commercial banks to park 17.5 percent of their deposits at the central bank. The new order means that requirement will rise to 18 percent on Nov. 29. Two Goldman Sachs economists, Helen Qiao and Yu Song, predicted in a research note that China might raise the reserve requirement again by the end of this year so as to further limit lending and control inflation.
By comparison, the Federal Reserve sets a reserve ratio of 10 percent for all but the smallest banks in the United States, and American banks are not required to hold any reserves against some large categories of deposits.
In China, the renminbi from commercial banks' compulsory deposits have been the central bank's main source of money in buying $2.65 trillion worth of foreign reserves. Raising the reserve requirement ratio not only gives the central bank more renminbi with which to buy dollars but also leaves the commercial banks with fewer to lend, which may help cool speculation in real estate and commodities.
The State Council, China's cabinet, announced late Wednesday that it was drafting price controls for a wide range of foods while seeking to make more food and fuel available. Local authorities were also ordered to provide subsidies for the needy.

Abstract: On Friday, for the second time in a month, the Chinese central bank raised the capital reserve requirements for banks as a way of controlling rising prices.

Full text: Stocks ended slightly higher on Friday as encouraging reports about the prospects for an Irish financial rescue appeared to outweigh concerns about the prospect of slower growth in China.
But the dollar was slightly lower and commodities fell, with some industrial metals and oil declining amid concerns that China's appetite as a commodities importer may wane.
With little new economic data and only a trickle of corporate results, investors were focused on events overseas. Investors had been anticipating that China would initiate measures to slow its economy after announcing last week that its inflation rate was a higher-than-expected 4.4 percent in October. On Friday, for the second time in a month, the Chinese central bank raised the capital reserve requirements for banks as a way of controlling rising prices.
The prospects of slower growth in China pushed down prices of some commodities. The CRB index, which measures prices for commodities like oil, metals and grains, fell more than 3 points, to 298.89.
Bart Melek, a global commodity strategist for BMO Capital Markets, said the decline was a response to China's move on the bank reserves. "At this point, China is signaling they are serious about this."
All this week, investors have been watching the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Experts from the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank met in Dublin, where Irish officials on Thursday said for the first time that the government would accept billions of dollars in aid to rescue its banks.
That prospect eased concerns about the health of Europe's financial system and helped buoy investor sentiment globally, and sent stocks up on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.32 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,203.55. It had been down more than 50 points early in the session.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.04 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,199.73. The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.72 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,518.12.
The three indexes ended the week barely changed compared with the previous week.
"To some degree we are consolidating this big move we had yesterday and trying to get our hands around the Chinese move," Philip J. Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said.
But in addition, generally upbeat economic data recently and the Federal Reserve's $600 billion quantitative easing program have also been market drivers.
Mr. Orlando said the market on Friday was in general responding to overbought conditions.
"It is not unusual to have a day of consolidation," he said.
The dollar was slightly lower on its index, weighted against a range of currencies. The euro was up slightly at $1.3672.
"Part of the reason why the euro has a bit of a pop in its step this morning is because Ireland is supposedly moving closer to accepting a bailout package for its banks," said David A. Rosenberg, the chief economist for Gluskin Sheff, in a research note.
Shares of General Motors, trading for the second day after the company's initial public offering, rose by 7 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $34.26. The stock had been priced at $33 on Wednesday.
On the Nasdaq, Dell gained 23 cents, or 1.68 percent, to $13.90, after reporting better-than-expected earnings on Thursday. Dell also helped pull up the broader market.
In the bond market, the Treasury 10-year note fell to 2.87 percent from 2.90 percent late Thursday.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, speaking in Frankfurt, raised a touchy issue between the United States and China when he said that Beijing's policies were undervaluing its currency. Currency undervaluation by China and other emerging markets, he said, was at the root of "persistent imbalances" in trade that "represent a growing financial and economic risk."

Abstract: "In the short run, disinflationary forces in Western economies, especially the U.S., appear too powerful to be overwhelmed by the recent loosening of monetary policy," said Richard Batty, an investment strategist at Standard Life Investments, a Scottish firm. Since the collapse of the housing market in the United States and the beginning of the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has made avoiding deflation a major priority, recalling the experience of Japan after its bubble burst in the early 1990s.

Full text: THE core rate of inflation fell to a record low in the United States last month, rekindling fears of deflation and warnings that the Federal Reserve might have to take even more aggressive steps to keep inflation as high as it wants it to be.
"In the short run, disinflationary forces in Western economies, especially the U.S., appear too powerful to be overwhelmed by the recent loosening of monetary policy," said Richard Batty, an investment strategist at Standard Life Investments, a Scottish firm.
Since the collapse of the housing market in the United States and the beginning of the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has made avoiding deflation a major priority, recalling the experience of Japan after its bubble burst in the early 1990s. The Fed has set an annual inflation target of 2 percent or a little lower, but is not getting it.
The latest figures, released this week, showed that overall inflation in consumer prices was 1.2 percent in the 12 months through October, while the core inflation rate -- excluding food and energy -- rose just 0.6 percent. The previous low for that index, of 0.7 percent, came in the 12 months through February 1961, when the economy was in recession.
As the accompanying chart indicates, the core inflation figures are charting a path roughly similar to one shown in Japan 15 years earlier. That has been true despite a much stronger reaction by the American central bank, which was determined not to make the same mistakes the Japanese made.
Deflation is feared for several reasons. If consumers come to expect it, as happened in Japan, there is a strong incentive to delay purchases while waiting for a lower price. That can restrain economic activity and increase unemployment. In addition, deflation places downward pressure on asset prices, worsening the situation of those who are indebted.
The latest announced move by the Fed, called QE2 in the media as a shorthand for the second round of quantitative easing, calls for the central bank to purchase $600 billion of longer-term Treasuries in coming months. While the Fed has traditionally conducted its open market operations using short-term Treasury bills, rates on those are already close to zero, forcing the bank to move out the maturity spectrum if it wants to stimulate the economy.
That move has been denounced overseas as an effort to reduce the value of the dollar, something Fed officials deny, and inside the country as an effort to print money and support big government that would lead to runaway inflation.
This week, a group of Republicans proposed to change the Fed's dual legal mandate, which calls on it both to keep inflation tame and to fight unemployment. "It's time to return the Federal Reserve to the singular mission of protecting the fundamental strength and integrity of the dollar," said Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, a Republican and chief sponsor of the proposal.
There are times when the dual mandate seems contradictory, but this is not one of them, and it is unlikely the Fed would change course if it had a single mandate.
The political criticism could make it harder for the Fed to continue acting if the economy remains weak and inflation keeps falling after QE2 is completed. But it might conclude it had no choice.
"To change inflation expectations permanently," wrote Mr. Batty of Standard Life, "a much larger monetary response would be needed from the U.S. and Western authorities than that already announced. In summary, if central bankers decide that higher inflation must be engineered, then investors should anticipate another phase of extraordinary policy measures through QE3."

BUCKS; Retirees' Cost-of-Living Index

Abstract: Created by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the experimental index tracks the spending habits of households headed by individuals 62 or older, according to Rudolph G. Penner, a fellow at the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, who analyzed the issue of cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security in a recent paper.

Full text: You could almost hear the collective groan from Social Security recipients after they learned that their benefits would not increase in 2011 because of the low rate of inflation.
This was the second consecutive year that benefits were held steady, particularly painful news for retirees whose income has already been diminished by low interest rates.
But what retirees may find even more irksome is the fact that the measure that determines whether they'll get a raise isn't even based on the spending patterns of retirees - it's based on the buying habits of working people. And many older people spend a greater share of their budgets on items like health care, whose costs continue to spiral higher.
So isn't it only fair that cost-of-living adjustments for retirees be based on figures that are actually relevant to retirees? And if we did use such a measure, would retirees have received an inflation adjustment?
Such an index already exists. Created by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the experimental index tracks the spending habits of households headed by individuals 62 or older, according to Rudolph G. Penner, a fellow at the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, who analyzed the issue of cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security in a recent paper.
Called the CPI-E, it reflects the fact that older people spend a greater percentage of their budget on medical care (about 11 percent, compared with the 5 to 6 percent spent by everyone else) and housing, but less on categories like apparel or education.
Right now, Social Security benefit increases are pegged to a variant of the Consumer Price Index known as the CPI-W, which tracks the typical purchases of a sample of wage and clerical workers. Another variation, known as the CPI-U, is based on a broader sample of the urban population, including some people who are retired. We use the CPI-W, however, because it was the only index that existed at the time Social Security was first adjusted for inflation.
How do they compare? The cost of living for the elderly has increased at a faster pace than the other indexes, but perhaps not quite as fast as you might think. Prices increased 36.1 percent for the elderly from December 1997 to December 2009, compared with 33.8 for the CPI-W and 33.9 percent for the index that includes some retired people, according to the paper. So, on average, the costs for the elderly grew about 0.1 percentage points more each year than the other indexes, Mr. Penner said.
Even if Social Security were pegged to the experimental index, however, it would not have resulted in a cost of living adjustment for the past two years, he added.
Of course, no one index will work for everyone all of the time. As Mr. Penner says in the paper, the notion of inflation adjustments is really about how many dollars it takes to attain a given level of well-being, and that will vary. "Given that well-being in an intensely personal concept and is not really measurable," he said, "no simple index can be used to adjust accurately for changes in living costs."
But using the elderly index would certainly be a more precise attempt. The Obama administration's deficit-reduction commission, meanwhile, proposed swapping the current index for what it says is a more accurate measure of inflation - one that also happens to rise more slowly. Using a slower-rising index has been billed as one of the ways to help strengthen Social Security over the longer term.
This measure - known as a chained index - takes into account that people tend to buy different things when prices rise. The index used now assumes that if the price of rye bread goes up, for example, people will continue to spend the same amount on the bread, they'll just buy less of it, Mr. Penner said. But it doesn't assume people will take some of their bread budget and shift it to, say, vegetables.
To account for this potential change in behavior from month to month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been experimenting with a chain index based on the CPI-U, which is the version that includes some retirees. It has risen less rapidly than the other indexes. (For a comparison, see the chart on page 6 of Mr. Penner's paper.)
The most accurate way to reflect retirees' spending patterns would be to use this method, he added, but base it on the index for the elderly. "Higher benefits are, of course, better than lower benefits from the point of view of recipients," he said.
But he added that there are no guarantees that the costs for the elderly will always rise faster. Even at 11 percent of their budget, he argues that medical costs still represent a small slice of the older population's overall expenses. And he said those costs could conceivably go down if some of the health reform provisions work as promised, like reducing the amount retirees spend on prescription drugs.
What do you think? Should Social Security should be linked to an index geared toward the elderly? Please drop your thoughts in the comment section below.

Full text: What do the government of China, the government of Germany and the Republican Party have in common? They're all trying to bully the Federal Reserve into calling off its efforts to create jobs. And the motives of all three are highly suspect.
It's not as if the Fed is doing anything radical. It's true that the Fed normally conducts monetary policy by buying short-term U.S. government debt, whereas now, under the unhelpful name of "quantitative easing," it's buying longer-term debt. (Buying more short-term debt is pointless because the interest rate on that debt is near zero.) But Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, had it right when he protested that this is "just monetary policy." The Fed is trying to reduce interest rates, as it always does when unemployment is high and inflation is low.
And inflation is indeed low. Core inflation -- a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices, and is widely considered a better gauge of underlying trends than the headline number -- is running at just 0.6 percent, the lowest level ever recorded. Meanwhile, unemployment is almost 10 percent, and long-term unemployment is worse than it has been since the Great Depression.
So the case for Fed action is overwhelming. In fact, the main concern reasonable people have about the Fed's plans -- a concern that I share -- is that they are likely to prove too weak, too ineffective.
But there are reasonable people -- and then there's the China-Germany-G.O.P. axis of depression.
It's no mystery why China and Germany are on the warpath against the Fed. Both nations are accustomed to running huge trade surpluses. But for some countries to run trade surpluses, others must run trade deficits -- and, for years, that has meant us. The Fed's expansionary policies, however, have the side effect of somewhat weakening the dollar, making U.S. goods more competitive, and paving the way for a smaller U.S. deficit. And the Chinese and Germans don't want to see that happen.
For the Chinese government, by the way, attacking the Fed has the additional benefit of shifting attention away from its own currency manipulation, which keeps China's currency artificially weak -- precisely the sin China falsely accuses America of committing.
But why are Republicans joining in this attack?
Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues seem stunned to find themselves in the cross hairs. They thought they were acting in the spirit of none other than Milton Friedman, who blamed the Fed for not acting more forcefully during the Great Depression -- and who, in 1998, called on the Bank of Japan to "buy government bonds on the open market," exactly what the Fed is now doing.
Republicans, however, will have none of it, raising objections that range from the odd to the incoherent.
The odd: on Monday, a somewhat strange group of Republican figures -- who knew that William Kristol was an expert on monetary policy? -- released an open letter to the Fed warning that its policies "risk currency debasement and inflation." These concerns were echoed in a letter the top four Republicans in Congress sent Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday. Neither letter explained why we should fear inflation when the reality is that inflation keeps hitting record lows.
And about dollar debasement: leaving aside the fact that a weaker dollar actually helps U.S. manufacturing, where were these people during the previous administration? The dollar slid steadily through most of the Bush years, a decline that dwarfs the recent downtick. Why weren't there similar letters demanding that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman at the time, tighten policy?
Meanwhile, the incoherent: Two Republicans, Mike Pence in the House and Bob Corker in the Senate, have called on the Fed to abandon all efforts to achieve full employment and focus solely on price stability. Why? Because unemployment remains so high. No, I don't understand the logic either.
So what's really motivating the G.O.P. attack on the Fed? Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues were clearly caught by surprise, but the budget expert Stan Collender predicted it all. Back in August, he warned Mr. Bernanke that "with Republican policy makers seeing economic hardship as the path to election glory," they would be "opposed to any actions taken by the Federal Reserve that would make the economy better." In short, their real fear is not that Fed actions will be harmful, it is that they might succeed.
Hence the axis of depression. No doubt some of Mr. Bernanke's critics are motivated by sincere intellectual conviction, but the core reason for the attack on the Fed is self-interest, pure and simple. China and Germany want America to stay uncompetitive; Republicans want the economy to stay weak as long as there's a Democrat in the White House.
And if Mr. Bernanke gives in to their bullying, they may all get their wish.

Abstract: Emerging markets went through more than a decade ago in the Asian financial crisis what developed markets are experiencing now, Mr. Browder said. Hard assets in emerging markets are a better store of value for investors and so he looks to own real estate developers and gold mining companies in these markets.

Full text: William F. Browder was speaking at Columbia Business School several weeks ago when he was asked a question he gets asked a lot: Where's the next Russia?
Mr. Browder, the grandson of Earl Browder, a onetime leader of the American Communist Party, is uniquely qualified to answer.
From 1996 to 2005, he was on the front lines of investing in Russia, becoming one of the country's most prominent and vocal activist investors with a fund that ballooned to $4.5 billion by the end of 2005, from $25 million a decade earlier.
Sitting in offices in Paveletskaya Square in Moscow, Mr. Browder focused on under-researched Russian companies that were trading at sharp discounts to their more widely followed peers. He had no plans to leave Russia, but at the end of 2005 he was expelled from the country after the Kremlin turned against him, possibly irked by his criticism of some of Russia's prized companies like Gazprom.
"I was then challenged to figure out the world, which was much harder than a simple place like Moscow," said the 46-year-old Mr. Browder, who moved to London, where he now invests in emerging markets from offices in a sedate square in the city's West End.
Mr. Browder is looking grayer these days, but he is upbeat until he starts talking about Russia; then his smile fades and his demeanor turns serious. "I have pretty dark feelings about Russia," he says. "I think it is a place best to avoid both for financial and moral reasons."
In his old office in Moscow, he used to have a large painting of Lenin above his desk, but it has now been taken down and is stashed in a corner. The only visible reminder of his time there is a small painting of Red Square.
His team in London with about nine portfolio managers and analysts is bigger than the one he had in Moscow, which is not surprising since he is scouring the globe for investment ideas.
Mr. Browder's schooling on the world came at a critical juncture. By 2007, when he set up Hermitage Global, his new fund, with $1 billion in assets, there were growing signs that the real estate bubble in the United States, which had spawned a lending spree by banks, was headed for a bad end. Mr. Browder and his team did some analysis and concluded that an American bank - he got the wrong one - would fail. Then, as governments spent $9.1 trillion, by his estimate, to rescue their banking systems and revive their economies, he turned his attention to them.
About a year and a half ago, he stood up at a Stanford University alumni event in London and mentioned the unthinkable: a run on the Irish banks, which he posited could occur if depositors decided over a weekend to withdraw their money. Ireland would turn to the European Union, where dithering by fiscal hawks in Germany and France would precipitate a run on the banks on Monday morning.
Mr. Browder's doomsday scene was averted in 2009 when the International Monetary Fund announced a trillion-dollar balance sheet intended to avoid the kind of crisis he laid out. But he had predicted that the move would give Ireland breathing room of only 12 to 18 months, especially since the country, in a move to bolster confidence in its banks, had guaranteed all deposits.
Ireland is a country with "tax revenue of $41 billion and total G.D.P. of $108 billion and their debt burden is about to explode from $59 billion to $459 billion in order to guarantee all bank deposits," Mr. Browder said in an interview this week. "There is no way they can possibly guarantee everything in the end."
He said countries like Ireland, Portugal and Greece were in an unsustainable situation. "They are going to have to default and devalue, and the only way to do that will be to remove themselves from the euro zone and print their own currency," he says. "If they default and don't devalue at the same time, they may never recover."
Mr. Browder sees the emergence in developed countries of "debasement inflation" - or rising prices with no growth. In a situation where central banks of the developed world are printing money, "you want to own hard things that can't be printed," he said. He added that he and his fund owned a lot of gold.
Emerging markets went through more than a decade ago in the Asian financial crisis what developed markets are experiencing now, Mr. Browder said. "Their currencies aren't going to be debased," he says. Hard assets in emerging markets are a better store of value for investors and so he looks to own real estate developers and gold mining companies in these markets.
Mr. Browder said the world was in the second stage of the crisis, where "governments won't be able to borrow much more, and are going to be forced to print money." This stage will spawn a new bubble in long-term bonds. "People are going to lose their shirts owning long-term bonds," he said.
The next - and most dangerous- stage of the crisis will be the collapse of currencies. "There will be a crisis in confidence in developed market currencies," he said. The trouble is, "you can't bail out currencies when they start collapsing."
As for the new Russia, Mr. Browder said there would never be another investing opportunity like the previous one in Russia, where investors had the chance to increase their money thirtyfold. But in the high-inflation scene he is painting for the developed world, he says he thinks there could be another lucrative opportunity for Columbia Business School students much closer to home.
"If I were finishing business school right now, I would become an expert as quickly as I could on the U.S. residential real estate market," which is 50 percent off of its peak and will become an inflation hedge as the United States and others start printing money, he says.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, plans to argue Friday that currency undervaluation by China and other emerging markets is at the root of "persistent imbalances" in trade that "represent a growing financial and economic risk."
Mr. Bernanke is expected to warn that a "two-speed global recovery," with the richest countries lagging behind fast-growing emerging markets like China and India, is hampering the cooperation the worldwide recovery needs, echoing a main point the Obama administration made -- with limited success -- when leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers gathered last week in South Korea.
The Fed released on Thursday the prepared text of the speech Mr. Bernanke was scheduled to deliver Friday at a European Central Bank conference in Frankfurt, with accompanying remarks that he planned to deliver as part of a panel discussion there.
For the last two weeks, the Fed has been criticized for its Nov. 3 decision to inject $600 billion into the banking system through next June, resuming an effort to lower long-term interest rates.
Those attacks continued Thursday. Speakers at a conference here, organized by the libertarian Cato Institute, warned that the Fed's monetary policy could lead to asset-price bubbles like the housing boom that crashed in 2007.
Mr. Bernanke's speech argues that unemployment in the United States is at "unacceptable" levels, and gingerly wades into the fiscal policy debate roiling Washington.
"In general terms, a fiscal program that combines near-term measures to enhance growth and strong, confidence-inducing steps to reduce longer-term structural deficits would be an important complement to the policies of the Federal Reserve," Mr. Bernanke will say.
He does not plan, however, to express a view on extending the Bush-era tax cuts, the most contentious fiscal policy choice facing the White House and the lame-duck Congress.
Even so, by defending the Fed's actions, calling for global rebalancing and hinting that more fiscal stimulus might be needed, Mr. Bernanke's remarks amount to an endorsement of crucial elements of President Obama's economic approach.
But that endorsement, in turn, could further stoke criticism by Congressional Republicans, who say the Fed is defying voters' skepticism about large-scale government intervention in the economy and setting the stage for inflation later, and by foreign officials, who fear the Fed is trying to weaken the dollar to make American exports more competitive.
Mr. Bernanke, a Republican economist who was first appointed by George W. Bush, will reiterate his argument that the Fed felt compelled to act because inflation is so low (about half of the Fed's target of roughly 2 percent) and unemployment so high (stuck at nearly 10 percent for the last 18 months or so).
"In sum, on its current economic trajectory the United States runs the risk of seeing millions of workers unemployed or underemployed for many years," he will say. "As a society, we should find that outcome unacceptable."
Mr. Bernanke will say that the Fed's first, $1.7 trillion round of asset purchases, which lasted from December 2008 to last March, helped stabilize the economy. By resuming the purchases, the Fed "seeks to support the economic recovery, promote a faster pace of job creation and reduce the risk of a further decline in inflation that would prove damaging to the recovery."
(In the speech he will also argue that "quantitative easing," the term markets have used to describe the bond-buying strategy, is an "inappropriate" phrase because it usually refers to policies that aim to change the quantity of bank reserves, rather than affect interest rates, as the Fed is trying to do.)
The text includes indirect responses to domestic and overseas critics. He intends to argue that the Fed "remains unwaveringly committed to price stability" and that buttressing growth is "the best way to continue to deliver the strong economic fundamentals that underpin the value of the dollar."
The speech addresses the anxieties of Brazil, Thailand and other emerging economies, which fear that a surge of foreign capital will drive up prices and interest rates.
If exchange rates were allowed to move freely, Mr. Bernanke will argue, emerging markets would raise interest rates -- and allow their currencies to appreciate -- even as advanced economies like the United States maintained expansionary monetary policies. That would curb the emerging markets' trade surpluses and shift demand toward domestic consumption and away from export-led growth.
Instead, Mr. Bernanke plans to say, currency undervaluation in big surplus economies has led to unbalanced growth and "uneven burdens of adjustment."
Since "the ultimate purpose of economic growth is to deliver higher living standards at home," the speech states, surplus countries should satisfy domestic needs instead of focusing mainly on exports.
Without naming China explicitly, Mr. Bernanke warned that its "pursuit of export-led growth cannot ultimately succeed if the implications of that strategy for global growth and stability are not taken into account."
As Mr. Bernanke prepared to depart for Frankfurt, other Fed officials rallied to the central bank's defense.
In a speech at Case Western Reserve University, Sandra Pianalto, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, defended the asset purchases, saying that the recovery had been "exceptionally gradual " and that she did not expect unemployment to fall below 8 percent before 2013.
Even so, she tried to reassure inflation-fearing skeptics, saying: "The main variable the Federal Reserve can control over time is the price level. Ensuring price stability is our job."
At a speech in Chicago, Narayana R. Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, also defended quantitative easing.
He said that in normal times, if the Fed let banks create more money, that could spur inflation. But, he said, that "this basic logic isn't valid in current circumstances" because banks were sitting on nearly $1 trillion in excess reserves held at the Fed.
"This means that they are not using a lot of their existing licenses to create money," he said. "Q.E. gives them $600 billion of new licenses to create money, but I do not see why they would suddenly start to use the new ones if they weren't using the old ones."
Still, he said the effects of the Fed's new policy "are likely to be relatively modest."

Abstract: "Longer-term, however, we continue to expect a gradual recovery in the U.S. economy and a gradual pullback from quantitative easing, leading to higher stock prices and interest rates," Mr. Kelly said, referring, in part, to the Federal Reserve's program to buy government debt and increase the amount of cash in the economy.

Full text: Stocks were little changed on Wednesday as concerns about debt problems in Europe persisted, and new reports showed inflation remaining low and the housing sector in the United States remaining weak.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted a small gain after four days of declines.
Stocks traded lower this week as finance ministers from the 16 countries that use the euro met in Brussels to discuss aid for Ireland. Investors have worried that Ireland's debt problems could spread to other countries that use the euro, primarily to Portugal and to Spain.
But on Wednesday, the British government signaled that it could offer Ireland direct financial aid. Officials from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund are due in Ireland on Thursday to discuss its financial problems.
"I think it is a pretty significant issue from a standpoint of potential contagion from the sovereign or banking issues," said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at First American Funds. "It has served within the markets as a proxy for risk appetite," he said.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which briefly fell below 11,000 on Tuesday for the first time since mid-October, lost 15.62 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 11,007.88.
The S.& P. rose 0.25 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,178.59 while the Nasdaq composite index was up 6.17 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,476.01.
The market wavered, then rose slightly in afternoon trading after the United States government released reports on inflation and the housing sector. The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in October, compared with 0.1 percent in September. The core inflation rate -- the measure of consumer prices excluding food and energy prices -- was flat, or marginally lower, while the annual rate of core prices was up 0.6 percent, the smallest increase since the government started keeping the records in 1957.
A Commerce Department report showed that housing starts fell in October to the lowest level in more than a year.
David Kelly, the chief market strategist for J. P. Morgan Funds, also referring to a new report on Wednesday on a decline in mortgage applications, said the recent economic indicators justified declines in the equity market.
"Longer-term, however, we continue to expect a gradual recovery in the U.S. economy and a gradual pullback from quantitative easing, leading to higher stock prices and interest rates," Mr. Kelly said, referring, in part, to the Federal Reserve's program to buy government debt and increase the amount of cash in the economy.
"The economic numbers this week are a little on the disappointing side," Mr. Kelly added. "The fears of deflation can't quite be put to bed. It is reasonable to be a little glum that we are not seeing any acceleration in the economy."
But Mr. Kelly said he believed that the markets had generally overreacted to the debt problems in Europe, partly because Ireland is determined to reduce its budget.
The dollar was slightly lower, and the euro was up slightly, at $1.3523.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 10/32, to 97 26/32, and the yield rose to 2.88 percent, from 2.84 percent late on Tuesday.
Retail shares led the broader market. Target rose nearly 4 percent, or $2.08, to $55.62 after reporting a 23 percent increase in third-quarter profit and an upbeat outlook for same-store sales in the fourth quarter.
After the housing report, shares of home builders fell. D. R. Horton fell 34 cents, or 3.09 percent, to $10.68. PulteGroup declined more than 2 percent, or 15 cents, to $6.74.
The financial sector declined, pulled down by Citigroup, which closed down 3 cents, to $4.19, and Bank of America shares, which fell 32 cents, to $11.62.
Human Genome Sciences, one of the most actively traded shares on the Nasdaq, fell more than 5 percent, or $1.37, to $24.51. The company's lupus drug, Benlysta, moved a step closer to the market on Tuesday by winning an endorsement from a committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration.
But analysts from Citi said the process had raised criticism about the drug's benefits, and the analysts were concerned about long-term sales.

Full text: HONG KONG -- China took steps Wednesday to control rising prices at the most basic consumer level. But Beijing faces a severe challenge in preventing higher global commodity prices from igniting broader inflation that could threaten China's streak of powerful economic growth.
With prices rising this autumn for many commodities like sugar and cotton, the country's cabinet announced on Wednesday evening that it would impose price controls on food, introduce subsidies for the needy and increase the availability of fuel supplies.
So far, the inflation in consumer goods in China has been largely confined to food and energy, and government policy makers want to keep it that way. But avoiding more general inflation could prove difficult.
And in terms of economic diplomacy, the measures announced Wednesday were almost precisely the opposite of the steps the Obama administration and many Western economists have been urging Beijing to take.
China's broadly measured money supply has surged in the last two years, soaring 54 percent as its central bank has supported the export economy by intervening in currency markets to keep the renminbi artificially low. Considerable cash is also sloshing around the Chinese economy because of two years of extremely heavy lending by state-owned banks to finance a highly successful economic stimulus program that has returned the country to double-digit growth.
But China's leaders are now clearly worried about the inflationary side effects of those financial policies. The premier, Wen Jiabao, has toured southern China over the last week and was shown on national television late Tuesday night expressing concern about rising food prices and promising that the government would take action.
Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, had said earlier on Tuesday that the amount of money racing through the global economy was putting pressure on emerging economies that want to control inflation. And Yao Jian, a commerce ministry spokesman, said at a press conference on Tuesday that the government would tighten scrutiny of foreign investment so as to prevent too much money from pouring into China as foreign investors seek higher returns than are currently available in the West.
Imposing price controls and other administrative controls on the Chinese economy runs counter to the steps recommended by many Western experts. They have suggested that China should further deregulate its economy, let the renminbi appreciate and otherwise rely on market forces to tame inflation.
The standard policy prescription from Washington has been that China should raise interest rates, as a way to slow investment and prevent the economy from overheating. And American policy makers from President Obama down have argued that if China would let the renminbi rise against the dollar, oil and other commodities would be less expensive in China, helping to tame inflation. But Beijing has resisted, in large part because Washington's prescribed medicine would reduce the price competitiveness of Chinese exports to the United States and elsewhere.
Still, even as China is zigging when Washington would rather it zag, some corporate economists are cautiously optimistic that China may be able to tame inflation with its approach -- for now, at least.
"Given that food prices are spearheading immediate inflationary pressures, supply-side measures should be more effective than rate hikes," Qu Hongbin, the co-head of Asian economics research at the international bank HSBC, wrote in a research note on Wednesday night. "There's no need to panic, as Beijing has more than enough effective policy options to combat inflation."
And yet, while there may be limits to China's ability to keep a lid on inflation, it is better prepared than many countries to cope with rising world commodity prices. That is because China is self-sufficient in most foods, has an enormous trade surplus and has accumulated copious foreign reserves that reached $2.65 trillion at the end of September.
In contrast, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warned on Wednesday that food import bills were up 10 percent this year for the world's poorest countries.
But many economists were surprised by the accelerated inflation in China that the National Bureau of Statistics disclosed in Beijing last week. Overall consumer prices were 4.4 percent higher last month than a year earlier.
Chinese leaders have repeatedly made clear over the years that fighting inflation is a top priority, because it could fuel social unrest. And they have publicly set a target of not allowing the annual increase in consumer prices to reach 5 percent again. It peaked at 8.5 percent in the spring of 2008.
If food and energy prices are removed from the consumer price index, the prices for everything else are up only 1.3 percent from a year earlier, according to the government. But that is not necessarily a reassuring measure, some economists suggest.
Chinese and Western economists worry that the Chinese price index may underestimate inflation separate from food and energy. The Chinese index has longstanding methodological problems -- like measuring apartment rents but not the cost of buying and living in an apartment, which has soared in recent years.
While climbing food and energy prices are a global problem, they particularly affect lower-income countries like China, where such necessities claim a far larger share of household incomes than in more affluent nations. China's consumer price index, which is based mainly on urban spending patterns, assumes that groceries represent a third of a family's spending.
That is extremely high by Western standards. And it shows how far China must still go to create the kind of broad-based consumer society that American officials recommend and that Chinese leaders say they want to adopt in the long term in place of their current export-led model. In the United States, groceries represent only 8 percent of the Consumer Price Index.
The State Council, China's cabinet of ministers, decided on Wednesday that it would stabilize prices for grain, oil, sugar and cotton in particular, according to a statement on a government Web site. The State Council also said that the government would make sure that more diesel reached filling stations, to fuel trucks, and that utility power stations had ample supplies of coal.
The high prices and relative scarcity of diesel fuel have resulted in part from its use by factories, which have been burning it in backyard generators as power companies have cut back electricity generation to meet national targets for limiting energy consumption.
Meanwhile, utilities have struggled to buy enough coal because the government requires coal mines to sell it to power companies at low, regulated prices. The mines, of course, prefer to sell their coal at higher prices on the open market.
Last week, in another move against inflation, Beijing ordered commercial banks to put more of their assets in low-yield accounts at the central bank. The measure, an increase in the so-called reserve requirement, was meant to cool a frenzy of lending over the last two years that has priced urban real estate beyond the reach of most working-class families.
Liang Huoqiao, a 22-year-old plastics worker, said in an interview earlier this year in Guangzhou in southern China that his pay was rising 10 percent a year, to around $300 a month. But his entire annual pay would be enough to buy only about two square meters of an apartment, or 21.5 square feet.
So he planned to buy a car as soon as possible, and worry about a home later.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, faced with more criticism than its leaders anticipated, stepped up its counteroffensive on Wednesday as leading Republican lawmakers continued to attack its plan to spur the recovery.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, met with 11 members of the Senate banking committee to explain the decision to inject $600 billion into the banking system, a resumption of the Fed's bond-buying program aimed at lowering long-term interest rates.
In a speech on Wednesday, Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and one of the biggest advocates of the Fed's decision, said the plan could reduce the unemployment rate by a little less than half a percentage point by the end of 2012. "This would translate into more than 700,000 additional jobs that we would not have had in the absence of this monetary policy action," he said.
On Friday in Frankfurt, Mr. Bernanke intends to respond to international criticism of the Fed's decision, which has come from officials in Europe, and in China and other emerging markets.
Those actions, along with rare on-the-record interviews this week by William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, and Janet L. Yellen, the central bank's vice chairwoman, add up to an unusual and orchestrated attempt by the Fed to cast its decision in the most favorable terms and respond to a maelstrom of criticism -- some partisan, some not -- that has taken it by surprise.
Those objections persisted on Wednesday.
In a letter to Mr. Bernanke, four Congressional Republican leaders expressed "deep concerns" about the Fed's plan, known as quantitative easing.
"While intended to improve the short-term growth of the U.S. economy and help maintain a stable price level, such a measure introduces significant uncertainty regarding the future strength of the dollar, and could result both in hard-to-control, long-term inflation and potentially generate artificial asset bubbles that could cause further economic disruptions," the letter said.
The Republicans who signed the letter were the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona; Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, who is in line to become the House speaker in January; and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican. They emphasized that the Fed should be insulated from political pressure but also said the central bank "should be open to receiving input and data from a wide range of sources."
However, the letter was more moderate in tone than recent complaints voiced by other Republican critics, like Representatives Mike Pence of Indiana, the chairman of the House Republican Conference, and Kevin Brady of Texas, who is in line to lead a subcommittee on trade.
By contrast, in the Fed's corner on Wednesday was Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, which poured money into the midterm campaigns to defeat Democrats.
"The Fed has over many, many, many years been particularly helpful to this government and to this country in dealing with financial crises, and by the way, they always make money on it," Mr. Donohue told reporters, referring to the fact that the Fed each year turns over to the government the profit it makes as a byproduct of its investments. "We're hopeful that the Fed's judgments turn out to be very positive for job creation and economic expansion."
Mr. Donohue suggested that some of the criticism of Mr. Bernanke had gone too far, praising Mr. Bernanke as a scholar of the Depression and saying, "We must maintain the independence of the Fed and be very, very careful not to louse that up on Capitol Hill."
As for the senators who met with Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday, the Fed seemed to score some sympathy from skeptics, if not outright support.
"I thought he made good points," Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, said afterward. "I still am not necessarily fully signed on to the process, but that's why we have an independent Fed that's supposed to make these calls. He made a very strong case for what they've done." Mr. Gregg said he still had reservations, adding "once you start printing money, it's pretty hard to control."
Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, said Mr. Bernanke mentioned the potential for quantitative easing to help create jobs.
"He said he was absolutely committed to keeping inflation in check and that all indicators showed that it was benign," Mr. Bayh said. "He also indicated that as they go forward, they were looking at a variety of data to see if there are any unanticipated adverse consequences of their actions and that if there were any, they would adjust what they were doing."
Mr. Gregg and Mr. Bayh, who did not seek re-election this year, said in separate interviews that the Fed and monetary policy were carrying the burden because of failures in fiscal policy, though they disagreed on what those failures were. Mr. Bayh cited gridlock in Congress over short-term measures to stimulate the economy. Mr. Gregg said the Fed was acting because of the failure to get spending and deficits under control and reassure the markets.

Full text: A bipartisan group of budget experts called Wednesday for steep cuts in future military spending, just as leaders of a presidential debt-reduction commission proposed last week.
Taken together, the reports are likely to intensify pressure to reduce Pentagon spending and cancel troubled weapons programs as part of a broad effort to reduce federal budget deficits.
But the proposals, which would cut back on expensive planes like the F-35 fighter and the V-22 Osprey, represent only the start of what could be a long debate. And it is already clear that many of the suggestions will be hotly disputed in Congress.
The plan released Wednesday included a five-year freeze on Pentagon spending, along with sweeping changes in taxes and other federal programs, to reduce projected deficits by $5.9 trillion through 2020. It was prepared by a group led by former Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, who was the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee for more than a quarter-century, and Alice M. Rivlin, who served both Congress and then-President Bill Clinton as a budget director.
Their proposal would freeze the Pentagon's spending, which tops $700 billion a year, at this year's levels from fiscal 2012 through 2016.
That would mean the Pentagon budget would not even be adjusted for inflation, and the military would lose $431 billion in additional spending that the Congressional Budget Office had projected it would receive during that period.
And even if annual inflation adjustments were restored in 2017, the Pentagon would still lose $1.1 trillion in cumulative spending by 2020.
"Would this be easy? No," said Gordon Adams, a professor at American University who led a team that prepared the group's recommendations on military spending.
But given that the Pentagon accounts for more than half of the government's discretionary spending, "We think it's a reasonable plan," he said.
Last week, the leaders of a commission created by President Obama proposed cuts in weapons systems and other expenditures that could add up to $100 billion by 2015.
Those cuts were part of a larger package of spending reductions and tax increases proposed by the panel's chairmen, Erskine B. Bowles, who was White House chief of staff under President Clinton, and Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican Senate leader.
The recommendations from both groups have come after nearly a decade of rapid increases in military spending, and they are setting up the first serious debate since the terrorist attacks of 2001 about the size and cost of the armed services.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has sought to get ahead of the budget-cutting demands by showing that he can squeeze more efficiency from the Pentagon's bureaucracy.
He has called for the Pentagon's budget to keep growing at 1 percent a year after inflation, plus the costs of the war in Afghanistan.
He is also pushing for 2 or 3 percent in annual savings in the department's contracting practices. He wants to use the money for other military needs. But both of the debt-reduction reports said any such savings should be used to lower the federal deficits.
Speaking at a conference sponsored by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Mr. Gates said that the presidential commission's proposal to slash the military budget was "math, not strategy."
"If you cut the defense budget by 10 percent, which would be catastrophic in terms of force structure, that's $55 billion out of a $1.4 trillion deficit," Mr. Gates said. "We are not the problem."
Mr. Adams said his group believed that the Pentagon could reduce the number of uniformed personnel by 275,000 as the Afghanistan war wound down.
The group also recommended canceling all three versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.
At a projected cost of $382 billion for 2,457 planes, the F-35, made by Lockheed Martin, is the Pentagon's most expensive program.
Last week, the president's commission suggested canceling the most complex version of the plane, which can take off almost vertically, while reducing purchases of the conventional and aircraft-carrier variants.
Both panels also recommended canceling the V-22, a combination of a winged plane and a helicopter, and the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, an amphibious assault craft.

Abstract: For security reasons, the White House doesn't comment on logistics of presidential trips, but they have made an exception this time. Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, said: I will take the liberty this time of dismissing as absolutely absurd, this notion that somehow we were deploying 10 percent of the Navy and some 34 ships and an aircraft carrier in support of the president's trip to Asia.

Full text: On Nov. 4, Anderson Cooper did the country a favor. He expertly deconstructed on his CNN show the bogus rumor that President Obama's trip to Asia would cost $200 million a day. This was an important "story." It underscored just how far ahead of his time Mark Twain was when he said a century before the Internet, "A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes." But it also showed that there is an antidote to malicious journalism -- and that's good journalism.
In case you missed it, a story circulated around the Web on the eve of President Obama's trip that it would cost U.S. taxpayers $200 million a day -- about $2 billion for the entire trip. Cooper said he felt impelled to check it out because the evening before he had had Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a Republican and Tea Party favorite, on his show and had asked her where exactly Republicans will cut the budget.
Instead of giving specifics, Bachmann used her airtime to inject a phony story into the mainstream. She answered: "I think we know that just within a day or so the president of the United States will be taking a trip over to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day. He's taking 2,000 people with him. He'll be renting over 870 rooms in India, and these are five-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. This is the kind of over-the-top spending."
The next night, Cooper explained that he felt compelled to trace that story back to its source, since someone had used his show to circulate it. His research, he said, found that it had originated from a quote by "an alleged Indian provincial official," from the Indian state of Maharashtra, "reported by India's Press Trust, their equivalent of our A.P. or Reuters. I say 'alleged,' provincial official," Cooper added, "because we have no idea who this person is, no name was given."
It is hard to get any more flimsy than a senior unnamed Indian official from Maharashtra talking about the cost of an Asian trip by the American president.
"It was an anonymous quote," said Cooper. "Some reporter in India wrote this article with this figure in it. No proof was given; no follow-up reporting was done. Now you'd think if a member of Congress was going to use this figure as a fact, she would want to be pretty darn sure it was accurate, right? But there hasn't been any follow-up reporting on this Indian story. The Indian article was picked up by The Drudge Report and other sites online, and it quickly made its way into conservative talk radio."
Cooper then showed the following snippets: Rush Limbaugh talking about Obama's trip: "In two days from now, he'll be in India at $200 million a day." Then Glenn Beck, on his radio show, saying: "Have you ever seen the president, ever seen the president go over for a vacation where you needed 34 warships, $2 billion -- $2 billion, 34 warships. We are sending -- he's traveling with 3,000 people." In Beck's rendition, the president's official state visit to India became "a vacation" accompanied by one-tenth of the U.S. Navy. Ditto the conservative radio talk-show host Michael Savage. He said, "$200 million? $200 million each day on security and other aspects of this incredible royalist visit; 3,000 people, including Secret Service agents."
Cooper then added: "Again, no one really seemed to care to check the facts. For security reasons, the White House doesn't comment on logistics of presidential trips, but they have made an exception this time. He then quoted Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, as saying, "I am not going to go into how much it costs to protect the president, [but this trip] is comparable to when President Clinton and when President Bush traveled abroad. This trip doesn't cost $200 million a day." Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, said: "I will take the liberty this time of dismissing as absolutely absurd, this notion that somehow we were deploying 10 percent of the Navy and some 34 ships and an aircraft carrier in support of the president's trip to Asia. That's just comical. Nothing close to that is being done."
Cooper also pointed out that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the entire war effort in Afghanistan was costing about $190 million a day and that President Bill Clinton's 1998 trip to Africa -- with 1,300 people and of roughly similar duration, cost, according to the Government Accountability Office and adjusted for inflation, "about $5.2 million a day."
When widely followed public figures feel free to say anything, without any fact-checking, we have a problem. It becomes impossible for a democracy to think intelligently about big issues -- deficit reduction, health care, taxes, energy/climate -- let alone act on them. Facts, opinions and fabrications just blend together. But the carnival barkers that so dominate our public debate today are not going away -- and neither is the Internet. All you can hope is that more people will do what Cooper did -- so when the next crazy lie races around the world, people's first instinct will be to doubt it, not repeat it.

Full text: With the Federal Reserve under attack at home and abroad, it is making an unusual public bid to keep itself away from the political crossfire.
After a barrage of criticism over the last week -- including from foreign leaders, Congressional officials, economists and Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman -- the Fed came out to explain its efforts to inject $600 billion more into the sagging economy.
One worry of Fed watchers as well as its defenders is that some of the domestic criticism may have the subtext of challenging the Fed's traditional independence in deciding monetary policy without political interference.
In a rare on-the-record interview, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the Fed's move was not intended to affect the value of the dollar, but rather to encourage a faster, stronger recovery that will also assist international growth.
"We have no goal in terms of pushing the dollar up or down," Mr. Dudley said. "Our goal is to ease financial conditions and to stimulate a stronger economic expansion and more rapid employment growth."
And in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the Fed's new vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, defended the decision in broadly similar terms. "I'm having a hard time seeing where really robust growth can come from," she said. "And I see inflation lingering around current levels for a long time." Ms. Yellen said she was "not happy to see us caught up in a political debate."
The comments by Mr. Dudley, who is also the vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, and by Ms. Yellen amounted to an unusual rebuttal, the first by top Fed officials, of criticism of its decision this month to pump money into the banking system. The plan is to spur the recovery by buying government securities to lower long-term interest rates.
Kenneth A. Froot, who teaches international finance at Harvard Business School, said, "The Fed needs to get the word out more clearly" because of the politically volatile times. Mr. Froot added, "This is a very rare circumstance where the basic authority we vest in institutions like the Fed has, more than ever, been challenged," by politicians and economists who are often identified with political parties.
The bond markets have been increasingly uneasy about the Fed's actions. On Monday, bond prices fell and yields jumped as a result of the concerns.
The criticism has tended to fall along three lines. Some have accused the Fed of deliberately weakening the dollar to make American exports more competitive. Others fear the Fed's decision could ignite inflation down the road. Still others say the policy will be ineffective absent additional fiscal stimulus.
Fed officials were clearly unsettled by an opinion piece by Mr. Greenspan in The Financial Times on Thursday, at the start of meetings of the Group of 20 nations in Seoul, South Korea. Mr. Greenspan said the United States was "pursuing a policy of currency weakening" and increasing the risks of trade protectionism.
In an open letter to Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, on Monday, a group of conservative economists, writers and investors urged that the Fed's action "be reconsidered and discontinued," arguing that the bond purchases "risk currency debasement and inflation." The group included Michael J. Boskin, a former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers; the historian Niall Ferguson; Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office; and the economist John B. Taylor, one of Mr. Bernanke's most prominent critics.
Mr. Dudley did not single out any critic, but suggested that the criticisms were unfounded.
"There is no long-term conflict between what the U.S. is trying to accomplish and what other countries are trying to accomplish," Mr. Dudley said, echoing statements by President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. "A strong economic recovery in the U.S. is in the interests of the global economy."
While Mr. Dudley said the effect on the dollar was not a consideration, he acknowledged that when interest rates adjust, "oftentimes there will be consequences for the dollar." He added, "We have seen some dollar weakness in this period, but it doesn't seem to be unusual, given the changes that we've seen in interest rates in the U.S. compared to interest rates abroad."
Mr. Dudley rejected the idea that the Fed might be setting the stage for uncontrollable inflation in years to come. He said the Fed had tools for draining the bank reserves sitting on its balance sheet.
"We are very, very confident that those tools will be completely effective at keeping inflation in check," he said. "We are completely willing to use those tools, when the time comes, to prevent an inflation problem. Higher inflation is not a way out. It is not a solution."
Mr. Dudley argued that the Fed's efforts had their intended effect. Since August, when the Fed first hinted that it might take further steps to spur the recovery, stock prices have risen and long-term interest rates have fallen. That makes it easier for consumers to buy homes or refinance mortgages, and for businesses to borrow and invest.
"You've seen a significant easing of financial conditions over that time period," he said. "I have to believe that the expectation of a second large-scale asset purchase program was the primary driver of those changes."
Even so, Mr. Dudley cautioned, "One shouldn't view this instrument as a panacea or a magic wand that's going to make the economy recover rapidly." He said the Fed's action, known as quantitative easing, was "not going to be extremely powerful" but was nonetheless necessary to reduce the risk, however slim, of a double-dip recession.
"It's going to be a long and bumpy road to a strong and vigorous expansion, but this will be helpful rather than hurtful," he said.
Uncertainty about fiscal policy -- whether the Bush-era tax cuts will be extended, and in the long term, how the nation will rein in its record deficits -- has complicated the recovery, Mr. Dudley said.
Asked whether fiscal gridlock had forced the Fed to act, he said, "We're going to worry about what we can worry about, which is monetary policy." The Fed, he said, has to "take the world as it is."
Mr. Dudley, who joined the New York Fed in 2007 from Goldman Sachs, where he was the chief United States economist, also provided details about how the Fed's outlook had evolved.
"We were going into the year expecting the economy to pick up steam," Mr. Dudley said. In the spring, "We were starting to see the glimmers" of a healthy recovery in private-sector employment, he said. But by the summer, growth began to stall; it is now estimated at an annualized rate of 2 percent. Inflation, already low, fell further.
The economy was "vulnerable to a shock that could tip us into deflation," he said.
In recent speeches, Mr. Dudley and Charles L. Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, mentioned the possibility of allowing inflation to run higher in the future to make up for inflation's being too low today, an approach known as price-level targeting. But in the interview, Mr. Dudley emphasized that he had not endorsed that approach.
"The problem with a price-level target is that it's difficult to explain what you're doing in a way that doesn't create larger anxiety about the long-term inflation target," he said. "We clearly want people to understand that we are committed to price stability over the long run."
Mr. Dudley declined to discuss the deliberations of the committee, but acknowledged that the decision was not easy.
"Reasonable people can disagree about how big the costs are versus how big the benefits are," he said. "It's completely reasonable to expect that not everyone is going to see it exactly the same way, because these policies have not been used much on a historical basis."

Full text: BY disclosing a plan to conjure $600 billion to support the sagging economy, the Federal Reserve affirmed the interesting fact that dollars can be conjured. In the digital age, you don't even need a printing press.
This was on Nov. 3. A general uproar ensued, with the dollar exchange rate weakening and the price of gold surging. And when, last Monday, the president of the World Bank suggested, almost diffidently, that there might be a place for gold in today's international monetary arrangements, you could hear a pin drop.
Let the economists gasp: The classical gold standard, the one that was in place from 1880 to 1914, is what the world needs now. In its utility, economy and elegance, there has never been a monetary system like it.
It was simplicity itself. National currencies were backed by gold. If you didn't like the currency you could exchange it for shiny coins (money was "sound" if it rang when dropped on a counter). Borders were open and money was footloose. It went where it was treated well. In gold-standard countries, government budgets were mainly balanced. Central banks had the single public function of exchanging gold for paper or paper for gold. The public decided which it wanted.
"You can't go back," today's central bankers are wont to protest, before adding, "And you shouldn't, anyway." They seem to forget that we are forever going back (and forth, too), because nothing about money is really new. "Quantitative easing," a k a money-printing, is as old as the hills. Draftsmen of the United States Constitution, well recalling the overproduction of the Continental paper dollar, defined money as "coin." "To coin money" and "regulate the value thereof" was a Congressional power they joined in the same constitutional phrase with that of fixing "the standard of weights and measures." For most of the next 200 years, the dollar was, in fact, defined as a weight of metal. The pure paper era did not begin until 1971.
The Federal Reserve was created in 1913 -- by coincidence, the final full year of the original gold standard. (Less functional variants followed in the 1920s and '40s; no longer could just anybody demand gold for paper, or paper for gold.) At the outset, the Fed was a gold standard central bank. It could not have conjured money even if it had wanted to, as the value of the dollar was fixed under law as one 20.67th of an ounce of gold.
Neither was the Fed concerned with managing the national economy. Fast forward 65 years or so, to the late 1970s, and the Fed would have been unrecognizable to the men who voted it into existence. It was now held responsible for ensuring full employment and stable prices alike.
Today, the Fed's hundreds of Ph.D.'s conduct research at the frontiers of economic science. "The Two-Period Rational Inattention Model: Accelerations and Analyses" is the title of one of the treatises the monetary scholars have recently produced. "Continuous Time Extraction of a Nonstationary Signal with Illustrations in Continuous Low-pass and Band-pass Filtering" is another. You can't blame the learned authors for preferring the life they lead to the careers they would have under a true-blue gold standard. Rather than writing monographs for each other, they would be standing behind a counter exchanging paper for gold and vice versa.
If only they gave it some thought, though, the economists -- nothing if not smart -- would fairly jump at the chance for counter duty. For a convertible currency is a sophisticated, self-contained information system. By choosing to hold it, or instead the gold that stands behind it, the people tell the central bank if it has issued too much money or too little. It's democracy in money, rather than mandarin rule.
Today, it's the mandarins at the Federal Reserve who decide what interest rate to impose, and what volume of currency to conjure.
The Bank of England once had an unhappy experience with this method of operation. To fight the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century, Britain traded in its gold pound for a scrip, and the bank had to decide unilaterally how many pounds to print. Lacking the information encased in the gold standard, it printed too many. A great inflation bubbled.
Later, a parliamentary inquest determined that no institution should again be entrusted with such powers as the suspension of gold convertibility had dumped in the lap of those bank directors. They had meant well enough, the parliamentarians concluded, but even the most minute knowledge of the British economy, "combined with the profound science in all the principles of money and circulation," would not enable anyone to circulate the exact amount of money needed for "the wants of trade."
The same is true now at the Fed. The chairman, Ben Bernanke, and his minions have taken it upon themselves to decide that a lot more money should circulate. According to the Consumer Price Index, which is showing year-over-year gains of less than 1.5 percent, prices are essentially stable.
In the inflationary 1970s, people had prayed for exactly this. But the Fed today finds it unacceptable. We need more inflation, it insists (seeming not to remember that prices showed year-over-year declines for 12 consecutive months in 1954 and '55 or that, in the first half of the 1960s, the Consumer Price Index never registered year-over-year gains of as much as 2 percent). This is why Mr. Bernanke has set out to materialize an additional $600 billion in the next eight months.
The intended consequences of this intervention include lower interest rates, higher stock prices, a perkier Consumer Price Index and more hiring. The unintended consequences remain to be seen. A partial list of unwanted possibilities includes an overvalued stock market (followed by a crash), a collapsing dollar, an unscripted surge in consumer prices (followed by higher interest rates), a populist revolt against zero-percent savings rates and wall-to-wall European tourists on the sidewalks of Manhattan.
As for interest rates, they are already low enough to coax another cycle of imprudent lending and borrowing. It gives one pause that the Fed, with all its massed brain power, failed to anticipate even a little of the troubles of 2007-09.
At last week's world economic summit meeting in South Korea, finance ministers and central bankers chewed over the perennial problem of "imbalances." America consumes much more than it produces (and has done so over 25 consecutive years). Asia produces more than it consumes. Merchandise moves east across the Pacific; dollars fly west in payment. For Americans, the system could hardly be improved on, because the dollars do not remain in Asia. They rather obligingly fly eastward again in the shape of investments in United States government securities. It's as if the money never left the 50 states.
So it is under the paper-dollar system that we Americans enjoy "deficits without tears," in the words of the French economist Jacques Rueff. We could not have done so under the classical gold standard. Deficits then were ultimately settled in gold. We could not have printed it, but would have had to dig for it, or adjusted our economy to make ourselves more internationally competitive. Adjustments under the gold standard took place continuously and smoothly -- not, like today, wrenchingly and at great intervals.
Gold is a metal made for monetary service. It is scarce (just 0.004 parts per million in the earth's crust), pliable and easy on the eye. It has tended to hold its purchasing power over the years and centuries. You don't consume it, as you do tin or copper. Somewhere, probably, in some coin or ingot, is the gold that adorned Cleopatra.
And because it is indestructible, no one year's new production is of any great consequence in comparison with the store of above-ground metal. From 1900 to 2009, at much lower nominal gold prices than those prevailing today, the worldwide stock of gold grew at 1.5 percent a year, according to the United States Geological Survey and the World Gold Council.
The first time the United States abandoned the gold standard -- to fight the Civil War -- it took until 1879, 14 years after Appomattox, to again link the dollar to gold.
To reinstitute a modern gold standard today would take time, too. The United States would first have to call an international monetary conference. A chastened Ben Bernanke would have to announce that, in fact, he cannot see into the future and needs the information that the convertibility feature of a gold dollar would impart.
That humbling chore completed, the delegates could get down to the technical work of proposing a rate of exchange between gold and the dollar (probably it would be even higher than the current price of gold, the better to encourage new exploration and production).
Other countries, thunderstruck, would then have to follow suit. The main thing, Mr. Bernanke would emphasize, would be to create a monetary system that synchronizes national economies rather than driving them apart.
If the classical gold standard in its every Edwardian feature could not, after all, be teleported into the 21st century, there would be plenty of scope for adaptation and, perhaps, improvement. Let the author of "The Two-Period Rational Inattention Model: Accelerations and Analyses" have a crack at it.

Abstract: A rising renminbi would lower the price of imports and give the central bank more control over its money supply.

Full text: American economic leadership seems to be on its heels. At the meeting of 20 leading economies in Seoul last week, China resisted Washington's demands to stop manipulating its currency and rallied Germany and Brazil to criticize the Federal Reserve's plan to inject billions into the economy. G-20 leaders also shrugged off an American proposal to set targets to reduce trade surpluses and deficits, calling instead for vague guidelines.
Summit meetings rarely produce breakthroughs. And despite these seeming defeats, the Obama administration may be close to achieving one of its core objectives. Internal economic pressure may finally force Beijing to let the value of its currency rise. That would be good for the United States economy, the global economy and China's economy. The cheap renminbi that helped build China into the world's export powerhouse is now overheating its economy. Despite the bluster in Seoul, some Chinese officials are suggesting the country could better manage these pressures if it let the currency rise.
A cheap renminbi doesn't just increase the price of imported goods for Chinese consumers. To hold down the value of its currency, the central bank must print renminbi to buy all the dollars flowing in. This is fueling inflation and bubbles in housing and stocks.
Trying to cool things down, the central bank raised interest rates last month for the first time since 2007. Last week, it told banks to hold more money in reserve and lend less. A rising renminbi would lower the price of imports and give the central bank more control over its money supply.
China has successfully followed this policy before. From 2005 to 2008, the renminbi rose a fifth against the dollar. This helped contain inflation as commodity prices rose around the world. It increased domestic consumption. The growth of China's trade surplus slowed. And China continued to grow by double digits until the financial crisis slammed the brake on the world economy, leading Beijing to abruptly reverse policy.
Reviving such a policy today would also do the world economy enormous good, taking pressure off countries whose manufacturers are struggling to compete with artificially cheap Chinese exports. It would create space for them to combat their own inflationary pressures by letting their own currencies rise.
Whether China's political leaders -- always nervous about anything they can't fully control -- get it is not clear. But no amount of bluster, or fearfulness, can paper over the damage caused by the cheap renminbi policy.

Full text: WHEN the going gets tough, governments complain about trade.
The meeting of the G-20 in Seoul, South Korea, this week was dominated by concerns about world trade, which has rebounded after falling sharply during the credit crisis and global recession. With the rebound, trade deficits and surpluses, which had appeared to be falling, have begun to rise again, setting off complaints from numerous countries that others are trying to hold down the value of their currencies to gain a trade advantage.
The apparent shrinkage of trade imbalances, usually presented as a percentage of gross domestic product, was in significant part a mirage caused by the plunge in trade. After all, if world trade went to zero, so would surpluses and deficits.
Looked at in another way, by comparing the value of each country's exports with its imports, the declines were not nearly as sharp, and in some cases vanished altogether. Germany's balance of payments -- a figure largely made up of the trade balance -- fell from 8 percent of G.D.P. in late 2007 to 3.8 percent in early 2009, for example, only to recover to 4.4 percent in the latest data. But, as the accompanying charts show, its total exports were about 20 percent larger than its imports throughout the period.
Similarly, the United States' balance of payments deficit fell to as low as 2.4 percent of G.D.P., less than half what it was a few years earlier. But the improvement was far more modest when looked at in terms of trade. The country exported 41 percent less than it imported in 2007, compared with 34 percent less in the most recent 12 months.
As can be seen in the charts, Germany may have benefited over the last decade from the fact that other members of the euro zone were becoming less competitive in exports. France was exporting more than it imported when the decade began; now its exports are running 12 percent behind imports. Italy went from relatively small surpluses to relatively small deficits.
Not shown are some of the peripheral members of the euro zone, which have been robbed of competitiveness by inflation. Greek exports are 60 percent lower than imports, and that ratio has improved lately only because it is less able to afford imports. The figures for Portugal and Spain are 36 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Had there not been a euro, it is probable that the value of the German mark would have risen relative to that of other European nations, reducing the competitive advantage Germany now enjoys.
There were some significant changes in trade ratios during the downturn. Japan's trade surplus briefly vanished, although its export/import ratio has recovered in recent months. China's gap did narrow, although it now seems to be rising again. India's substantial trade deficit widened, and its ratio of exports to imports is now lower than that of the United States.
There has been little talk of that, however. In part, it is because the figures shown are for trade in goods, not services, an area where India is strong. But it also reflects the fact that India has been importing capital as it grows, offsetting the trade numbers.
With much of the developing world now growing more rapidly than the developed countries, there has been a rush of capital into many of them, touching off worries that their currencies will become overvalued and their terms of trade worsen. That appears to have happened in Brazil, where the rising value of the real has been accompanied by a sharp reduction in the export-import ratio. Some countries are beginning to impose various forms of capital controls in an effort to keep that from happening to them.

Abstract: Doug Roberts, the chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research Institute, said that in addition to the focus on China, there were outstanding questions about the effect of the Federal Reserve's resumption of buying Treasuries. China, which accounts for most of the United States trade deficit, has managed to resist pressure to allow its currency to appreciate quickly, and Mr. Obama said the Chinese currency issue was an "irritant" to the United States as well as "to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world."

Full text: Stocks fell Friday and commodity prices declined, reflecting concerns about global issues and the possibility of a slower economy in China.
The declines came after world leaders at the G-20 summit meeting in Seoul, South Korea, came up with an agreement that fell short of the Obama administration's goals for trade surpluses and deficits.
Investors were also apparently reacting to signs of financial pressures in Europe and to the possibility that China's higher-than-forecast inflation rate of 4.4 percent in October could lead to measures to slow its economy.
Doug Roberts, the chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research Institute, said that in addition to the focus on China, there were outstanding questions about the effect of the Federal Reserve's resumption of buying Treasuries.
The Fed announced last week that it would buy government securities worth $600 billion as a way to stimulate the economy. It began the new round with a purchase of $7.23 billion in Treasury paper Friday, according to Reuters.
"What is driving everything is really the quantitative easing, and people wondering how successful it is going to be," Mr. Roberts said of the program aimed at jolting the economy into recovery.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 90.52 points, or 0.8 percent, to 11,192.58 on Friday. The Dow was down 2.2 percent for the week, but is up 7.33 percent so far this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 14.33 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,199.21. It was down 2.2 percent for the week, but is up 7.54 percent for the year.
The Nasdaq composite index, which includes many technology stocks, slid 37.31 points, or 1.46 percent, to 2,518.21. It was down 2.4 percent for the week, but is up 10.98 percent so far this year.
"Nothing is a one-way bet," said Bart Melek, a global commodity strategist for BMO Capital Markets. "Typically markets look to sell off and make some profit."
He said one of the catalysts on Friday was related to expectations that China would act after its latest inflation report, ultimately affecting its appetite for commodities.
"There is wide speculation that China is going to undertake a program of monetary tightening," he said. "The consensus is building that China will likely slow things down a little bit."
The worries also sent crude oil futures down nearly 3 percent, while gold prices also fell.
"Commodities have moved sharply into reverse as markets fear further tightening from China," following the inflation report and expectations that inflation will keep rising, Edel Tully, head of precious metals strategy at UBS, wrote in a research note.
Stocks of materials companies fell more than 2 percent, while energy and industrial shares fell more than 1 percent.
"China was a big catalyst to that," said Alan B. Lancz, the president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates. "Obviously China has a big role in global economic growth, so that might force some investors to take risk off the table."
President Obama and other leaders wrapped up the G-20 meeting with an agreement to curb "persistently large imbalances" in saving and spending. But there is still outstanding friction over currency, Mr. Roberts of Channel Capital said.
China, which accounts for most of the United States trade deficit, has managed to resist pressure to allow its currency to appreciate quickly, and Mr. Obama said the Chinese currency issue was an "irritant" to the United States as well as "to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world."
Investors have been watching corporate earnings and economic indicators for trading cues in recent weeks, but developments in Asia and global markets, including concerns over borrowing costs in Europe, have captured the market's focus this week.
Mr. Melek said concern that some European countries, particularly Ireland, could be restructuring their sovereign debt was another reason for a lower market Friday.
The technology sector declined for a second day, because of disappointing earnings forecasts from Cisco.
Shares of Cisco fell 37 cents, or 1.80 percent, to $20.15.
Intel said it was raising its quarterly dividend to 18 cents a share, starting in the first quarter of next year. Shares of Intel rose 32 cents, or 1.51 percent, to $21.53.
Shares of Nvidia rose 65 cents, or 5.15 percent, to $13.26, after the company said that its third-quarter profit was stronger than expected.
Citigroup and Bank of America declined. Citigroup lost 7 cents, or 1.61 percent, to $4.29, while Bank of America dropped 25 cents, or 2.02 percent, to $12.12.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary November reading on consumer sentiment failed to lift market spirits, even though it came in at 69.3, up from 67.7 in October and slightly higher than the median Reuters forecast of 69.0.
The price on the 10-year Treasury note fell 1 7/32, to 98 19/32. The yield rose to 2.79 percent from 2.63 percent late Wednesday. The bond market was closed Thursday for Veterans Day.
The dollar edged down on its weighted index against a range of currencies. The euro was up to $1.3693.
The American market followed declines in Europe and Asia.
The FTSE 100 in Britain was down 18.36 points, or 0.32 percent, to 5,796.87, while the DAX index in Germany declined 11.2 points, or 0.17 percent, to 6,734.61.
The CAC 40 in France was lower by 36.23 points, or 0.94 percent, at 3,831.12.

Full text: The United States Postal Service reported a net loss of $8.5 billion for the most recent fiscal year as mail volume continued to decline, forcing the agency to find ways to overhaul its business. The Postal Service has been trying to drastically reform its business practices for years in the face of the increasing popularity of e-mail, competition from FedEx, United Parcel Service and other delivery services, and the recent economic downturn. This is the fourth straight year the agency has posted net losses despite cost-cutting measures and staff reductions. The agency this summer proposed raising rates on first-class mail and other services beyond the pace of inflation to compensate for revenue losses. The agency's regulator denied the proposal. The Postal Service reported a $3.8 billion net loss for the previous fiscal year.

Abstract: Stock indexes have mostly declined this week after rallying to their highest level this year on generally upbeat corporate earnings, some positive economic indicators and the Federal Reserve announcement that it would buy more government securities.

Full text: Stocks fell Thursday, dragged down mostly by the technology sector as it reacted to a disappointing earnings forecast from Cisco Systems.
Cisco is considered a bellwether for corporate technology spending. But the company said Wednesday that orders from governments fell 25 percent in the quarter that ended Oct. 30 compared with a year ago, and 48 percent from the previous quarter.
The company's forecast was also more modest than what analysts had been anticipating. John T. Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, said he expected revenue growth of 9 percent to 12 percent for Cisco's 2011 fiscal year.
Shares of Cisco, which were the most actively traded, fell 16.21 percent, or $3.97, to $20.52. Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Microsoft were among the tech stocks that also declined.
The Nasdaq composite index, which has many technology issues, slid 23.26 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,555.52.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 73.94 points, or 0.65 percent, to 11,283.10, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 5.17 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,213.54.
Stock indexes have mostly declined this week after rallying to their highest level this year on generally upbeat corporate earnings, some positive economic indicators and the Federal Reserve announcement that it would buy more government securities.
Hank Smith, chief investment officer for Haverford Investments, said it was likely that the earnings and economic factors would continue to bolster the market despite the "one-off" Cisco-related drop.
"Clearly that was a big disappointment," Mr. Smith said. "When you look at where the weakness was, is it really that big of a surprise?" he added, referring to the decline in government spending.
It should not be "given the fiscal condition that states have found themselves in," he said.
Technology companies like Microsoft, Google and Intel have reported earnings recently that showed none of the weakness seen in the Cisco results, although their reports did not include the month of October.
Tom Samuels, managing partner at Palantir Capital Management, said the Cisco results came at a time when revenue and earnings in the technology sector were considered to be improving.
"This fired a shot across the bow with regard to that," he said. But he noted that some stocks still managed to "find their feet and appreciate" by the end of the day. One of them was Intel, which had declined in early trading but then closed up 0.81 percent, or 17 cents, at $21.21.
Microsoft lost nearly 1 percent, or 26 cents, to $26.68, while Oracle fell 0.41 percent, or 12 cents, to $28.57.
Dell declined 3.86 percent, or 56 cents, to $13.93.
Hewlett Packard fell 2.4 percent, or $1.06, to $43.10, and I.B.M. slipped 0.76 percent, or $1.12, to $145.53.
Citigroup and Bank of America were among the widely traded financial stocks that fell more than 1 percent. Citigroup dropped 1.36 percent, or 6 cents, to $4.36, and Bank of America fell 1.59 percent, or 20 cents, to $12.37.
Brian Gendreau, market strategist for the Financial Network, said recent economic reports on areas like manufacturing and jobs have been "coming in on the strong side," and corporate earnings have generally beaten expectations.
He said the declines on Thursday might be a result of profit-taking after the recent rally.
The bond market and federal government were closed Thursday for Veterans Day.
The dollar edged higher on its weighted index against a range of currencies.
Investors kept an eye on developments overseas, but those remained in the background. This week concerns have resurfaced over the strength of the global economy and the fiscal struggles of some countries in Europe, including Ireland, Portugal and Greece.
China, which accounts for much of the United States trade deficit, said on Thursday that its inflation rate was 4.4 percent in October, largely because of rapidly rising food prices. The level was higher than analysts' forecasts.
And President Obama was meeting with other leaders at the G-20 summit in Seoul, South Korea, where currency issues and trade imbalances were discussed. Some leaders have objected to the Federal Reserve's plan to buy $600 billion in government securities, seeing it as a form of currency manipulation that will undercut their own competitiveness and affect trade. The Fed intends the measure to help stimulate the economy.

Abstract: When things were good, it forgot the injunction of a former Fed chairman, William McChesney Martin, that the Fed's job was to "take away the punch bowl" when everyone was having a good time. Yet no less eminent an economist than Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor, former president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and chairman of Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers when the country was recovering from a severe recession in the early 1980s, is worried.

Full text: Can you remember when the Federal Reserve was above criticism? When politicians vied for Alan Greenspan's favor and fell all over themselves praising his wisdom?
Now poor Ben S. Bernanke, who succeeded Mr. Greenspan as Fed chairman, is being blasted from all sides. It is bad enough that his latest effort to revive the American economy has taken on a name previously used for a 40-year-old cruise ship that no longer sails -- QE2.
He is attacked by Americans for printing money and by overseas officials for trying to help American trade by undermining the dollar. Some Republicans claim to believe the country would be better off without a central bank at all.
If the stock market were falling, you can be sure the Fed would get the blame. But it has been rising of late, and in some critiques that is proof of the Fed's perfidy. The Fed is creating inflation, its critics say.
Overseas, there is a widespread belief that the purpose of QE2, for the second round of quantitative easing, must be to depress the dollar and thus give the United States an unfair trade advantage. "It's inconsistent," thundered the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, in an interview with Der Spiegel, "for the Americans to accuse the Chinese of manipulating exchange rates and then to artificially depress the dollar exchange rate by printing money."
Oddly enough, the dollar rallied in the week after the latest plan was announced, even though the normal expectation would be for a weakening. The currency slipped after Mr. Bernanke signaled such a move was likely, but it seemed unlikely the currency was a major consideration in the Fed's decision. If the central bank does manage to kick-start economic growth, the dollar is likely to rise further.
The Fed did not deserve the praise it used to get. It presided over bubbles and huge debt creation. When things were good, it forgot the injunction of a former Fed chairman, William McChesney Martin, that the Fed's job was to "take away the punch bowl" when everyone was having a good time.
We would be much better off if the Fed had noticed there was a bubble inflating in housing, rather than take the doctrinaire position that there were no bubbles, or, if there were, no one could figure out if they were too big.
Some Fed officials say they have learned that lesson, and will act differently when something similar happens. Right now, we can only hope we'll get the chance to see if they will be wiser the next time. For now, there is no party at all, let alone one with spiked punch.
Yet no less eminent an economist than Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor, former president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and chairman of Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers when the country was recovering from a severe recession in the early 1980s, is worried.
Anticipation of QE2, he wrote in The Financial Times, caused prices of commodities and common stocks to rise.
"Like all bubbles, these exaggerated increases can rapidly reverse when interest rates return to normal levels," he said. "The greatest danger will then be to leveraged investors, including individuals who bought these assets with borrowed money and banks that hold long-term securities. These risks should be clear after the recent crisis driven by the bursting of asset price bubbles. Although the specific asset prices that are now rising are different from last time, the possibility of damaging declines when bubbles burst is worryingly similar."
The threat of rising prices also was clear to Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, who asserted that "everyone who ever goes out shopping for groceries knows that prices have risen significantly over the past year or so. Pump-priming would push them even higher. And it's not just groceries. Oil recently hit a six-month high, at more than $87 a barrel."
Those worries seem excessive. The Fed is clearly more concerned about deflation than inflation, and it has a point. Inflation may be a longer-term problem, but that term is likely to be longer than you would guess from a lot of the commentary.
To be sure, some prices are up. But that could mean that markets are more encouraged about growth prospects than they were when the American recovery stalled this summer and brought on talk of a double-dip recession.
It seems that the third-quarter growth rate of gross domestic product will be revised higher from the 2 percent initially reported. Kamalesh Rao, the director of research for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which monitors retail sales, says those sales grew about 3 percent in October. "It is not an extraordinary rate of growth, but it indicates we are coming out of that summer lull," he said.
Near the end of 2008, oil traded below $35 a barrel and the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index, now around 1,200, fell below 800. What has changed since then is not inflation, or inflation expectations. The Consumer Price Index for September was a little below the figure for two years earlier. The arrival of Great Depression II seems less likely now.
Nor do markets seem to fear soaring inflation. Given the record-low interest rates on United States Treasury securities, it certainly appears that investors still trust Uncle Sam, even if Ms. Palin is worried that QE2 will be followed by QE3, 4 and 5, and that no one will be willing to lend money to the United States. A Chinese bond rating agency this week cut its rating of American government debt to single-A-plus, saying that "serious defects in the U.S. economy will lead to long-term recession and fundamentally lower the national solvency."
It is just such a long-term recession that the Fed is seeking to avoid. I don't know if it will work, but some action seems to be needed, and the politicians show no real interest in using fiscal policy to support the economy.
The action the Fed took was to announce plans to buy $600 billion of longer-term Treasuries by mid-2011. That is smaller than the purchases of 2009, but then there was a clear emergency. To a lot of people, this sounds like simple printing of money, and we all remember hearing that inflation is the result of having too much money floating around.
At the Fed, there are promises that the action will be reversed when conditions improve, but critics who once believed everything Mr. Greenspan said now doubt everything his successor says.
These are extraordinary times. If interest rates were at more normal levels, the latest Fed action would be roughly similar to a reduction of the federal funds rate by around three-quarters of a percentage point, or so some economists believe. Then the Fed would have bought Treasury bills to accomplish that goal. It would seem like a big move, but not a particularly unusual one.
Fed officials could have simply announced they were taking aim at a longer-term rate, like the five-year Treasury note, and were determined to get the yield on that down to some level they deemed appropriate. (That is essentially what Mr. Bernanke once advised Japan to do.) That might have sounded more like the old policy. But doing that could have raised fears that the Fed would have to buy a huge quantity of notes, and had made an open-ended commitment.
If we look at this as normal Fed policy in abnormal times, then we are back to another fear being raised now, that the move will not do much good because the Fed is "pushing on a string" and sending liquidity into an economy that will not make much use of it. Mr. Feldstein voiced that worry with calculations of the very limited improvement in G.D.P. that we could expect.
He may be right, of course. But in every recovery I can remember, there were similar worries. Then, seemingly suddenly, the economy took off and growth recovered. There is a cumulative effect from easing credit, but no easy way to know when it will kick in.
One area to watch is the junk bond market. Rates are down and borrowing is up. But little money seems to be going to support the kind of economic activity we would like to see, in which companies buy plants and equipment and hire workers. Instead, such companies as HCA, the privately held hospital chain, and Armstrong World, the vinyl flooring company, are borrowing to pay dividends to shareholders. That money may be recycled in new investments, of course, but its economic impact is limited.
If and when we see more money being borrowed at these low rates for projects based on expectations of a better economy, Mr. Bernanke may deserve the kind of praise his predecessor used to receive.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Inflation in China surged past analysts' forecasts in October, raising expectations that authorities in Beijing would step up efforts to slow the country's blistering growth rate.
Consumer prices have been creeping up for months as the Chinese economy has returned to its more typical heated pace of growth. But October's acceleration in prices outstripped expectations, with inflation jumping 4.4 percent from a year earlier, largely because of rapidly rising food prices, data released on Thursday showed. The figure represented also a sharp jump from the 3.6 percent recorded in September.
While inflation remains below the levels of 2007, when food prices rose around the world, the latest readings are a red flag for Chinese officials. Beijing is highly aware that social tensions could be set off by rising energy and food prices.
This year, a series of big labor strikes at factories in southern China were fueled by workers' complaints about unfair treatment, but also by the diminishing purchasing power of their salaries, as rents and food prices kept climbing.
Although affluence is rising, large swaths of the population still struggle to make ends meet and find budgets badly dented when household bills rise.
The jump in the October inflation rate also diminished hopes that price increases might level off quickly in response to recent government efforts to rein in inflation.
Inflationary pressures are being stoked by ample lending at home, as well as by an impending rise in capital inflows as overseas investors seek to cash in on China's buoyant growth.
Rising capital inflows have raised widespread concerns in emerging-market economies and provided an undercurrent of tension to the meeting of Group of 20 leaders in Seoul, South Korea, this week. Many policy makers have criticized the United States' latest efforts to bolster its own economy through a major asset-purchase program. The program, known as quantitative easing, could accelerate capital inflows into developing nations and lead to inflation, critics say.
On Wednesday, Beijing stepped up its efforts to damp rapid growth, once again instructing banks to set aside a greater portion of their reserves. This effectively curtails the amount banks can lend out, helping to limit loan-fueled growth. Loan growth has nevertheless remained strong this year.
Further measures to cool growth and inflation are now probable. The latest increase in the banks' so-called reserve requirement ratio and an interest rate increase announced last month suggest a newfound sense of urgency in Beijing's efforts, analysts said.
"As China has had four consecutive quarters of above-trend growth, together with a huge money overhang, we believe inflation is bound to rise further in the months ahead," analysts at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said in a note on Thursday. "Looking ahead, we think the monetary authorities will not only need to raise interest rates but will also need to allow the renminbi to strengthen further so as to dampen the effect of imported inflation."
Beijing has permitted the renminbi to gain about 3 percent against the dollar since June. And on Thursday, the central bank fixed a key daily exchange rate for the currency at a record high of 6.6242 to the dollar.
The economy seems able to handle more tightening. Reflecting that, Moody's upgraded China to Aa3 from A1.

SEOUL, South Korea -- President Obama's hopes of emerging from his Asia trip with the twin victories of a free trade agreement with South Korea and a unified approach to spurring economic growth around the world ran into resistance on all fronts on Thursday, putting Mr. Obama at odds with his key allies and largest trading partners.
The most concrete trophy expected to emerge from the trip eluded his grasp: a long-delayed free trade agreement with South Korea, first negotiated by the Bush administration and then reopened by Mr. Obama, to have greater protections for American workers.
And as officials frenetically tried to paper over differences among the Group of 20 members with a vaguely worded communique to be issued Friday, there was no way to avoid discussion of the fundamental differences of economic strategy. After five largely harmonious meetings in the past two years to deal with the most severe downturn since the Depression, major disputes broke out between Washington and China, Britain, Germany and Brazil.
Each rejected core elements of Mr. Obama's strategy of stimulating growth before focusing on deficit reduction. Several major nations continued to accuse the Federal Reserve of deliberately devaluing the dollar last week in an effort to put the costs of America's competitive troubles on trading partners, rather than taking politically tough measures to rein in spending at home.
The result was that Mr. Obama repeatedly found himself on the defensive. He and the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, had vowed to complete the trade pact by the time they met here; while Mr. Obama insisted that it would be resolved "in a matter of weeks," without the pressure of a summit meeting it was unclear how the hurdles on nontariff barriers to American cars and beef would be resolved.
Mr. Obama's meeting with China's president, Hu Jintao, appeared to do little to break down Chinese resistance to accepting even nonbinding numerical targets for limiting China's trade surplus. While Lael Brainard, the under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, said that the United States and China "have gotten to a good place" on rebalancing their trade, Chinese officials later archly reminded the Americans that as the issuers of the dollar, the main global reserve currency, they should consider the interests of the "global economy" as well as their own "national circumstances."
The disputes were not limited to America's foreign partners. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner got into a trans-Pacific argument with one of his former mentors, Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, after Mr. Greenspan wrote that the United States was "pursuing a policy of currency weakening." Mr. Geithner shot back on CNBC that while he had "enormous respect" for Mr. Greenspan, "that's not an accurate description of either the Fed's policies or our policies." He added, "We will never seek to weaken our currency as a tool to gain competitive advantage or grow the economy."
Much of the rest of the world seemed to share Mr. Greenspan's assessment. Moreover, Mr. Obama seemed to be losing the broader debate over austerity. The president has insisted that at a moment of weak private demand, the best way to spur economic growth is to have the government prime the pump with cheap credit and government stimulus programs. He quickly found himself in an argument with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
"You do hear the argument made sometimes: If you have a deficit, put off the action to deal with it because taking money out of the economy will reduce your growth rate," Mr. Cameron said at the meeting. "I simply don't accept that." Even as he spoke, back home his ministers were announcing new cuts in Britain's famed welfare system.
Mrs. Merkel, reflecting a more traditional German view born of her country's history of hyperinflation before World War II, was equally adamant. "I am not one, and Germany is not one, who says growth and fiscal consolidation are contradictory," she said during a lunchtime address in Seoul. "They can go together, and it is essential to return to a sustainable growth path."
She also suggested that it was the job of deficit countries -- like the United States and Britain, though she diplomatically avoided citing them -- to increase their competitiveness rather than put limits on countries that had figured out how to get the world to buy their goods. "In the task ahead, the benchmark has to be the countries that have been most competitive, not to reduce to the lowest common denominator," she said.
The differences with Mr. Cameron and Mrs. Merkel were particularly striking because during Mr. Obama's first Group of 20 meetings -- in London, Pittsburgh and Toronto -- he managed to get all of the major economies to pursue something of a coordinated stimulus strategy.
But that consensus began fracturing at the June meeting in Toronto. While the administration had warned that rolling back fiscal stimulus programs too quickly could endanger the fragile recovery, the pressure on European nations to slash their deficits was becoming overwhelming. Ultimately the Group of 20 countries committed to cutting government deficits in half by 2013, a goal the United States insists it will meet.
But much has now changed. Mr. Cameron is following his conservative instincts and has made budget-cutting a signature issue. Mrs. Merkel is credited with avoiding spending heavily on stimulus programs and emerging with the most successful recovery in Europe.
And Mr. Obama faces new political constraints. Jeffry A. Frieden, a political scientist at Harvard, noted Thursday that the administration "feels it does not have the domestic political support for embarking on potentially difficult cooperative measures."
The White House decided it was smarter for Mr. Obama to return home with no free trade accord than with one in which it could be accused of making concessions at a time that the consensus on trade has been shattered, particularly within the Democratic Party.
Similarly, accusations that China has manipulated its currency for its own advantage -- and now the countercharge that the Fed is doing the same -- are part of what Mr. Frieden calls an argument over "who will bear the burden of adjustment."
"Will it be the creditor or debtor countries?" he said. "Who's going to take a hit for our debt?"
Indeed, the struggle for advantage, which ultimately may be a struggle to set the rules for a new global financial order, was the unspoken subtext of the meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu.
Mr. Hu, in the most indirect terms, told Mr. Obama that Beijing was focused on the Fed's role in pushing down interest rates, and its effect on weakening the dollar. The code words were obvious. For days Chinese officials have characterized the Fed's actions as an effort to drive "hot money" to developing nations, pushing up their currencies and their interest rates, and perhaps fueling inflation. Mr. Obama had hoped to make the meeting about a related subject: China's continuing refusal to allow rapid appreciation of its currency, which fuels its huge trade surplus.
At a press briefing in Seoul, Zheng Xiaosong, director general of the Chinese Ministry of Finance's international department, indirectly accused the United States of ignoring its international responsibilities. "The major reserve-currency issuers, while implementing their monetary policies, should not only take into account their national circumstances but should also bear in mind the possible impacts on the global economy," he said.

Full text: Stocks closed modestly higher Wednesday amid caution about a meeting of world leaders and as Europe continues to grapple with government debt problems.
Major indexes pared some of their early losses as technology stocks recovered and energy companies rose along with crude oil prices. Chevron and ConocoPhillips were among oil companies that gained more than 1 percent.
Not even an unexpectedly sharp drop in first-time claims for unemployment benefits, announced before the start of trading, was enough to give the market much of a lift.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 10.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,357.04.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 5.31 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,218.71.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is primarily made up of technology stocks, was up 15.80 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,578.78. All three indexes had been lower in the morning.
Enthusiasm was kept in check ahead of a crucial meeting by world leaders. Members of the Group of 20will be meeting on Thursday and Friday in South Korea.
The gathering comes as countries like the United States and Japan try to stimulate economic growth, taking measures that have weakened their currencies. A global economic recovery has been slow, and many developed countries like the United States have struggled to expand at a pace that will cut high unemployment.
Major European indexes all slid as worries grew about debt problems in Ireland. The euro slipped below $1.38 and the dollar rose against other major currencies. Concerns about mounting government debt in many European countries have occasionally dragged down stocks around the world throughout the year. Countries like Ireland and Greece are facing rising debt with little signs of growth.
The dollar had been weakening against other currencies in recent weeks because of the program by the Federal Reserve to buy Treasury securities in an effort to drive interest rates lower and ignite spending and lending.
A weaker currency makes a country's exports cheaper and more attractive overseas. Japan has been especially active in trying to weaken its currency because its economy is so reliant on companies like Sony and Toyota that rely on exports.
Bond yields were marginally lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ended at 2.63 percent, down from 2.64 Tuesday.
The FTSE 100 in Britain closed 1 percent lower, as did the DAX index in Germany. The CAC 40 of France fell 1.5 percent.
In Asia, China's Shanghai composite index fell 0.6 percent, to 3,115.36, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slumped 0.85 percent, to 24,500.61.
The declines in Asia and Europe came after China's central bank announced it would raise the amount of cash that banks need to hold in reserve. Also, China's leading credit rating agencylowered its view of United States debt in the wake of the Federal Reserve's latest effort to revive the economy.
The artificially low level of China's currency, the renminbi, is likely to be one of the main topics of discussion during the two-day G-20 meeting.
Investors are concerned that the decision by the People's Bank of China to raise the reserve-ratio requirements of banks by half a percentage point -- to cool lending, particularly in the overheated real estate market -- beginning next Monday will be the first in a series of tightening measures.
A day ahead of a report on inflation in China and the G-20 meeting, there were growing concerns in the markets that China is preparing to tighten policy further to dampen down on price pressures and rein in sky-high growth levels.
"The timing may well be an indication of plans for more substantial tightening in an attempt to slow economic growth," said Derek Halpenny, an analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average was the best performer in Asia, closing up 136.03, or 1.4 percent, at 9,830.52 as the dollar rose to near 82 yen, giving exporters some respite from a strong Japanese currency.

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- Obama administration officials said Thursday that they were close to securing a compromise agreement to help reduce vast trade imbalances, a step that could ease conflict among the major world economies over commerce, currency and monetary policies.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said he believed that the world's leading economies, which will meet in Seoul on Friday, would agree that they should monitor and seek to reduce acute trade surpluses or deficits that threaten economic and financial stability.
China and Germany, among others, sharply criticized an earlier American proposal to set numerical limits to such imbalances. The new compromise appears devised to eke out a modest agreement on principles that each country would adhere to voluntarily.
While the agreement is unlikely to lead to bold new steps by individual countries, Obama administration officials say an accord on broad goals may help calm fears that a flurry of recriminations over who is responsible for trade imbalances could lead to a competitive devaluations or trade war.
"I think it overstates the level of disagreement about the challenges we have ahead," Mr. Geithner told reporters on the way from Singapore to Seoul for the Group of 20 summit meeting. "We expect we'll see broad support for the type of cooperative framework the ministers of finance first introduced two weeks ago."
A senior Obama administration official, speaking in Seoul, said the advance draft of a joint communique under consideration by the member nations would adopt a set of "indicative guidelines" that set common standards for assessing trade balances and prompting diplomatic discussions about them when they grow too large.
As with all Group of 20 communiques, this one relies on peer pressure and the perception of shared long-term interests; it is not legally binding. But the group plans to ratify calls for the International Monetary Fund to a play a stronger and more prominent role in monitoring the trade imbalances and, when necessary, publicizing them, a process that still must be worked out.
Word of the possible compromise came as American officials scrambled to cool tensions that had flared over the United States Federal Reserve's decision to pump $600 billion into the economy to stimulate growth, which China, Germany, Brazil and other major exporters fear is intended to push down the value of the dollar and give the United States an advantage in global trade.
President Obama, in a letter to the Group of 20 released Wednesday, appealed for calm, while also imploring other world leaders to shift global economic demand away from its historical reliance on American consumption and borrowing.
"We all now recognize that the foundation for a strong and durable recovery will not materialize if American households stop saving and go back to spending based on borrowing," Mr. Obama wrote. "Yet no one country can achieve our joint objective of a strong, sustainable and balanced recovery on its own."
In an opinion article for the Asian edition of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Geithner, joined Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the finance minister of Singapore, and Wayne Swan, the treasurer of Australia, in warning that a "two-track recovery will dominate the global economy for a long time to come" and would require new forms of cooperation.
Together, Mr. Obama's letter and Mr. Geithner's article laid out a strategy that combined an appeal to reason, an avoidance of confrontation and more than a little humility. The benefit of their approach, they said, would be higher overall growth in the long term.
It remained to be seen how a vague commitment to reduce imbalances would affect China and Germany, which have the world's two most powerful surplus economies. Both countries rely on exports for much of their growth and have relatively low rates of consumption, while the United States has high consumption and runs a large trade deficit.
Mr. Obama's letter indirectly defended the Fed's move to try to stimulate more growth by injecting fresh monetary stimulus into the economy. The president said the world needed a robust United States recovery even though it should no longer depend on the American consumer to serve as the mainstay of demand.
"A strong recovery that creates jobs, income and spending is the most important contribution the United States can make to the global recovery," Mr. Obama wrote in the letter. "The dollar's strength ultimately rests on the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy."
A few hours after Mr. Obama's letter was released, the Commerce Department reported that American exports grew 0.3 percent in September while imports fell 1 percent. Exports through the first nine months of the year are up nearly 18 percent from the same period a year ago.
"Our renewed focus on trade promotion is helping to grow exports, which are critical to our continued economic growth," the commerce secretary, Gary Locke, said in a statement from Yokohama, Japan, where Mr. Obama is to travel on Friday evening for meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
In his article with Mr. Tharman and Mr. Swan, Mr. Geithner said trade and currency adjustments now required broad collective action.
"Currency issues were once left to the United States, Europe and Japan, but that will no longer work in the new world economy," they wrote, acknowledging that the days in which American officials could more or less dictate global monetary policy had ended.
The three men wrote that "the currencies of the major advanced economies are roughly in alignment with each other today" and that the major nations should avoid currency volatility, but they added that "emerging economies need to allow their exchange rates to reflect the substantial growth they have achieved in their economies over the last decade."
The pair of new American statements also acknowledged the anxiety felt by fast-growing emerging markets like South Korea, the host of this year's Group of 20 meeting, over the surge of capital flows that have been entering their economies, driving up currencies, interest rates and inflation and raising the risk of unsustainable asset bubbles.
Despite the more conciliatory tone, many analysts argue that the struggle over monetary policy is unlikely to be resolved quickly.
Uri Dadush, who directs the international economics program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the system of flexible exchange rates that had existed since 1971 was at risk of breaking down.
"At the heart of the problem is the unwillingness of the big players -- and here I would single out the United States, Germany and China -- to deal with their own domestic problem," Mr. Dadush said.
He said that the United States needed to stimulate demand in the short run but curb its addiction to borrowing in the long run; that China needed to reduce its reliance on exports and allow its consumers to buy more and save less; and that Germany needed to wean itself off the fixation on frugality and productivity that helped it through reunification in 1990 but that now posed a threat to the economic integration of Europe.
Mr. Dadush's view is the mainstream one, and one shared by the United States. As Mr. Obama put it, "Just as the United States must change, so too must those economies that have previously relied on exports to offset weaknesses in their own demand."

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- The Federal Reserve's decision to pump $600 billion into the American economy has put South Korean government officials in a difficult spot.
As the site of the Group of 20 leaders' summit meeting this week, South Korea had hoped to host efforts to mediate the dispute between the United States and China over exchange-rate policies. But like other fast-growing countries, it is confronting economic worries of its own, a surge of capital seeking higher yields likely to be accelerated by the Fed's move, which is expected to push down American interest rates and the value of the dollar.
With annual economic growth at nearly 5 percent and real estate prices so high that there is talk of a bubble, South Korea announced steps in June to limit the risks arising from sharp reversals in capital flows, a main source of instability during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis.
Last Friday, the finance ministry and the central bank moved for the second time in a week to inspect foreign exchange positions, a step seen as an effort to curb speculation. Lawmakers are weighing whether to tax interest income on bonds bought by foreigners.
There is also talk of whether the South Korean currency, the won, should be devalued to stay competitive with Japan, which intervened in foreign-exchange markets in September in a short-lived attempt to stop the devaluation of the yen.
The steps come as institutions like the International Monetary Fund, which has long preached against controls on capital flows, are reassessing their usefulness.
With slow growth in the United States, Japan and other parts of the developed world, South Korea and countries like it have benefited from foreign investment. That compels government to confront "the challenge of balancing the need for large capital inflows -- especially foreign direct investment -- with ensuring competitiveness, financial sector stability, and low inflation," said Vikram Nehru, the World Bank's chief economist for East Asia.
On the eve of the summit meeting, that challenge has been the talk of leading economists here.
"How can the United States tell China and Japan not to intervene when it is doing the same?" in effect, with its currencies, said Kang Sung-jin, an economist at Korea University.
Shin Min-yong, an economist at LG Economic Research Institute, said the Fed's actions did not match American rhetoric. "To come up with this monetary easing at such a sensitive time appears to the rest of the world to be at odds with what the United States has said about holding hands to fix the world economy together," he said.
In a recent interview, Changyong Rhee, the personal representative to the G-20 for the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, said that South Korea had a distinct role to play as the first emerging-market economy to host the G-20 leaders' meeting, a source of national pride.
Dr. Rhee, a Harvard-trained economist, spoke of bridging the disputes between the United States, its closest ally, and China, its largest trading partner, and of prodding the G-20 to pay more attention to development.
But the escalating currency tensions now threaten to overshadow those efforts.
"Yen, yuan, won -- if one currency goes down, the other nations will react in kind, and with even more extreme measures," Cho Gyeong-lyeob, an economist at the Korean Economic Research Institute, a private market research firm, said. "It would lead to a breakdown of the cooperative mechanism that we have all been aspiring to maintain."
Some South Korean companies said they were already feeling the bite from the weaker dollar, which has dropped about 8 percent against the won this year. Nam Bok-gyu, president of Young Poong Filltex, a small textiles producer, said his profit margins had been squeezed even before the Fed's easing.
"All of us exporters can only be hurt by this," he said of the Fed's action, in an office in an industrial neighborhood in western Seoul, filled with racks of hanging textile samples.

Full text: When President Obama arrives in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday for the summit of the Group of 20 leading economies, he will be met by blistering criticism of the Federal Reserve's plan for "quantitative easing" -- pumping $600 billion into the weak American economy over the next eight months.
Many nations are worried that a weaker American dollar would harm their export sectors and overheat their economies as more capital flows in, in search of better returns. Their fears are understandable but shortsighted. The Fed's move is a much-needed attempt to stimulate the American economy and head off deflation here. Prolonged stagnation, or worse, in the United States would turn off one of the main sources of global demand and global growth.
By buying Treasury securities, the Fed aims to lower long-term interest rates and increase expectations of future inflation. This would spur households and businesses to spend and invest rather than hold on to money that will fall in value.
The approach is not ideal. It would be better if fiscal policy were carrying some of the load of economic stimulus. Building new rail links and roads or other large job-creating projects would do more to promote growth than lowering the price of debt, as the Fed is doing. Republican Party leaders in Congress -- for political and ideological reasons, rather than sound economics -- have vowed to block all stimulus spending.
China, eager for someone else to take the heat, is trying to equate the Fed's attempts at stimulus with its own long-term manipulation of its own currency. That may play well in some quarters, but it also makes no sense. Beijing has a policy to cheapen its currency to grow through exports, on the back of other countries' demand, while slowing its own domestic demand. The Fed's policy also weakens the dollar, but its objective is to boost demand at home.
The pain caused by the falling dollar on the export sectors of many economies is real enough. Yet rather than criticize the Fed, the G-20 should focus on working out complementary policies. Washington should back plans by developing countries like Brazil to impose capital controls and slow the inflow of money fleeing low interest rates in rich countries. Europe and Japan, where growth is anemic and inflation virtually nonexistent, could try the same approach as the Fed. They need more stimulus than the United States.
China should take this opportunity to shift course, allow its currency to rise against the dollar and rely more on consumption at home. That will be good for China and good for the global economy.

Abstract: Why? Because $10 today is not more valuable than $9 a few decades ago.

Full text: Washington
"Gold sets record high amid economic fears," The Associated Press recently wrote. "Gold surges to record high," CNN said. Gold closed Monday "at a record $1,402.80 per troy ounce," the front page of The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
It's a good story. Unfortunately, it's not true, at least not in any meaningful sense.
Gold is at a record only if you fail to adjust for inflation. And you should almost always adjust for inflation. Otherwise, you end up with meaningless records -- Gold reaches record high! Oil reaches record high! Lettuce reaches record high! -- that depend on the fact that a dollar in 2010 does not have the same value as a dollar did in, say, 1980.
More than a month ago, Ryan Chittum of The Columbia Journalism Review noticed the epidemic of supposed gold records and urged those of us in the news media to stop. The actual record was set 30 years ago, when the price of gold, in today's dollars, hit $2,387, or 71 percent higher than it closed on Tuesday.
This isn't simply a question of math. Anyone who says gold is at a record high (or who said oil was several years ago) is getting the story wrong. Why? Because $10 today is not more valuable than $9 a few decades ago. Claiming otherwise is tantamount to saying that 10 rupees is more valuable than $9 because 10 is a bigger number than 9.
The notion that gold is more expensive than ever happens to fit with a larger narrative that also does not square with the facts -- namely, that inflation is an imminent threat. This can be a bit confusing, I realize, because inflation plays two roles in the story: past inflation distorts our view of record highs, while future inflation is the concern of some of those people making a big deal out of gold.
But the story itself is fairly straightforward. In the last week, foreign governments and some economists in this country have criticized the Federal Reserve for announcing that it would try to reduce long-term interest rates. China, Germany, Russia and a couple of other countries say the move is an attempt to bring down the value of the dollar. Inflation worriers in the United States say that the Fed can't keep rates low forever and eventually must wind down its emergency responses to the financial crisis.
On narrow grounds, both groups of critics have a point. The Fed's move will indeed bring down the dollar. And the Fed cannot continue its aggressive policies forever. But forever is a long way off. Right now, the unemployment rate remains near a 30-year high, and inflation is just 1.1 percent, compared with 2.7 percent when the year began. Meanwhile, the United States is running a large trade deficit with China, Germany and Russia, among other countries.
In this situation, the Fed should absolutely be trying to lift economic growth and employment by reducing the cost of borrowing money. Its mistake, in fact, was waiting so long to do so, even after the recovery began losing momentum in the spring. That the Fed's move is also likely to bring down the dollar -- lowering the cost of American exports, raising the cost of imports into this country and thus reducing some of the world's trade imbalances -- is an added benefit.
Remember, the Fed has a dual mandate: maximum employment and stable prices. The country is about nine million jobs shy of full employment today, at the same time that prices are clearly stable. Not only has inflation itself fallen, but people's expectations of future inflation, an important indicator to the Fed, have fallen over the last year, according to surveys by the University of Michigan.
And what evidence is there that consumers are wrong and inflation is about to become a problem?
Well, borrowing rates for the federal government remain exceedingly low, so bond investors don't seem concerned. That leaves gold.
Its price has certainly been rising. It began doing so a decade ago, around the same time that oil prices began rising. Both fell sharply in the 1980s and 1990s, but they began to increase around 2000, partly because rapid economic growth in Asia was lifting demand for all sorts of commodities.
When the financial crisis occurred in 2008, oil and gold both fell, although gold's fall was milder and it soon began rising again. Over the last two years, it has nearly doubled in price. To a lot of people -- from Glenn Beckto George Soros, and many in between -- gold is a refuge in uncertain economic times. No matter what, it will always retain at least some of its value.
But gold is hardly a perfect predictor of inflation. Consider the second half of 1982, when gold jumped even as inflation was falling. Inflation would continue to fall for most of the next 20 years. From 2000 to 2008, gold nearly tripled in price, while inflation was largely quiet.
The recent rise, as Nariman Behravesh of IHS Global Insight notes, has relatively little to do with inflation fears. "It's not about inflation," he said. "It's a hedge against a weak dollar, not a hedge against inflation."
Investors who hold a large amount of dollars -- including central banks like China's -- understand that the dollar probably needs to fall in coming years, as today's trade imbalances slowly shrink. So many of those investors are turning to gold.
If investors really were worried about inflation, gold would probably be a lot more expensive than it is. Who knows? It might even hit a record high.

Full text: Investors feel better when risky bonds come with flak jackets. Drive-by deals, so named for skipping the conventional road-show route in favor of a one-day turnaround, do not give investors much time to ensure they are protected. Shoddier bondholder provisions in several recent, often rushed, deals indicate many are not.
MetroPCS is a case in point. The company, a cellphone service provider, secured itself considerably more leeway than other similar borrowers in a hastily arranged $500 million sale last week. To ensure they are paid back, bondholders like to restrict a heavily indebted company's spending, investment and borrowing. As a general rule, high-yield issuers have been able to tap only about 5 percent of their available assets without violating bondholder rights, according to Moody's Investors Service. MetroPCS has access to nearly 30 percent.
It gets worse. MGM Resorts, the casino operator, and Tenet Healthcare, the hospital chain, represent the worst credit available. Both are rated junk -- Ca1 from Moody's. Deals light on covenants are nothing new, yet both still-recovering companies managed to arrange debt with the more lenient provisions reserved for those with far less risk of missing payments.
Of course, most of the money is being used to refinance more expensive existing debt. And such balance sheet management is healthy, especially when rock-bottom interest rates make capital cheaper. Yet issuers are taking advantage of the fast and furious race for yield to weaken bondholder protections wherever possible.
The Federal Reserve's commitment to low interest rates means there will probably be more opportunities. With corporate defaults slowing and investors craving better returns than the shrunken yield on government debt, few will have the will to pass up high-yield bonds. Junk bonds have generated around 15 percent this year against barely 1 percent on a five-year Treasury note.
Still, investors should beware how creative the bond engineers are getting. They have already wheeled out the "springing lien," which sounds like it just might bounce right back into buyers' faces. Momentive Performance Materials, a specialty chemicals maker, included the provision in a $635 million offering. Instead of providing collateral upfront, the company will provide it later, when it is finished being pledged to other debt holders. When promises replace secured holdings, it is surely time for better armor.
Gold for Private Trade
A proposal from Robert B. Zoellick, the World Bank president, to use gold as a global monetary reference point could prove destabilizing. Similar to the old Bretton Woods system, such a government-run peg would break under stress. A better approach would flip the monetary order and use gold as a private means of global exchange.
Mr. Zoellick suggests using gold as an "international reference point of market expectations about inflation, deflation and future currency values." In its weakest form, this would simply use the gold price as one indicator of the health of the monetary system, something many central bankers already do. In a stronger form, it would mean fixing a peg for currencies, in a similar manner to the Bretton Woods monetary system in force from 1944 to 1971, and in vestigial form until 1973.
The model worked while the United States was the dominant global economy and in control of foreign exchange markets. Once other economies revived and currency markets were liberalized after 1958, the system proved unable to handle growing monetary imbalances. Today, America is economically less dominant and foreign exchange markets are more powerful, so the life expectancy of a state-administered fixed-peg system would be correspondingly shorter.
An alternative route for dealing with global distrust of currencies inflated by excessive monetary easing would be for the private sector to start using gold in ordinary transactions. Exporters from Germany or China, for example, distrusting the dollar and not wishing to use the potentially fragmented euro or the state-controlled renminbi, could invoice customers in gold, thus creating gold-denominated trade paper. Banks wishing to serve such customers could offer gold-denominated accounts, either hedging themselves in the futures market or maintaining a gold fractional reserve against such accounts.
This would not necessarily upend the banking system, though, if widely adopted, it would enforce changes. But if the world's monetary authorities maintained control of their currency issuance, the private gold transactions market would remain modest, expanding only if global inflation took off. It would nevertheless provide the private sector with a useful protection against some of the misguided enthusiasms of central bankers. AGNES CRANE and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

Full text: BASEL, Switzerland -- Central bank chiefs warned Monday that economic growth remained uneven, especially in industrial countries, as new data reinforced fears of a slowdown in Germany, Europe's biggest economy.
"There is a degree of uncertainty which is the mark of the present time," the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said in a news conference after a meeting of central bankers, held under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements. "Colleagues share this sentiment that we have to accept we are in a universe where there are risks."
Mr. Trichet, serving as spokesman for the group, did not refer to any specific countries but said there was a divergence between the advanced economies and "impressive" growth in emerging markets.
In Europe, Germany's export strength has been helping to lift growth across the Continent and compensate for the negative effects of the sovereign debt crisis. Data released Monday, however, showed that German industrial production fell 0.8 percent in September from August, as a decline in manufacturing outweighed gains in construction and energy.
At the same time, German exports, which include services and financial transfers as well as manufactured goods, rose 3 percent from August, the Federal Statistical Office said.
"The upswing in industry has clearly lost considerable momentum in the past few months," Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note. "The growth rates of the first half of the year are unlikely to be achieved again that quickly."
Rolf Schneider, an economist at the insurer Allianz, noted, however, that while the upswing might have "come off the boil" recently, "this does not alter the still positive economic outlook."
During his news conference here, Mr. Trichet avoided criticizing the decision by the Federal Reserve last week to pump more liquidity into the United States economy by purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Treasury securities.
Other countries have complained that the move will push the dollar lower and stoke inflation. Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, last week called the policy "clueless."
But Mr. Trichet, while declining to discuss any specific country, said central bankers agreed on the need to hold inflation below 2 percent.
"All central bankers in the world have a unity of purpose in terms of anchoring inflation expectations in line with their definition of price stability," he said.
"The word 'currency wars' was not pronounced at all," Mr. Trichet added. "Absolutely no country mentioned they were pursuing weak currency policies."
Mr. Trichet seemed to put little stock in a call by Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, for a return to a modified gold standard as a way to control currency movements. Mr. Zoellick made the comments in an article written for The Financial Times on Monday.
Mr. Trichet noted that such proposals had been made for decades. "We did not discuss the reintroduction of the gold standard," he said.

Full text: Eight years ago Ben Bernanke, already a governor at the Federal Reserve although not yet chairman, spoke at a conference honoring Milton Friedman. He closed his talk by addressing Friedman's famous claim that the Fed was responsible for the Great Depression, because it failed to do what was necessary to save the economy.
"You're right," said Mr. Bernanke, "we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."
Famous last words. For we are, in fact, doing it again.
It's true that things aren't as bad as they were during the worst of the Depression. But that's not saying much. And as in the 1930s, every proposal to do something to improve the situation is met with a firestorm of opposition and criticism. As a result, by the time the actual policy emerges, it's watered down to such an extent that it's almost guaranteed to fail.
We've already seen this happen with fiscal policy: fearing opposition in Congress, the Obama administration offered an inadequate plan, only to see the plan weakened further in the Senate. In the end, the small rise in federal spending was effectively offset by cuts at the state and local level, so that there was no real stimulus to the economy.
Now the same thing is happening to monetary policy.
The case for a more expansionary policy by the Fed is overwhelming. Unemployment is disastrously high, while U.S. inflation data over the past few years almost perfectly match the early stages of Japan's relentless slide into corrosive deflation.
Unfortunately, conventional monetary policy is no longer available: the short-term interest rates the Fed normally targets are already close to zero. So the Fed is shifting from its usual policy of buying only short-term debt, and is now buying long-term debt -- a policy generally referred to as "quantitative easing." (Why? Don't ask.)
There's nothing outlandish about this action. As Mr. Bernanke tried to explain Saturday, "This is just monetary policy," adding, "It will work or not work in much the same way that ordinary, more conventional, familiar monetary policy works."
Yet the Pain Caucus -- my term for those who have opposed every effort to break out of our economic trap -- is going wild.
This time, much of the noise is coming from foreign governments, many of which are complaining vociferously that the Fed's actions have weakened the dollar. All I can say about this line of criticism is that the hypocrisy is so thick you could cut it with a knife.
After all, you have China, which is engaged in currency manipulation on a scale unprecedented in world history -- and hurting the rest of the world by doing so -- attacking America for trying to put its own house in order. You have Germany, whose economy is kept afloat by a huge trade surplus, criticizing America for running trade deficits -- then lashing out at a policy that might, by weakening the dollar, actually do something to reduce those deficits.
As a practical matter, however, this foreign criticism doesn't matter much. The real damage is being done by our domestic inflationistas -- the people who have spent every step of our march toward Japan-style deflation warning about runaway inflation just around the corner. They're doing it again -- and they may already have succeeded in emasculating the Fed's new policy.
For the big concern about quantitative easing isn't that it will do too much; it is that it will accomplish too little. Reasonable estimates suggest that the Fed's new policy is unlikely to reduce interest rates enough to make more than a modest dent in unemployment. The only way the Fed might accomplish more is by changing expectations -- specifically, by leading people to believe that we will have somewhat above-normal inflation over the next few years, which would reduce the incentive to sit on cash.
The idea that higher inflation might help isn't outlandish; it has been raised by many economists, some regional Fed presidents and the International Monetary Fund. But in the same remarks in which he defended his new policy, Mr. Bernanke -- clearly trying to appease the inflationistas -- vowed not to change the Fed's price target: "I have rejected any notion that we are going to try to raise inflation to a super-normal level in order to have effects on the economy."
And there goes the best hope that the Fed's plan might actually work.
Think of it this way: Mr. Bernanke is getting the Obama treatment, and making the Obama response. He's facing intense, knee-jerk opposition to his efforts to rescue the economy. In an effort to mute that criticism, he's scaling back his plans in such a way as to guarantee that they'll fail.
And the almost 15 million unemployed American workers, half of whom have been jobless for 21 weeks or more, will pay the price, as the slump goes on and on.

Abstract: Mr. Bernanke said Mr. Friedman would have agreed that the Fed had a mandate to promote price stability and that "you don't want inflation to be too high, but you also don't want inflation to be too low." Because inflation, at just more than 1 percent, is too low, and because the economy and the money supply are growing very slowly, "even from a strict monetarist perspective, we need to do more," Mr. Bernanke said.

Full text: JEKYLL ISLAND, Ga. -- The Federal Reserve is portraying its $600 billion plan to prop up the economic recovery as a difficult but needed step to promote growth by lifting stock prices and making long-term borrowing even cheaper.
But there is another way to look at it. The central bank will indirectly be financing the government's deficits on a scale not seen since World War II. It will buy the equivalent of most of the new Treasury debt issued through next June. The portfolio of federal bonds it amassed as a result of the 2008 crisis will swell further, just about doubling.
As the magnitude of the Fed's plan, announced on Wednesday, sank in, a weekend gathering here of top Fed officials and economists took on the air of an awkward family reunion, with rivalries for the affections of an ancestor.
That ancestor would be Milton Friedman, the economist and Nobel laureate who died in 2006. Mr. Friedman argued that the Fed could have prevented the Depression, and he rejected the Keynesian doctrine of using government spending to stimulate demand. But he was also wary of the Fed and called for limiting the growth of the supply of money to avoid high inflation -- an idea known as monetarism.
In an essay in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University and the pre-eminent historian of the Fed, said that the Fed was stoking inflation to stimulate the economy, and that Mr. Friedman would never have supported such an effort.
That drew an emotional retort from Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman and a scholar of the Depression.
"I grasp the mantle of Milton Friedman," Mr. Bernanke told his colleagues on Saturday. "I think we are doing everything Milton Friedman would have us do."
Mr. Bernanke said Mr. Friedman would have agreed that the Fed had a mandate to promote price stability and that "you don't want inflation to be too high, but you also don't want inflation to be too low."
Because inflation, at just more than 1 percent, is too low, and because the economy and the money supply are growing very slowly, "even from a strict monetarist perspective, we need to do more," Mr. Bernanke said.
Mr. Meltzer was unconvinced. In an interview here, he said the Fed was pumping money into an economy already awash in cash, noting that commercial banks have been stockpiling money -- through their deposits at the Fed, known as reserves -- instead of lending it.
"There isn't a liquidity problem," Mr. Meltzer said. "We have over a trillion dollars in excess reserves. Idle money is sitting on corporate balance sheets."
He said the Fed risked squandering the inflation-fighting credibility it had earned under Mr. Bernanke's predecessors, Paul A. Volcker and Alan Greenspan, and said the economy's biggest problem was the uncertainty confronting business owners. "I want a moratorium on new regulations and on tax rates," said Mr. Meltzer, who has advised House Republican leaders. "That will get things moving."
On this island south of Savannah, it seemed fitting that a Fed policy was the subject of controversy. It was here, amid oak trees covered in Spanish moss, that Wall Street bankers and Washington officials, thinly disguised as a duck hunting party, gathered a century ago this month for a clandestine meeting that helped lay the groundwork for the creation of the Fed three years later.
The 1910 gathering has long been grist for conspiracy theorists. Those attending included Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, Republican of Rhode Island; the bankers Paul M. Warburg, Henry P. Davison and Frank A. Vanderlip; and Abram Piatt Andrew Jr., an economist and an official in the Treasury Department. They hoped that a new monetary authority could lessen the frequency and severity of the financial panics that had regularly buffeted the economy since the Civil War.
"The conspiracy theorists are right: There really was a conspiracy," said Michael D. Bordo, a professor of economics at Rutgers University who helped organize this year's conference, sponsored by Rutgers and the Atlanta Fed. The men, after all, were not here to hunt ducks. But if there was a conspiracy, it seems not to have been sufficiently thought out, as judged by the research presented here, which focused on mistakes and lapses throughout the Fed's history.
For example, Mr. Bordo argued in a paper that the Fed failed to prevent the bank panics of 1930-33 in part because it was not well designed to be a "lender of last resort," the traditional role of a central bank. Distressed banks could borrow directly from the Fed through what is known as the discount window, but the high hurdles to such lending, and the stigma associated with it, reduced its effectiveness, he found.
Similarly, Mr. Bordo said the Fed's much-criticized measures to help sell Bear Stearns and bail out the American International Group in 2008 might have been avoided if New Deal-era reforms had prepared the Fed to handle crises outside traditional banking. The Fed did not regulate Bear, an investment bank, or A.I.G., an insurance company; the Wall Street overhaul signed by President Obama in July extends the Fed's reach to cover all systemically important financial institutions, not just big banks.
Another paper, by Charles W. Calomiris, an economist and a professor at the Columbia Business School, argued that the Fed was slow to learn from its mistakes, especially in its first few decades. "We have a puzzle here of long-term, persistent bad ideas and slowness of learning that we should all be thinking about, if we're modest, for our current policies," he said.
Robert G. King, an economist and a professor at Boston University, described the Fed's failure in 1969 to rein in the inflation that began to rise in the Vietnam War era. It would be another decade before the Fed would start to succeed in taming inflation, and only at the cost of two painful recessions.
If there was a consistent theme here, it was that the Fed's independence was hard-won and fragile. After all, it was only in 1951 that the Fed gained full control over interest rates, having been pressed by the Treasury to keep them low to finance the government's wartime borrowing.
Marvin Goodfriend, who was an economist at the Richmond Fed in the 1990s, said the Fed's actions "only have lasting effectiveness if the policies are credible to the public" and are seen as "free of political interference or manipulation."
In interviews here, participants wondered whether Mr. Bernanke's support for the economy raised doubts about that autonomy. "It seems a little risky to me, and something an independent Fed might be able to hold off from doing," said William R. Keech, a political scientist at Duke. "I wonder if this isn't a reflection of the political pressure the chairman feels."
But Lawrence J. Christiano, an economist at Northwestern University, said after listening to Mr. Bernanke: "He's absolutely right. Inflation is low. Unemployment is high. It's clear from the Fed's mandate what they're supposed to do."

Abstract: By Thursday afternoon, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had reached a new bull market high, erasing all of its losses from the summer, and rose a bit further on Friday, to 1,225.85. Since plummeting to its lowest point during the financial crisis in March 2009, the index has risen more than 80 percent, making this the strongest bull run since World War II, according to Laszlo Birinyi, the veteran market analyst.

Full text: TWO momentous events occurred last week, and what was most startling for the financial markets was that they were so utterly predictable. As if on cue, the markets rose.
First, in the midterm elections on Tuesday, Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives, dividing the government and conjuring the prospect of more political gridlock -- which Wall Street traditionally sees as good for the markets. (In a recent column, I pointed out that gridlock hasn't actually helped long-term returns, though many investors believe it has.)
Then, on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced the start of a second round of quantitative easing -- unconventional purchases of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of longer-term Treasuries. Anticipation of that move had sent the markets rising since late August, and the actual announcement provided an extra boost.
This kind of exuberant market reaction was exactly what Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, had intended all along: on Thursday, in an op-ed article in The Washington Post, Mr. Bernanke said as much. In his essay, he took the unusual step of analyzing his agency's own policy rather than leaving the tea-leaf reading to pundits, as his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, typically had done.
Instead, Mr. Bernanke took direct issue with inflation hawks by asserting that the Fed's unconventional policy would not "lead to excessive increases in the money supply and ultimately to significant increases in inflation." Rather, he said he envisioned a "virtuous circle" of "higher incomes and profits" that would "support economic expansion" and "promote increased employment and sustain price stability."
What would propel this virtuous circle into motion? "Higher stock prices," Mr. Bernanke said. They "will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending," he added.
And what proof was there that the policy was working? He cited the very rally in the stock and bond markets that had started when "investors began to anticipate the most recent action" of the Fed -- namely, quantitative easing, or QE2, as it is called.
Wall Street hates to fight the Fed, and with the central bank's intentions made so very clear, the markets responded with brio.
By Thursday afternoon, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had reached a new bull market high, erasing all of its losses from the summer, and rose a bit further on Friday, to 1,225.85. Since plummeting to its lowest point during the financial crisis in March 2009, the index has risen more than 80 percent, making this the strongest bull run since World War II, according to Laszlo Birinyi, the veteran market analyst. Mr. Birinyi has been relentlessly bullish since early 2009 and remains so, but the latest surge prompted a note of mild caution.
"Stocks are somewhat overbought at this level," Mr. Birinyi says. It's like walking along Fifth Avenue and seeing a red light, he said: "If you're a New Yorker, it doesn't really mean you shouldn't cross. You can cross if you want -- but you'd better look where you're going." While the market may now be vulnerable to a short-term decline, he says he is convinced that we are still in the midst of a powerful "secular bull market" with plenty of room to run.
The bond market has been rallying, too. The Fed's quantitative easing, aimed explicitly at lowering the interest rates of Treasuries in the 10-year range, isn't likely to extend that rally for very long, said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, the world's largest bond manager.
Yields of 10-year Treasuries, now at about 2.5 percent, are close to fair value, he said. "The Fed is taking action aimed at pushing you as an investor into risk assets" like stocks, he said. But he added that "people don't really like to be pushed into something," so the Fed's moves "are still attracting some skepticism," which may make markets quite volatile.
Problems that could derail the markets and the economy abound. Ethan S. Harris, chief North American economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said gridlock in Washington could quickly negate the short-term market benefits of the Fed's quantitative easing. If Democrats and Republicans in a forthcoming lame-duck session of Congress don't reach a compromise on taxes fairly quickly, he said, it could "rattle the markets, and if the two sides don't reach an agreement by year-end, the level of uncertainty will be very, very high."
That's because a variety of taxes are scheduled to rise on Jan. 1 if Congress doesn't act. Mr. Harris calculates the net negative impact of such an across-the-board tax hike -- which neither Republicans nor Democrats favor -- as the equivalent of subtracting roughly 2 percent from G.D.P. next year. That could send economic growth to zero.
Presumably, there will eventually be some kind of compromise -- perhaps an extension of the Bush-era income tax cuts for all taxpayers, which the Republicans prefer, but on a "temporary" basis of maybe two years, he said.
And while in a weak economy fiscal policy ought to be expansionary -- as a tax cut would be -- a different approach is required over the long haul, he said: "We'll need fiscal austerity to trim the country's budget deficit, which is unsustainable." In a fractious political environment, that will be challenging.
Meanwhile, the Fed's loose monetary policy, which has set off a fall in the dollar, could easily have unintended consequences. The Fed hopes to prop up the housing market and spur spending by businesses as well as consumers, but it risks creating an asset bubble in the commodities market, several analysts said.
"We are certainly seeing the beginnings of a commodity bubble right now," said Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, who says that there is still money to be made in commodities like precious and industrial metals. Oil prices could easily spike and impede the recovery, Mr. Harris said. "The situation is volatile," he said.
AND Lakshman Achuthan, the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a private forecasting group, said the Fed's quantitative easing might end up doing more harm than good. Why? Because the economy is already recovering at a sluggish pace, he said, even if it hasn't been vigorous enough to cut unemployment, which remains at 9.6 percent. By easing policy now, he said, "you have to consider that they may introduce instability -- and not greater stability -- in the economy, and create a more extreme boom-bust cycle than we would ordinarily have."
While the Fed is easing, other central banks have been holding steady or raising rates. "The Fed has poured liquidity into the financial system in the United States that can't be entirely absorbed," Mr. El-Erian said. This has led to tensions that may complicate the meeting of the G-20 nations this week in Seoul, South Korea. There will be plenty to discuss, but the Fed has already made its intentions clear.

Full text: AFTER their election victory on Tuesday, Republican leaders in the House promised progress on many fronts, including a turn toward more fiscal discipline and less economic uncertainty.
They have a chance to start work on these goals almost immediately, because the lame-duck Congress soon will face a pressing issue that directly concerns both themes: the estate tax.
The uncertainty imbedded in this tax was actually written into the law in 2001 by a Republican-controlled Congress.
In what some wags have called the "throw momma from the train" provision, the law stipulated that the estate tax would disappear in 2010, only to reappear in 2011 at the lower exemption level and higher rates that were in place in 2001. (To give proper credit, this provision should really be called the "planned Bush tax increase.") The law has made 2010 the best time for tax-conscious rich people to die
Right now, no one has any idea what rules will be in place in January -- or even how to interpret some particulars of the current rules, as we shall see. (And if Congress does nothing, rich relatives might want to watch their backs on New Year's Eve.)
The essentials of estate tax law can be captured in two numbers: the amount of an estate that is exempt from taxes, and the rate paid on estates larger than that exemption. In 2001, the exemption was $1,350,000 for a married couple, and half that for a single person. The maximum tax rate was 55 percent. Between 2002 and 2009, the exemption for a couple was gradually raised to $7 million and the maximum rate was lowered to 45 percent. Gifts of any size from one spouse to the other are not taxed, unless the spouses are of the same sex. (But don't expect that inequity to be fixed anytime soon.)
If Congress had simply indexed the 2009 limit to adjust automatically for inflation, and left the tax rate at 45 percent, we would have a reasonable law in place and would have avoided a decade of uncertainty. Instead, we have granted a tax holiday to the heirs of rich people who have done their families the courtesy of dying in 2010, but we've left everyone else in a muddle.
Consider three courses that Congress might take:

Do nothing and go back to the 2001 exemption and rates.

Make the 2009 rates and exemption permanent, an approach that the Obama administration favors.

Make the 2010 rules permanent, thereby eliminating the estate tax, as the Republican leadership would like to do.
In thinking about these options, let's debunk two common misconceptions.
First, it is incorrect to say the estate tax amounts to double taxation. The wealth in many large estates has never been taxed because it is largely in the form of unrealized -- therefore untaxed -- capital gains. A 2000 study found that for estates worth more than $10 million, unrealized capital gains represented 56 percent of assets. For estates with active farms and businesses, the percentage is much higher. If no estate tax is imposed, capital gains taxes can be avoided indefinitely.
The second myth is that the estate tax somehow threatens family farms -- that they would need to be sold if they couldn't pay the tax. But under the $7 million exemption proposed by the Obama administration, such cases would be exceedingly rare.
What should Congress do? The most important step would be to end the uncertainty by legislating a permanent set of rules. If Congress doesn't act, even middle-class households might soon be facing an estate tax. And of all the taxes in our system, the estate tax probably requires the most advance thought. (It is called "estate tax planning," after all.) To avoid future showdowns in Congress, the exemption should be indexed for inflation if the estate tax remains.
But what about the tax rate? The proposed 45 percent rate is the lowest since 1932, but it still sounds high, almost confiscatory. Yet we must keep that $7 million exemption in mind. The Tax Policy Center estimates that in 2009, the average effective rate (taxes paid as a proportion of the entire estate) was 19.4 percent for all taxable estates. Even for estates above $20 million, the rate was only 22.4 percent.
We could lower the rate if we also lowered the exemption, but that would be a mistake. Dealing with the estate tax is a major nuisance, so it should apply to as few people as possible. With the $7 million exemption, only 3 estates in 1,000 would have to pay any tax. And those with estates that big could certainly afford a good lawyer to help them further increase the effective size of their exemption.
ONE might think that eliminating the tax -- that is, continuing the 2010 rules -- would end this reporting burden for everyone. In fact, the opposite is true. There are new filing provisions in 2010 for any estate with more than $1.3 million in unrealized capital gains. Previously, the original prices for assets in an estate weren't important because the income tax bases were "stepped up" to current levels. Now, the I.R.S. wants to know the original purchase prices, which you will have to enter on a form that the agency has not yet provided.
So if your affluent grandpa died this year, now might be a good time to start looking for the receipt for that original Picasso he bought in Paris 50 years ago.
Which brings us to fiscal discipline. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that eliminating the estate tax would cost about $500 billion over the next decade. The Obama proposal, if indexed to inflation, reduces that loss of revenue by about half. Some Republicans will want to hold out for a complete elimination of the tax and may try to postpone acting until the new Congress convenes. If a spike in deaths occurs in late December, we will know whom to blame.
So let's be serious. There are lots of ways to spend $250 billion. Trim the deficit, improve education, support the troops, or make sure heiresses like Paris Hilton have the proper attire for trips to St.-Tropez. At this time in our history, which of them seem prudent?

[...] there is a risk, however small, that once that nudge takes hold, it may not be easy to cap inflation and inflationary expectations at levels that are still broadly compatible with price stability.

Full text: JEKYLL ISLAND, Ga. -- Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, continued on Saturday to rebut critics who feared the central bank's latest bid to stimulate the economy could trigger dangerous inflation down the line and antagonize other countries by weakening the dollar.
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed's decision on Wednesday to pump $600 billion into the economy by mid-2011 was a response to the rate of inflation being too low and an attempt to mitigate high unemployment, though he suggested that the first problem was easier to fix than the second.
"We're not in the business of trying to create inflation," he said at a conference here, speaking on a panel with his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. "Our purpose is to provide some additional stimulus to help the economy recover and to avoid, potentially, additional disinflation."
Not everyone at the conference, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Rutgers University, agreed.
E. Gerald Corrigan, a former president of the New York Fed who also spoke on the panel with Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan, said he felt "uneasiness" about the latest decision.
"Inflation is, by its nature, a cumulative and self-reinforcing process," Mr. Corrigan, now at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a paper accompanying his remarks. "Thus there is a risk, however small, that once that nudge takes hold, it may not be easy to cap inflation and inflationary expectations at levels that are still broadly compatible with price stability."
Mr. Bernanke said he was "very sympathetic" to that concern, which tends to be held by Fed veterans whose formative experience was the Fed's painful but successful battle against inflation from 1979 to 1982. But he also revealed a certain frustration at the sharp response to the Fed's decision to renew a strategy, known as quantitative easing, that involves buying Treasury securities to lower long-term interest rates.
The strategy is unconventional, but the Fed's usual tool to stimulate the economy, lowering short-term rates, is no longer available because the Fed already lowered those rates to nearly zero in December 2008.
"There's a sense out there that, quote, quantitative easing, or asset purchases, is some completely foreign, new, strange kind of thing, we have no idea what the hell is going to happen, and it's an unanticipated and unpredictable policy," Mr. Bernanke said. "Quite the contrary: this is just monetary policy. Monetary policy involves the swapping of assets -- essentially, the acquisition of Treasuries and swapping those for other kinds of assets."
Mr. Bernanke said that the new approach "will work, or not work, in much the same way that monetary policy -- ordinary, more conventional, familiar monetary policy -- will work" and that there was "not as much discontinuity as people think."
The statement seemed directed both at inflation-fearing critics and overseas critics -- from Germany and Brazil -- who say the central bank is effectively weakening the dollar.
The two-day conference was held at a time of significant uncertainty at the Fed, a point Mr. Corrigan underscored, writing that "the policy dilemmas faced by the Fed today are more acute than at any point in the 40-plus years that I have been a participant in, or a close observer of, the monetary policy process."
But the gathering was also intended to offer reassurance about the economy.
"The Federal Reserve is respected, and it's respected at a time when respect and trust in all our government institutions is all too rare," Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chief who tamed inflation, said in taped remarks. "It's that respect and that trust that at the end of the day is vital to the acceptance of its independence and to support for its policies."
Mr. Greenspan's tenure at the Fed, which ended in 2006, was once celebrated but is now being reassessed in light of the financial crisis. Raghuram G. Rajan, the economist who moderated the discussion, asked Mr. Greenspan to appraise the idea of the "Greenspan put," the notion that stocks and other assets soared to unsustainable levels because investors had believed that Mr. Greenspan would not allow the stock market to fall too sharply.
Some say Mr. Greenspan held rates low for too long, contributing to the housing bubble.
Mr. Greenspan rejected the notion that propping up the stock market had been his goal. "We're responding to the economy -- not to the markets, not to interest rates," he said.

Abstract: While federal aid often pays for a large part of projects, a vast majority of public construction projects are undertaken and at least partly financed by state and local governments.

Full text: AFTER a rapid plunge, the pace of residential construction in the United States has stabilized. But any respite for the economy that could have been provided by the end of that decline has been more than offset by a drop in privately financed nonresidential construction.
And now even publicly financed construction has begun to slide on a year-over-year basis, something that has not happened since 1984.
The rapid decline in nonresidential construction reflects the fact that commercial projects often cannot be stopped immediately, even if the market has soured. Finishing a building is usually preferable to leaving it half built, since there is no possibility of renting out an unfinished shell. That helped to keep such spending up early in the recession, but it has since fallen off rapidly.
Figures for September, released this week, showed that residential construction spending rose a little compared with August, but remained well below year-ago levels. At the same time, figures for almost every category of nonresidential spending showed declines.
Month-to-month figures can be volatile because of weather, even though the Census Bureau applies seasonal adjustments. The accompanying charts are based on total spending over 12-month periods, and compare one period to the same period a year earlier. The figures are in actual dollars, not adjusted for inflation.
Private residential construction spending took off early in this century, rising to a peak in 2006. For the 12 months through June of that year, Americans spent $643 billion on building homes and apartments. That spending was spurred, of course, by easy credit and by a mortgage industry that was lending money to almost anyone. By early this year, the 12-month total was down to $243 billion, a decline of more than 60 percent.
At the peak, residential spending amounted to 55 percent of total construction spending, a level unprecedented since the government began collecting such data in the 1960s. For many years, nonresidential and residential spending were on different cycles, with one drawing in more money when the other faltered. But that pattern ended in the early 1990s, and residential spending was virtually unaffected by the 2001 recession.
Publicly financed construction, largely for things like roads, schools and sewers, has been relatively steady and did not rise as rapidly during the years when the economy was booming. Now it is sliding, but not as rapidly as the other categories. It is now the largest of the three categories.
During the boom, the excesses in the economy both drove up construction costs and left many areas overbuilt, with too many homes, offices, hotels and stores. It will take time to work off those excesses, which is a why a rapid pickup in such spending seems unlikely.
There is a need for public infrastructure projects, and with contractors desperate for business, there is a possibility of getting such work done for less than it would otherwise cost. But there appears to be little prospect that the government will be able to take advantage of that opportunity.
While federal aid often pays for a large part of projects, a vast majority of public construction projects are undertaken and at least partly financed by state and local governments. Many of them are suffering large budget deficits, in part because falling property prices have depressed tax collections, and are hesitant to undertake projects that can be deferred.
This is an area where a federal stimulus program could both pay for needed projects and put to work a sector of the economy that has otherwise dubious prospects, even if the overall economy does continue to improve. Concern over federal budget deficits, however, may make Congressional approval of such a program impossible.

Full text: JEKYLL ISLAND, Ga. -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Friday defended the central bank's decision to inject $600 billion into the American economy, in the face of objections from European and Asian officials about the weakening of the dollar that is likely to result from the action.
"The best fundamentals for the dollar will come when the economy is growing strongly," Mr. Bernanke told students at Jacksonville University in Florida. "That is where the fundamentals come from. We are aware the dollar plays a special role in the global economy."
In commenting on the dollar, Mr. Bernanke was making an unusual departure from custom. By tradition, the dollar is the purview of the Treasury secretary and monetary policy is the domain of the Fed chairman, and neither official steps on the other's turf.
But the Fed's announcement on Wednesday that it would resume a strategy of buying Treasury securities to lower long-term interest rates has generated unease around the world.
As Mr. Bernanke spoke, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, arrived in Kyoto, Japan, for a meeting of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where American complaints about the undervaluation of the Chinese currency will probably be countered with accusations that the Fed is engaging in an exchange-rate move of its own.
"What the U.S. accuses China of doing, the U.S.A. is doing by different means," the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said of the Fed's new decision. Earlier, the Brazilian finance minister, Guido Mantega, who has warned of a global currency war, predicted that the Fed's move would be ineffective, saying, "Throwing money out of a helicopter doesn't do any good."
Mr. Bernanke has defended the Fed's decision to pump $600 billion into the banking system as a modest but necessary step to support the American recovery, and he told the students: "A strong U.S. economy is critical not just for Americans but for a global recovery."
The chairman also addressed critics who were worried that the Fed's move could touch off uncontrollable inflation, even though the current rate is well below the Fed's unofficial goal of about 2 percent.
"We are absolutely committed to keeping inflation low and stable," Mr. Bernanke said. "We have the tools to unwind and tighten policy at the appropriate time, when that time comes."
The chairman spoke in Jacksonville before traveling here for a conference on Fed history, attended by many presidents of Fed regional banks, along with a legion of Fed veterans and top economists.
Though they would not grant interviews, their public comments at the conference suggested an acute awareness of the potential drawbacks of the decision. "We are still rewriting the narrative, and gaining an understanding, of what happened in the Great Depression and why," said Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. "No doubt it will be at least 50 years before we understand very well what happened in 2008 and 2009 and whether the Federal Reserve undertook the right policies or the wrong policies."
Or as Sandra Pianalto, president of the Cleveland Fed, put it: "History has an ability to administer a dose of humility."
Mr. Bernanke and his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, whose 18-year tenure coincided with a period of economic calm that ended soon after Mr. Bernanke succeeded him, are scheduled to speak Saturday at the conference, organized by the Atlanta Fed and Rutgers University.
Leading scholars of the Fed voiced skepticism about the latest step, which even Fed officials acknowledge will have only modest effects on employment and growth.
"Learning is slow when you need it most," said Charles W. Calomiris, an economist at Columbia Business School who presented research on the Fed's policy mistakes from its founding until 1951, most notably during the Depression. "Volatile times make learning and accountability much harder, because views that might be false are harder to discredit."
Mr. Calomiris said he would "make a strong case" against additional purchases of government debt, and added: "When we need central banks to act the wisest, they often act the least wise."
In interviews here, other economists expressed ambivalence about the Fed's latest step.
"They're setting the stage for an outbreak of real serious inflation one to two years from now, at which point they will have no choice but to sell securities and raise interest rates, which will reduce the value of their assets and consequently their earnings," said William F. Ford, a former president of the Atlanta Fed.
The Fed transferred $47.4 billion, a record sum, to the Treasury last year, but it could conceivably record a loss if interest rates were to rise quickly and reduce the value of the securities on the central bank's books.
Others said the Fed was doing its best at a time of few good options.
Anil K. Kashyap, an economist in the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, gave a more favorable interpretation, predicting that the Fed would be praised for lowering interest rates, making emergency loans and ultimately pumping trillions of dollars into the economy.
"It's already well understood that things could have gotten much worse in 2008 if the Fed hadn't gone to the mat, and I think Ben will be viewed as a hero," he said. "I think history will treat the Fed pretty well."

Once on a Sleepy Beat, Regulator Is Suddenly Busy

Abstract: Starting last spring as the two banks cut back on their activities in the silver market, the prices of silver futures increased about 50 percent "even though no fundamental changes in supply or demand for silver, including industrial demand, have occurred during this time period," one lawsuit states. Silver, copper, wheat and oil have also gained amid concern that new efforts to spur growth -- including the $600 billion in new Treasury bond purchases announced by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday -- could eventually ignite inflation.

Full text: Cotton, sugar, silver, wheat: in investment circles, commodities like these are hot.
Maybe too hot. At a time when prices of many commodities are soaring -- cotton has jumped 95 percent in the last 12 months, silver 43 percent -- alarms are going off inside the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington.
Long dismissed as a lackadaisical regulator, the commission is suddenly on the move. Indeed, it is busier than ever: It opened a record 419 investigations over the last year, into things as diverse as small-time Ponzi schemes and claims of market manipulation.
It is a remarkable turnabout for the agency, which not long ago seemed on the brink of extinction. Its chairman, Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has surprised some of his former Wall Street colleagues by flexing his agency's muscles. He is rushing to expand the C.F.T.C.'s power now that the agency is poised to take on a new role in overseeing the vast market for derivatives that were traded off formal exchanges in the so-called over-the-counter market. He recently hired a former United States prosecutor as his new head of enforcement.
Granted, the C.F.T.C., like its bigger cousin, the Securities and Exchange Commission, often reels in relatively small fish. One recent case centers on what it calls the Aloha scam -- a $3 million suspected Ponzi scheme in Hawaii that the agency says was overseen by a man in prison. Bernie Madoff, this is not. What is more, agency outsiders question whether it has the means and experience to police new markets and take on the biggest players.
"They had the whole commodities market, and now they're getting an entire new market," said Therese M. Doherty, a partner at the law firm of Herrick Feinstein. "I don't think people have gotten their arms around just how big this market is."
The C.F.T.C., for instance, has about 200 lawyers in its enforcement division, while the S.E.C. has more than 1,200, Ms. Doherty said.
The agency is certainly talking tougher. Last week, one of its commissioners, Bart Chilton, urged the agency to strengthen its two-year investigation into suspected manipulation in silver trading.
"I believe that there have been repeated attempts to influence prices in the silver markets," Mr. Chilton said at a hearing last month in Washington. "There have been fraudulent efforts to persuade and deviously control that price."
A day after Mr. Chilton made his comments, two silver traders filed separate lawsuits in Manhattan federal court against two banking giants, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC Holdings. They accused the banks of conspiring to suppress prices of silver futures on the Commodity Exchange division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, beginning in the spring of 2008. A third suit, this one charging actions in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, was filed this week.
In the relatively thinly traded silver futures markets, a handful of large banks and financial firms dominate trading. In March 2008 when JPMorgan acquired the foundering Bear Stearns, Bear Stearns had made a significant bet that the price of silver would fall, one of the lawsuits says. A few months later, in August, JPMorgan and Bear Stearns's bet against the market totaled about 25 percent of the annual world mining production of silver, the lawsuit states.
The lawsuits say that JPMorgan and HSBC used their dominant positions in the market to manipulate silver prices.
Starting last spring as the two banks cut back on their activities in the silver market, the prices of silver futures increased about 50 percent "even though no fundamental changes in supply or demand for silver, including industrial demand, have occurred during this time period," one lawsuit states.
A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuits. HSBC officials did not return a telephone call for comment.
The investigation comes at a time when individual investors are increasingly interested in investing in commodities, following the lead of hedge fund giants like John A. Paulson and George Soros.
Given the uncertain outlook for the economy, many investors have sought safety in precious metals like gold. Silver, copper, wheat and oil have also gained amid concern that new efforts to spur growth -- including the $600 billion in new Treasury bond purchases announced by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday -- could eventually ignite inflation.
Now, as many are making millions legitimately as gold and silver streak to record highs, others are falling foul of frauds in the darker underbelly of the commodities boom.
The C.F.T.C. filed 57 enforcement actions in the 12 months ended in September, 14 percent more than in the period a year earlier. And the pace shows no signs of slowing. On Wednesday, the agency took enforcement actions against five different groups or individuals, including accusing three individuals of running a $28 million Ponzi scheme in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
A senior enforcement official said the commission was working more closely with other law enforcement agencies. Its success in securing convictions has shown that commodities fraud is a crime, encouraging other investors to come forward with their complaints, he said.
The increase in investigations also reflects a shakeout in Ponzi schemes during the financial crisis. Several of the successful cases over the last year came to light during the 2008 crisis.
The agency is also now looking harder for these schemes. It saw a big increase in enforcement actions in the early 2000s, but the number declined in the following years as commodities fell out of fashion and the agency cut back its staff.
Now the commission is expanding under Mr. Gensler. Its reach has recently grown to overseeing foreign exchange dealers, and it will share a large part of the burden of the new financial regulation, including new responsibilities for the swaps market. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the agency new authority to fight manipulation in the swaps market, as well as new powers against disruptive practices in the swaps and futures markets.
Mr. Gensler, who was one of the strongest proponents for moving over-the-counter derivatives onto public exchanges, estimates that his agency will need an additional 400 employees, taking staff levels from 688 now to 1,100 over the next two years. "Markets work best when they are transparent and they have an effective cop on the beat," he said.
Another sign of the change in attitude at the agency is that it hired David Meister, a former securities fraud prosecutor in New York, to run the agency's enforcement division. Since 2008, the division has been overseen by acting directors.

Abstract: Growth in the 16-country euro zone has allowed the central bank to effectively tighten monetary policy by gradually withdrawing the low-interest loans it provided to banks that were short of cash. Some economists warned that another round of government debt purchases, or quantitative easing, by the Federal Reserve could prove to be a roadblock for Europe's recovery by lifting the euro and the pound against the dollar and pushing up commodity prices.

Full text: LONDON -- With the economic recovery showing some resilience in Europe, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank left their main interest rates at record lows on Thursday.
The Bank of England decided against any new stimulus measures for Britain, a day after the Federal Reserve moved to buy an additional $600 billion in government bonds to strengthen the United States economy. The British bank left its bond purchasing program at $:200 billion, or $322 billion, and its main interest rate at 0.5 percent.
And the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, indicated at a news conference Thursday in Frankfurt that the Fed's move would not force the bank to change its monetary strategy, adding that the current rate at 1 percent was "appropriate."
Unlike the United States, Europe continues to experience some growth momentum. While the American economy has stumbled amid uncertainty about the housing market, and as consumers remain reluctant to spend, relatively strong growth in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, more than made up for weaker growth in countries like Spain and Ireland. Germany mainly benefited from rising demand for its exports, made more attractive by a drop in the euro.
Mr. Trichet said that a "positive underlying momentum," helped by continued demand for Europe's exports, "remains in place" for the euro zone. Still he said that, despite the encouraging developments, "uncertainties are remaining." He mentioned the "re-emergence of tensions in financial markets" and possible increases in the prices of oil and other commodities.
Growth in the 16-country euro zone has allowed the central bank to effectively tighten monetary policy by gradually withdrawing the low-interest loans it provided to banks that were short of cash.
Some economists warned that another round of government debt purchases, or quantitative easing, by the Federal Reserve could prove to be a roadblock for Europe's recovery by lifting the euro and the pound against the dollar and pushing up commodity prices.
Mr. Trichet said Thursday that he had no reason to believe that the United States was "playing the strategy of a weak dollar."
But Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital in London, said that "the E.C.B.'s task is clearly complicated considerably by the Fed's action."
"It could push up global asset prices and commodities," which could fuel inflation, and "the E.C.B. is likely to be more concerned that the Fed could end up pushing the dollar down too far at this stage," Mr. Callow said.
The Bank of England considered expanding purchases of government debt last month, but positive economic data released since then eased pressure for it to act.
The services sector, including banks and airlines, and manufacturing reported unexpected growth in October, and growth of Britain's gross domestic product beat economists' forecasts in the third quarter.
The Bank of England would find it "hard to justify further purchases without some evidence," Jens Larsen, chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets in London and a former Bank of England official, said.
"The rebound has been pretty robust and inflation has surprised us on the upside," he said. "At the same time there are clearly some big risks facing the economy. Quantitative easing is not off the table."
The main risk for Britain's sustained recovery is the government's austerity program, which is expected to affect consumers beginning early next year. An increase in sales tax combined with deep cuts in government spending, including the elimination of an estimated 490,000 jobs, might slow the recovery despite the recent encouraging signs.
Signs that consumers hold back on spending because of job uncertainty have already been seen. Sales at Next, one of the biggest clothing retailers in Britain, fell in the third quarter, and the company expects the last three months of the year to be more difficult. Last month, house prices fell the most since January 2009, as buyers postponed investments and more property came to the market.
Many economists expect Bank of England policy makers to postpone any decision on more stimulus until next year, when the impact of the largest spending cuts since World War II becomes clearer. Britain's opposition Labour Party has warned that the private sector might not be able to fill the gap and that spending cuts that are too extensive risk a recession.
At the same time, inflation remains well above the Bank of England's target of 2 percent, making it harder for policy makers to argue for pumping more capital into the economy. But many economists expect interest rates to remain unchanged for at least six months, and the Bank of England has said that it expected inflation to drop by 2012.
The European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the euro zone, has left its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent since May 2009.

Full text: MUMBAI, India (AP) -- India's benchmark Sensex index closed at a record high Thursday, after the Federal Reserve's decision to buy $600 billion in government bonds to shore up the United States recovery drove a surge of foreign investment into fast-growing India.
The Sensex closed up 2.1 percent, at 20,893.6 points, topping a January 2008 closing high of 20,873.33, according to Bombay Stock Exchange data. The index touched an intraday high of 20,917.0, 290 points shy of its record intraday high on Jan. 10, 2008.
"It's the Fed's quantitative easing," said Nandan Chakraborty, managing director of institutional equity research at Mumbai's Enam Securities. "It's great for India."
Mr. Chakraborty said the Fed's announcement, against a backdrop of slow growth and near zero interest rates in the developed world, would continue to bolster emerging market stocks, commodities and the rupee. A rising rupee will help India's importers, like engineering, infrastructure and telecom companies, but will hurt its software services exporters, like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, which get more than half their revenue from North America.
On Thursday, foreign investors poured $635.9 million into Indian equities and debt, bringing the year-to-date total to a record $36.3 billion, according to the securities regulator.
India's central bank has been less concerned about the flood of foreign investment -- and its export-bruising impact on the rupee -- than other emerging Asian economies because India must finance a growing current-account deficit and an ambitious $9 billion government divestment program.
The central bank has warned that it will intervene if capital flows become disruptive.
India also suffers from higher consumer price inflation than any other major world economy, which makes the Reserve Bank of India more tolerant of the rupee's rise. The bank seems more concerned about the damage to export competitiveness from inflation than rupee appreciation.
Coal India touched a high of 344.75 rupees ($7.80) on the Bombay Stock Exchange before settling at 342.35 rupees compared with an offering price of 245 rupees a share.
The government sold 10 percent of its stake in Coal India, which controls about 80 percent of the nation's coal market, raising $3.4 billion in India's largest initial offering ever.
Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India and Tata Motors all closed up 3 percent or more.

Abstract: [...] of which comparison is more apt, the Fed's decision on Wednesday to renew a no-holds-barred effort to nudge the recovery by lowering long-term interest rates was a notable display of Mr. Bernanke's determination to act at a time when the effectiveness of both monetary policy, which he controls, and fiscal policy, which he does not, is under debate. In an op-ed article published Thursday in The Washington Post, Mr. Bernanke described the "body blow" that the financial crisis dealt the world economy two years ago, and said the Fed's actions -- lowering short-term interest rates to nearly zero and then buying $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury debt -- "helped end the economic free fall."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- By placing a $600 billion bet on the Federal Reserve's ability to encourage the recovery, Ben S. Bernanke is gingerly trying to avoid the mistakes of Japan, where deflation has stymied growth. But the antideficit Republicans who seized control of the House on Tuesday draw cautionary lessons from a different country: debt-stricken Greece.
Regardless of which comparison is more apt, the Fed's decision on Wednesday to renew a no-holds-barred effort to nudge the recovery by lowering long-term interest rates was a notable display of Mr. Bernanke's determination to act at a time when the effectiveness of both monetary policy, which he controls, and fiscal policy, which he does not, is under debate.
The impact of the Fed's decision to embark on a new round of debt-buying rippled through world markets on Thursday. Stocks in Asia and Europe were up, as was the Dow Jones industrial average, which surged nearly 2 percent. But as Treasury yields fell, along with the dollar, officials from emerging markets expressed alarm about the prospect of a wave of foreign capital crashing on their shores in search of higher returns.
That unwelcome flood of cash has already pushed up their currencies, and the new Fed action is certain to be a topic of contention when President Obama and other leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers gather in Seoul, South Korea on Thursday of next week for a two-day summit meeting.
But Mr. Bernanke has by now made it clear that his top priority was to get the American economy going again, even at the risk of unsettling the nation's trading partners. His decision to act -- a culmination of months of debate within the Fed -- occurred against the backdrop of political gridlock at home, and despite a conservative resurgence more concerned about Greek-style debt than Japanese-style stagnation.
In an op-ed article published Thursday in The Washington Post, Mr. Bernanke described the "body blow" that the financial crisis dealt the world economy two years ago, and said the Fed's actions -- lowering short-term interest rates to nearly zero and then buying $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury debt -- "helped end the economic free fall."
He described the Fed's experience with quantitative easing, the strategy of buying assets to lower long-term rates, in optimistic terms. "This approach eased financial conditions in the past and, so far, looks to be effective again," Mr. Bernanke wrote, predicting lower mortgage rates, cheaper corporate borrowing and higher stock prices that would encourage consumer confidence. "Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion," Mr. Bernanke predicted.
He said the economic fix "will take time and the combined efforts of many parties, including the central bank, Congress, the administration, regulators and the private sector."
However, Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, said that without additional government spending to match the Fed's loose monetary policy, the economic frailty was bound to persist.
"Virtually everything on the fiscal policy side will be off the table in the deadlocked partisan world we face in 2011 and 2012," he said. "This greatly increases the probability of a Japanese-style lost decade that would span the decade 2007-17."
Mr. Bernanke has said that the economy needs continued fiscal support from Congress, as long as it is paired with a longer-range plan to rein in deficits and stabilize public debt levels.
But his appeals for fiscal help have been muted.
"The chances of getting some stimulus from fiscal policy are close to zero," said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor. "I think Bernanke is well aware of that, so he probably feels that there is little use in belaboring the point."
Perry G. Mehrling, an economist at Barnard College, said Mr. Bernanke was being careful not to overstep the Fed's role. "Probably he would prefer fiscal easing over quantitative easing, but that decision is ultimately a political one," he said.
Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economist who is chairman of the committee that determines the start and end dates of recessions, said it would be "very wise" for Mr. Bernanke to keep out of the fiscal policy debates.
"He should stick to what he controls -- Fed policy, broadly conceived," Mr. Hall said. "Ben has his hands full with enlarged powers to keep banks under control and to manage his big portfolio."
That portfolio -- a $2.3 trillion balance sheet that has already more than doubled -- is about to grow even more.
Along with $600 billion in Treasury securities to be purchased by the end of June, the Fed is continuing an earlier effort, begun in August, to use mortgage-related proceeds to buy government securities.
In a research note, Jan Hatzius, the chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, predicted that the program "will grow significantly beyond the initial $600 billion."
If his forecasts of 10 percent unemployment and a further decline in core inflation to around 0.5 percent by late 2011 prove correct, the Fed could continue buying Treasuries into 2012 for a total of around $2 trillion, Mr. Hatzius wrote.
Most business economists expect the Fed to start tightening monetary policy, by raising interest rates, in 2012, but Mr. Hatzius said that tightening might not begin "until 2015 or later."
Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the sole dissenter from the Fed's decision, believes such a delay would be a mistake. In a phone interview, he said the fears of Japanese-style deflation were overblown.
"High inflation or strong deflation, like we had in the Depression, is of course abhorrent," he said. "But we can't use the fact that we had this negative event, the Depression, to say we can't have any deflation. I'm not any more afraid of very modest deflation than I am of very modest inflation."
Mr. Hoenig said the Fed erred after the 2001 recession by holding interest rates low for too long, which he views as having contributed to the housing bubble. The Fed is at risk of repeating that mistake, he said.
But at the moment the Fed seems to be paying more heed to people like Kazuo Ueda, an economist at the University of Tokyo.
In a conference organized by the Boston Fed in October 1999, Mr. Ueda warned that fighting deflation when short-term rates are at zero "will be a lot more painful than you can possibly imagine."
In a reprise of that conference last month, the Boston Fed's president, Eric S. Rosengren, called that prediction "accurate and prophetic."
Mr. Ueda, looking back on the past decade, took little satisfaction from that praise. "Despite the adoption of various unconventional, nontraditional monetary policy measures, we are still in deflation," he told a crowd that included numerous Fed officials. "So in a sense, we failed to stop it."

A More Aggressive Response After Months of Holding Back

Full text: For much of the last year, there were three basic camps on what the Federal Reserve should be doing.
One focused on the risks of the Fed's taking more action to help the economy. This camp -- known as the hawks, because of their vigilance against inflation -- worried that the Fed could be sowing the seeds of future inflation and that any further action might cause global investors to panic.
Another camp -- the doves -- argued instead that the Fed had not done enough: inflation remained near zero, and unemployment near a 30-year high.
In the middle were Ben Bernanke and other top Fed officials, who struggled to make up their minds about who was correct. For months, they came down closer to the hawks and did little to help the economy. On Wednesday, they effectively acknowledged that they had made the wrong choice.
The risks of inaction have turned out to be the real problem.
The recovery has not been as strong as the Fed forecast. Businesses became more cautious about hiring after the European debt crisis in the spring. State governments began cutting workers around the same time, and the flow of federal stimulus money began to slow. Since May, the economy has lost 400,000 jobs.
Now -- six months later, with Congress unlikely to spend more -- the Fed is getting more aggressive. (And, yes, the idea that the doves are the advocates for aggression is indeed a bit odd.) Having long ago reduced its benchmark short-term interest rate to zero, the Fed will again begin buying bonds, as it did last year, to reduce long-term interest rates, like those on mortgages. Lower rates typically lead to more borrowing and spending by households and businesses.
Of course, the risks of taking action have not gone away. The new policy could eventually cause inflation to spike. All else equal, a policy that encourages more spending will cause prices to rise. And if investors begin to think that a dollar tomorrow will be worth much less than one today, they may refuse to lend money at low interest rates, undercutting the whole point of the bond purchases. Separately, the Fed, like any bond buyer, could end up losing money on the purchases, worsening the federal budget deficit.
What's striking about the last six months, however, is how much more accurate the doves' diagnosis of the economy has looked than the hawks'.
Early this year, for example, Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed and probably the most prominent hawk, gave a speech in Washington warning about the risks of an overheated economy and inflation. Mr. Hoenig suggested that the kind of severe inflation that the United States experienced in the 1970s or even that Germany did in the 1920s was a real possibility.
When he gave the speech, annual inflation was 2.7 percent. Today, it's 1.1 percent.
The doves, on the other hand, pointed out that recoveries from financial crises tended to be weak because consumers and businesses were slow to resume spending. Around the world over the last century, the typical crisis caused the jobless rate to rise for almost five years, according to research by the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. By that timetable, the unemployment rate would rise for a year and a half more.
Perhaps the clearest case for more action came from within the Fed itself. In June, an economist at the San Francisco Fed published a report analyzing how aggressive monetary policy should be, based on past policy and on the current levels of unemployment and inflation.
As a benchmark, it looked at the Fed's effective interest rate, taking into account the actual short-term rate as well as any bond purchases to reduce long-term rates. Because the short-term rate was zero and the Fed bought bonds in 2009, the report judged the effective interest rate to be below zero -- about negative 2 percent.
And what should the effective rate have been, based on the economy's condition? Negative 5 percent, the analysis concluded. In other words, the Fed wasn't buying enough bonds.
All the while, global investors have continued to show no signs of panicking. If anything, as the economy weakened over the summer, investors became more willing to lend money to the United States, viewing its economy as a safer bet than most others.
After the Fed's announcement on Wednesday, many of the hawks who warned about inflation earlier this year repeated those warnings anew. The Cato Institute, citing a former vice president of the Dallas Fed, said the new program would "sink" the economy. Mr. Hoenig provided the lone vote inside the Fed against the bond purchases.
It's always possible that the critics are correct and that, this time, inflation really is just around the corner. But there is still no good evidence of it.
Some economists are optimistic that it has finally found the right balance. Manoj Pradhan, a global economist at Morgan Stanley, pointed out that bond purchase programs lifted growth in Europe and the United States last year -- and a broadly similar approach also helped end the Great Depression. "There are no guarantees," Mr. Pradhan said, "but the historical precedents certainly suggest it will work."
Others, though, wonder if the program is both too late and too little. "I'm a little disappointed," said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist who has strongly argued for more action. The announced pace of bond purchases appears somewhat slower than Fed officials had recently been signaling, Mr. Gagnon added, which may explain why interest rates on 30-year bonds actually rose after the Fed announcement.
One thing seems undeniable: the Fed's task is harder than it would have been six months ago. Businesses and consumers may now wonder if any new signs of recovery are another false dawn. And although Mr. Bernanke quietly credits the stimulus program last year with being a big help, more stimulus spending seems very unlikely now.
Unfortunately, in monetary policy, as in many other things, there are no do-overs.

Full text: The following is the full text of the statement released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September confirms that the pace of recovery in output and employment continues to be slow. Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Housing starts continue to be depressed. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low, relative to levels that the committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. Although the committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been disappointingly slow.
To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the committee decided today to expand its holdings of securities. The committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. In addition, the committee intends to purchase a further $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011, a pace of about $75 billion per month. The committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
The committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.
The committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate.
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A. Duke; Sandra Pianalto; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S. Rosengren; Daniel K. Tarullo; Kevin M. Warsh; and Janet L. Yellen.
Voting against the policy was Thomas M. Hoenig. Mr. Hoenig believed the risks of additional securities purchases outweighed the benefits. Mr. Hoenig also was concerned that this continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future financial imbalances and, over time, would cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations that could destabilize the economy.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In its latest move to help the economy, the Federal Reserve is about to restart its monetary printing press -- or rather, the electronic equivalent.
The Fed announced Wednesday that it intended to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities through June. It also signaled that it could make more purchases after that if unemployment remained too high and inflation too low.
The Fed is prohibited from directly lending to the Treasury Department, which issues government debt. So the Fed buys government securities on the open market from "primary dealers," a network of 18 institutions, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, that constantly trade in such securities, both for their own accounts and on behalf of clients, including other financial institutions around the world.
While monetary policy is set at the Fed's headquarters here, it is carried out in Lower Manhattan, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which buys and sells Treasury securities and other assets on the Fed's behalf.
An adage among economists is that "the Fed creates reserves and banks create money."
In typical recessions, the Fed pumps money into the economy by buying assets like government bonds and creating an equivalent amount in liabilities -- reserve deposits that commercial banks keep at the Fed. Those deposits, currently over $1 trillion, along with currency in circulation, now $961.4 billion, make up the monetary base -- in essence, the raw material from which money is created and made available to consumers and businesses.
If banks were to quickly start using the reserves to make loans, the supply of money, currently $8.7 trillion by one estimate, could grow rapidly and lead to inflation even as the amount of reserves remained constant. The supply of money includes not just currency, but also things like bank deposits, savings accounts and money market funds.
For now, that seems highly unlikely. Banks say there is not much demand for loans, though some business owners say credit is too difficult to obtain.
Because current conditions are so dire, the Fed is now not only expanding liquidity but also focusing its purchases on Treasury securities -- from bills maturing in 18 months to bonds maturing in 30 years -- that have an average maturity of five to six years. Those purchases should drive up the prices of these securities (because there will be more demand) and consequently push down medium and longer term rates (because bond yields move inversely with prices).
The Fed bought $1.7 trillion in assets from December 2008 to March 2010. As of last week, the Fed held $834 billion of Treasury securities and nearly $1.1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet.
But the volume of mortgage-backed securities on the Fed's balance sheet is gradually shrinking as mortgage loans are paid off early (usually because they are refinanced) or reach maturity.
To prevent such shrinking, which would have the undesired effect of contracting the Fed's balance sheet, the Fed announced in August that it would reinvest the proceeds from the mortgage-related holdings in Treasury securities -- about $35 billion a month. The Fed said Wednesday that it would continue those reinvestments through at least June.
Economic theory holds that unemployment is currently so high, and inflation so low, that the Fed should lower short-term interest rates. But those rates have been near zero since December 2008.
By some estimates, the Fed would have to buy as much as $5 trillion in Treasury securities to simulate the effects of lowering short-term rates as much as they should be lowered. But an amount that large is seen as unrealistic; it would sharply devalue the dollar and could unmoor inflation expectations and cause long-term rates to rise -- the opposite of what the Fed wants. Fed officials believe the $600 billion action announced Wednesday will be similar to lowering the benchmark Federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points.
The Fed can buy only so much debt. Among other constraints, it does not control how much debt the Treasury issues, and there are only so many securities available in the open markets. In addition, the Fed has not allowed itself to own more than 35 percent of the outstanding amount of any particular security.
On Wednesday, the New York Fed said that it was "temporarily relaxing" the 35 percent limit to give itself flexibility but said it would exceed the threshold "only in modest increments."

Abstract: The Republicans regained control of the House for the first time in four years in part by attacking the stimulus plan -- begun by the Bush administration and accelerated by President Obama -- as a symbol of government spinning out of control, contributing to a dangerously escalating national debt. In a sign of its willingness to do even more, the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy arm, left open the possibility of even more purchases beyond June, saying it would "adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, getting ahead of the battles that will dominate national politics over the next two years, moved Wednesday to jolt the economy into recovery with a bold but risky plan to pump $600 billion into the banking system.
A day earlier, Republicans swept to a majority in the House on an antideficit platform, virtually guaranteeing that they would clash with the Obama administration over the best way to nurture a fragile recovery.
The action was the second time in a year that the Fed had ventured into new territory as it struggles to push down long-term interest rates to encourage borrowing and economic growth. In a statement, the Fed said it was acting because the recovery was "disappointingly slow," and it left the door open to even more purchases of government securities next year.
The Fed is an independent body, its policy decisions separated from the political pressures of the day. But it acted with a clear understanding that the United States, like many other Western countries, seems to have taken off the table many of the options governments traditionally use to give their economies a kick, particularly deficit spending.
The Republicans regained control of the House for the first time in four years in part by attacking the stimulus plan -- begun by the Bush administration and accelerated by President Obama -- as a symbol of government spinning out of control, contributing to a dangerously escalating national debt.
This political reality has left Washington increasingly reliant on the Fed to take action, though its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said the Fed cannot fix the problem alone.
But in stepping in so aggressively, the Fed is taking risks. The action not only expands the Fed's huge portfolio of Treasury bonds, it makes it a target of a Congress whose new members include some who are hostile to the Fed's independent role.
On Wall Street, analysts said the move appeared to be a balancing act that met expectations and stock prices rose.
Ordinarily the Fed's main tool for spurring economic growth is to lower short-term interest rates. But those rates are already near zero. With no more room to go, it has to find another route to stimulate demand.
That route is to buy government bonds, which increases demand for them and raises their prices, pushing long-term interest rates down. "Easier financial conditions will promote economic growth," Mr. Bernanke predicted in an essay for Thursday's Washington Post.
Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the outgoing chairman of the House Republican Conference, said shortly after the announcement that the Fed was overstepping its bounds. "Diluting the value of the dollar by continually increasing the supply of money poses an incalculable risk," he said. "Instead, Congress needs to embrace progrowth fiscal policies to stimulate our economy rather than masking our fundamental problems by artificially creating inflation."
In making that argument, Mr. Pence and his allies are replaying a dispute that permeated Washington in the mid-1930s, when the economy was crawling out of the Great Depression. Conservative Democrats pushed Franklin D. Roosevelt to cut back on spending, and argued for tight monetary policy. Many economists argue that the result was a second downturn just before the outbreak of World War II, but others say the conditions today differ in so many ways that the comparison is misleading.
While the Fed step was telegraphed to the markets in recent weeks, most experts had expected $300 billion to $500 billion in purchases of Treasury debt. Still, the pace -- $75 billion a month for eight months -- disappointed some investors.
The Fed said it would also continue an earlier program, announced in August, of using proceeds from its mortgage-related holdings to buy additional Treasury debt, at a rate of about $35 billion a month, or $250 billion to $300 billion by the end of June.
So in total, the Fed will buy $850 billion to $900 billion, just about doubling the amount of Treasury debt it currently holds.
If the Fed's bet is right, lower long-term rates should ripple through the markets, pushing down rates for mortgages and corporate bonds. That could encourage homeowners to refinance into cheaper mortgages, though it would not help the millions of Americans facing foreclosure. It could push businesses to make investments instead of sitting on piles of cash.
In a sign of its willingness to do even more, the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy arm, left open the possibility of even more purchases beyond June, saying it would "adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability."
Only one committee member dissented, for reasons that are similar to the complaints that some Republicans are likely to raise. Thomas M. Hoenig, an economist who is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said he believed the decision could create more risk for the financial system by enticing too much borrowing.
There are other risks, as well. The actions are likely to further drive down the dollar. That could worsen trade and exchange-rate tensions that have threatened to unravel cooperation among the world's biggest economies.
Moreover, the Fed is exposing itself to the risk that the assets it has acquired could shrivel in value when interest rates eventually rise. That could reduce the amount of money the central bank turns over to the Treasury each year, and expose the Fed, already vulnerable for its failure to prevent the 2008 financial crisis, to even more criticism.
On Wednesday, the standoff between the parties was on display as the two sides argued over tax cuts and the desirability of government investment to create jobs.
It was this impending gridlock that might have pushed Mr. Bernanke to move, said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor. "Bernanke has said that fiscal stimulus, accommodated by the Fed, is the single most powerful action the government can take for lowering the unemployment rate, when short-term rates are already at zero," Mr. Meyer said. "He has nearly pleaded with Congress for fiscal stimulus, but he can't count on it."
But Leonard J. Santow, an economic consultant, said he feared that the Fed was reacting to one mistake -- the failure of fiscal policy -- by adding another. "The main problem is on the fiscal side, and there is nothing wrong with the Fed chairman making budget recommendations and admitting there is not a great deal left for monetary policy to achieve when it comes to stimulating the economy," he said.
One of the main questions raised by the Fed's action was whether it had waited too long. While economists disagree on that, the Fed's announcement completed a U-turn. Earlier, speculation was that the Fed would gradually raise interest rates and tighten the supply of credit, as it would normally do after a recession..
But this downturn and its painful aftermath have been anything but normal. Markets were set back in the spring by the European debt crisis. By late summer, as continuing high unemployment, slow growth and low inflation became clear, Mr. Bernanke became convinced that the Fed needed to act again.

Abstract: [...] the pressure is now on the Obama administration to cut a deal on taxes before the end of the year, even though there is no consensus on where to cut spending, analysts said.

Full text: As Republicans prepare to assert new authority in Congress, America's overseas trading partners worry that Washington's political upheaval may pose fresh challenges to the global economy.
Despite pledges to curb government spending and the huge United States budget deficit, Republicans are expected to address anxiety over unemployment and flagging growth by pushing for an extension of the income tax cuts passed during the presidency of George W. Bush -- a move that would add to the deficit and, by extension, further weaken the dollar.
"The rest of the world, including Asia, is looking at the United States and seeing no real effective policy measures in bringing the economy back on track," said Bart van Ark, the chief economist at the Conference Board, which measures American economic indicators. "That is making the U.S. lose its legitimacy in the global economic community as a leader in terms of providing solutions."
Maintaining taxes at their current relatively low rates could help lift consumer spending in the United States, while a cheaper dollar would make American exports more competitive. But analysts said those fixes would be only temporary and would be unlikely to reverse the waning of the United States economic clout, as emerging markets -- led by China, India and Brazil -- outpace industrial nations as drivers of global growth.
A weaker dollar, by making European exports priced in euros more expensive, may also damp efforts at an export-led recovery in European countries like Britain, Greece and Ireland that have adopted harsh austerity measures to rein in their excessive debts.
After the Obama administration pushed through changes to health care and to the financial system, voters signaled that they wanted reductions in federal spending. Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican set to become the next speaker of the House, reiterated a pledge after the elections to reduce the size of government, create jobs and change the way Congress does business.
That is no easy task. Voters also want to keep expensive entitlements and are hoping Republicans can reverse cuts to the Medicare program and extend the Bush tax cuts set to expire at year's end.
Those moves, if enacted into law, would make it harder -- not easier -- to keep Republican commitments to curb the national debt and the budget deficit. From the perspective of those outside the United States, "Republican claims to fiscal probity are a little difficult to buy into," said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. "What they're advocating would probably increase the deficit rather than effect the dramatic reduction which they claim they want to bring about."
There is also the risk that Congress, divided between Republican control of the House and a fragile Democratic majority in the Senate, will fall into gridlock. That would leave the task of supporting a United States economic recovery almost entirely to the Federal Reserve.
The Federal Reserve expressed concern Wednesday about a "slow" recovery and weak inflation in announcing plans to buy $600 billion in Treasury bonds, a process known as quantitative easing, aimed at stimulating growth and reducing unemployment. That move seems certain to further weaken the dollar, but its ability to stimulate the American economy remains to be seen.
It is also unclear just how much the lame-duck Congress still controlled by Democrats can push through before the new Republican-led House takes over. But the pressure is now on the Obama administration to cut a deal on taxes before the end of the year, even though there is no consensus on where to cut spending, analysts said.
Moreover, if the current income tax rates are extended for the wealthy as well as for middle class taxpayers for the next few years, the action could add an estimated one to two percentage points to the deficit as a share of overall economic activity, according to Klaus Gunter Deutsch, a senior economist with Deutsche Bank Research in Berlin.
If Washington ends up adding to the deficit rather than reducing it, one result could be a further weakening of the dollar against the euro, the pound and other floating currencies.
The dollar has slumped more than 15 percent against the euro alone since June on concerns about the federal fiscal situation and on expectations that the Federal Reserve would announce new efforts on Wednesday to pump more money into the weakened economy.
In times of full employment, a bigger deficit can be offset by tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates, said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "But now, with rates at zero and the Fed about to embark on a quantitative expansion, that will mean a bigger deficit and a weaker dollar, and that's the set of issues that would set off the biggest alarm overseas -- especially among the Europeans."
Even if the dollar continues to weaken, helping American exporters, most political and economic experts expect lawmakers from both parties to keep up pressure on China to strengthen its currency. That would make it even harder for the Obama administration to support a more cooperative approach toward bringing the Chinese currency more into line with that country's strong economic fundamentals.
American manufacturers have long complained that China is keeping its currency, the renminbi, artificially weak, making it harder for United States exports to compete in the global marketplace.
The currency issue is part of a larger skirmish over trade, said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
"If the Chinese were to give a little, that would buy a lot of time on trade policy," he said. "Asians especially are extremely nervous about seeing the U.S. slap a tariff on Chinese imports or some such aggressive approach, not only because Republicans are taking the House, but because the economy is very weak."
Until the dust settles, however, "unpredictability is the word of the day," Mr. Rogoff added. "We have a powerful and volatile new force," he added. The "rest of world will be worried about that."

Full text: DECISION POINTS
By George W. Bush
Illustrated. 497 pages. Crown Publishers. $35.
George W. Bush's memoir "Decision Points" could well have been titled "The Decider Decides": it's an autobiography focused around "the most consequential decisions" of his presidency and his personal life from his decision to give up drinking in 1986 to his decision to invade Iraq in 2003 to his decisions regarding the financial crisis of 2008. It is a book that is part spin, part mea culpa, part family scrapbook, part self-conscious effort to (re)shape his political legacy.
A dogged work of reminiscence by an author not naturally given to introspection, "Decision Points" lacks the emotional precision and evocative power of his wife Laura's book, "Spoken From the Heart," published earlier this year, though it's a considerably more substantial effort than Mr. Bush's perfunctory 1999 campaign memoir, "A Charge to Keep."
Certainly it's the most casual of presidential memoirs: how many works in the genre start as a sort of evangelical, 12-step confession ("Could I continue to grow closer to the Almighty or was alcohol becoming my god?"), include some off-color jokes and conclude with an aside about dog poop?
The prose in "Decision Points" is utilitarian, the language staccato and blunt. Mr. Bush's default mode is regular-guy-politico, and his moods vacillate mainly among the defensive and the diligent -- frat boy irreverence, religious certainty and almost willful obliviousness.
The Bush who emerges from these pages will be highly familiar to readers of Bob Woodward's quartet of books on the administration or Robert Draper's 2007 "Dead Certain": a president fond of big ideas and small comforts (like a daily run); a chief executive known for his optimism, stubbornness and lack of curiosity. At the same time "Decision Points" -- sometimes deliberately, sometimes inadvertently -- gives the reader an uncanny sense of how personality and the fateful interplay of personalities within an administration can affect policies that affect the world.
Along the way Mr. Bush acknowledges various mistakes. On his administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina he says, "As leader of the federal government, I should have recognized the deficiencies sooner and intervened faster." On Iraq he says he regrets that "we did not respond more quickly or aggressively when the security situation started to deteriorate after Saddam's regime fell," that "cutting troop levels too quickly was the most important failure of execution in the war," and that he still has "a sickening feeling every time" he thinks about the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
Still, he insists that "removing Saddam from power was the right decision": "for all the difficulties that followed, America is safer without a homicidal dictator pursuing WMD and supporting terror at the heart of the Middle East."
In the course of this book Mr. Bush hops and skips over many serious issues raised by critics, including the cherry-picking of intelligence by administration hawks in the walk up to the invasion of Iraq; the push for aggrandized executive power by the White House in the war on terror; and the ignoring of advice from the military and the State Department on troop levels and postwar planning.
The former president does not address the role that the decision to divert resources to the war in Iraq played in the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, instead arguing that "the multilateral approach to rebuilding, hailed by so many in the international community, was failing." He tries to play down the problems of Guantanamo Bay, writing that detainees were given "a personal copy of the Koran" and access to a library among whose popular offerings was "an Arabic translation of 'Harry Potter.' " And he asserts that "had I not authorized waterboarding on senior al Qaeda leaders, I would have had to accept a greater risk that the country would be attacked."
Mr. Bush does not grapple with the role that his deregulatory, free market policies played in fueling the economic meltdown at the end of his second term. Nor does he take any responsibility for the fierce partisanship and political divisiveness that took root in his administration.
Several times in the book Mr. Bush uses the term "blindsided" to describe his feelings about a crisis that his advisers and cabinet seem not to have filled him in on. He says he felt "blindsided" over Abu Ghraib: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld "had told me the military was investigating reports of abuse at the prison, but I had no idea how graphic or grotesque the photos would be," he writes. "The first time I saw them was the day they were aired on '60 Minutes II.' "
Mr. Bush says he told advisers he "never wanted to be blindsided like that again," after a showdown between the White House and the Justice Department over a secret surveillance program. And he says "we were blindsided by a financial crisis that had been more than a decade in the making": his focus, he writes, "had been kitchen-table economic issues like jobs and inflation. I assumed any major credit troubles would have been flagged by the regulators or rating agencies."
Many books by reporters and former insiders have delineated the Bush administration as given to improvisatory decision making, wary of the traditional processes of policy review and inclined to favor loyalty over expertise. In "The Assassins' Gate," the New Yorker writer George Packer quoted Richard N. Haass, a former director of policy planning in the State Department, saying that a real weighing of pros and cons about the Iraq war never took place. And in "The Next Attack" Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon wrote that planning efforts for the war were often not coordinated, that many officials were working out of channels, "issuing directives without ever having their plans scrubbed in the kind of tedious, iterative process that the government typically uses to make sure it is ready for any contingency."
In many respects this volume ratifies such observations. Mr. Bush, famous for being a "gut player," writes that in assessing candidates for administration jobs, he looked at "character and personality" in an effort to create a culture that "fostered loyalty -- not to me, but to the country and our ideals." In 2006 an aide told him that "several people had spontaneously used the same unflattering term to describe the White House structure," he writes. "It started with 'cluster' and ended with four more letters." And he writes about "squabbling within the national security team" and how "nothing worked" to cool these turf battles, including his own talks with Mr. Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Vice President Dick Cheney and the national security adviser Condoleezza Rice.
Despite the eagerness of Mr. Bush to portray himself as a forward-leaning, resolute leader, this volume sometimes has the effect of showing the former president as both oddly passive and strangely cavalier.
For instance Mr. Bush writes about the failures to contain deteriorating security conditions in Iraq, continuing fights between the Pentagon and State Department, and his frustrations with Mr. Rumsfeld. But while he says that he had "planned to make a change at Defense as part of a new national security team" in 2004, he adds that he simply couldn't come up with a replacement for Mr. Rumsfeld. He considered and rejected the ideas of putting Ms. Rice or Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in the job, and was rebuffed by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who "was enjoying his retirement."
The situation in Iraq continued to deteriorate over the next two years with more and more soldiers and civilians getting killed and wounded, and in the spring of 2006 a group of retired generals spoke out against Mr. Rumsfeld. "While I was still considering a personnel change," Mr. Bush writes, "there was no way I was going to let a group of retired officers bully me into pushing out the civilian secretary of defense. It would have looked like a military coup and would have set a disastrous precedent."
And so Mr. Rumsfeld stayed on in the job until an old friend of Mr. Bush's from high school and college (whom he had appointed to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board) suggested Robert M. Gates as a replacement. "Why hadn't I thought of Bob?" Mr. Bush wonders.
Mr. Bush's portrait of Mr. Cheney reaffirms many reporters' depiction of him as a steamrolling force for military intervention in Iraq. And Mr. Bush's description of the momentum toward war echoes that found in Mr. Woodward's book "Plan of Attack," in which there was building pressure for action: Mr. Bush says that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, told him "the uncertainty was hurting the economy," and that Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia told him "the Middle East wanted a decision."
But while many books like "The Bushes" by Peter Schweizer and Rochelle Schweizer and "The Bush Tragedy" by Jacob Weisberg have emphasized the differences between George W. Bush and his father -- and No. 43's need to differentiate himself from No. 41 -- the younger Bush takes pains in this memoir to underscore his closeness with his dad.
He says that during family Christmas celebrations in 2002 his father said: "You know how tough war is, son, and you've got to try everything you can to avoid war," and then added, "But if the man won't comply, you don't have any other choice." Later, after Bush the Younger gave the order to go to war, he says that his father sent him a note saying: "You are doing the right thing. Your decision, just made, is the toughest decision you've had to make up until now. But you made it with strength and with compassion."
Mr. Bush says he left office satisfied that "I had always done what I believed was right." Since then, he says, he's comfortably settled back into ordinary life. Shortly after moving to Dallas, he writes, he took his dog Barney for an early morning walk: "Barney spotted our neighbor's lawn, where he promptly took care of his business. There I was, the former president of the United States, with a plastic bag on my hand, picking up that which I had been dodging for the past eight years."

Full text: Australia and India raised interest rates on Tuesday, highlighting the contrast between the Asia-Pacific region's rapid growth and the fragile recovery in other parts of the world.
Central banks in the United States, Europe and Japan are still propping up their economies with very low interest rates. In fact, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce additional pump-priming measures Wednesday. But many of their counterparts in developing Asia and in fast-growing Australia have been gradually nudging up the cost of borrowing this year.
Few economists had expected Australia to raise its main cash rate to 4.75 percent. It was the latest in a series of increases that began in October 2009 and now total 1.75 percentage points.
India, too, has pushed up rates gradually this year. On Tuesday it added another quarter of a percentage point to the repurchase rate for short-term lending, making it 6.25 percent, and to the reverse repurchase rate for short-term borrowing, now at 5.25 percent.
The Reserve Bank of India cited rising inflation pressures, which have become the major concern for policy makers throughout the region, as the reason for the latest rate increase.
Unencumbered by the debt levels that are still haunting their counterparts in the West, most Asian economies are set to enjoy robust growth this year. Increasing trade within Asia, including with China, also has helped offset the declining consumer demand in the United States.
China, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia have started to increase borrowing costs, as have Brazil and other emerging market economies, though the cumulative moves by Australia and India have been among the most aggressive to date.
Australia in particular has benefited from China's enormous appetite for its natural resources, which shows few signs of abating.
"Most commodity prices have firmed, after a fall earlier in the year," Glenn Stevens, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said in a statement after the rate decision on Tuesday. "The prices most important to Australia remain at very high levels, with the result that the terms of trade are at their highest since the early 1950s."
India, meanwhile, has powered ahead thanks to the steadily increasing wealth of its huge population, while its economy has been less reliant on overseas trade.
For many such countries, rising food and energy prices, rather than slow growth, have emerged as the main worry for policy makers.
India's economy, for example, grew at a rate of 8.8 percent in the three months that ended in June, compared with the period a year earlier. But the wholesale price index for September, the last one released before the central bank's meeting, had risen at an annual rate of 8.62 percent, from 8.5 percent in August.
In Australia, inflation has remained fairly muted in recent months but still represents a worry for the future.
"The moderation in inflation that has been under way for the past two years is probably now close to ending," Mr. Stevens said.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's unexpected decision to stage another rate increase prompted the Australian dollar to jump on Tuesday. The currency has been steadily appreciating for months; by late afternoon in Sydney, one Australian dollar was worth almost exactly $1.
Other currencies in the region have been undergoing similar rises in recent months, as investors from slower-growing economies have sent cash into emerging markets in search of higher returns.

Full text: Shares on Wall Street closed mixed on Monday ahead of midterm elections and expected changes in monetary policy.
The market opened higher on momentum from new statistics on the economy, including upbeat reports on manufacturing, construction and corporate earnings. But indexes declined as investors turned jittery before Tuesday's elections and a meeting of the Fed policy makers.
Investors will also get a look at the latest readings on car sales and retail sales later this week.
And on Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release the unemployment report for October, which will be closely watched for any improvements to the 9.6 percent unemployment rate and any increases in private payrolls.
That rounds out what some analysts are calling one of the biggest weeks in some time for market-moving events.
"It's hard to remember a period so fraught with event risk, as midterm elections, an F.O.M.C. meeting, and a payrolls report are likely to add to volatility," said Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 6.13 points to 11,124.62. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 1.12 points to 1,184.38, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 2.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,504.84.
On Wednesday the Fed is expected to announce a new round of bond purchases to help stimulate the American economy.
The Fed's F.O.M.C., or Federal Open Market Committee, meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected to announce a program to buy Treasury securities, and perhaps other investments, to pump more money into the financial system. Estimates as to the size of the purchases have ranged from $500 billion to $2 trillion.Many analysts expect the purchases to be mostly of two- and 10-year Treasuries, although Goldman Sachs predicted last week that the Fed might include 30-year bonds in its program.
The Fed is hoping to provide further stimulus to the economy during a period of extremely low inflation and nearly double-digit unemployment. Investors are also hoping the generally upbeat third-quarter corporate earnings will translate into a rise in hiring, and then the hoped-for increase in consumer spending.
While there has been some improvement in manufacturing and business confidence, Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy at Glenmede, noted that there was still a "missing link" between the corporate profits and their translation into jobs.
Stanley A. Nabi, chief strategist for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said that third-quarter corporate earnings had been "far more solid than had been expected" and that the outlook for the next few quarters looked generally upbeat. News about a troubled bond insurance company, the Ambac Financial Group, was among issues "casting a shadow on the markets," said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
Ambac said in a filing on Monday that it was in talks with creditors about a bankruptcy plan.
The company, which said it had $1.6 billion in debt as of June 30, said it was in talks about filing a prepackaged bankruptcy, a speedier route that has the backing of a majority of creditors, by the end of the year.
In the United States, manufacturing activity came in better than expected for October. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 56.9 points last month, from 54.4 in September, exceeding the forecasts of economists, who had expected a decline in activity to 54. New orders rose to 58.9, from 51.1 in September, reversing three months of declines.
The employment component of the index rose to 57.7 points from 56.5 in September.
While the numbers are a bright spot for the manufacturing sector, economists noted that there were still substantial challenges ahead for consumers struggling under debt and uncertainty in the jobs market.
"Much will depend on the consumer, and we feel that the headwinds for consumer spending remain too brisk to expect substantial help on this front over the near to medium term," Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said in a research note.
The Commerce Department also reported Monday that construction spending in Septemberrose to $801.7 billion, a seasonally adjusted, annualized figure that was above the revised August estimate of $797.5 billion. Spending on private construction in September was flat, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $482 billion, about the same as in August.
Interest rates were up slightly. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 7/32, to 100 and the interest rate rose to 2.62 percent, from 2.60 percent late Friday.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is all but certain to move to spur the nation's sputtering recovery this Wednesday, but most economists say it is unlikely to have a big impact on employment and growth.
Overruling objections from a handful of inflation-fearing dissidents, the Fed's policy-setting committee, which begins a two-day meeting on Tuesday, is expected to resume quantitative easing, a strategy of buying Treasury securities to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. The hope is that new action by the Fed will make a deflationary spiral of falling prices less likely, and make it somewhat easier for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend.
In theory, the Fed could print trillions of dollars to achieve its aim, but it is far more likely to start with a smaller amount -- perhaps a few hundred billion -- and gradually buy more bonds as conditions warrant.
That open-ended, conditional approach would be a departure from the Fed's first, $1.7 trillion round of debt purchases, which lasted about 15 months and ended in March.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, seems to be under no illusion about the potency of the new purchases, having declared in August that "central bankers alone cannot solve the world's economic problems."
With inflation well below the Fed's unofficial target of 2 percent, unemployment stuck at nearly 10 percent, and gross domestic product growing at a lethargic rate, Mr. Bernanke has evidently concluded that doing nothing is not an option.
Mr. Bernanke has long argued that a central bank, having lowered short-term rates to zero, as the Fed did in December 2008, still has tools to prevent an economy from slipping into deflation; he is now following that advice.
But economists seem to be in broad agreement that no matter the magnitude of the Fed's actions this week, the economy will remain challenged for some time.
"There is a substantial chance that the U.S. economy is headed into a lost decade, similar to what Japan has experienced in the past 15 years, possibly with zero inflation instead of actual deflation," said Robert J. Gordon, of Northwestern University, who serves on the committee that determines the start and end dates of recessions.
"But the consequences for the U.S. population will be much more severe than in Japan," he added, "because of our higher unemployment rate, our lack of a social safety net, our system that ties medical insurance to employment instead of making it a right of citizenship, our greater inequality and our higher level of poverty."
Guillermo A. Calvo, of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, gave a similar assessment.
"The central problem in the U.S. is the breakdown of the credit channel, especially credit for small firms and for working capital," he said. "Buying long-term Treasury bonds amounts to directing credit toward a sector that has no need for it."
The Fed's actions, Mr. Calvo said, will mostly be felt abroad. Quantitative easing is likely to push down the value of the dollar and send even more money flowing into the faster-growing economies of Asia and Latin America, where interest rates are higher and inflation is a greater worry than in the sluggish economies of North America and Western Europe.
Mr. Calvo said the result could be heightened tensions over currency and trade and pressure on emerging-market countries to curb the flow of capital into their economies.
The Fed has clearly taken steps to address both sources of anxiety, domestic and foreign, and to fully prepare the markets for its next move.
On Aug. 10, the Fed took a baby step toward additional monetary expansion, deciding to use proceeds from its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities to buy two- to 10-year Treasury securities. In an Aug. 27 speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Bernanke emphasized the need to analyze both the costs and the benefits of action, but made it clear he was prepared to move if needed.
At the Fed's most recent policy meeting, on Sept. 21, the committee said it was "prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed," and in a speech in Boston on Oct. 15, Mr. Bernanke said "there would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case for further action."
The actions have already had an effect. Since Aug. 10, long-term interest rates have fallen, stock prices have risen and expectations of inflation have crept upward.
At a closed-door gathering of central bankers from the Group of 20 economic powers in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Oct. 22 and 23, Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure his peers, some of whom expressed alarm about the effect of Fed action on the dollar.
In response, Mr. Bernanke cited the imperative of supporting domestic growth and the role American consumer demand plays in sustaining the worldwide recovery, according to people who attended the meeting.
What the chairman has not managed -- or necessarily tried -- to do, however, is to quell the dissenting voices within the Fed who say additional action is a grave mistake.
The most prominent dissenter, Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, has argued that new quantitative easing could lead to imbalances and volatility, undermine the Fed's independence and unmoor inflation expectations. In his most pointed language to date, he recently called the plan a "dangerous gamble" and a "bargain with the devil."
Other regional Fed presidents -- Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia, Richard W. Fisher of Dallas and Jeffrey M. Lacker of Richmond -- also oppose additional bond purchases. But there is substantial support for more monetary stimulus from William C. Dudley of New York, Eric S. Rosengren of Boston, Charles L. Evans of Chicago and, recently, Dennis P. Lockhart of Atlanta.
Speculation about "hawks" (whose priority is fighting inflation) and "doves" (who put relatively greater emphasis on reducing unemployment) is a well-established game among Fed watchers.
But it is Mr. Bernanke's opinion that ultimately matters. He has studiously avoided wading into fiscal controversies, but it seems clear that the gridlock over taxes and spending, and the virulence of the rhetoric going into the Tuesday elections, has deprived the central bank of the support fiscal policy can play in bolstering the recovery.
"Fiscal measures would accomplish something; they directly support spending and therefore G.D.P.," said James K. Galbraith, an economist at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin. "Quantitative easing will accomplish nothing beyond flooding the banks with cash which they will use, if at all, for speculating rather than lending."
But Scott E. Pardee, an economist at Middlebury College, said Mr. Bernanke was correct to do all he could. "As long as unemployment is so high, and the housing market is not standing on its own two feet yet, the Fed has no other choice," he said.

Full text: Everyone on Wall Street is waiting on the Fed.
Whatever the outcome of Tuesday's midterm elections, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to take new steps this week to spur the nation's snail-paced recovery.
Indeed, investors are counting on the Fed. The stock market has been rallying since August in part on expectations that the central bank would embark on another round of what is known as quantitative easing. Equities and gold are up. The dollar and market interest rates are down.
Because official rates are already near zero, the Fed is expected to buy United States Treasury securities, and perhaps other investments, to pump more money into the financial system.
The question is how aggressively the Fed will act, and whether it can actually make a difference to the broader economy.
Analysts expect the central bank to buy securities on the open market in an effort to the unlock the flow of credit to the economy. Estimates of the size of the program range from $500 billion to $2 trillion. As usual, analysts will parse every word of any statement from the Fed. An announcement is expected Wednesday.
But while investors have been staking out their positions for weeks, the announcement -- and the potential ramifications -- remain fraught with uncertainty. Given that the Fed's news is expected to land as Wall Street is digesting Tuesday's election results, analysts are bracing for a volatile day, particularly if the Fed underwhelms investors.
"There is not going to be a headline-grabbing number," said David Semmens, the United States economist for Standard Chartered Bank. "It will cause the market significant concern."
At the end of 2008, the Fed began a program to buy $1.7 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The purchases were announced in advance and came in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Now investors are waiting for a second round of such quantitative easing. Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has hinted that the central bank is likely to act.
"The market is the world's largest forecasting mechanism," said Stephen Wood, senior portfolio strategist for Russell Investments. "Markets tend to move before things happen."
There have been plenty of signals to feed expectations. The annual inflation rate is running below 2 percent, while unemployment remains stubbornly high. The latest estimated gross domestic product pace of 2 percent for the third quarter and the core personal consumption expenditures rise of 0.8 percent, released on Friday, only added to what many saw as further justification for action.
If the government spends $500 billion to $2 trillion on quantitative easing, the securities purchases are expected to be spread out over months. The Fed might spend $80 billion to $100 billion a month, constantly assessing whether the program is having the desired effect.
"The Fed loves ranges because that gives them more options," said Mr. Wood. "They will set expectations but not tip their hands. It will want to keep its powder dry, its options open."
But with quantitative easing already expected by the markets, such an announcement could disappoint investors. Treasuries and equities could modestly sell off in the short term if the amount is less than expected.
"If there is any sign of a more cautious approach, or a smaller scale, you could see long-term bond rates rise, the dollar strengthen and perhaps stocks selling off a bit," said Adrian Cronje, the chief investment officer of Balentine. "I think that is probably the area that is most likely to cause any correction to recent trends -- if there is a sense that the Federal Reserve might back off."
Many analysts expect the second round of purchases to be mostly of two- and 10-year Treasuries, although the Goldman Sachs Group recently predicted that the Fed might include 30-year Treasury bonds in its program. Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, said his firm expected $100 billion in monthly asset purchases, with the final amount contingent on future inflation.
The dollar has been weakening against major currencies in recent weeks on the expectation of the Fed's move. Gold, already at a high above $1,300 an ounce, could benefit even more if investors read an aggressive move by the Fed as a sign that inflation may eventually accelerate, said Jeffrey Nichols, senior economic adviser to Rosland Capital, in a recent speech.
The stock market treaded water on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing virtually unchanged at 11,118.49. The broad stock market has gained about 9.5 percent since Sept. 1.
"People have taken positions, and they are waiting to see what the trifecta is," said Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's, referring to this week's elections, Fed meeting and monthly national unemployment report. The question, he said, is whether the Fed's expected action produces a yawn or a sigh of relief.

Abstract: Japan has remained trapped in this spiral despite the equivalent of trillions of dollars in stimulus spending, more than a decade of near-zero interest rates and even unconventional steps by the central bank similar to those now contemplated by Mr. Bernanke, like purchasing corporate and government bonds to increase the money supply.

Full text: TOKYO -- In the annals of economic policy blunders, the one in which Hiroshi Kato played a hand in early 1997 ranks among the biggest in recent Japanese history.
Mr. Kato led a government advisory committee that concluded that the economy, which was then finally starting to rebound from the collapse of its 1980s land and stock bubbles, was healthy enough to raise the national consumption tax to 5 percent from 3 percent.
Aimed at reducing deficits, the tax increase instead quickly snuffed out the fragile recovery, pushing Japan to the brink of a financial meltdown and thrusting the nation deeper into the economic morass from which it has yet to emerge even today.
"Our sins are large," Mr. Kato, now president of Kaetsu University in Tokyo, said ruefully. "I hope the rest of the world can learn from this mistake."
And indeed, the lessons of Japan's long stagnation are well known to American policy makers like the treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, who have studied Japan's policy missteps.
In 1999, Mr. Bernanke, then an academic, tartly criticized Japanese officials for mishandling their 1990s financial crisis, saying Japan's plight was "self induced." Partly because of that expertise, American policy makers have long been confident, even during the darkest days of the current financial crisis, that the United States could avoid the fate of Japan and its two lost decades.
But now, with growing signs that the United States might be a lot closer to a Japan-style slump than previously thought, that confidence is waning.
In the United States, a robust recovery remains stubbornly elusive, and Mr. Bernanke is said to be ready to take new, unconventional steps to increase the money supply in order to maintain the uncertain growth of the past year. He is also said by close associates to favor further fiscal measures to stimulate the economy. But in the current political climate, with Republicans poised to make strong gains in the midterm elections while preaching fiscal austerity, the prospect of more federal stimulus spending seems remote, and it is unclear if monetary policy alone will be enough to restore healthy growth.
Partly as a result, some economists now predict that it could take years or even a decade for the American economy to regain the levels of employment and vigor achieved before the 2008 crisis. The growing political pressure for cuts in federal spending -- along with plunging consumer confidence and companies that seem more intent on cutting costs and hoarding cash than investing in new growth -- have led economists to talk of the United States' entering a grim new era of austerity.
That is very close to what befell Japan two decades ago, when the seemingly invincible Asian economic juggernaut fell into a deep rut of chronically anemic demand and corrosive price declines, known as deflation, from which it has never fully recovered. The parallels are so striking, and unsettling, that economists are now taking a renewed look at Japan for insights on how the United States can avoid the deflation trap.
"There has been a political and intellectual arrogance in the United States that it won't happen to us," said Adam S. Posen, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "We shouldn't be so smug. You can get there without being Japan."
Indeed, the financial crisis that crippled Japan's once high-flying economy appears an eerie precursor of the one that struck much of the global economy in 2008. In Japan, a huge expansion in credit created twin price bubbles in the land and stock markets that, when they burst in the late 1980s and early 1990s, left banks and other companies drowning in failed real estate investments.
But perhaps the most alarming part is what came next: a collapse in demand that pushed prices and ultimately wages into a self-reinforcing deflationary spiral, which made already stingy individuals and businesses even less willing to use money, because falling prices meant that cash itself gained in value.
Japan has remained trapped in this spiral despite the equivalent of trillions of dollars in stimulus spending, more than a decade of near-zero interest rates and even unconventional steps by the central bank similar to those now contemplated by Mr. Bernanke, like purchasing corporate and government bonds to increase the money supply.
Despite the strong parallels, there are still reasons to think the United States can escape what has been called Japanification.
The United States and Japan are very different, culturally and politically, and Japan faces a host of unique problems that have sapped its vitality, like a rapidly aging populace that has created generational tensions, and the closing of its doors to immigration and the youthful labor and fresh ideas that can bring. Economists say the dynamic United States economy has shaken off seemingly intractable slumps before, as in the frightening recession of 1980-82, when conditions and the prospects for recovery seemed, for a while, every bit as bleak as they do now.
However, some warn that the United States could still get it wrong, especially if the midterm elections produced a sharply divided political landscape.
"The danger is if the U.S. plunges into policy paralysis just like Japan in the 1990s," said Shumpei Takemori, an economist at Keio University in Tokyo. "Ideological divides and political divides can make bold policy action impossible."
In fact, some economists warn that the United States may be deeper into Japan-style stagnation than is widely realized. Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, estimates that the total output of the American economy this year will be no higher by his estimate than it was in 2006.
"We've already lost half a decade," said Mr. Johnson, now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In addition, economists say, Japan had one advantage the United States does not. With its high savings rate, the government could borrow from its own domestic sources at minuscule rates to finance trillions of dollars in stimulus projects. By contrast, the United States has to sell its government bonds to foreign investors, who are likely to demand higher interest rates as its national debt grows.
Leading Japanese economists also said their nation's many failures -- like the 1997 tax increase -- yielded one crucial lesson on combating the aftereffects of a financial panic: the need to avoid policy flip-flops.
"The lesson is that there is a proper sequence for pulling a nation out of a financial crisis," said Heizo Takenaka, an economist who was the architect of the successful cleanup of Japan's banking system in the early 2000s. "First, you restore growth before worrying about deficits."
However, Mr. Takenaka acknowledged that while the banking problems have been largely fixed, Japan has yet to come up with a strategy for restoring growth, which he says is the only way to end deflation.
This month, Japan's central bank pushed its benchmark rate back down to zero. However, central bankers here argue that it is not enough just to loosen monetary policy when a lack of borrowers and new investment means there is no demand for money to start with. And this points to another feature of Japan's experience that may already be visible in the United States: the paradox of a stagnant economy that is awash in cash.
This occurs when companies and individuals stop spending and banks stop lending for fear that anemic growth and rising bankruptcies will result in defaults. This is particularly apparent in regional economies outside Tokyo, which remains relatively vibrant.
In a healthy economy, banks typically lend out more money than they have on deposit. But in Osaka, Japan's third largest city and commercial hub, nearly two decades of hoarding of cash created the unusual situation in 2002 of deposits at all the city's banks surpassing their outstanding volume of loans. Since 1997, the total amount of loans by the city's banks has fallen by a third, to $530 billion, while deposits have risen by 20 percent, to $767 billion.
"Deflation has made everyone very conservative and eager to hold cash," said Hiroshi Tanaka, a senior director at Osaka Shinkin Bank. "We have too much cash and nowhere to invest it all."
This has created distortions in Japan's economy. One is a sharp drop in the number of times cash changes hands in normal business and spending transactions. This so-called velocity of money has dropped to about a third the level of the United States, according to figures from the Mizuho Research Institute in Tokyo.
Another distortion is Japan's so-called dresser savings -- the piles of cash that individuals keep at home for fear that their banks may also go bankrupt. These stashes are estimated to total about $370 billion, according to Akira Otani, a researcher at the Bank of Japan.
Economists see early signs that the United States is heading down the same path. Recent data shows a surge in savings rates to 6.4 percent in June from less than 1 percent in 2005, reflecting consumers' reluctance to spend, and continued disinflation.
The picture is not entirely bleak for the United States, where the constant drive to innovate can produce bursts of growth that few economists or anyone else can see coming. While Japan was seen once as an unstoppable powerhouse, the picture was altered by wave after wave of technological innovation in the United States -- the personal computer industry, then the Internet and Web businesses, smart phones, and mobile software. That dynamism, economists note, is often wrenching. But it also means that investment dollars and people shift more rapidly to new opportunities. In Japan, though, such painful payroll cuts and corporate deaths were postponed for years.
The American approach to economic adjustment is "shock treatment," said Edward J. Lincoln, director of the Center for Japan-U.S. Business and Economic Studies at New York University, while "Japan favors stability and the corporate socialization of the pain."
"Deep down inside, as an American," Mr. Lincoln said, "I tend to think that the United States' approach makes for a healthier economy in the long run."

Abstract: There have been fledgling signs of growth: home sales and chain store sales are up a bit; a swelling equities market has raised consumer confidence a few notches; and jobless claims fell noticeably last week, albeit they are still quite high.

Full text: The United States economy is a bit like a jetliner short on fuel these days, waiting for something to give it the oomph needed for takeoff.
The latest report offers not much by way of immediate relief, as the Commerce Department estimated on Friday that the nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter. That growth rate, matching the forecast, is the barest tick up from the second quarter.
The weak report comes at a parlous time for President Obama and the Democrats, who are only days away from crucial midterm elections that are widely expected to turn out well for Republican challengers. High unemployment and soaring foreclosure numbers in the Midwest and West already made this a particularly difficult election for Democrats.
The nation's tens of millions of unemployed -- many now jobless for close to two years -- present a political and social challenge. Two percent growth, almost all economists agree, cannot produce nearly the demand needed to reduce the nation's 9.6 percent unemployment rate.
The trade gap remained wide in the latest quarter, as imports again surged and outpaced exports, and that too could portend ill for job creation.
"It's the expected G.D.P. number, which is mostly bad news for the economy," Josh Bivens, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, said of the gross domestic product. "The growth rate is just nowhere near enough to put downward pressure on unemployment."
In the fourth quarter of last year, the picture was far brighter, when growth rose 5 percent as the country emerged from recession. But conditions have weakened considerably.
Demand is crucial to re-igniting the economy, and demand remained flaccid in the third quarter, although there were hints of increased consumer spending. Income growth, adjusted for inflation and taxes, slowed, rising at an annualized rate of 0.5 percent in the third quarter after increasing at a 4.4 percent rate in the second. And at the other end, prices excluding food and energy increased at a rate of 0.6 percent compared with 0.8 percent in the second quarter.
In recent weeks, the economy has presented two faces, which is reflected in the latest G.D.P. numbers. There have been fledgling signs of growth: home sales and chain store sales are up a bit; a swelling equities market has raised consumer confidence a few notches; and jobless claims fell noticeably last week, albeit they are still quite high.
At the same time, the steroidal effect of the federal stimulus spending is fading (although more than a trace of that spending is in the growth in large highway and bridge projects found in this quarter's output numbers). City and state governments have shed tens of thousands of employees, and states face a sea of red ink as they look at next year's budgets.
"Two percent growth is not great, but it beats zero," said Steve Blitz, chief economist with ITG investment research. "But the picture of the economy remains troubling. There is certainly no sign that a normal cyclical upturn is taking hold. The consumer is still underemployed and overindebted, so the normal push won't be there."
Economic bulls are more difficult to locate now than in the spring, when the economy appeared to gain traction. But Bernard Baumohl, chief economist for the Economic Outlook Group, has lost none of his elan, saying that he spots signs of strength.
"The main message from this report is that the economic recovery is gathering fresh momentum from the sector that matters most to this recovery: consumer spending," he said in an e-mail. "Slowly but surely, worries over job security and future income growth have subsided and households appear to be more at ease about shopping."
Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity, remains the great unknown. Americans have shed some debt, which is good, but in an unsightly fashion, which is not so good. They have defaulted on credit card debt or have lost their homes to foreclosure in record numbers. Their spending rose this quarter and personal savings was estimated at 5.5 percent of income, compared with 5.9 percent in the second quarter.
But price and income growth remains too weak to banish entirely the fear that deflation might yet take hold.
The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco touched on this prospect two weeks ago in a gloomy forecast, noting that no sector of the private economy stands ready to drive a robust recovery. "The economic recovery is proceeding at a very slow pace and has lost momentum since the spring," said Mary C. Daly, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. "Japan's experience beginning in the early 1990s underscores the risk of getting into a long period of sustained disinflation."
The midterm elections on Tuesday further complicate the economic picture. After the votes are counted, and certainty edges aside uncertainty, American business may start spending a bit more and banks may start lending to small businesses. But few economists are willing to turn that wish into a forecast, not the least because political deadlock looms as a possibility.
David Rosenberg, economist for the Canadian investment firm Gluskin Sheff and Associates, does not put a lot of faith in consumers pulling the economy out of its ditch. "Barring divine intervention, it's not clear how the economy keeps expanding in the coming year," he said. "You'll have federal spending declining and more and more folks falling out of emergency unemployment benefits."
The eyes of some economists and political leaders have turned to overseas economies, in hopes that sturdier boats might come to America's aid. The Chinese economy has cooled a touch, but its engine remains impressive. And the European economies have shown signs of stabilizing of late, with Germany as a potential driver of growth (its unemployment recently reached an 18-year low). All of this could bode well for America's export sector.
But the facts in Friday's report offered little immediate help. Imports in the third quarter once again grew faster than exports, leaving a significant trade gap. Imports grew at an annual rate of 17.4 percent, compared with a 5.0 percent gain for exports.
Government spending began to slow, as the effects of the stimulus spending wear off. That was reflected in the unemployment numbers for September. Companies added 64,000 jobs last month, but over all, the economy lost 95,000 nonfarm jobs, the result of a 159,000 decline in government jobs. Local governments were particularly hard hit.
"The problematic factor is that consumers remain fundamentally insolvent or worried about becoming so, and too many of the major banks are zombies uninterested in commercial or industrial lending," said James K. Galbraith, an economics professor at the University of Texas.
Still, each quarter that the economy does not lapse back into recession adds incrementally to consumer and business confidence, and perhaps eventually to growth. The great immediate test, economists say, is the fourth quarter. The hope is that small signs of market strength in recent weeks may coalesce into something that looks more like an actual recovery, and that by next spring unemployment may stabilize and the gloom may lift.
"As with money, there is a power of compounding the economy," Mr. Blitz said. "The longer you go with 2 percent growth, you begin to push up against constraints, and the more the fear of unemployment ebbs, the more chance there is that people will begin to feel confident. It's a very slow burn."

Full text: Albany needs sweeping change. Gerrymandering and anything-goes campaign finance "rules" guarantee that most of the hacks will be back next year, working to ensure nothing ever changes.
If there is any doubt, consider this grim fact: some of the Legislature's worst enablers -- starting with the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver -- have no opponent on the ballot. Other members of Albany's hall of shame -- Senators John Sampson, Malcolm Smith, Ruben Diaz Sr. and Carl Kruger -- barely have challengers.
The only good news is that there are a few competitive races and a few candidates committed to changing the system who are worth electing. Here is our list:
STATE SENATE DISTRICT 11 IN QUEENS Tony Avella, a former city councilman and an independent-minded Democrat, is challenging Frank Padavan, a Republican who has served in the State Senate for almost 40 years.
Mr. Avella supports women's rights and promises to champion ethics reform. He is particularly interested in ending gerrymandering, citing his district as a poster child for the way electoral borders are drawn to ensure incumbents keep getting elected. Although Mr. Padavan has fought admirably against casinos and human trafficking, he has also fought against women's reproductive rights, same-sex marriage and immigration reform.
We support Tony Avella, the Democrat, in District 11.
STATE SENATE DISTRICT 37 IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY The Republican candidate, Bob Cohen, dares to name United States Senator Jacob Javits -- a voice of thoughtful moderation -- as his hero. He is challenging Senator Suzi Oppenheimer, a Democrat, who has held the seat for 26 years.
A real estate executive and political newcomer, Mr. Cohen has promised to focus on straightening out the mess of a state budget. He wants to cap state spending with adjustments for inflation, set long-term targets for Medicaid and schools, and eliminate "all V.I.P. tax credits to politically connected insiders." Mr. Cohen says he wants to work with both sides of the aisle, a revolutionary idea, especially in this polarized year. Senator Oppenheimer is a person of integrity, but she has too little to show for her years in Albany.
We support Bob Cohen, the Republican, in District 37.
STATE SENATE DISTRICT 40 IN WESTCHESTER, PUTNAM AND DUTCHESS COUNTIES This is a rare open seat to replace Senator Vincent Leibell, a Republican who is retiring. Michael Kaplowitz, a Democratic legislator in Westchester County, has promising ideas about property tax relief for seniors, pension reform for unions and cutting Albany sleaze. His Republican opponent, Assemblyman Greg Ball, has shown that he knows how to fight, but not how to win legislative victories.
We support Democrat Michael Kaplowitz in Dist. 40.
STATE SENATE DISTRICT 41 IN DUTCHESS AND COLUMBIA COUNTIES Didi Barrett, a community activist, is challenging Senator Stephen Saland, a Republican who has been in the Legislature for 30 years, the last 20 in the Senate. Ms. Barrett supports a long list of reforms that Senator Saland has rejected. She promises to push for real ethics reform and real campaign finance reform, including public financing, and to protect women's reproductive rights.
We support Didi Barrett, the Democrat, in District 41.

Full text: Now the government really is selling bonds that deserve the label "certificates of confiscation."
This week the United States Treasury sold bonds for a price that may be greater than the total amount of cash an investor will get from holding the bond to maturity in 2015.
That appears to be a first for this or any other government. When all is done, the Treasury may have managed to borrow money at a negative interest rate. Put another way, buyers of the bonds might have done better if they stuffed the money in their mattresses.
We'll get to the details of the bond later. But first we'll note that buyers of the bonds could make out O.K. if inflation soars. The bonds are inflation-protected. So there is a chance, albeit perhaps a small one, that this will prove to be a really profitable investment.
The same cannot be said for conventional bonds from the Treasury or from high-quality corporate borrowers. There the rates are minuscule, and the upside nonexistent.
Only two months ago, people were shocked to hear that I.B.M. had issued three-year bonds with a coupon of only 1 percent. That rate seems a little high now. In September, Microsoft paid seven-eighths of a percent on similar bonds. Then this month Wal-Mart borrowed at three-quarters of a percent.
If you bought a $1,000 Wal-Mart bond at par when it was issued, you would get a check for $3.75 every six months. Then in three years you get your $1,000 back.
The term "certificate of confiscation" was coined in the late 1970s, when inflation was rising. "If you took the coupon payment, adjusted for inflation and taxes, you had a negative real return," said Leon Cooperman, who may have been the first to use the term. Mr. Cooperman now runs Omega Advisors, a hedge fund manager, but then was a strategist for Goldman Sachs.
By the time the concept became popular, around 1980, Treasury bonds had nominal yields of more than 10 percent and were despised. (To his credit, by then Mr. Cooperman was suggesting such bonds could be good investments.)
When I called Mr. Cooperman this week and told him I wanted to talk about bonds, he immediately brought up the confiscation theme, saying it was truer now than ever.
Incredibly enough, at the auction this week, investors locked in a negative real return of 0.55 percent. This is a bond that comes with a promise the investor will not keep up with inflation.
Here's how this bond will work for the four and a half years until it matures. Every six months, the holder of a $100 bond will get one-quarter of 1 percent of whatever the principal value is at that point. That value will rise, or perhaps fall, with the Consumer Price Index. When the bond matures, in April 2015, the bondholder will get the principal value back.
And how much will the principal value be? The government will use a combination of the C.P.I. figures, before seasonal adjustments, for January and February 2015. If that figure is below 228.65, the investor will get back less than the $105.50 he or she paid for the bond this week. The C.P.I. in September was 218.44, so cumulative inflation of 4.7 percent, or a little over 1 percent a year, is needed for the investor to break even. If the 2015 C.P.I. is higher, there will be a profit.
If we have deflation, as some fear, the buyer does get a bit of a break. He or she will get back $100 even if the C.P.I. has fallen a lot.
This week's auction was a reopening of a Treasury security sold six months ago. Next April, there will be an auction for a newly issued series of bonds. If the market then is around where it is now, that auction will lead to a zero-coupon Treasury, one with no dividend payments at all, and the possibility of capital loss at the end of five years if there is no inflation.
This makes sense if you accept as reasonable the current depressed level of interest rates. Those rates have been driven down by the Federal Reserve as it seeks to stimulate the economy and prevent deflation. A search for safety by investors has also helped, as has China's need to buy and invest dollars to keep the renminbi from appreciating too much.
So the United States borrows at amazingly low rates. Some other countries, among them Germany and Britain, get similar bargains. But Greece, which averted default earlier this year, is still viewed as scary, and its 10-year bonds have double-digit returns.
When inflation was rampant, there was talk of making the dollar worthless. In a certain sense, that is what has happened now. It is not worthless as a currency to buy things, but it has little value for an investor seeking a safe return on money that is being saved for retirement or a child's education. The yield on a one-year Treasury bill is now under a quarter of 1 percent.
Investors who need to earn money but crave the perceived safety of fixed income are being forced to lock up their money for years. This week, Goldman Sachs borrowed $1.3 billion from retail investors by selling notes that will mature in 50 years. The notes pay 6.125 percent, and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
The deal seems remarkable for many reasons. It was little more than two years ago that we learned that a large Wall Street firm can go broke and leave small investors hung out to dry, but now investors desperate for yield are throwing money at Goldman, which set out to borrow $250 million but found lenders eager.
It is a cliche that the most important assets of an investment bank go home every night, but investors are willing to lend money for 50 years. Few if any people working for Goldman now will still be with the firm then; it is quite possible that the chief executive in 2060 has yet to be born.
Imagine, for a moment, that someone guessed in 1960 which Wall Street firm would be prospering in 2010. He or she might have gotten it right, but a lot of wrong guesses would have seemed equally reasonable.
Finally, Goldman has been widely criticized for its actions leading up to the financial crisis, and it paid $550 million to settle fraud charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the issuance of collateralized debt obligations based on mortgage securities. But the government has made it possible for Goldman to borrow on extremely favorable terms.
"It is a gift to the banking system," said Mr. Cooperman, the former Goldman partner, of the prolonged period of superlow interest rates. "The people who did not get us into trouble are being penalized by getting nothing on their savings."
The Fed's moves are justified by the need to support an economy that is suffering through a very slow recovery. But monetary policy is not the only policy available to a government. "The time has come for the government to turn to fiscal policy," Mr. Cooperman said.
But fiscal stimulus has gotten a bad name and is being denounced in the current campaign, as Republicans bemoan budget deficits and demand (vague) spending cuts. It seems unlikely a new Congress will do anything to help the economy. That leaves it to the Fed, and is bad news for those who rely on their savings for income.

Full text: COIMBATORE, India -- As talk of currency battles rumble through the global economy, India has been a reluctant warrior.
The reasons are evident here in Coimbatore, a southern city long known as a capital of India's textile industry, an old-line export trade. Recently, demolition crews razed an abandoned textile mill to make way for the Alliance Mall.
From the ashes of an export industry rises a temple to foreign investment and local consumption. And it is all in keeping with India's approach to a rising currency.
The Indian rupee is soaring -- up 9 percent against the dollar in the last 16 months. That has taken a toll on exports like textiles by making them more expensive on the world market. And the strong rupee poses longer-term threats of overheating the economy.
But instead of fighting currency appreciation, as Brazil and some other countries have done, India has been willing to let the rupee rise -- for now, at least.
India is simply too hungry for the foreign capital that is drawn to the strong rupee and is driving it higher, because that influx of money is helping support this country's approach to developing a modern consumer economy.
The Alliance project, with more than a million square feet of retail space, a hotel, offices and condominiums, is being built by an Indian developer with financing from a British retail company and a South African investment firm.
Meanwhile, the foreign carmakers Volkswagen and Nissan have started their first dealerships, hoping to capitalize on the growing consumer class in this city of about 1.5 million people.
The clear losers of India's currency approach right now are garment makers. From April to August, exports were down 6.4 percent from a year earlier in the $10 billion Indian clothing industry. Although it represents only about 1 percent of the nation's economy, the garment industry is India's largest employer after agriculture.
"All the other countries are protecting their currencies, so why are we not?" said Premal Udani, chairman of India's Apparel Export Promotion Council.
Indian policy makers are eager enough for foreign investment that, for now at least, they are willing to endure the damage a stronger rupee inflicts on exports, especially for lower-value goods like clothes. Exports of other Indian goods and services, like software and pharmaceuticals, have not been as hard hit because they are not as price-sensitive.
India also places a premium on the higher-value jobs that are fueled by foreign investment. Not far from where that old textile mill once stood, the German engineering company Bosch and the American software concern Perot Systems have opened offices in a new technology park.
The influx of capital has helped fuel a nearly 9 percent annual growth rate for India's economy. It has also powered the Indian stock market to near record highs. A big beneficiary of the stock rally has been the government, which is selling shares in state-owned firms like Coal India, the world's largest coal miner.
The government, which has a large budget deficit, plans to raise $9 billion in the current fiscal year from share sales and spend the money on jobs for the rural poor and other welfare programs. A stronger rupee also reduces India's bill for commodities, like oil, that it needs to import.
"If India is to sustain 8 percent growth or 9 percent growth, the only constraint on that can be capital," said Nikhil Chaturvedi, managing director of Prozone, the Indian real estate firm that is building the Alliance Mall development. "Free flow of capital should be allowed in all sectors" of the economy, he said.
Mr. Chaturvedi, whose joint venture partner in the Alliance Mall is the London-based Capital Shopping Centers, said an appreciating rupee must be tolerated as an unpleasant side effect of the flow of foreign capital.
India's willingness to let a rising currency stimulate its consumer economy is what many experts say that another emerging giant, China, should be doing -- not only for the good of China's people but to ease global trade and currency tensions. And yet, while that part of the model might be worth Beijing's emulating, India in turn can only envy the strength of China's export juggernaut.
China, which has been wary of letting its currency rise too much relative to the dollar, has one of the world's largest surpluses in its current account -- the broadest measure of a country's trade and capital flows. India, meanwhile, has the fourth-biggest current-account deficit among the G-20 nations, amounting to 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product.
That places India just behind the United States, which has the third-highest deficit, on a side of the trade ledger no vibrant economy aspires to be.
Over the long term, India needs to pare that deficit and reduce its reliance on foreign capital, which can be fickle. During the recent financial crisis, for example, foreign investors pulled back sharply from India and other emerging markets, helping to temporarily put the brakes on the economy here.
The current-account deficit is partly reflected in the declining fortunes of India's garment exporters.
About 34 miles east of Coimbatore, in the city of Tiruppur, clothing factory owners and workers say the strong rupee is causing them to lose orders to competitors in China, Bangladesh and other countries that peg their currency to the United States dollar and thus are able to offer much lower-priced clothes to Wal-Mart, H&M and other western buyers.
M. Sivasubramaniam, the owner of a textile printing factory in Tiruppur, employs about 70 people -- one-third fewer than a year ago. One recent morning, workers trickled into the factory after a long tea break. Their job was to print several varieties of T-shirts, including one with an image of the cartoon character Bart Simpson kicking a soccer ball.
S. Anand, a print machine operator and the son of a rice farmer, said work was so slow that he was making only about 5,000 rupees ($113) a month, down from 7,000 rupees a year ago when he had the opportunity to work more overtime shifts. But Mr. Anand, who supports a wife and two children, is still better off than many of his co-workers who have lost their jobs.
The industry is trying to compensate by focusing on the domestic market and producing more fashionable clothes that command higher prices. But Mr. Udani of the export council said neither effort would quickly offset the decline in exports of mass-market clothes.
Whatever the Indian government's strategic motives for letting the rupee rise, it also knows the risks of trying to intervene.
In 2007, for instance the country's central bank tried to stem the currency's rise by buying dollars and selling rupees. The bank tried to soak up the rupees by issuing bonds. But economists say that the tactic was not entirely successful and that its currency intervention helped stoke domestic inflation. The benchmark wholesale inflation rate hit 11 percent in mid-2008.
Prices are a big concern again -- wholesale inflation was nearly 9 percent in September -- and policy makers are reluctant to do anything to make it worse, economists say.
Still, there may be limits to how long the government would stand by if a lot more foreign capital floods into the country and the rupee rises significantly higher.
In a recent speech, Duvvuri Subbarao, the central bank's governor, said the bank would intervene in currency markets if capital flows became "lumpy and volatile or if they disrupt the macroeconomic situation."
"Two considerations have guided our policy," he said. "First that, our policy should be as stable as possible without flip-flop moves. Second, our use of controls should be prudent."
Officials could try to balance the need for capital and the concerns of exporters by regulating the flow of money, said Rajiv B. Lall, chief executive of the Infrastructure Development Finance Company in Mumbai.
They could force investors to commit investments to longer-term projects, by making it harder to invest in stock and real estate markets, which tend to attract "hot money" that flows in and out countries quickly as sentiments change.
That would also slow the rise of the rupee, giving exporters time to adapt to a stronger rupee, Mr. Lall said. "I don't think anybody would have problem with the appreciation of the rupee over the long term," Mr. Lall said. The problem is "the volatility and the mismatch between that and the rest of the economy's ability to keep adjusting."

Abstract: At a time when savers complain that they are earning almost no interest from their bank accounts, some investors on Monday bought United States government bonds that effectively had a negative rate of return. The unusual auction on Monday "reflects a condition in the Treasury market that has been in place for months, chiefly that yields on shorter maturities have moved below the inflation rate," Anthony Crescenzi, a senior vice president at the bond giant Pimco, wrote in a research note.

Full text: At a time when savers complain that they are earning almost no interest from their bank accounts, some investors on Monday bought United States government bonds that effectively had a negative rate of return.
Bizarre as it sounds, that is correct. In an auction of a special kind of five-year Treasury bond, investors paid $105.50 for every $100 of bonds the government sold -- agreeing to pay the government for the privilege of lending it money.
The reason is that these types of bonds offer a guaranteed protection against inflation. So, if inflation soars -- as some economists worry might happen, with the government seeking to give the economy a boost by flooding it with money -- the value of the bonds would go up accordingly.
The investors who took part in the $10 billion auction are betting that inflation, now at about 1 percent annually, will rise to a level that more than compensates for the premium they paid.
The unusual auction on Monday "reflects a condition in the Treasury market that has been in place for months, chiefly that yields on shorter maturities have moved below the inflation rate," Anthony Crescenzi, a senior vice president at the bond giant Pimco, wrote in a research note.
Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, said there were about $28 billion worth of bids for the notes. About 40 percent were foreign buyers, 57 percent dealers and the rest were possibly retail investors, he said. The prediction is for a 1.58 percent rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
"It was good demand considering the negative yields," he said. "They are counting on the Fed to be successful in generating inflation."
As strange as all this may seem, these investors were actually going along with conventional market wisdom. Many economists are concerned that if the economy continues to stagnate, there is a danger of deflation, or a decline in prices, that would be difficult to reverse.
Most analysts expect that the Federal Reserve, which has already lowered interest rates to near zero and bought Treasury securities in efforts to reinvigorate the economy, is about to pump even more money into the system. Such a move would probably increase the rate of inflation.
Fed officials have hinted at such action in recent appearances. In a speech in Boston on Oct. 15, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that "there would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case for further action."
The markets interpreted that and other statements as unmistakable signals that the Fed was poised to act at its next meeting, on Nov. 2-3.
Mr. Bernanke couched his argument in terms of the Fed's mandate to keep prices stable and maximize employment. He said that inflation had been running well below the implicit target of about 2 percent and that unemployment, at 9.6 percent, was too high.
Inflation-protected Treasury securities have already been trading at negative yields on the open market for some time, as professional and institutional investors have sought to hedge their portfolios against the risk of inflation. But Monday was the first time since the government began selling these so-called Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities in the 1990s that new ones were sold at a negative yield.
Buyers "believe we have reached the bottom of the inflation cycle and the next move is higher, not lower," said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
A growing aversion to risk has produced all manner of investment oddities in the last two years. At the height of the financial crisis, for example, the yield on ordinary short-term Treasury bonds turned negative for a brief time as people flocked to safe investments.
Even now, big investors are buying gold at levels unseen in decades, to protect against fluctuations in the value of currencies. Small investors are fleeing the stock market in droves, favoring bonds and even cash over equities. Companies have managed to sell bonds that do not pay off for 50 or even 100 years.
The remarkable auction occurred as stock indexes on Wall Street edged higher, buoyed by recent strong corporate earnings and a month-to-month rise in housing sales.
Sales of previously owned houses increased 10 percent in September from August, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.53 million units, above forecasts of 4.30 million, but they were still down 19 percent from September 2009. The National Association of Realtors said about a third of the sales last month were related to foreclosures.
On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.49 points, or 0.28 percent, to 11,164.05. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.54 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,185.62.
The Nasdaq composite index climbed 11.46 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,490.85.
Bond prices fell, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury rising to 2.56 percent from 2.55 percent late Friday.
As equities advanced, the dollar declined over the weekend after promises by the world's 20 biggest economies to avoid a currency war.
It was the latest sign that financial markets are positioning for a rise in inflation. Economists point to the fall in the dollar as a sign of budding inflationary pressures. Another is the recent sharp rise in the price of some assets, including commodities like gold.

Abstract: Moving to shore up the "fragile and uneven" recovery, officials from the world's 20 biggest economies promised Saturday to refrain from weakening their currencies, agreeing to let the markets exert more influence in setting foreign exchange rates.

[...] they pledged to "refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies" -- an effort to calm anxiety over a wave of protectionism in which countries would weaken their currencies to bolster their own exports.

Full text: Moving to shore up the "fragile and uneven" recovery, officials from the world's 20 biggest economies promised Saturday to refrain from weakening their currencies, agreeing to let the markets exert more influence in setting foreign exchange rates.
The officials also decided to give fast-growing countries a greater say at the International Monetary Fund, which monitors nations' fiscal and monetary policies, an acknowledgment that the fund's credibility required more representation from these nations. They also strengthened the I.M.F.'s role in assessing whether G-20 members were meeting their commitments.
The finance ministers and central bankers were at a two-day meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea, and their actions represented another step in the effort to bridge the diverging priorities of the leading economies and ease the strain of simmering disputes.
The intense talks -- built largely around an agenda the Americans brought to the meeting -- yielded more consensus than many officials had expected. In general, the United States refrained from putting more public pressure on China to revalue its currency, preferring instead to emphasize the benefits of reducing trade imbalances.
Seeking to find common ground on currency valuation, officials agreed to "move toward more market-determined exchange rate systems that reflect underlying economic fundamentals." And they pledged to "refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies" -- an effort to calm anxiety over a wave of protectionism in which countries would weaken their currencies to bolster their own exports.
Threats of such a "currency war" have unsettled markets and threatened to hinder a flagging global recovery.
The language adopted Saturday was the strongest yet from the G-20, which operates through consensus and peer pressure but lacks binding authority, following warnings by the United States that rapidly developing countries were trying to keep their currencies from rising, setting off a "damaging cycle" of "competitive nonappreciation."
For their part, the richest countries, like the United States and Britain, both with large deficits, agreed to be "vigilant against excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates."
On the issue of trade, the United States failed to secure support for a numerical limit on the surplus or deficit of the nations' current account balances, the broadest measure of a country's trade and investment. The Americans had proposed that surplus and deficits be reduced to less than 4 percent of gross domestic product by 2015.
Such a deal would have obliged two export giants, China and Germany, to stimulate domestic consumption and rely less on foreign consumers. China in particular would have faced new pressure to let its currency, the renminbi, rise against the dollar.
Instead, G-20 members pledged to "pursue the full range of policies conducive to reducing excessive imbalances."
That language was not as firm as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had sought, but he called the pledge a step forward.
"The most important thing we achieved is agreement on a framework for curbing excess trade imbalances in the future," Mr. Geithner said. On Sunday, he will make a previously unannounced trip to Qingdao, China, where he was to meet with Wang Qishan, the Chinese vice premier for economic issues.
The French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said that Mr. Geithner "probably would have liked specific targets," but Olli Rehn, Europe's economic and monetary affairs commissioner, said that "setting specific numerical targets would have been easily counterproductive."
Germany, Russia and Italy were among the countries that opposed the 4 percent proposal, officials said.
One significant development was the agreement on changes to how the I.M.F. is run. The G-20 agreed to transfer more than 6 percent of voting power within the I.M.F. to "dynamic emerging-market and developing countries" like Brazil and India by the fall of 2012.
"The legitimacy of the I.M.F. is increasing," Pranab Mukherjee, the Indian finance minister, said approvingly.
China will become the fund's third-largest shareholder, behind the United States and Japan but ahead of Germany, France and Britain. Europe agreed to surrender two seats on the 24-member executive board.
As part of a package deal, the G-20 agreed to double the I.M.F.'s quotas, which determine how much each country contributes to -- and may borrow from -- the institution. The quotas presently total about $340 billion.
The G-20 also continued to increase the role of the I.M.F. as a watchdog over its member economies in the hope that it might help arbitrate thorny trade and currency disputes. Officials agreed to empower the I.M.F. to investigate the "persistently large imbalances" and determine "the root causes" of why adjustment had been so hard to achieve.
Like the G-20, the I.M.F. cannot compel members to act, but its findings carry great weight.
Yoon Jeung-hyun, the South Korean finance minister, said the agreement would help remove "uncertainty in the global markets such as the foreign exchange rate issues." He added, "This will put an end to the controversy over foreign exchange rates."
George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, was not quite so optimistic, though he praised the accord, saying "this language calms everything down and gives us a route map for resolving these imbalances."
Not everyone was happy with the Americans. Several officials expressed concerns to Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, that the Fed would pour more money into the economy to stop inflation from falling and to stimulate growth, thus weakening the dollar.
"Excessive, permanent money creation in my opinion is an indirect manipulation of an exchange rate," the German economy minister, Rainer Bruderle, warned, in effect accusing the United States of the same type of currency weakening for which China has been criticized. At a news conference, Mr. Geithner dismissed the anxiety, saying, "The policy of the United States is to support a strong dollar."
Nevertheless, the Fed's policy is sure to come up again next month when world leaders, including President Obama, meet at G-20 talks in Seoul.

Full text: THERE were plenty of worries in the stock market last week -- about an unexpected rise in interest rates in China and the latest fallout from the American housing crisis, just for starters.
Add to the list the global imbalances in capital flows and currency alignments, the feeble economic recovery in the United States and the volcanic rhetoric of partisan midterm election campaigns, and it makes for a gloomy picture.
"The evidence that the sky is falling has been pretty compelling," said Barry Ritholtz, chief executive of FusionIQ, an equity research firm, and proprietor of The Big Picture, a financial blog.
Yet the stock market managed to grind out some gains last week. And even though Mr. Ritholtz believes we are mired in a long-running bear market, his outlook for the next several months is bullish. Like many other strategists, he has found some solace in a Wall Street adage: "Don't fight the Fed."
The Fed, of course, is the Federal Reserve, which has considerable power over the money supply. In a series of speeches, policy statements and transcripts since Aug. 27, its officials have indicated that they are very likely to make their extraordinarily expansive monetary policy even looser.
While there are evidently internal disagreements at the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, its chairman, and several other officials have said that inflation is low enough to pose a risk of deflation, and that unemployment is too high and economic growth too slow.
Congress, meanwhile, isn't likely to approve new legislation to stimulate the economy in the near future, especially if Republicans make big gains on Nov. 2, as is expected. And on the monetary side, short-term interest rates are already near zero. So the Fed appears to be gearing up for further unconventional action -- the launching of a second round of "quantitative easing," or QE2, as it's being called.
While the details aren't clear -- they are expected to entail the purchase of more Treasury securities, and the expansion of available credit in the financial system -- the general outline of Fed policy has seemed evident to market strategists for weeks.
"The Fed is easing," says Ralph Acampora, a veteran market analyst and a partner at Altaira Wealth Management. "When that happens, stocks tend to rise. That's got to count as good news."
Mr. Ritholtz puts it this way: "When the Fed opens its fire hose, you're going to get wet. If you're smart, you get ready for it."
On Sept. 24, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, a hedge fund manager, said on CNBC that the Fed's signals had made him confident that the stock market could not fall far -- and would likely rise over the short run.
Such sentiments are being widely expressed. Gus Sauter, the chief investment strategist at Vanguard, says he is "fairly bullish," and for a number of reasons -- among them a judgment that with corporate earnings on the rise, stock valuations are fair. And he says he is paying respectful attention to the "Don't fight the Fed" mantra.
It also helps, he says, that the stock market has consistently risen after midterm elections. (I've written about stock market patterns and the American political cycle in recent columns.) Mr. Sauter does not advocate market timing, but, he says, "The outlook right now is fairly good."
Similarly, Robbert Van Batenburg, head of equities at Louis Capital Markets, says that Fed easing and the election cycle are propitious for the stock market. Because he believes Congress will be inclined to keep taxes relatively low, dividend-paying stocks should benefit, he says. And he says he expects that in a more inflationary environment, shares in the retail sector should rise.
Still, some nagging problems remain. On the housing front, the recent imbroglio over mass home foreclosures is playing out not only in the courts, but also in the hands of state regulators and federal officials.
Bank of America, the biggest of the nation's banks, ended a brief moratorium on foreclosures last week. But myriad investigations and lawsuits continue throughout the industry. Where will that crisis end?
For investors in financial stocks, the worry centers on the potential for very large write-downs by banks. "I don't really know how to evaluate this," says Edward Yardeni, an independent economist. He wonders whether new problems with mortgage-backed securities could threaten the financial system. "Probably not," he says. "But I'm not sure."
A self-professed market bull, Mr. Yardeni says he believes that the Fed is making it likely that stocks will rise over the short term. But, he says, Fed easing is superfluous and probably dangerous because the business cycle is strong enough to be self-sustaining.
"I'm afraid that QE2 will create a trifecta of asset bubbles" -- in stocks, bonds and commodities, he said.
Bonds have rallied partly because the Fed has helped make yields unusually low. And rising commodity prices, which are generally quoted in dollars, have been correlated with the dollar's decline. That, in turn, is at least partly a consequence of comparatively loose monetary policy.
STILL, Mr. Yardeni says, it is noteworthy that Janet Yellen, in her first speech as Fed vice chairwoman, warned this month of the dangers of "asset bubbles."
"We haven't seen much explicit concern about asset bubbles coming from the Fed in the past," Mr. Yardeni says.
Facing the threat of competitive currency devaluations, finance ministers of the G-20 countries were meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea over the weekend in hopes of restoring concord. The United States has been pressuring China to revalue its currency upward against the dollar, but China has resisted. And by raising interest rates within its borders last week, "China appears to be fighting the Fed," Mr. Yardeni says.
As the world's second-largest economy, China may be able to go its own way for a while. But when the Fed exerts its powers, it usually makes sense for market traders to bend with the wind.

Abstract: The figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are based on unemployment compensation insurance premiums paid, and thus reflect virtually all employees rather than relying on surveys of workers or employers.

Full text: WALL Street incomes are surging back.
The government reported this week that the real wage and salary income of finance industry employees based in Manhattan rose nearly 20 percent in the first quarter of this year. That surge helped make Manhattan the fastest-growing county in the United States in terms of terms of year-over-year gains in income.
Most Wall Street firms pay bonuses in the first quarter of each year, and the figures indicate that bonuses were much higher this year than in the same quarter of 2009. Then, of course, the financial crisis was at its most severe, with stock prices at 12-year lows and major banks being bailed out. It was not a good time to be paying bonuses.
The figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are based on unemployment compensation insurance premiums paid, and thus reflect virtually all employees rather than relying on surveys of workers or employers. Unfortunately, to get such detail requires substantial delays, which is why first-quarter figures are only now coming out.
As can be seen in the accompanying graphic, the average financial industry employee earned just over $100,000 in the first three months of the year, a figure that was up sharply from the same period of 2009 but still below the payouts in the previous three years.
The fact that those averages include bank tellers and trading desk clerks, as well as senior investment bankers, shows just how large many of the bonuses were.
From 1990 -- the first year for which figures are available -- through 2007, the average financial salary in Manhattan rose almost 7 percent a year, after adjusting for inflation. In 2007, total financial industry pay in Manhattan topped $100 billion for the first time. But the average fell by nearly a quarter by 2009.
New York, unlike other cities, includes five counties, and the data includes only Manhattan, known formally as New York County. The figures cover people who work in the county, regardless of where they live.
New York remains the financial capital of the country. Manhattan has more financial workers than any other county, and those workers have a higher average income than similar workers in any other county.
In the first quarter, only 4.6 percent of the finance workers in the country worked in Manhattan. But they received 14.7 percent of the income paid to all finance workers -- giving the average Manhattan worker income about three times as large as the overall figure.
Among counties with at least 20,000 financial industry workers, three of the next five counties with the highest average financial pay in the quarter were in the New York region -- Fairfield County, Conn.; Hudson County, N.J.; and Westchester County, N.Y. The others were San Francisco County and Suffolk County (Boston), Mass.

Abstract: There have been widespread claims that deficit-cutting actually reduces unemployment because it reassures consumers and businesses; but multiple studies of historical record, including one by the International Monetary Fund, have shown that this claim has no basis in reality. Never mind that British debt as a percentage of national income is actually below its historical average; never mind that British interest rates stayed low even as the nation's budget deficit soared, reflecting the belief of investors that the country can and will get its finances under control.

Full text: In the spring of 2010, fiscal austerity became fashionable. I use the term advisedly: the sudden consensus among Very Serious People that everyone must balance budgets now now now wasn't based on any kind of careful analysis. It was more like a fad, something everyone professed to believe because that was what the in-crowd was saying.
And it's a fad that has been fading lately, as evidence has accumulated that the lessons of the past remain relevant, that trying to balance budgets in the face of high unemployment and falling inflation is still a really bad idea. Most notably, the confidence fairy has been exposed as a myth. There have been widespread claims that deficit-cutting actually reduces unemployment because it reassures consumers and businesses; but multiple studies of historical record, including one by the International Monetary Fund, have shown that this claim has no basis in reality.
No widespread fad ever passes, however, without leaving some fashion victims in its wake. In this case, the victims are the people of Britain, who have the misfortune to be ruled by a government that took office at the height of the austerity fad and won't admit that it was wrong.
Britain, like America, is suffering from the aftermath of a housing and debt bubble. Its problems are compounded by London's role as an international financial center: Britain came to rely too much on profits from wheeling and dealing to drive its economy -- and on financial-industry tax payments to pay for government programs.
Over-reliance on the financial industry largely explains why Britain, which came into the crisis with relatively low public debt, has seen its budget deficit soar to 11 percent of G.D.P. -- slightly worse than the U.S. deficit. And there's no question that Britain will eventually need to balance its books with spending cuts and tax increases.
The operative word here should, however, be "eventually." Fiscal austerity will depress the economy further unless it can be offset by a fall in interest rates. Right now, interest rates in Britain, as in America, are already very low, with little room to fall further. The sensible thing, then, is to devise a plan for putting the nation's fiscal house in order, while waiting until a solid economic recovery is under way before wielding the ax.
But trendy fashion, almost by definition, isn't sensible -- and the British government seems determined to ignore the lessons of history.
Both the new British budget announced on Wednesday and the rhetoric that accompanied the announcement might have come straight from the desk of Andrew Mellon, the Treasury secretary who told President Herbert Hoover to fight the Depression by liquidating the farmers, liquidating the workers, and driving down wages. Or if you prefer more British precedents, it echoes the Snowden budget of 1931, which tried to restore confidence but ended up deepening the economic crisis.
The British government's plan is bold, say the pundits -- and so it is. But it boldly goes in exactly the wrong direction. It would cut government employment by 490,000 workers -- the equivalent of almost three million layoffs in the United States -- at a time when the private sector is in no position to provide alternative employment. It would slash spending at a time when private demand isn't at all ready to take up the slack.
Why is the British government doing this? The real reason has a lot to do with ideology: the Tories are using the deficit as an excuse to downsize the welfare state. But the official rationale is that there is no alternative.
Indeed, there has been a noticeable change in the rhetoric of the government of Prime Minister David Cameron over the past few weeks -- a shift from hope to fear. In his speech announcing the budget plan, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, seemed to have given up on the confidence fairy -- that is, on claims that the plan would have positive effects on employment and growth.
Instead, it was all about the apocalypse looming if Britain failed to go down this route. Never mind that British debt as a percentage of national income is actually below its historical average; never mind that British interest rates stayed low even as the nation's budget deficit soared, reflecting the belief of investors that the country can and will get its finances under control. Britain, declared Mr. Osborne, was on the "brink of bankruptcy."
What happens now? Maybe Britain will get lucky, and something will come along to rescue the economy. But the best guess is that Britain in 2011 will look like Britain in 1931, or the United States in 1937, or Japan in 1997. That is, premature fiscal austerity will lead to a renewed economic slump. As always, those who refuse to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
AS portfolios tick up after the vast losses of two years ago, many investors remain wary. The latest whiz-bang product is more likely to inspire skepticism than desire. Promises of steady returns do not inspire confidence, either.
While in boom times it seemed easy to make money, investors have learned that it is even easier to lose money.
In this climate, advisers face a challenge, and, once again, they have had to develop new ways of presenting their services. Speaking broadly, three approaches seem to have emerged: the caring, the technical and the retirement-focused.
The emergence of different approaches also shows the resilience of the wealth-management industry -- and this is not the first time the industry has changed how it describes itself.
"They said 'trust us,' but they leave off the rest of the sentence: 'to get you out of the hole we dug for you,' " said Mark Stevens, chief executive of MSCO, a marketing firm that has done work for wealth-management companies. "Why are they able to resurrect themselves? People want them to. What's your other option?"
Understanding the differences among the three approaches and choosing the right adviser may at least help investors sleep better at night.
THE CARING APPROACH Advisers in this camp say they manage money as if it were their own. Their approach is less flashy by design than others, and they go beyond the issue of fiduciary responsibility of registered investment advisers, they say.
One large firm using this approach is Stephens Inc., a privately held bank run by Warren Stephens, founded by his uncle in 1933 and later run by his father. The firm's claim to fame is having brought Wal-Mart public in 1970; it added the wealth-management division in 2001.
In the last three years, Mr. Stephens says, he has added 25 advisers, for a total of 107, and with them clients who fit the Stephens ethos: people who want stability with steady growth. "We're not immune to our clients' portfolios being down somewhat," Mr. Stephens said. "We've benefited from the real and perceived stability of our firm."
The wealth management division now manages $7 billion, the same amount it managed before the recession.
The relatively small number of advisers, given how much money they manage, has created a culture that prides itself on continually checking where it has invested its clients' money.
In one instance, Mr. Stephens said, the firm found that a money market account it had used for years added more securities beyond ultrasafe Treasury bonds. Stephens contacted its clients and sought their permission to move that money to a money market account more focused on Treasuries.
"We had several clients say, 'You're looking out for my money; that's a really good call,' " Mr. Stephens said, noting one client deposited an additional $5 million in his account.
In a different approach to caring, Ben Marks, president and chief investment officer of Marks Group Wealth Management in Minnetonka, Minn., is investing clients' money more locally than globally, bucking the trend to look abroad.
"The proximity is important to investors," Mr. Marks said. "They like the proximity of who is making the investment decisions -- that's us -- and secondly the proximity of the actual investments themselves."
In this strategy, Mr. Marks said, the qualitative side of investing is winning out over the quantitative approach. This was not so important in 2006 when portfolios were all rising, he said, but has become so, and having a connection to the companies is one such driver.
"There is a sense of patriotism in investing in your local community," Mr. Marks said. "When people are investing overseas, it's almost conceptual -- I should invest in Brazil or China -- but they don't have the level of detail of what they should know."
At the Harbor Lights Financial Group, which manages $250 million from its base on the New Jersey shore, the notion of a small, caring firm goes a step further to include "lifestyle concierge services" for clients with $1 million or more. This includes help negotiating the price of a new car or securing hard-to-get theater tickets or restaurant reservations.
This may seem labor-intensive for a small firm, but Doug Lockwood, a partner, said the good will that accrues more than offsets the labor, particularly because clients do not use the services frequently.
"We could only control so much of the performance with the markets, so we decided to create this program," he said. "Our top clients are referring us all these people, so we try to overimpress them."
He says his firm recently saved a client $5,000 on a luxury car, something he believes clients are more likely to talk about at a dinner party than their rate of return.
"Some of the largest wealth management firms have been doing this for years," he said. "Our referrals have gone up at least 25 percent in 2009 and 2010."
THE TECHNICAL APPROACH Advisers in this category say it is a way to talk about returns and expectations without dwelling on the numbers themselves. Doing that requires them to ask different questions.
Mitch Cox, head of global investments and research at Barclays Wealth, said the first question to ask clients should be "how much am I financially and mentally prepared to lose?" While talking about potential losses, Mr. Cox said his firm speaks to clients about opportunities across nine asset classes that span the globe.
The reasoning is that moving into cash and bonds may allow investors to sleep at night, but it may also let them fall behind the rate of inflation. In direct contrast to Mr. Marks's invest-local focus, Mr. Cox suggested: "Think of the global economy as an air mattress. If you're pushing down on one part, chances are there is going to be a positive effect someplace else."
Finding the right mix of investments depends on a person's emotional makeup, he said, but one thing is consistent: "They want returns that are unsurprising and sustainable."
The other distinctive element of the technical approach is an emphasis on lower costs and fees, which translates to a higher return.
That high costs eat up returns is something investors in index funds have been pointing out for decades. HighTower Advisors of Chicago says it has a fresh approach.
Started two years ago with backing from a group led by Philip J. Purcell, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, HighTower raised $165 million that it is using for two goals: to build a technology and infrastructure platform that aims to lower the costs on everything, including bonds and fees paid to third-party custodian firms, and to hire top teams from other firms.
"The fundamental difference is we've converted financial advisers from being the last node of a manufacturing and distribution business into becoming a buyer of Wall Street products, and that makes Wall Street compete for the business," said Elliot S. Weissbluth, chief executive of HighTower.
The firm now manages $16 billion. Beyond performance numbers, it emphasizes to clients that it has more freedom and can lower their costs -- something all registered investment advisers tell their clients, of course.
But HighTower goes a step further. When it wants to buy a bond on behalf of a client, for example, HighTower solicits bids from up to 50 firms to get the best price. The same holds true with the custodians who actually hold the money the firm's advisers are managing: HighTower works with seven, as opposed to one or two, so the client benefits from shopping around.
"If nothing else, you're paying less," Mr. Weissbluth said. "And driving down the costs helps performance."
RETIREMENT-FOCUSED This approach educates clients about their portfolios and tries to persuade them to keep the long term in mind. By extension, this means trying to ignore the short-term peaks and valleys in their portfolios.
A cynical view of this is that firms need clients to forget the losses of the last three years, as Mr. Stevens of MSCO pointed out, and think decades down the road. This can work, unless a client had planned to retire next year.
The more generous view is that people should have been thinking long-term all along and that being concerned with short-term market gyrations at this point is not going to help them.
"We've been very visible in the public with educational seminars," said Lyle LaMothe, head of wealth management in the United States for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management. "They all have something to do with retirement or income protection."
Last year, "there was a clear need that was percolating," he said. Merrill Lynch has added 15,000 accounts with more than $250,000 in each so far in 2010. Claire Huang, head of marketing for Bank of America Global Wealth Management and Investment Management, which includes Merrill, said their campaigns were emphasizing retirement goals and steering people away from thinking about the absolute amount of money they have.
"People who talk about the number are missing the point," she said. "People want help based on their needs. They want little steps, and over time they'll hit that number."
David B. Armstrong, a managing director of Monument Wealth Management, outside of Washington, employs a similar approach on a smaller level. Advocating "personal pension planning," he tells clients to look at retirement as any other liability.
"If I want to live off of $150,000 a year when I retire, that's a liability," he said. "What we do is a simple net present value calculation -- what does an asset have to be worth today to be worth what they need it to be worth in the future?"
Retirement may still be the goal, but for many people the timeline for it has changed, and that has altered the planning process, said Renee Brown, director of wealth, brokerage and retirement for Wells Fargo.
"They're less concerned about getting to retirement; they think it's going to happen later," Ms. Brown said. "Their concern now is, will their money last through retirement?"
It's essential to remember that the three schools of thought are not broken down by wealth levels but by personality traits. A person with $30 million could be happy fishing and golfing his days away in retirement, while someone with $5 million would rather take the caring approach while he sat on boards or consulted.
Most important in choosing an adviser is for people to ask: what kind of investor am I?

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Thursday with an article about different approaches taken by investment advisers referred imprecisely to the location of Stephens Inc., a privately held bank. While Stephens has offices in New York and other locations, and while the photograph showed Warren Stephens, who runs the bank, in his office in Manhattan, the bank's headquarters are in Little Rock, Ark.

AS portfolios tick up after the vast losses of two years ago, many investors remain wary. The latest whiz-bang product is more likely to inspire skepticism than desire. Promises of steady returns do not inspire confidence, either.
While in boom times it seemed easy to make money, investors have learned that it is even easier to lose money.
In this climate, advisers face a challenge, and, once again, they have had to develop new ways of presenting their services. Speaking broadly, three approaches seem to have emerged: the caring, the technical and the retirement-focused.
The emergence of different approaches also shows the resilience of the wealth-management industry -- and this is not the first time the industry has changed how it describes itself.
"They said 'trust us,' but they leave off the rest of the sentence: 'to get you out of the hole we dug for you,' " said Mark Stevens, chief executive of MSCO, a marketing firm that has done work for wealth-management companies. "Why are they able to resurrect themselves? People want them to. What's your other option?"
Understanding the differences among the three approaches and choosing the right adviser may at least help investors sleep better at night.
THE CARING APPROACH Advisers in this camp say they manage money as if it were their own. Their approach is less flashy by design than others, and they go beyond the issue of fiduciary responsibility of registered investment advisers, they say.
One large firm using this approach is Stephens Inc., a privately held bank run by Warren Stephens, founded by his uncle in 1933 and later run by his father. The firm's claim to fame is having brought Wal-Mart public in 1970; it added the wealth-management division in 2001.
In the last three years, Mr. Stephens says, he has added 25 advisers, for a total of 107, and with them clients who fit the Stephens ethos: people who want stability with steady growth. "We're not immune to our clients' portfolios being down somewhat," Mr. Stephens said. "We've benefited from the real and perceived stability of our firm."
The wealth management division now manages $7 billion, the same amount it managed before the recession.
The relatively small number of advisers, given how much money they manage, has created a culture that prides itself on continually checking where it has invested its clients' money.
In one instance, Mr. Stephens said, the firm found that a money market account it had used for years added more securities beyond ultrasafe Treasury bonds. Stephens contacted its clients and sought their permission to move that money to a money market account more focused on Treasuries.
"We had several clients say, 'You're looking out for my money; that's a really good call,' " Mr. Stephens said, noting one client deposited an additional $5 million in his account.
In a different approach to caring, Ben Marks, president and chief investment officer of Marks Group Wealth Management in Minnetonka, Minn., is investing clients' money more locally than globally, bucking the trend to look abroad.
"The proximity is important to investors," Mr. Marks said. "They like the proximity of who is making the investment decisions -- that's us -- and secondly the proximity of the actual investments themselves."
In this strategy, Mr. Marks said, the qualitative side of investing is winning out over the quantitative approach. This was not so important in 2006 when portfolios were all rising, he said, but has become so, and having a connection to the companies is one such driver.
"There is a sense of patriotism in investing in your local community," Mr. Marks said. "When people are investing overseas, it's almost conceptual -- I should invest in Brazil or China -- but they don't have the level of detail of what they should know."
At the Harbor Lights Financial Group, which manages $250 million from its base on the New Jersey shore, the notion of a small, caring firm goes a step further to include "lifestyle concierge services" for clients with $1 million or more. This includes help negotiating the price of a new car or securing hard-to-get theater tickets or restaurant reservations.
This may seem labor-intensive for a small firm, but Doug Lockwood, a partner, said the good will that accrues more than offsets the labor, particularly because clients do not use the services frequently.
"We could only control so much of the performance with the markets, so we decided to create this program," he said. "Our top clients are referring us all these people, so we try to overimpress them."
He says his firm recently saved a client $5,000 on a luxury car, something he believes clients are more likely to talk about at a dinner party than their rate of return.
"Some of the largest wealth management firms have been doing this for years," he said. "Our referrals have gone up at least 25 percent in 2009 and 2010."
THE TECHNICAL APPROACH Advisers in this category say it is a way to talk about returns and expectations without dwelling on the numbers themselves. Doing that requires them to ask different questions.
Mitch Cox, head of global investments and research at Barclays Wealth, said the first question to ask clients should be "how much am I financially and mentally prepared to lose?" While talking about potential losses, Mr. Cox said his firm speaks to clients about opportunities across nine asset classes that span the globe.
The reasoning is that moving into cash and bonds may allow investors to sleep at night, but it may also let them fall behind the rate of inflation. In direct contrast to Mr. Marks's invest-local focus, Mr. Cox suggested: "Think of the global economy as an air mattress. If you're pushing down on one part, chances are there is going to be a positive effect someplace else."
Finding the right mix of investments depends on a person's emotional makeup, he said, but one thing is consistent: "They want returns that are unsurprising and sustainable."
The other distinctive element of the technical approach is an emphasis on lower costs and fees, which translates to a higher return.
That high costs eat up returns is something investors in index funds have been pointing out for decades. HighTower Advisors of Chicago says it has a fresh approach.
Started two years ago with backing from a group led by Philip J. Purcell, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, HighTower raised $165 million that it is using for two goals: to build a technology and infrastructure platform that aims to lower the costs on everything, including bonds and fees paid to third-party custodian firms, and to hire top teams from other firms.
"The fundamental difference is we've converted financial advisers from being the last node of a manufacturing and distribution business into becoming a buyer of Wall Street products, and that makes Wall Street compete for the business," said Elliot S. Weissbluth, chief executive of HighTower.
The firm now manages $16 billion. Beyond performance numbers, it emphasizes to clients that it has more freedom and can lower their costs -- something all registered investment advisers tell their clients, of course.
But HighTower goes a step further. When it wants to buy a bond on behalf of a client, for example, HighTower solicits bids from up to 50 firms to get the best price. The same holds true with the custodians who actually hold the money the firm's advisers are managing: HighTower works with seven, as opposed to one or two, so the client benefits from shopping around.
"If nothing else, you're paying less," Mr. Weissbluth said. "And driving down the costs helps performance."
RETIREMENT-FOCUSED This approach educates clients about their portfolios and tries to persuade them to keep the long term in mind. By extension, this means trying to ignore the short-term peaks and valleys in their portfolios.
A cynical view of this is that firms need clients to forget the losses of the last three years, as Mr. Stevens of MSCO pointed out, and think decades down the road. This can work, unless a client had planned to retire next year.
The more generous view is that people should have been thinking long-term all along and that being concerned with short-term market gyrations at this point is not going to help them.
"We've been very visible in the public with educational seminars," said Lyle LaMothe, head of wealth management in the United States for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management. "They all have something to do with retirement or income protection."
Last year, "there was a clear need that was percolating," he said. Merrill Lynch has added 15,000 accounts with more than $250,000 in each so far in 2010. Claire Huang, head of marketing for Bank of America Global Wealth Management and Investment Management, which includes Merrill, said their campaigns were emphasizing retirement goals and steering people away from thinking about the absolute amount of money they have.
"People who talk about the number are missing the point," she said. "People want help based on their needs. They want little steps, and over time they'll hit that number."
David B. Armstrong, a managing director of Monument Wealth Management, outside of Washington, employs a similar approach on a smaller level. Advocating "personal pension planning," he tells clients to look at retirement as any other liability.
"If I want to live off of $150,000 a year when I retire, that's a liability," he said. "What we do is a simple net present value calculation -- what does an asset have to be worth today to be worth what they need it to be worth in the future?"
Retirement may still be the goal, but for many people the timeline for it has changed, and that has altered the planning process, said Renee Brown, director of wealth, brokerage and retirement for Wells Fargo.
"They're less concerned about getting to retirement; they think it's going to happen later," Ms. Brown said. "Their concern now is, will their money last through retirement?"
It's essential to remember that the three schools of thought are not broken down by wealth levels but by personality traits. A person with $30 million could be happy fishing and golfing his days away in retirement, while someone with $5 million would rather take the caring approach while he sat on boards or consulted.
Most important in choosing an adviser is for people to ask: what kind of investor am I?

Full text: WHILE the long-term outlook for the dollar seems to be dismal these days, what about other currencies? And if you are interested in investing in currencies, how best to go about it?
It's possible not only to invest in a basket of foreign currencies. but to make one-way bets on individual currencies. Animated by the Australian dollar? Riveted by India's rupee? More than 40 ways are available to wager on the direction of currencies in the $4 trillion global currency market, which is roughly four times as large as the United States bond market.
Always remember that the currency markets are notoriously volatile, so timing the market is difficult and risky. Despite all of the cable TV ads promoting software that can produce foreign-exchange trading profits, even the largest financial institutions get burned trading currencies.
You need to consider carefully which, if any, investment vehicle is suitable for you. The choices include at least 14 mutual funds, 19 exchange-traded funds and 10 exchange-traded notes issued by banks that are all based on currency strategies.
If you want exposure to foreign currencies to blunt the impact of a portfolio largely dominated in dollars, a large basket of currencies managed by a mutual fund might be suitable. Experts say it depends on the portfolio you are trying to hedge.
"I don't like currency baskets," said Michael Dubis, a certified financial planner based in Madison, Wis. He said such investments were often "expensive, unnecessary and will already overallocate currency, which is already embedded in your international stock exposure. And thinking one knows the direction of currency shifts is insanely delusional."
Or do you have a strong hunch about where the dollar is headed? For bears, the Rydex Weakening Dollar 2x Strategy A (RYWBX) fund uses leverage to double your returns on a falling dollar. The company has another fund (RYSJX) that bets on the dollar strengthening. The Merk Hard Currency fund (MERKX) invests in gold (which rises in price when the dollar falls) and a group of major currencies to wager against the dollar.
What if you have a time-sensitive transaction or heavy exposure to another currency and want to ensure that you don't lose money if it appreciates relative to the dollar? A more complex instrument called a currency forward might be suitable. It's a contract that locks in a price to buy or sell a specific quantity of the currency at a future date.
Or maybe you're just plain skittish about the prospects of the dollar as Congress continues to sell Treasury securities in a weakened economy to finance the more than $13 trillion national debt. That's a reasonable concern, and if most of your investments are in dollars, you may be able to realize some gains in stocks and bonds denominated in other currencies.
Alec Young, international equity strategist for Standard & Poor's, said that for investors in the United States, "currency diversification is a key benefit of international investing; you can make a case for the dollar being in a secular decline."
As with the stock market, though, currencies don't follow a script. The Greek debt crisis brought on a 15 percent decline in the euro against the dollar earlier this year, although the euro has recovered more than 10 percent since then.
From a financial planning perspective, rather than placing your bets on a particular currency or strategy, you'd be better off focusing on growth from foreign stocks. If you happen to benefit from currency movements, it's an added benefit -- though it carries the risk, of course, that the currency will move the other way. And don't forget that many American multinationals have a large foreign presence that could promise capital appreciation from overseas.
Focusing on currency strategies can also be expensive. The Merk fund, for example, charges 1.3 percent annually in expenses to manage a handful of currencies. Compare that with 0.27 percent for the Vanguard Total International Stock Index fund, which holds more than 1,800 stocks in developed and emerging markets.
A more pressing concern for American investors -- and one that may be clouded by the foreign exchange investing frenzy -- is domestic inflation and interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall and you lose purchasing power. While that doesn't appear to be a problem now, it may be when the United States economy heats up.
Rick Miller, a financial planner with Sensible Financial in Waltham, Mass., recommended that investors protect against purchasing power erosion with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. They are also sold through the Treasury in the form of I-Bonds. Unlike most bonds, TIPS keep pace with the Consumer Price Index and increase in value when inflation climbs. The securities are available in mutual funds like the Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund (VIPSX) and the iShares Barclays TIPS fund (TIP).
"TIPS are boring," Mr. Miller said, "but they are better than stocks or commodities, which could go down with inflation."
A tunnel-vision focus on whether the dollar will continue to slide may distract you from globally diversifying your portfolio in foreign stocks and bonds. Only about 42 percent of the world's free-floating stock market value is in American stocks. Broad-based international stock and bond funds include the iShares All Country World Index exchange-traded fund (ACWI) and the Pimco Foreign Bond fund (PFUIX).
So if you're ignoring Europe, South America and developing countries, you could be missing out on growth. It's far more likely that you'll make money in a passive portfolio covering dozens of countries than making one bet on a single currency.

Full text: James Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, took one on the nose in the third quarter. While his peers have largely beat analysts' estimates, Mr. Gorman presided over results that not only missed the target but included an unexpected $91 million loss. In fact, the company had to rely on one-time items to avoid an even worse showing. After a decent first half of the year, it's a setback.
A surprising write-down on an Atlantic City casino project pushed Morgan Stanley into the red. The company already had taken what appeared to be a full hit on the investment when it decided to get rid of its stake early this year. But it has yet to find a buyer at the price initially marked on the books.
Fixed-income trading revenue also slumped. And the twisted accounting rule that forces firms to mark their own debt to market made the drop from the second quarter, 64 percent, look even worse.
But even after stripping out the new rules, the top line still fell 24 percent, worse than any of Morgan Stanley's rivals. JPMorgan Chase's bond, currency and commodities revenue rose slightly, while Bank of America's equivalent business generated 50 percent more cash than the previous quarter.
Morgan Stanley's loss would have been worse but for some nonrecurring items. There was $800 million of revenue from gains on investments housed in the institutional securities and asset management units. Another $176 million accrued thanks to a tax benefit from bringing foreign earnings back to the United States.
That the bank's fixed-income traders had the most dismal quarter of the top banks was not so surprising. After multiple changes of strategy, the division is still rebuilding, a task that Mr. Gorman has repeatedly cautioned investors will take several quarters.
And revamps elsewhere are still running smoothly, if slowly. Wealth management pretax income rose by about a third, though its pretax margin reached only 9 percent. And even after stripping out gains on real estate investments, asset management made a rare profit from continuing operations. That suggests underlying strength. That should give investors some comfort that, the latest noise and disappointments aside, Mr. Gorman is still largely on the right track.
British Penance
It is living up to its billing as a bloodbath. Britain's coalition government is slashing public spending by $128 billion over five years, about 19 percent when adjusted for inflation.
The plan is billed as a painful necessity to secure the country's financial future, but it is also ideological. The aim is to move from unaffordable levels of public employment and welfare to private employment and a balanced budget. The risk, however, is that the economy could stall.
The cuts to the civil service are drastic and will cause distress, even though most departments' budgets have been reduced by less than a quarter, as had been threatened. The BBC, the foreign office, the police, even the royal family: none have been spared. The government wants services to be delivered more cheaply, which means by fewer people.
Britons know the public sector has excesses and that some cuts will not be the end of the world. Nevertheless, losing half a million public sector jobs is a heavy toll. If the private sector cannot absorb these workers, total unemployment in Britain may rise to three million, or more than 9 percent.
Cutting many departments has allowed the government to lift health spending and maintain the schools budget. With welfare, however, the changes risk looking harsh. Most, though not all, of the overall $11 billion drop in welfare spending hits the poorest. The intention is to encourage people to swap welfare for work, but the danger is greater social division.
The big macroeconomic risk is that the cuts cause a return to recession, thereby wrecking the government's fiscal calculations. That risk is real: house prices are still falling, and consumers are still deleveraging.
The Bank of England is likely to make money as cheap as possible. Nevertheless, tough years lie ahead. A country that was living far beyond its means now faces simultaneous big spending cuts and tax increases.
The government hopes its decision will bring clarity and a swift climb in private investment. A happy outcome is not assured. But at least it's a resolute start.

A Basket Of Assets In One Investment

Abstract: For insulation from the stock and bond markets, consider commodity and natural resource E.T.F.'s, which let investors choose a single-commodity fund, like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which holds gold bullion, or broad baskets like the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC), which tracks the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index.

Full text: AS investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds seem like a perfect fit for retirement portfolios.
The funds, known as E.T.F.'s, are generally relatively low cost and easy to understand. Listed and traded openly on exchanges, E.T.F.'s are baskets that invest in assets as various as global stocks and gold.
Yet picking the right E.T.F. is crucial. Far too many E.T.F.'s are overmarketed and some of the complex funds are loaded with nuances that most investors do not understand. E.T.F.'s can pose an almost irresistible, but risky, temptation to limit your bets to a single industry sector, country or commodity.
This is a particularly good time to invest in E.T.F.'s because major fund managers and vendors are battling one another to win customers by lowering costs. Brokerage commissions and internal fund management "expense ratios" are the major costs of owning E.T.F.'s. By taking advantage of this commission war, investors can increase the net returns on retirement funds.
"If all you did was replicate your entire portfolio with E.T.F.'s, you'd save 1 percent annually on expenses," said Tom Lydon, publisher of ETFTrends.com. Most E.T.F.'s are bought and sold through brokers, and, as with other investments, deep discounters typically charge the lowest commissions. Three of the largest sellers of E.T.F.'s, Fidelity, Schwab and Vanguard, offer commission-free E.T.F.'s on select groups of in-house funds. Fidelity also provides a break on some iShares funds.
Other funds, if not commission-free, are modestly priced. The Vanguard S.& P. 500 E.T.F. (VOO), for example, charges 0.06 percent annually for fund management -- a significant savings over the 0.10 percent for similar E.T.F.'s and 1.45 percent for a broker-sold index fund like the UBS S.& P. 500 Index (PWSPX) fund (C shares).
With more than 1,000 funds to choose from in a $1 trillion industry, which E.T.F.'s do you add to your portfolio? You can start with the simple principle of diversification. Do you have funds that cover the entire United States stock and bond markets? How about international stocks and bonds?
It is also prudent to consider which risks you want to insulate your retirement portfolio from: market downturns, inflation, currency fluctuation and losing out on opportunities abroad, for example.
An important principle of E.T.F. diversification is to stick with passive portfolios or index funds. The iShares Barclays Aggregate Bond fund (AGG), for example, invests in most of the United States investment-grade bond market for a 0.24 percent expense ratio annually.
The broadest baskets of securities will provide samplings of most markets. The Vanguard Total World Stock Market E.T.F. (VT), for example, invests in 2,900 holdings in 47 countries.
For insulation from the stock and bond markets, consider commodity and natural resource E.T.F.'s, which let investors choose a single-commodity fund, like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which holds gold bullion, or broad baskets like the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC), which tracks the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index.
Do not ignore commercial real estate, which is best represented by a basket of real estate investment trusts. These are stocks that invest in properties like shopping malls and office buildings. The FTSE NAREIT Industrial/Office Capped Index Fund (FIO) tracks part of the commercial real estate sector and pays a yield of 4.8 percent.
A fully diversified retirement strategy would include emerging markets. The iShares MSCI Emerging Market fund (EEM), for example, can provide a sampling of markets from Brazil to Taiwan.
Be careful not to concentrate too much in any specialized fund. Piling into a gold or bond fund could be hazardous, especially if you're buying into a bubble.
More sophisticated investment strategies, like leveraged bets that multiply gains and losses or "shorting" an industry or basket of securities, also can be pursued using E.T.F.'s. But Michael Iachini, a director in the Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, suggested: "If you're investing for the long term, keep it simple. A lot of new E.T.F. concepts are geared toward active traders."
On the other hand, some passive E.T.F.'s do not accurately track daily index moves, a notable problem with commodity E.T.F.'s and inverse E.T.F.'s, which allow you to bet against a commodity -- if the price of oil falls, the value of an inverse E.T.F. would rise. These are not the best vehicles for aggressive day traders or market timers.
Beware, too, of advisers who say they can beat the market with portfolios of E.T.F.'s.
While you can always construct a portfolio on your own, it makes sense to consult a certified financial planner or registered investment adviser to see what your portfolio needs -- and does not need -- before you buy these vehicles. An investment policy statement outlining your objectives is essential. Duplicating what you already have makes no sense.

China G.D.P. Grew 9.6% Despite Cooling Efforts

Full text: HONG KONG -- The Chinese economy continued to expand at a rapid clip during the third quarter, demonstrating that government measures aimed at reining in growth have not choked off expansion.
China's gross domestic product grew 9.6 percent from the same period a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That was a slower pace than the 10.3 percent year-on-year expansion recorded for the second quarter, but just above analyst expectations for a 9.5 percent increase.
Analysts view the slowdown as a return toward more normal, sustainable growth, rather than the beginning of a worrying slump. Though the United States and much of Europe are still struggling to pick up the pace of their economies, China has for months faced the opposite challenge: tempering expansion, and the price rises that accompany excessively rapid growth.
Inflation data also released on Thursday showed consumer prices rose 3.6 percent in September, a slight acceleration from the increase recorded in August.
Reduced lending by state-owned banks and other measures have helped soaring property prices stabilize somewhat in recent months.
The Chinese authorities stepped up their growth-slowing efforts on Tuesday by staging their first interest rate increase since late 2007. The move caught most observers by surprise, but appeared to indicate that Beijing was confident that China's overall growth momentum was intact and able to withstand the more sweeping tool of rate increases.

In a Visit to Clerics, the Iranian Supreme Leader Demands Loyalty

Full text: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran's supreme leader quickly set the tone Tuesday for his long visit among some of the country's most influential clerics, demanding loyalty to the Islamic state and an end to defiance that had blurred once-clear lines of power since last year's disputed elections.
At the start of a planned 10 days of speeches and meetings, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in the seminary city of Qum, underscored the concerns among Iran's theocrats that their control is under threat by dissent from clerics and the rising influence of security forces after the worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, supported President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after his disputed election victory in June 2009 and dismissed claims of widespread vote fraud. But many senior clerics in Qum do not side with Mr. Ahmadinejad and have increasingly criticized the government.
There could also be an element of legacy-building at play. Some experts on Iranian affairs say that Ayatollah Khamenei, who is 71, may be trying to pave the way for his hard-line son, Mojtaba Khamenei, to one day take over at the pinnacle of Iran's ruling system.
Minutes after arriving in Qum, Ayatollah Khamenei delivered a speech in which he said that solidarity "needs to be strengthened further day by day, specifically with the executive branch, which has a lot of burdens on its shoulders." His speech, near Qum's holiest shrine, was broadcast live on state television.
Last month, Grand Ayatollah Nasser Makarem Shirazi, one of the leading religious scholars in Qum, accused Mr. Ahmadinejad's government of lying about Iran's economic situation. "Statistics about reducing inflation are constantly released but contradict what the people see by their own eyes," Ayatollah Shirazi was quoted by the news media as saying. "When state statistics don't correspond with reality, people lose confidence in government."
Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, who died in December and had spent years under house arrest after a falling-out with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, once denounced the "despotic treatment" of protesters at the hand of the Islamic leadership.

China's Central Bank Raises Interest Rates, Jolting World Markets

Abstract: A surprise announcement by China's central bank that it would raise interest rates for the first time in nearly three years jolted world financial markets Tuesday, as investors worried that China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, could slow and crimp the global recovery. China's rate increase is the latest indication that it is struggling against stubborn inflation, soaring housing prices and an overly buoyant economy that is pumping out exports, resulting in the accumulation of huge amounts of foreign exchange reserves.

Full text: BEIJING -- A surprise announcement by China's central bank that it would raise interest rates for the first time in nearly three years jolted world financial markets Tuesday, as investors worried that China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, could slow and crimp the global recovery.
Stocks were sharply lower on exchanges in Europe and the United States. Oil and other commodities, all affected by the world economic outlook, also declined.
"Any time China tries to tighten the reins on their economy, it will have a ripple-down effect on the rest of the globe," said Brad Sorensen, the director for market and sector analysis at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
Weak quarterly reports from financial giants like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, and signs of weakness from technology companies like Apple and I.B.M., also weighed on the United States markets.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 165.07 points, or 1.48 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 43.71 points, or 1.76 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 18.81 points, or 1.59 percent. The yield for the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note yield fell to 2.48 percent, from 2.51 percent Monday.
In London, the FTSE 100 index was down 38.63 points, or 0.67 percent, at 5,703.89, while the DAX in Frankfurt fell 25.94 points, or 0.40 percent, to 6,490.69.
In Asia on Wednesday, the stock market reaction was mixed. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan was down 1.6 percent in afternoon trade, while the key indexes in Hong Kong and Australia sagged about 0.9 percent. But in mainland China, the Shanghai composite index reversed morning losses, to stand about 0.7 percent higher by around noon. The markets in Taiwan and South Korea rose by similar amounts.
Mr. Sorensen said that China's rate increase was small. The People's Bank of China increased its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage point, so deposit rates will rise to 2.25 percent, and a crucial lending rate will climb to 5.56 percent. He suggested that investors had been preparing to take profits anyway after several weeks in which the dollar weakened and stocks declined.
"Really it was just time to sell, take some profits and that was a good excuse to do it," he said, referring to the Chinese rate increase.
China's effort to take control of its galloping economy contrasts sharply with economic policies in developed nations like the United States, where officials are trying to spur growth by keeping interest rates low. In Washington, the Federal Reserve declined to comment, in keeping with its policy of not remarking on the actions of other central banks.
The prospect that the Federal Reserve may pump more money into the American economy has Chinese officials worried that much of that money will find its way here, creating even more problems with higher asset prices and other forms of inflation. Fed policy makers will meet on Nov. 2 and 3.
Charles L. Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, signaled in a speech on Tuesday that the Fed could buy assets to raise prices temporarily. "I think this could be helpful, I think we should talk about it," he said.
China's rate increase is the latest indication that it is struggling against stubborn inflation, soaring housing prices and an overly buoyant economy that is pumping out exports, resulting in the accumulation of huge amounts of foreign exchange reserves.
It acted after the government reported a surge in bank lending and property prices in September and found indications that inflation may have also risen sharply last month, after a big jump in August.
Analysts said they were surprised by the decision, because a central bank official had suggested recently that no rate increase was needed.
"This move is symbolically huge," Dong Tao, a Hong Kong-based economist at Credit Suisse, said by e-mail. "Yet it may only have limited impact on the real economy because overall rates are still at excessively low levels. This move probably will dampen sentiment in the property sector and equity market in the short run. However, we think excess liquidity will still prevail, if this is just a one-off rate hike."
The market declines on Tuesday also occurred against the backdrop of corporate earnings reports. Apple said after the market closed on Monday that it expected declines in its gross margins in the current quarter. And I.B.M. said late Monday that the pace of its services contracts was slower than it had expected.
The technology sector ended the day nearly 2 percent lower, with shares of Apple and I.B.M. down about 3 percent. Materials and energy stocks were also down more than 2 percent.
Financials were down more than 1.5 percent, after rising more than 2 percent on Monday because of an upbeat earnings report from Citigroup. Bank of America said Tuesday that although its operating profit had rebounded, it had a loss of $7.3 billion in the third quarter because of a $10.4 billion write-down in the value of its credit card business. It traded down more than 4 percent.
Goldman Sachs said Tuesday that it had declines in most of its major business units for the third quarter. Still, its shares rose about 2 percent.
Analysts said that the numbers were better than expected, and that the amount of Bank of America's write-down had already been built into its share price.
"We knew they were not going to do as well as last year," said David Kelly, the chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds.
Mr. Kelly said the midterm Congressional elections and the outlook for tax policy had caused a lot of uncertainty in the market.
On Tuesday the government also released statistics showing that housing starts inched up 0.3 percent last month, with single-family permits rising just 0.5 percent.
"Housing starts stabilized at depressed levels two years ago, and have made little headway since," said Patrick Newport, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
"Over the past 24 months, builders have put up an average of 595,000 units a month," he said in a research note, referring to an annualized rate. "Under normal conditions, they would put up at least 1.5 million units a month to meet demand from a growing population, and to replace old and damaged homes."

Full text: BOSTON -- A situation the Federal Reserve has long feared has come to pass: the central bank, after spending three decades taming inflation, now needs more of it.
And so the Fed is having to shift substantially from the approach that has come to define it and from which it has long derived its institutional self-esteem.
"In the 1980s and 1990s, few ever questioned the desired direction for inflation -- lower was always better," Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a conference here this weekend, acknowledging the sea change in the Fed's orientation.
Since the summer, Fed officials have grown increasingly worried that the United States could slip into deflation, a decrease in prices of the kind that has bedeviled Japan since the late 1990s.
That worry has taken center stage as Mr. Bernanke prepares the markets for a widely expected new round of unorthodox actions, starting in November, to prop up the recovery by lowering long-term interest rates. Nearly two years ago, the Fed lowered short-term interest rates to essentially zero.
The Fed is legally required to try to keep prices stable and maximize employment. Those often conflicting goals are, for the time being, no longer in tension as the economy limps along. In framing his cautious arguments for additional Fed action, Mr. Bernanke said inflation (about half of the implicit target of "about 2 percent or a bit below") was "too low" and that unemployment (9.6 percent) was "clearly too high."
Mr. Bernanke returned to Washington after giving the opening speech at the conference, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, on "Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment." Had he stayed through the weekend, he would have heard colleagues expressing even graver anxieties.
Drawing on Japan's experiences with low but persistent deflation, Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, said it seemed that the disease was much easier to prevent than cure. But getting Fed policy makers to agree on a course of action "has turned out to be extremely challenging," he added.
Charles L. Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, said at the conference that he had had "a dawning realization" that the economy was in a "liquidity trap" -- a situation in which monetary policy is unable to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates or expanding the money supply. He announced his support for a much-debated strategy known as "price-level targeting," in which the Fed would permit inflation to run at higher-than-normal rates in the future to make up for inflation being lower than desired today.
Fed officials closely monitor the markets' beliefs about future price movements because inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling. Since the recession began in 2007, those expectations have largely remained stable.
But Richard H. Clarida, an economist at Columbia, warned that the Fed should not take a premature victory lap.
"That expected inflation has thus far adjusted only modestly lower during this cycle may be the result not of Fed credibility to generate inflation in the future, but instead may be the result of the fact that the Fed in the past has delivered 2 percent inflation," he wrote in a paper presented here.
He added: "Expectations of disinflation or even deflation could become entrenched as they did in Japan and be very difficult, given inflation inertia, to reverse."
Mr. Clarida also noted that "bank lending, much of it to small and medium-sized enterprises, has collapsed to an extent unprecedented in previous business cycles and continues to decline more than a year into recovery." Such a credit crisis makes it particularly difficult for the Fed to stimulate demand by manipulating interest rates, he said.
Another paper, by Jeffrey C. Fuhrer, Giovanni P. Olivei and Geoffrey M. B. Tootell of the Boston Fed, noted that it was common for inflation to fall after a recession and concluded that "modest additional declines in inflation are likely."
James D. Hamilton of the University of California, San Diego, argued in another paper here that trying to increase inflation expectations as a response to the crisis -- through price-level targeting, for instance -- was far easier in theory than in practice.
However, Mr. Hamilton did find reason to be hopeful. His research found that the Fed could lower long-term interest rates by selling short-term Treasury securities and buying longer-term securities. He also found that quantitative easing -- the strategy of buying long-term assets to lower long-term rates -- could be similarly effective.
Fear of deflation has loomed before. In 2003, as the economy recovered from the mild recession of 2001, Fed policy makers warned that further disinflation, or a slowdown in inflation, would be "unwelcome." Mr. Bernanke called the moment "something of a watershed," because "central banks, for the first time in decades, had to take seriously the possibility that inflation can be too low as well as too high."
To prop up the economy the Fed bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and government debt last year and earlier this year. It is now considering resuming debt purchases, partly to stave off deflation.
Mr. Hamilton expressed hope for quantitative easing but said it might require creating huge sums of money. "If hundreds of billions are not enough to make much difference, then perhaps purchases in the trillions, such as the Fed has embarked upon with its holdings of mortgage-backed securities, might do the trick," he wrote.
That argument seemed to find support from Kazuo Ueda, an economist at the University of Tokyo, who said that the Bank of Japan's continuing fight against deflation might have been more effective had the central bank bought Japanese government bonds "on a much larger scale" than it has.

Abstract: In a recent working paper based on census data for the 100 most populous counties in the United States, Adam Seth Levine (a postdoctoral researcher in political science at Vanderbilt University), Oege Dijk (an economics Ph.D. student at the European University Institute) and I found that the counties where income inequality grew fastest also showed the biggest increases in symptoms of financial distress. Divorce rates are another reliable indicator of financial distress, as marriage counselors report that a high proportion of couples they see are experiencing significant financial problems.

Full text: PEOPLE often remember the past with exaggerated fondness. Sometimes, however, important aspects of life really were better in the old days.
During the three decades after World War II, for example, incomes in the United States rose rapidly and at about the same rate -- almost 3 percent a year -- for people at all income levels. America had an economically vibrant middle class. Roads and bridges were well maintained, and impressive new infrastructure was being built. People were optimistic.
By contrast, during the last three decades the economy has grown much more slowly, and our infrastructure has fallen into grave disrepair. Most troubling, all significant income growth has been concentrated at the top of the scale. The share of total income going to the top 1 percent of earners, which stood at 8.9 percent in 1976, rose to 23.5 percent by 2007, but during the same period, the average inflation-adjusted hourly wage declined by more than 7 percent.
Yet many economists are reluctant to confront rising income inequality directly, saying that whether this trend is good or bad requires a value judgment that is best left to philosophers. But that disclaimer rings hollow. Economics, after all, was founded by moral philosophers, and links between the disciplines remain strong. So economists are well positioned to address this question, and the answer is very clear.
Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, was a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow. His first book, "A Theory of Moral Sentiments," was published more than 25 years before his celebrated "Wealth of Nations," which was itself peppered with trenchant moral analysis.
Some moral philosophers address inequality by invoking principles of justice and fairness. But because they have been unable to forge broad agreement about what these abstract principles mean in practice, they've made little progress. The more pragmatic cost-benefit approach favored by Smith has proved more fruitful, for it turns out that rising inequality has created enormous losses and few gains, even for its ostensible beneficiaries.
Recent research on psychological well-being has taught us that beyond a certain point, across-the-board spending increases often do little more than raise the bar for what is considered enough. A C.E.O. may think he needs a 30,000-square-foot mansion, for example, just because each of his peers has one. Although they might all be just as happy in more modest dwellings, few would be willing to downsize on their own.
People do not exist in a social vacuum. Community norms define clear expectations about what people should spend on interview suits and birthday parties. Rising inequality has thus spawned a multitude of "expenditure cascades," whose first step is increased spending by top earners.
The rich have been spending more simply because they have so much extra money. Their spending shifts the frame of reference that shapes the demands of those just below them, who travel in overlapping social circles. So this second group, too, spends more, which shifts the frame of reference for the group just below it, and so on, all the way down the income ladder. These cascades have made it substantially more expensive for middle-class families to achieve basic financial goals.
In a recent working paper based on census data for the 100 most populous counties in the United States, Adam Seth Levine (a postdoctoral researcher in political science at Vanderbilt University), Oege Dijk (an economics Ph.D. student at the European University Institute) and I found that the counties where income inequality grew fastest also showed the biggest increases in symptoms of financial distress.
For example, even after controlling for other factors, these counties had the largest increases in bankruptcy filings.
Divorce rates are another reliable indicator of financial distress, as marriage counselors report that a high proportion of couples they see are experiencing significant financial problems. The counties with the biggest increases in inequality also reported the largest increases in divorce rates.
Another footprint of financial distress is long commute times, because families who are short on cash often try to make ends meet by moving to where housing is cheaper -- in many cases, farther from work. The counties where long commute times had grown the most were again those with the largest increases in inequality.
The middle-class squeeze has also reduced voters' willingness to support even basic public services. Rich and poor alike endure crumbling roads, weak bridges, an unreliable rail system, and cargo containers that enter our ports without scrutiny. And many Americans live in the shadow of poorly maintained dams that could collapse at any moment.
ECONOMISTS who say we should relegate questions about inequality to philosophers often advocate policies, like tax cuts for the wealthy, that increase inequality substantially. That greater inequality causes real harm is beyond doubt.
But are there offsetting benefits?
There is no persuasive evidence that greater inequality bolsters economic growth or enhances anyone's well-being. Yes, the rich can now buy bigger mansions and host more expensive parties. But this appears to have made them no happier. And in our winner-take-all economy, one effect of the growing inequality has been to lure our most talented graduates to the largely unproductive chase for financial bonanzas on Wall Street.
In short, the economist's cost-benefit approach -- itself long an important arrow in the moral philosopher's quiver -- has much to say about the effects of rising inequality. We need not reach agreement on all philosophical principles of fairness to recognize that it has imposed considerable harm across the income scale without generating significant offsetting benefits.
No one dares to argue that rising inequality is required in the name of fairness. So maybe we should just agree that it's a bad thing -- and try to do something about it.

Full text: OSAKA, Japan -- Like many members of Japan's middle class, Masato Y. enjoyed a level of affluence two decades ago that was the envy of the world. Masato, a small-business owner, bought a $500,000 condominium, vacationed in Hawaii and drove a late-model Mercedes.
But his living standards slowly crumbled along with Japan's overall economy. First, he was forced to reduce trips abroad and then eliminate them. Then he traded the Mercedes for a cheaper domestic model. Last year, he sold his condo -- for a third of what he paid for it, and for less than what he still owed on the mortgage he took out 17 years ago.
"Japan used to be so flashy and upbeat, but now everyone must live in a dark and subdued way," said Masato, 49, who asked that his full name not be used because he still cannot repay the $110,000 that he owes on the mortgage.
Few nations in recent history have seen such a striking reversal of economic fortune as Japan. The original Asian success story, Japan rode one of the great speculative stock and property bubbles of all time in the 1980s to become the first Asian country to challenge the long dominance of the West.
But the bubbles popped in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Japan fell into a slow but relentless decline that neither enormous budget deficits nor a flood of easy money has reversed. For nearly a generation now, the nation has been trapped in low growth and a corrosive downward spiral of prices, known as deflation, in the process shriveling from an economic Godzilla to little more than an afterthought in the global economy.
Now, as the United States and other Western nations struggle to recover from a debt and property bubble of their own, a growing number of economists are pointing to Japan as a dark vision of the future. Even as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, prepares a fresh round of unconventional measures to stimulate the economy, there are growing fears that the United States and many European economies could face a prolonged period of slow growth or even, in the worst case, deflation, something not seen on a sustained basis outside Japan since the Great Depression.
Many economists remain confident that the United States will avoid the stagnation of Japan, largely because of the greater responsiveness of the American political system and Americans' greater tolerance for capitalism's creative destruction. Japanese leaders at first denied the severity of their nation's problems and then spent heavily on job-creating public works projects that only postponed painful but necessary structural changes, economists say.
"We're not Japan," said Robert E. Hall, a professor of economics at Stanford. "In America, the bet is still that we will somehow find ways to get people spending and investing again."
Still, as political pressure builds to reduce federal spending and budget deficits, other economists are now warning of "Japanification" -- of falling into the same deflationary trap of collapsed demand that occurs when consumers refuse to consume, corporations hold back on investments and banks sit on cash. It becomes a vicious, self-reinforcing cycle: as prices fall further and jobs disappear, consumers tighten their purse strings even more and companies cut back on spending and delay expansion plans.
"The U.S., the U.K., Spain, Ireland, they all are going through what Japan went through a decade or so ago," said Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Securities who recently wrote a book about Japan's lessons for the world. "Millions of individuals and companies see their balance sheets going underwater, so they are using their cash to pay down debt instead of borrowing and spending."
Just as inflation scarred a generation of Americans, deflation has left a deep imprint on the Japanese, breeding generational tensions and a culture of pessimism, fatalism and reduced expectations. While Japan remains in many ways a prosperous society, it faces an increasingly grim situation, particularly outside the relative economic vibrancy of Tokyo, and its situation provides a possible glimpse into the future for the United States and Europe, should the most dire forecasts come to pass.
Scaled-Back Ambitions
The downsizing of Japan's ambitions can be seen on the streets of Tokyo, where concrete "microhouses" have become popular among younger Japanese who cannot afford even the famously cramped housing of their parents, or lack the job security to take out a traditional multidecade loan.
These matchbox-size homes stand on plots of land barely large enough to park a sport utility vehicle, yet have three stories of closet-size bedrooms, suitcase-size closets and a tiny kitchen that properly belongs on a submarine.
"This is how to own a house even when you are uneasy about the future," said Kimiyo Kondo, general manager at Zaus, a Tokyo-based company that builds microhouses.
For many people under 40, it is hard to grasp just how far this is from the 1980s, when a mighty -- and threatening -- "Japan Inc." seemed ready to obliterate whole American industries, from automakers to supercomputers. With the Japanese stock market quadrupling and the yen rising to unimagined heights, Japan's companies dominated global business, gobbling up trophy properties like Hollywood movie studios (Universal Studios and Columbia Pictures), famous golf courses (Pebble Beach) and iconic real estate (Rockefeller Center).
In 1991, economists were predicting that Japan would overtake the United States as the world's largest economy by 2010. In fact, Japan's economy remains the same size it was then: a gross domestic product of $5.7 trillion at current exchange rates. During the same period, the United States economy doubled in size to $14.7 trillion, and this year China overtook Japan to become the world's No. 2 economy.
China has so thoroughly eclipsed Japan that few American intellectuals seem to bother with Japan now, and once crowded Japanese-language classes at American universities have emptied. Even Clyde V. Prestowitz, a former Reagan administration trade negotiator whose writings in the 1980s about Japan's threat to the United States once stirred alarm in Washington, said he was now studying Chinese. "I hardly go to Japan anymore," Mr. Prestowitz said.
The decline has been painful for the Japanese, with companies and individuals like Masato having lost the equivalent of trillions of dollars in the stock market, which is now just a quarter of its value in 1989, and in real estate, where the average price of a home is the same as it was in 1983. And the future looks even bleaker, as Japan faces the world's largest government debt -- around 200 percent of gross domestic product -- a shrinking population and rising rates of poverty and suicide.
But perhaps the most noticeable impact here has been Japan's crisis of confidence. Just two decades ago, this was a vibrant nation filled with energy and ambition, proud to the point of arrogance and eager to create a new economic order in Asia based on the yen. Today, those high-flying ambitions have been shelved, replaced by weariness and fear of the future, and an almost stifling air of resignation. Japan seems to have pulled into a shell, content to accept its slow fade from the global stage.
Its once voracious manufacturers now seem prepared to surrender industry after industry to hungry South Korean and Chinese rivals. Japanese consumers, who once flew by the planeload on flashy shopping trips to Manhattan and Paris, stay home more often now, saving their money for an uncertain future or setting new trends in frugality with discount brands like Uniqlo.
As living standards in this still wealthy nation slowly erode, a new frugality is apparent among a generation of young Japanese, who have known nothing but economic stagnation and deflation. They refuse to buy big-ticket items like cars or televisions, and fewer choose to study abroad in America.
Japan's loss of gumption is most visible among its young men, who are widely derided as "herbivores" for lacking their elders' willingness to toil for endless hours at the office, or even to succeed in romance, which many here blame, only half jokingly, for their country's shrinking birthrate. "The Japanese used to be called economic animals," said Mitsuo Ohashi, former chief executive officer of the chemicals giant Showa Denko. "But somewhere along the way, Japan lost its animal spirits."
When asked in dozens of interviews about their nation's decline, Japanese, from policy makers and corporate chieftains to shoppers on the street, repeatedly mention this startling loss of vitality. While Japan suffers from many problems, most prominently the rapid graying of its society, it is this decline of a once wealthy and dynamic nation into a deep social and cultural rut that is perhaps Japan's most ominous lesson for the world today.
The classic explanation of the evils of deflation is that it makes individuals and businesses less willing to use money, because the rational way to act when prices are falling is to hold onto cash, which gains in value. But in Japan, nearly a generation of deflation has had a much deeper effect, subconsciously coloring how the Japanese view the world. It has bred a deep pessimism about the future and a fear of taking risks that make people instinctively reluctant to spend or invest, driving down demand -- and prices -- even further.
"A new common sense appears, in which consumers see it as irrational or even foolish to buy or borrow," said Kazuhisa Takemura, a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo who has studied the psychology of deflation.
A Deflated City
While the effects are felt across Japan's economy, they are more apparent in regions like Osaka, the third-largest city, than in relatively prosperous Tokyo. In this proudly commercial city, merchants have gone to extremes to coax shell-shocked shoppers into spending again. But this often takes the shape of price wars that end up only feeding Japan's deflationary spiral.
There are vending machines that sell canned drinks for 10 yen, or 12 cents; restaurants with 50-yen beer; apartments with the first month's rent of just 100 yen, about $1.22. Even marriage ceremonies are on sale, with discount wedding halls offering weddings for $600 -- less than a tenth of what ceremonies typically cost here just a decade ago.
On Senbayashi, an Osaka shopping street, merchants recently held a 100-yen day, offering much of their merchandise for that price. Even then, they said, the results were disappointing.
"It's like Japanese have even lost the desire to look good," said Akiko Oka, 63, who works part time in a small apparel shop, a job she has held since her own clothing store went bankrupt in 2002.
This loss of vigor is sometimes felt in unusual places. Kitashinchi is Osaka's premier entertainment district, a three-centuries-old playground where the night is filled with neon signs and hostesses in tight dresses, where just taking a seat at a top club can cost $500.
But in the past 15 years, the number of fashionable clubs and lounges has shrunk to 480 from 1,200, replaced by discount bars and chain restaurants. Bartenders say the clientele these days is too cost-conscious to show the studied disregard for money that was long considered the height of refinement.
"A special culture might be vanishing," said Takao Oda, who mixes perfectly crafted cocktails behind the glittering gold countertop at his Bar Oda.
After years of complacency, Japan appears to be waking up to its problems, as seen last year when disgruntled voters ended the virtual postwar monopoly on power of the Liberal Democratic Party. However, for many Japanese, it may be too late. Japan has already created an entire generation of young people who say they have given up on believing that they can ever enjoy the job stability or rising living standards that were once considered a birthright here.
Yukari Higaki, 24, said the only economic conditions she had ever known were ones in which prices and salaries seemed to be in permanent decline. She saves as much money as she can by buying her clothes at discount stores, making her own lunches and forgoing travel abroad. She said that while her generation still lived comfortably, she and her peers were always in a defensive crouch, ready for the worst.
"We are the survival generation," said Ms. Higaki, who works part time at a furniture store.
Hisakazu Matsuda, president of Japan Consumer Marketing Research Institute, who has written several books on Japanese consumers, has a different name for Japanese in their 20s; he calls them the consumption-haters. He estimates that by the time this generation hits their 60s, their habits of frugality will have cost the Japanese economy $420 billion in lost consumption.
"There is no other generation like this in the world," Mr. Matsuda said. "These guys think it's stupid to spend."
Deflation has also affected businesspeople by forcing them to invent new ways to survive in an economy where prices and profits only go down, not up.
Yoshinori Kaiami was a real estate agent in Osaka, where, like the rest of Japan, land prices have been falling for most of the past 19 years. Mr. Kaiami said business was tough. There were few buyers in a market that was virtually guaranteed to produce losses, and few sellers, because most homeowners were saddled with loans that were worth more than their homes.
Some years ago, he came up with an idea to break the gridlock. He created a company that guides homeowners through an elaborate legal subterfuge in which they erase the original loan by declaring personal bankruptcy, but continue to live in their home by "selling" it to a relative, who takes out a smaller loan to pay its greatly reduced price.
"If we only had inflation again, this sort of business would not be necessary," said Mr. Kaiami, referring to the rising prices that are the opposite of deflation. "I feel like I've been waiting for 20 years for inflation to come back."
One of his customers was Masato, the small-business owner, who sold his four-bedroom condo to a relative for about $185,000, 15 years after buying it for a bit more than $500,000. He said he was still deliberating about whether to expunge the $110,000 he still owed his bank by declaring personal bankruptcy.
Economists said one reason deflation became self-perpetuating was that it pushed companies and people like Masato to survive by cutting costs and selling what they already owned, instead of buying new goods or investing.
"Deflation destroys the risk-taking that capitalist economies need in order to grow," said Shumpei Takemori, an economist at Keio University in Tokyo. "Creative destruction is replaced with what is just destructive destruction."

Full text: The Federal Reserve has yet to act, but officials in Europe and Russia are already complaining about the prospect of a much weaker dollar. More Fed intervention could ultimately do the global economy good -- especially if it gets China to stop cheapening its currency and squeezing out the rest of the world's exports.
A lot of countries are hurting. Very few, except the United States, are speaking out. Some governments are instead choosing to manipulate their own currencies.
South Korea has been frantically buying dollars to cheapen the won. Japan, which intervened in its market but failed to stop the yen's rise, is now insisting that Beijing and Seoul "act responsibly." Thailand imposed measures to stop incoming money from pushing up the already artificially low value of the baht.
Everybody can't devalue at once. And competitive devaluations won't change China's behavior.
If Beijing is determined to keep its currency down after the Fed acts, it will have to buy billions of dollars of Treasury bonds and other assets -- even as the dollar falls. Printing renminbi to buy the dollars would fuel inflation and bubbles in stocks and housing. Trying to avoid that by issuing bonds would also be expensive.
China has a better option: it can let the renminbi rise. Beijing's leaders know the country needs to become more reliant on domestic income and spending. They are also fearful of any change that might have unintended political consequences. Washington's lectures have only provoked more bluster.
The euro area of the European Union and Japan -- their economies are weaker than ours and are also taking a battering from Chinese exports -- should emulate the Fed, pump more money into their economies and lower the values of their currencies. That would increase the pressure on Beijing to let the renminbi rise. If they coordinated with the Fed, they could avoid sharp fluctuations among the dollar, the euro and the yen.
Other developing countries with stronger economies and higher inflation, like Brazil, would be faced with the same choice as China: inflation or letting their currencies rise. That would be painful. But if the United States slips back into recession, it will be devastating for world growth, including their own.

Full text: IT'S been a rough decade for the stock market -- even when considering its recent rally. But frustrated investors can at least fall back on a comforting thought: that the market will eventually "revert to the mean," or snap back to its historical average returns.
Or can they? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be "not necessarily" -- or at least "not immediately." For starters, while it's true that the past decade has been unusually difficult for stocks, theoretically setting the stage for a rebound, the same can't be said for the last 20 years.
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's, points out that over 20-year periods since 1919, the average annual price gain for stocks has been 6.8 percent. And even with the market's losses from 2000 to this year, the S.& P. 500-stock index has still appreciated 7.8 percent a year, on average, in the most recent 20-year stretch. When you factor in dividends, the market has performed even better: up around 10 percent a year, on average.
"On a 20-year basis, we're only now getting back to the mean," Mr. Stovall said. This would imply that the market, despite the so-called lost decade of the 2000s, isn't necessarily coiled like a spring, ready to explode higher.
Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, also finds little immediate comfort in the prospect of reverting to the mean. He argues that the go-nowhere market of the last dozen years is itself such a reversion, but in a negative fashion -- in response to the booming bull markets of the 1980s and '90s.
To be sure, it's extremely rare for stocks to lose ground over the course of an entire decade, especially when you factor in dividends. So the laws of probability would suggest that stocks are likely to perform better in the coming 10 years than they did in the past 10.
But even if stocks start to rebound, John S. Osterweis, president of Osterweis Capital Management in San Francisco, wonders, "Which mean will stocks revert to?"
In theory, stocks could revisit their long-term historical total return of around 10 percent a year, going back to 1926. But several market strategists and historians say domestic stocks will have a hard time producing such returns in the coming years.
For example, stock performance over the past century includes the time when the United States market was evolving from an emerging player in the global economy to the world's economic superpower. Elroy Dimson, a finance professor at the London Business School, argues that because this early period of growth can't be replicated, investors ought to brace for more modest returns.
At the same time, some market strategists worry that using more recent averages -- for instance, the nearly 11 percent annualized total returns for stocks since 1980 or the 9 percent since 1990 -- is also misleading.
That's because those returns reflect a historic drop in interest rates and inflation, both of which served as major tail winds for stocks. Those trends were also coupled with an huge climb in market valuation that isn't likely to be repeated, says Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the investment management firm Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif.
He says that instead of waiting for stock performance to return to the mean, investors would do better to pay attention to whether price-to-earnings ratios are reverting to long-term averages.
That could take a while. Mr. Arnott uses 10-year averaged earnings to calculate the market's P/E, a conservative method that smoothes out extreme swings in corporate profits. The method is favored by Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist.
Despite the market's recent troubles, its P/E ratio, based on this method, currently stands at 21. That's significantly higher than the long-term average of 16 for domestic stocks.
Until that changes, stocks are likely to be in store for below-average returns, Mr. Arnott argues. In fact, since 1900, whenever P/E ratios have ranged from 16 to 24, stocks have gained about 7 percent, annualized, on a nominal basis -- or 4 percent after inflation -- in the following 10-year stretch.
For his part, Mr. Arnott says he thinks that stocks are likely to produce total returns of about 6 percent a year. He comes to that figure by taking the current 2 percent dividend yield for the S.& P. 500 and adding it to the long-term earnings growth rate of around 4 percent.
Whatever figure turns out to be right, the bottom line is that "people should ratchet down their expectations for stocks," he said.
"There's no harm in hoping that things turn out better," Mr. Arnott added. "But the danger is assuming and planning for the best while saving as if the market can do your work for you."

Full text: Stocks were mixed Friday as investors weighed encouraging retail news and signs of new Fed measures to bolster the economy against the impact of the tangled foreclosure process on the nation's banks.
On Friday, a spate of economic statistics and corporate results kept analysts sifting through potential outcomes for the stock market and economic recovery. Financial stocks closed down more than 1 percent, while technology shares rose.
The market opened higher shortly after the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested in a speech in Boston that the Fed was prepared to manage the risks associated with new purchases of government debt to lower long-term interest rates to stimulate the economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 31.79 points, or 0.3 percent, at 11,062.78. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.38 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,176.19, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 33.39 points, or 1.4 percent, at 2,468.77.
The Dow and S.& P. each were up less than 1 percent in the week, while the Nasdaq ended the week 2.7 percent higher, helped by a rise in Google.
But financial stocks were hit hard, down more than 1.7 percent, the most of any sector. On Wednesday, 50 state attorneys general announced that they were investigating the practices of the mortgage servicing industry. Concerns over the extent to which the foreclosure problems would hit banks' bottom lines were evident in the stock market on Thursday, and the declines continued on Friday. First Horizon National was down nearly 8 percent at $10.03. SunTrust Banks was down 4.7 percent at $24.38, and Bank of America declined nearly 5 percent, to $11.98.
Citigroup, the most actively traded of the banks, was more than 2.7 percent lower at $3.95. JPMorgan Chase was down more than 4 percent at $37.15, and Capital One declined 7.6 percent at $36.86.
"The financial sector is still being impacted by this issue of the foreclosure conundrum," said Brian A. Bethune, an IHS Global Insight economist. "It is very hard to say how that is going t0 play out."
And while the market has long been anticipating the Fed measures, economists downgraded the potential impact of new quantitative easing by the Fed. Some analysts said the market had already accounted for the effect of any easing measures, which the presidents of the regional banks had been discussing for weeks.
"They are all moving in that direction," said Mr. Bethune. "All the chairman is doing is summarizing and pulling it together. It is pretty clear where they are going. The question is, Will it impact the economy? And the answer is yes, but it is not going to be overnight."
Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics, said such quantitative easing measures might lower long-term interest rates and stimulate the stock market "a bit more."
But he added, "At this stage, $500 billion or even $1 trillion is probably just not going to do it."
"With mortgage rates and corporate bond yields already close to record lows, however, we doubt that would have any meaningful impact on the wider economy," Mr. Ashworth wrote in a research note.
There were also new economic statistics to mull over on Friday. Retail sales for September were a rare bright spot, climbing by 0.6 percent over all and beating forecasts.
The rise came after upward revisions to August and July, both of which projected a stronger picture of consumer spending in the third quarter than previously thought.
"Consumers are starting to pick up spending after a relatively weak showing in the first half of the summer despite a steady stream of poor news on the employment and financial fronts," said Chris Christopher, the IHS Global Insight United States economist.
Inflation was 0.1 percent, with the core index flat for another month, the Commerce Department reported.
Quarterly results continued to trickle out, with results from bellwether stocks affecting the direction of some of the main indexes.
General Electric reported that its third-quarter profit fell 18 percent, with revenue soft from sales of industrial equipment, although orders for industrial goods and services grew.
Its shares were down more than 5 percent at $16.30.
Google shares buoyed the Nasdaq. Google reported on Thursday that revenue climbed 23 percent and net income rose 32 percent. On Friday the share closed up more than 11 percent at $601.45.

Full text: The economy continued to show little sign of inflation as consumer prices eased marginally in September, while consumers provided a glimmer of hope for the retail sector, government reports said on Friday.
The Labor Department said that the Consumer Price Index, a benchmark measure of inflation, increased 0.1 percent in September, compared with a 0.3 percent rise in August and the same increase in July, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, the core index was flat in September, the same as in August. It had risen 0.1 percent in July and 0.2 percent in June.
Year-over-year core inflation was up 0.8 percent. It had been running at 0.9 percent for five consecutive months, its lowest level in more than 50 years.
The consumer price results for September were slightly below analysts' forecasts, which had called for a 0.2 percent rise in September and a 0.1 percent increase in the core index.
The figures were the latest in a series of economic indicators this week suggesting that growth would remain sluggish for the rest of the year, given the slowdown in jobs and output.
In addition, the Producer Price Index on Thursday registered a slight rise, suggesting that the environment was not deflationary, said Anthony Chan, the chief economist at J. P. Morgan Private Wealth Management.
The latest statistics "are telling us that the economy is in less danger of a double dip," he added.
But the bottom line for the recovery still remains pinned on job growth. "We are going to continue to grow positively, but maybe not strong enough to make the progress the central bank wants to lower unemployment," Mr. Chan said.
This week the government also said that weekly claims for unemployment insurance reached 462,000 as of the week of Oct. 9. And the trade deficit widened to $46.3 billion in August, with the deficit with China reaching a record. Some economists say they believe the trade deficit will be a drag on growth.
Separately, Reuters reported that consumer sentiment in the United States declined in early October to its weakest level since July.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary October reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment was 67.9, down from 68.2 in September and below the 69.0 median forecast among economists polled by Reuters.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions was at the lowest level since November 2009. The index was at 73 in early October, compared with 79.6 in September and 79.8 forecast by analysts, Reuters reported.
On Friday, new statistics for retail sales provided a bright spot for consumer spending, which is a cornerstone component of economic growth, by climbing more than forecast last month.
The Department of Commerce reported that retail sales picked up in September by 0.6 percent over all, up from a revised 0.7 percent rise in August and above forecasts of 0.4 percent. When the volatile auto sales and gas components are stripped from the equation, retail sales were up 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.9 percent revision for the previous month.
The upward revision to the retail sales number "does kind of offer a glimmer of hope that consumer spending is not falling off a cliff," Mr. Chan said.
A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also suggested some resilience in the economy. The Empire State manufacturing index for this month registered 15.73, up from 4.14 in September, with growth propelled by the new orders and employment sections of the index.
The data was released weeks ahead of a meeting on Nov. 2-3 of Federal Reserve policy makers, who many economists and analysts expect will announce a new round of quantitative easing.
At their meeting on Aug. 10, policy makers decided to use proceeds from the Fed's mortgage bonds to buy long-term Treasury securities.
"QE2 in my view is a 'done deal' and the Fed will re-engage this process at the November F.O.M.C. meeting," Tom di Galoma, head of fixed-income rates trading at Guggenheim Partners, said in a research note. "We expect $1 trillion in size for QE2," he said.
"The most substantial reason for this decision by the Fed is to simply keep the economy afloat during times of uncertainty as it relates to the high unemployment picture, subpar growth and the backdrop of a disinflationary environment," Mr. di Galoma said.

Bernanke Weighs Risks of New Action

Abstract: Mr. Bernanke noted that one key measure of inflation -- the price index for personal consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy prices -- had fallen to about 1.1 percent over the first eight months of this year, from about 2.5 percent in the early stages of the recession. "Whereas monetary policy makers clearly have the ability to determine the inflation rate in the long run, they have little or no control over the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate, which is primarily determined by demographic and structural factors, not by monetary policy," he said.

Full text: BOSTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, went further on Friday in outlining the risks the central bank was prepared to take by pumping more money into the flagging recovery.
In formal remarks here, Mr. Bernanke explained a viewpoint that had taken shape gradually over several months. The Fed hoped to calm debate over its next move and prepare markets for the likelihood that it would pour money into the economy by resuming purchases of government, and possibly private, debt.
The new action would be aimed at lowering long-term interest rates and spurring growth, but it would also have effects far beyond American shores. It could contribute to the weakening of the dollar and complicate a festering currency dispute that threatens to disrupt global trade relations.
For Americans, additional Fed activity is likely to mean that already low 30-year mortgage rates would fall even further. The moves would not help many savers, however, as yields on certificates of deposit and savings bonds would probably fall as well. But the Fed hopes that making credit even cheaper will encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, and that could eventually bring relief to jobless workers.
Mr. Bernanke's remarks, at a conference organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, confirmed Wall Street analysts' expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee would approve new steps at its next meeting on Nov. 2-3.
The question now is not whether the Fed will resume the debt-buying strategy known as quantitative easing, but how much it will buy, and how quickly, analysts said. Mr. Bernanke did not offer such details.
The stock markets, which have risen since the Fed took an incremental step in August toward additional monetary easing, largely shrugged off Mr. Bernanke's remarks, though new stimulus efforts would probably raise equity prices, at least in the short run. Stocks ended mixed, with the Dow Jones industrial average slightly lower and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up slightly.
In the past, the Fed sometimes changed rates when the market didn't expect it. But in this difficult economy, it felt it had to telegraph its moves well in advance so as not to disturb markets or other major economies.
The economic outlook offered by Mr. Bernanke was sobering. He said that the rate of growth was "less vigorous than we would like," and that the unemployment rate was likely to "decline only slowly" next year, even as the recovery gains steam.
Mr. Bernanke centered his analysis on the Fed's "dual mandate" to foster maximum employment and price stability. He said that inflation was "too low" relative to the desired rate of "about 2 percent or a bit below," and that unemployment was "clearly too high" relative to Fed officials' long-run forecast of 5 to 5.25 percent.
"Given the committee's objectives, there would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case for further action," Mr. Bernanke said.
Mr. Bernanke noted that one key measure of inflation -- the price index for personal consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy prices -- had fallen to about 1.1 percent over the first eight months of this year, from about 2.5 percent in the early stages of the recession.
Weighing in on a debate that has preoccupied Fed officials, Mr. Bernanke planted himself on the side of those who view the high unemployment rate -- 9.6 percent -- as an outcome of the sharp contraction in economic demand that followed the financial crisis, rather than of structural factors like a mismatch between workers' qualifications and the skills required by employers.
But Mr. Bernanke acknowledged, with greater candor than Fed officials usually have, the tension between the two parts of the Fed's mandate.
"Whereas monetary policy makers clearly have the ability to determine the inflation rate in the long run, they have little or no control over the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate, which is primarily determined by demographic and structural factors, not by monetary policy," he said.
In interviews, economists at the conference here offered mixed reactions.
"The Fed is trying to achieve too much," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. "They want to stimulate demand, but there are a lot of nonmonetary factors that are inhibiting the economy, including distressed mortgages and foreclosures, the need for households to save, and a whole array of factors deterring businesses from hiring."
John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist, disagreed with Mr. Bernanke's conclusions. "From my perspective, the cost-benefit analysis would suggest that it wouldn't be a good idea to do a big, massive quantitative easing because the gains are quite small in terms of the impact on interest rates," he said.
But Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor, defended Mr. Bernanke's stance.
"If the economy has a negative shock, or continues to grow as slowly as it has, it's going to be sliding toward deflation," he said. "The Fed can't sit on its hands," he added, and should pursue additional action "as long as it has an effect -- even if it's small."
Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, said more Fed action "should be positive for economic growth, though the amount is uncertain."
The Fed lowered short-term rates to nearly zero in December 2008 and then pursued its first round of quantitative easing beginning in 2009. By April this year, it had bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-related debt and Treasury securities to put downward pressure on long-term rates.
As recently as the spring, the Fed was considering when and how it would begin to raise interest rates. But as the recovery stumbled, the Fed reversed course, and by late summer it was debating how best to prop up the recovery.
Mr. Bernanke cautioned that "unconventional policies have costs and limitations that must be taken into account in judging whether and how aggressively they should be used."
He admitted that the debt-buying strategy was largely untested. "We have much less experience in judging the economic effects of this policy instrument, which makes it challenging to determine the appropriate quantity and pace of purchases and to communicate this policy response to the public," he said.
And he acknowledged a fear that new asset purchases might "reduce public confidence" in the Fed's ability to eventually make a smooth return to normal monetary policy and lead to "an undesired increase in inflation expectations." But he said he was confident that the Fed could tighten policy when the time came.
Along with more quantitative easing, the Fed could communicate that it intended to keep short-term interest rates low for even longer than markets expected. That could help lower longer-term rates, as they partly reflect expectations of future short-term rates. But Mr. Bernanke appeared to play down that option, saying it would be difficult to convey that intention "with sufficient precision and conditionality."

Full text: The United States trade deficit widened in August, with the politically charged imbalance with China reaching its highest mark on record, according to government figures released Thursday.
The trade deficit grew to $46.3 billion, up from a revised $42.6 billion in July and exceeding forecasts for a gap of around $44 billion. The deficit with China accounted for $28 billion of the August shortfall, up from $25.9 billion the month before.
The widening gap with China comes amid rising concerns in Washington about China's trade dominance and its effect on the global economic recovery. The Obama administration and some lawmakers are pressing China to allow its currency to appreciate more quickly, hoping it will temper Chinese exports by making them more expensive.
With a high unemployment rate in the United States, trade and currency issues with China have become a particularly delicate topic in the run-up to the midterm elections, with some members of Congress threatening to impose import tariffs on China. Beijing has defended its strategy, saying that it wants to allow its currency to fluctuate with market forces in its own time.
"The widening in the international trade deficit in August, and in particular the jump in the bilateral deficit with China to a record high, will only fuel growing speculation of a currency war," economists from Capital Economics said in a research note.
But some economists cautioned against oversimplifying the solution to the imbalance, saying that there needed to be a change in consumer preferences in the United States along with any change in policy.
"The only way this works in reducing the U.S. trade deficit is if U.S. consumers shift their consumption of Chinese goods to U.S.-produced goods," said Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company. "You need to increase the appeal of U.S.-based goods."
Steven Ricchiuto, the chief economist for Mizuho Securities USA, said adjustments needed to be made throughout the American economy. He said companies would need to start investing some of their extensive cash holdings, improving the rate of return for local production and potentially ramping up employment and demand.
"It is not easy to improve a trade deficit just by adjusting currencies," he said.
The overall deficit is now at an annual rate of $502.5 billion, up 34 percent from the $374.9 billion deficit for 2009.
The government reported that exports totaled $153.9 billion in August, while imports were $200.2 billion. The imports total reflected a rise in consumer goods, capital goods, automobiles, parts and engines. Petroleum accounted for about a third of the increase in the deficit, but a $1.5 billion decline in the volatile aircraft sector could be reversed in September, Yelena Shulyatyeva, a United States economist with BNP Paribas, noted in a statement.
The report suggested that trade would continue to be a drag on growth in the third quarter and a closely watched indicator as the United States continues to recover from the recession.
Recent slowdowns in job and output growth have weighed on economic forecasts for the remainder of 2010. On Thursday, first-time claims for unemployment insurance provided the latest sign of a weak labor market, reaching 462,000 in the week of Oct. 9, an increase of 13,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said. Economists had expected the number to go down, by 4,000.
The figures followed Friday's snapshot of the labor market, which that showed the economy lost 95,000 nonfarm jobs in September.
"The claims numbers show you the economy is moving at such a glacial pace that nothing is really improving there," Mr. Ricchiuto said.
Inflation in terms of producer prices remained stable in September, rising by 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent gain in August, the Labor Department said. The core index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by a slight 0.1 percent last month, in line with expectations.
Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said the underlying price trend of the core finished goods index was benign.
"It remains our belief that copious global spare capacity will keep it that way at least in the near term," he said in a research note.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- China said Wednesday that its exports continued to surge in September and that the nation's foreign exchange reserves ballooned last month, data that is likely to keep pressure on Beijing to appreciate its currency.
The government said its monthly trade surplus reached $16.9 billion in September, with exports up 25 percent and imports climbing 24 percent.
The surplus narrowed from August, when it had reached $20 billion, but it was still an enormous figure, analysts said.
Also Wednesday, Beijing said its foreign exchange reserves soared $194 billion in September to a record $2.65 trillion, far more than economists had forecast. China already had, by far, the world's largest currency reserve holdings.
The gains show that China's fast-growing economy is chugging along and that huge amounts of foreign capital continue to flow into the country, complicating Beijing's economic policies and threatening to feed inflation and asset bubbles.
"China's facing a big challenge," said Wang Tao, an economist based in Beijing at UBS. "The trade surplus is coming down, but it's still going to be $180 billion this year. And the reserve figure was $194 billion. That's huge."
In the United States, Europe, Japan and elsewhere, there are growing worries about China's trade dominance and its effect on countries struggling to emerge from a sharp global slowdown.
Nowhere are those worries more intense than in Washington, where the Obama administration and some members of Congress are pressing China to move more quickly to appreciate its currency, hoping such a move will temper Chinese exports by making them more costly while bolstering American exports to China.
As Congressional elections approach, with the unemployment rate high, some in Congress are threatening to impose heavy tariffs on imports from China because of the country's currency policies. Some lawmakers say they believe that China is intentionally manipulating its currency to gain trading advantages.
For its part, Beijing has repeatedly said that it intends to allow its currency to appreciate and fluctuate with market forces. But the government insists it has to move at its own pace. Too sharp a move, the government says, could create huge dislocations in the country's coastal factory zones, which employ tens of millions of migrant workers.
Beijing and some prominent economists warn that intense focus on the Chinese currency is fanning protectionist sentiment in the United States and elsewhere. They argue that China did allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate by over 20 percent against the dollar beginning in 2005 and that the effect on trade with the United States was marginal. Raising the value of the renminbi is not a cure-all for global ills, they say.
But China is facing challenges on all fronts. Its huge accumulation of currency reserves was partly because of a rise in the value of the euro and the yen in recent months, but also an indication that foreign investment and capital is flowing into China. Huge influxes of capital are increasing money supplies in China, and the government is already trying to deal with soaring property prices and inflation.
Ms. Wang at UBS said that China was now facing greater pressure to let its currency appreciate but that it also faced risks because the rising value of its currency could encourage even larger inflows of foreign capital from speculators betting that it would go even higher.
Even those who argue that China should not immediately increase the value of its currency are worried. They say that huge trade surpluses are contributing to global imbalances that have dangerous long-term implications for the global economy, creating large surpluses in some regions while others sink in mounting debt.
One way or another, analysts say, China will have to consume more and export less, and the United States, above all, will have to grow by exporting more and consuming less.
But the focus for now seems to be on trade and job growth. In an report issued Wednesday, Qu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC, said that despite reaching $16.9 billion in September, China's trade surplus narrowed, and that trend should continue through the rest of the year, weakening the case for currency appreciation.
But, he added, "pressures from the U.S. are likely to persist in the run-up to the midyear election."

Across the U.S., a Long Recovery Looks Much Like a Recession

Abstract: Born of a record financial collapse, this recession has been more severe than any since the Great Depression and has left an enormous oversupply of houses and office buildings and crippling debt. The decision last week by leading mortgage lenders to freeze foreclosures, and calls for a national moratorium, could cast a long shadow of uncertainty over banks and the housing market.

Full text: This is not what a recovery is supposed to look like.
In Atlanta, the Bank of America tower, the tallest in the Southeast, is nearly a fifth vacant, and bank officials just wrestled a rent cut from the developer. In Cherry Hill, N.J., 10 percent of the houses on the market are so-called short sales, in which sellers ask for less than they owe lenders. And in Arizona, in sun-blasted desert subdivisions, owners speak of hours cut, jobs lost and meals at soup kitchens.
Less than a month before November elections, the United States is mired in a grim New Normal that could last for years. That has policy makers, particularly the Federal Reserve, considering a range of ever more extreme measures, as noted in the minutes of its last meeting, released Tuesday. Call it recession or recovery, for tens of millions of Americans, there's little difference.
Born of a record financial collapse, this recession has been more severe than any since the Great Depression and has left an enormous oversupply of houses and office buildings and crippling debt. The decision last week by leading mortgage lenders to freeze foreclosures, and calls for a national moratorium, could cast a long shadow of uncertainty over banks and the housing market. Put simply, the national economy has fallen so far that it could take years to climb back.
The math yields somber conclusions, with implications not just for this autumn's elections but also -- barring a policy surprise or economic upturn -- for 2012 as well:

At the current rate of job creation, the nation would need nine more years to recapture the jobs lost during the recession. And that doesn't even account for five million or six million jobs needed in that time to keep pace with an expanding population. Even top Obama officials concede the unemployment rate could climb higher still.

Median house prices have dropped 20 percent since 2005. Given an inflation rate of about 2 percent -- a common forecast -- it would take 13 years for housing prices to climb back to their peak, according to Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist at the consulting firm Decision Economics.

Commercial vacancies are soaring, and it could take a decade to absorb the excess in many of the largest cities. The vacancy rate, as of the end of June, stands at 21.4 percent in Phoenix, 19.7 percent in Las Vegas, 18.3 in Dallas/Fort Worth and 17.3 percent in Atlanta, in each case higher than last year, according to the data firm CoStar Group.
Demand is inert. Consumer confidence has tumbled as many are afraid or unable to spend. Families are still paying off -- or walking away from -- debt. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, estimates it will be the end of 2011 before the amount of income that households pay in interest recedes to levels seen before the run-up. Credit card delinquencies are rising.
"No wonder Americans are pessimistic and unhappy," said Mr. Sinai. "The only way we are going to get in gear is to face up to the reality that we are entering a period of austerity."
This dreary accounting should not suggest a nation without strengths. Unemployment rates have come down from their peaks in swaths of the United States, from Vermont to Minnesota to Wisconsin. Port traffic has increased, and employers have created an average of 68,111 jobs a month this year.
After plummeting in 2009, the stock market has spiraled up, buoying retirement accounts and perhaps the spirits of middle-class Americans. As a measure of economic health, though, that gain is overstated. Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, notes that the most profitable companies in the domestic stock indexes generate about 40 percent of their revenue from abroad.
Few doubt the American economy remains capable of electrifying growth, but few expect that any time soon. "We still have a lot of strengths, from a culture of entrepreneurship and venture capitalism, to flexible labor markets and attracting immigrants," said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. "But we're going to be living with the overhang of our financial and debt problems for a long, long time to come."
New shocks could push the nation into another recession or deflation. "We are in a situation where our vulnerability to any new problem is great," said Carmen M. Reinhart, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland.
So troubles ripple outward, as lost jobs, unsold houses and empty offices weigh down the economy and upend lives. Struggles in Arizona, New Jersey and Georgia echo broadly.
Florence, Ariz.
In 2005, Arizona ranked, as usual, second nationally in job growth behind Nevada, its economy predicated on growth. The snowbirds came and construction boomed and land stretched endless and cheap. Then it stopped.
This year, Arizona ranks 42nd in job growth. It has lost 287,000 jobs since the recession began, and the fall has been calamitous.
Renee Wheaton, 38, sits in an old golf cart on the corner of Tangerine and Barley Roads in her subdivision in the desert, an hour south of Phoenix. Her next-door neighbor, an engineer, just lost his job. The man across the street is unemployed.
Her family is not doing so well either. Her husband's hours have been cut by 15 percent, leaving her family of five behind on water and credit card bills -- more or less on everything except the house and car payment. She teaches art, but that's not much in demand.
"I say to myself 'This can't be happening to us: We saved, we worked hard and we're under tremendous stress,' " Ms. Wheaton says. "My husband is a very hard-working man but for the first time, he's having real trouble."
Arizona's poverty rate has jumped to 19.6 percent, the second-highest in the nation after Mississippi. The Association of Arizona Food Banks says demand has nearly doubled in the last 18 months.
Elliott D. Pollack, one of Arizona's foremost economic forecasters, said: "You had an implosion of every sector needed to survive. That's not going to get better fast."
To wander exurban Pinal County, which is where Florence is located, is to find that the unemployment rate tells just half the story. Everywhere, subdivisions sit in the desert, some half-built and some dreamy wisps, like the emerald green putting green sitting amid acres of scrub and cacti. Signs offer discounts, distress sales and rent with the first and second month free.
Discounts do not help if your income is cut in half. Construction workers speak of stringing together 20-hour weeks with odd jobs, and a 45-year-old woman who was a real estate agent talks of her job making minimum wage bathing elderly patients. Many live close to the poverty line, without the conveniences they once took for granted. Pinal's unemployment rate, like that of Arizona, stands at 9.7 percent, but state officials say that the real rate rises closer to 20 percent when part-timers and those who have stopped looking for work are added in.
At an elementary school near Ms. Wheaton's home, an expansion of the school's water supply was under way until thieves sneaked in at night and tore the copper pipes out of the ground to sell for scrap.
Five miles southwest, in Coolidge, a desert town within view of the distant Superstition Mountains, demand has tripled at Tom Hunt's food pantry. Some days he runs out.
Henry Alejandrez, 60, is a roofer who migrated from Texas looking for work. "It's gotten real bad," he says. "I'm a citizen, and you're lucky if you get minimum wage."
Mary Sepeda, his sister, nods. She used to drive two hours to clean newly constructed homes before they were sold. That job evaporated with the housing market. (Arizona issued 62,500 housing permits several years ago; it gave out 8,400 last year.)
"It's getting crazy," she says, holding up a white plastic bag of pantry food. "How does this end?"
You put that question to Mr. Pollack, the forecaster. "We won't recover until we absorb 80,000 empty houses and office buildings and people can borrow again," he says.
When will that be?
"I'm forecasting recovery by 2013 to 2015," he says.
Cherry Hill, N.J.
The housing market in this bedroom community just across the border from Philadelphia never leapt to the frenzied heights of Miami Beach or Las Vegas. But even if foreclosure notices are not tacked to every other door, a malaise has settled over the market. Home prices have fallen by 16 percent since 2006, and houses now take twice as long to sell as they did five years ago.
That's enough to inflict pain on homeowners who need to sell because of a job loss or drop in income. Some are being forced to get rid of their houses in short sales, asking less than they owe on a mortgage. As of last week, 10 percent of all listings in this well-tended suburb were being offered as short sales.
Chrysanthemums bloomed in boxes on the porch of one of those homes as a real estate broker unlocked the front door. In the kitchen, children's chores were listed neatly on an erasable white board. Dinner simmered in a Crock-Pot on the counter.
There were few signs of the financial distress that prompted the owners to put their four-bedroom colonial on the market for less than they paid five years ago.
The colonial's owners, James and Patricia Furrow, bought near the top of the market in 2005 for $289,900. Mr. Furrow, 48, retired in July after 26 years as a corrections officer and supplements his pension with work as a handyman. But his income is spotty, and his wife, who works in a school cafeteria, does not earn enough to cover the mortgage on the house where they live with their three children.
They have already missed a payment; they want to sell the house in hopes their lender will forgive the shortfall between their loan balance and the lower sale price. They are asking $279,900.
"When we did buy, the market was still moving pretty good," said Mr. Furrow. "Then it got to the point where people said it is not going to last. And of course it didn't last."
Some of the homes being offered at distressed prices are dragging down prices for less troubled homeowners who hope to sell. And with foreclosures now in disarray, the market could be further weakened. "Even someone who is trying to sell a normal, well-maintained house is at the mercy of these low prices," said Walter Bud Crane, an agent with Re/Max of Cherry Hill.
So the houses sit, awaiting offers that rarely materialize. According to Mr. Crane, the average number of days that homes sit on the market has nearly doubled, to 62 this year from 32 in 2005. Buyers are chary, not sure if their jobs are secure. Open houses draw sparse crowds.
In Camden County, where Cherry Hill sits, unemployment is near 10 percent. Several large employers have closed or conducted huge layoffs, and others have pruned hours. With Gov. Chris Christie reining in spending, government workers are jittery.
Real estate agents say it has rarely been a better time to buy: interest rates are at record lows, house prices have fallen and the selection is large.
Tara Stewart-Becker, a 28-year-old financial services manager, said she and her husband would love to buy a sprawling fixer-upper just three blocks from the narrow colonial they purchased four years ago in Riverton, which backs onto the Delaware River.
But a bad kitchen flood and a loan to pay for repairs has left Ms. Becker and her husband, Eric, owing more on their mortgage than the house is currently worth. Even though the couple make far more money than they did when they bought their house and could afford a larger loan and renovations, they cannot sell.
"I would gladly take a new mortgage and stimulate the economy for the rest of my life," Ms. Becker said.
"Unfortunately, there isn't anything that a government or a bank can do," she added. "You just have to settle for less and wait."
Atlanta
Long fast-growing, no-holds-barred Atlanta has burned to the ground before, figuratively and in reality, and each time it was a phoenix rising. But this recession has cut deeper than any since the Great Depression and left Atlanta's commercial and high-end condo real estate in an economic coma.
Over all, assuming a robust growth rate, industry leaders say it could take 12 years for Atlanta to absorb excess commercial space.
"That one -- see it?" Alan Wexler points to a gleaming blue tower as he drives. "A Chicago bank took it over six months ago. Sold at a 40 percent discount."
"And over there" -- he juts his chin at a boarded-up hotel topped by a Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant crown. "That was going to be a condo. They just shut it down and walked away."
Mr. Wexler, a wiry and peripatetic real estate data analyst, describes it all on a drive down Peachtree Road, Atlanta's posh commercial spine.
He starts in the Buckhead neighborhood, which has more than two million square feet of vacant commercial space. A billboard outside one discounted condo tower promises "New Pricing from the $290s!" There are towers half-empty and towers in receivership. Office buildings that once sold for $85 million now retail for $35 million.
Approaching downtown, Mr. Wexler hits the brakes and points to an older, white marble building. "See that one? It's the Fed Reserve. That's where they sit, look, sweat and wonder: How did we get into this mess?"
That's a question much on the minds and lips of residents.
The commercial vacancy rate in Buckhead is near 20 percent, and the Atlanta region has added jobs only at the low end.
Mike Alexander, research division chief for the Atlanta Regional Commission, posed the question: "When do we start to add premium jobs again?"
Lawrence L. Gellerstedt III, chief executive of Cousins Properties, sits in an office high atop an elegant Philip Johnson tower, with a grand view of the Atlanta commercial corridor running north. He does not see improvement on the horizon.
"We're all wondering what gets the economy producing jobs and growth again," he says. "Atlanta always was the fair-haired child of real estate growth and now, it's 'O.K., poster boy, you're getting yours.' "
Small banks are a particular disaster, 43 having gone under in Georgia since 2008. (Federal regulators closed 129 nationally this year, up from 25 last year.) Real estate was the beginning, the middle and the end of the troubles. In one deal, dozens of Atlanta banks invested in Merrill Ranch, a 4,508-acre tract of desert south of Phoenix.
The deal imploded and took a lot of banks with it.
"No one was demanding documents or reading the fine print, and mortgage banks were fat and happy," recalls John Little, a developer. "Well, that train couldn't keep running."
He has a ringside seat on this debacle, as he sits in the office of a handsome condo complex he built in west Atlanta. He faced price discounts so deep that he decided to rent it instead.
Nationwide banks have no interest in lending to local developers, and the regional banks are desperate for cash and calling in their loans.
Mr. Little got lucky; he bought out his loan and kept his property. "Most of my generation of builders has gone under," he said. "It's still spiraling out of control."

Full text: First it was heat and drought in Russia. Then it was heat and too much rain in parts of the American Corn Belt. Extreme weather this year has sent grain prices soaring, jolting commodities markets and setting off fears of tight supplies that could eventually hit consumers' wallets.
In the latest market lurch, corn prices dropped in early October, then soared anew, in response to changing assessments by the federal government of grain supplies and coming harvests.
The sudden movements in commodities markets are expected to have little immediate effect on the prices of corn flakes and bread in the grocery store, although American consumers are likely to see some modest price increases for meat, poultry and dairy products.
But experts warn that the impact could be much greater if next year's harvest disappoints and if 2011 grain harvests in the Southern Hemisphere also fall short of the current robust expectations.
"We can live with high commodity prices for a period without seeing much impact at the retail level, but if that persists for several months or a couple of years, then it eventually has to get passed on" to consumers, said Darrel Good, an emeritus professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois.
The rise in prices is a good indication of how volatile the market has become for commodity futures in basic farm products like corn or wheat.
Grain prices started to shoot up over the summer on reports of a catastrophic drought in the major wheat-producing regions of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Prices rose not only for wheat, but also for corn and soybeans, since those grains are interchangeable as animal feed and a drop in wheat production could mean increased demand for the other grains.
Corn prices surged again on Friday after a new report from the United States Agriculture Department said this year's corn crop would be smaller than expected. The harvest is forecast to be 3 percent lower than the 2009 crop, which set a record.
The crop will still probably be the third-largest on record, but demand for corn to be used as animal feed on American farms, in ethanol production and for exports remains high, so supplies are expected to be tight.
December corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade reached a high of $5.84 a bushel in trading on Tuesday. In late June, similar corn futures were trading as low as $3.43. That is a 70 percent jump.
Dr. Good said the average price for the new crop, which will encompass sales through next August, is expected to be a record, at about $5 a bushel, well above the $3.95 average price for the last three crops.
The government's latest harvest forecast suggests that corn supplies into next year will be "precariously tight," said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities, a consulting and brokerage firm in West Des Moines, Iowa. "At these levels, we have to cut back on our usage," he said. "We can either cut back on exports, our ethanol consumption or our feed."
It is not yet clear who will be forced to cut corn consumption.
Federal ethanol mandates mean that production of biofuel from corn will remain high, regardless of price. The export market is also going strong.
Dermot J. Hayes, a finance and economics professor at Iowa State University, said there appear to be signs of what he called panic buying by some Asian purchasers of American grains for animal feed. He said they are continuing to buy even though prices are rising out of fear that prices could go much higher.
"The psychology is, you need corn or soybeans for your diets and let's just buy now rather than wait," Professor Hayes said.
A wild card in the export market is China, which has not historically been a significant buyer of American corn. China surprised experts when it made some purchases earlier this year, but it is not clear if it will be a major buyer of the current crop.
"Everybody will be watching that closely, to see if China is in the market or not," said Dr. Good.
The price increases are good news for American grain farmers, who stand to get far more for their crops than they anticipated when they planted them in the spring.
But they mean hard decisions for livestock and dairy farmers, who were hard hit during the recession and have only recently begun to recover.
Those farmers are likely to respond to higher feed prices by cutting the size of herds, or at least not increasing the number of animals they raise, say farm economists and industry executives. Many farmers will also sell animals at a slightly lower weight. Both those factors will cut supplies of meat and dairy products, eventually pushing prices up.
A similar outcome is expected for the poultry industry.
Other foodstuffs are not likely to see as strong an impact, according to economists.
That is because the cost of basic grains makes up only a small fraction of the total cost of most manufactured foods that contain them, such as breakfast cereals or bread. A large part of the cost of those items comes from transportation, processing and marketing.
The federal government forecasts that food prices will rise as much as 1.5 percent this year and 2 to 3 percent next year. The average annual increase in food prices over the last 10 years was 2.9 percent.
Despite the high commodity prices, economists do not expect a return to the raging food inflation of 2008, when worldwide demand surged and costs were propelled higher by peaking fuel prices. That led to a 5.5 percent increase in food prices in the United States in 2008 and much higher food inflation and food shortages in developing countries.
The Agriculture Department is scheduled to release an updated estimate of this year's crop yield next month.
"There will be a lot of attention focused on the next crop report," said Joseph Glauber, the department's chief economist. "It just appears to be a very, very tight situation, and so there will be a lot of volatility."

Abstract: In her first speech since she was sworn in Oct. 4 as the Fed's second-highest ranking official, Janet L. Yellen acknowledged that expansionary monetary policy -- holding interest rates low to stimulate the economy, as the Fed has been doing for more than two years -- "could provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and excessive risk-taking in the financial system."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials "have no choice" but to try to "contain future bubbles and credit binges" and limit their damage to the economy, the central bank's vice chairwoman said on Monday, detailing the Fed's newly broadened mandate to promote financial stability.
In her first speech since she was sworn in Oct. 4 as the Fed's second-highest ranking official, Janet L. Yellen acknowledged that expansionary monetary policy -- holding interest rates low to stimulate the economy, as the Fed has been doing for more than two years -- "could provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and excessive risk-taking in the financial system."
But Ms. Yellen did not say that such risks should deter the Fed from resuming purchases of government debt to prop up the flagging recovery, an action most Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to take as early as next month.
She is associated with the camp of so-called inflation doves at the Fed, who tend to emphasize the persistently high unemployment rate rather than the risks of setting off inflation. As a member of the Fed's board of governors from 1994 to 1997, Ms. Yellen served under Alan Greenspan in an era when the Fed did not emphasize tough regulation. Later, she was an adviser to President Bill Clinton and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
In her speech, to the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, in Denver, Ms. Yellen discussed the interplay between monetary policy and "macroprudential supervision," which focuses on the safety of the financial system as a whole rather than the soundness of individual banks and institutions.
Supervision and regulation must be the "first and main line of defense" against risks to the financial system, Ms. Yellen said, because monetary policy has other objectives and is "too blunt an instrument" to contain such risks. That position is in line with a central belief of Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman.
Effective supervision should focus on the accumulation of high levels of risk and leverage, Ms. Yellen said, sources of vulnerability that are shared by multiple institutions, and the interconnectedness of the system.
Banking supervision and regulation were a focus of the annual meeting last week of the International Monetary Fund. On Sunday, the Institute of International Finance, a global association of commercial and investment banks, said that many countries were piling on regulations too rapidly and giving too little time for new rules to take effect, and warned that bank lending and economic growth could be curtailed as a result.
But the same day, the Group of Thirty, a private association of finance leaders, called for "urgent action" on macroprudential supervision. "As we have seen, a focus on individual institutions and markets, absent a systemic view, cannot ensure financial stability and resilience," said Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a former Fed vice chairman who led the working group that prepared the Group of Thirty's report.
Ms. Yellen, who was a member of that working group, threw her support behind its findings on Monday.
She argued against the idea, fashionable before the 2008 crisis, that business cycles had been tamed and that markets were self-correcting. "That view lies in tatters today as we look at tens of millions of unemployed and the trillions of dollars of lost output and lost wealth around the world," she said.
Regulators had been "lulled into complacency by a combination of a Panglossian worldview and benign experience," she said. Turbulent events -- like the Latin American debt crisis and the savings-and-loan disaster in the 1980s; the Asian financial crisis and the failure of the giant hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in the 1990s; and stock market declines in 1987 and 2000-1 -- appeared to be manageable at the time.
"We appeared to have entered a new period of stability," Ms. Yellen said. "We even gave it a name: the Great Moderation. We were left with a mirage of a system that we thought was invulnerable to shock, a financial Maginot Line that we believed couldn't be breached. We now know that this sense of invincibility was mere hubris."
She also spoke favorably of the Dodd-Frank overhaul of Wall Street, which President Obama signed in July and which expanded the Fed's mandate, and of proposed global bank regulations, known as Basel III, that will gradually force banks to hold more and higher-quality capital. And she said that regulators should compel financial institutions to have enough liquidity and not to rely too much on unstable, short-term financing.
Ms. Yellen said the new regulatory system should incorporate automatic safeguards and straightforward rules, and involve extensive international coordination. While recognizing that "overly strict supervision" posed dangers, she said that policy makers "had veered disastrously too far in the direction of laissez-faire, with consequences we know too well."
She concluded by saying: "Next time I hope we can say, 'We did see it coming, and we did something about it."'

From Tea Party Advocates, an Undercurrent of Anger at the Federal Reserve

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, having weathered criticism of its regulatory failings and interest rate decisions in the years before the financial crisis, is facing a new source of anger: the Tea Party movement.
Take, for example, three Republican nominees for the Senate who relied on support from Tea Party activists to vanquish primary rivals supported by the party establishment:
In Utah, Mike Lee has accused the central bank of trying to "monetize the debt" by printing money to buy government bonds -- a motivation that Fed officials have hotly denied. Ken Buck in Colorado has called for "shining a light on the Federal Reserve," saying it is too cozy with private interests. And in Kentucky, Rand Paul has argued that the Fed is devaluing the dollar and causing boom-bust cycles through its easy-money policies.
They have made the Fed a target of their ire, linking it to their criticisms of President Obama's stimulus effort and the Wall Street bailouts begun under President George W. Bush.
None of them has gone as far, though, as Mr. Paul's father, Representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican and libertarian activist who is seeking to abolish the central bank. (His 2009 book, "End the Fed," is popular in Tea Party circles.) The senior Mr. Paul, who ran for president in 2008, is in line to lead a House subcommittee that oversees the Fed if Republicans win control of that chamber in November.
Criticism of the Fed has been more of a simmering undercurrent in this election cycle than a dominant theme, even for insurgent candidates. But Fed officials, who try to avoid public discussion of electoral politics, have become increasingly attuned to the probability that their critics will have a louder voice in the next Congress.
The likely outcome is greater scrutiny of the Fed, even though the Wall Street regulatory overhaul that Mr. Obama signed in July already calls for a one-time audit of the Fed's emergency lending programs as well as a study by the Government Accountability Office of how the central bank is governed.
"The Fed has become politicized, whether we like it or not," said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University who writes a macroeconomics blog.
To be sure, mistrust of central banking has been an enduring theme in American history. The Fed, established in 1913, is the nation's third central bank; the other two expired in 1811 and 1836 when their charters lapsed.
"There's always been this strong tension between people who are likely to be debtors, and who are in effect in favor of cheap money, and people who are creditors and in favor of hard money," said Benjamin M. Friedman, a Harvard economist whose 2005 book, "The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth," argued that growth was essential for social and political progress.
Historically, anger at the Fed has been voiced from the left and the right, but lately it has been more pronounced among conservatives. Mr. Friedman said the anger had "understandable origins," saying it resulted from stagnation in the incomes of ordinary citizens, compounded now by high unemployment.
Some critics, however, say the Fed has been too eager to fight unemployment and should be more attentive to inflation risks.
One is Peter D. Schiff, who runs a brokerage firm in Westport, Conn., and unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for the Senate in Connecticut this year, with Tea Party support.
Mr. Schiff assailed the Fed's decisions to cut short-term interest rates to nearly zero and buy $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed assets and Treasury securities to stimulate the economy.
"What we need now is higher interest rates, severe cuts in spending," he said. "And that will bring about a severe downturn, but there's no way around it. We have to swallow some bitter medicine; if we don't, we're going to get sicker and sicker."
He added: "The Fed is the enabler, by keeping credit flowing. It is a drug dealer."
Mr. Schiff -- who warned in a 2007 book of impending economic collapse and has made Web videos on the topic -- is hardly outside the Republican mainstream.
Representative Spencer T. Bachus of Alabama, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, has also used a drug analogy to describe the Fed's interventions.
"As with any addiction, an altered state is created where the only choices are permanent addiction or a sometimes painful withdrawal," Mr. Bachus said at a House hearing in February.
Dick Armey, a former House majority leader and now a Tea Party organizer, blames the Fed for abetting the crisis by keeping interest rates too low for too long after the 2001 recession.
A few Tea Party candidates, like Mr. Lee in Utah, have come close to urging a return to the gold standard, which the United States essentially abandoned in 1933.
Mr. Lee, in a forum with voters last year, questioned the use of fiat money, currency that has no intrinsic value but the full faith and credit of the government that issues it. "Maybe we ought to return to the gold system," he said. "I don't really care whether it's gold or silver or platinum or Grape-Nuts or Corn Flakes. It's got to be based on something."
The ire at the Fed may be broad but not very deep. A New York Times/CBS News poll in April found that Tea Party supporters were more likely than all adults surveyed to say they had heard or read about the Fed. While a plurality of Tea Party supporters and all respondents said they had confidence in the Fed to promote financial stability, a sizable minority of both groups said they did not know enough to say.
Even so, the anger has been strong enough to raise some concerns among Republicans. "The positions that have become almost mainstream, at least on the right, used to be extreme positions," Vin Weber, a Republican and a former congressman from Minnesota, told Bloomberg Television this month. "Only the John Birch Society used to call for the auditing of the Federal Reserve."
In an essay titled "Mend the Fed," published in The National Review in June, Josh Barro, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, noted with dismay that Tea Party activists had gotten the Maine Republican Party to adopt a platform calling for an audit as "the first step in ending the Fed."
"There's always a problem with unaccountable government agencies, but on the other hand the Fed has had a free hand to do things that have been necessary and unpopular," Mr. Barro said in an interview. "If Congress had had the power to stop all the asset purchases the Fed has done, we might have dropped into deflation the last couple of years."
Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, is the most prominent inflation "hawk" at the Fed, having dissented repeatedly from the Fed's stance that it intends to keep interest rates near zero for "an extended period."
Mr. Hoenig appeared recently before the Hope for America Coalition, an anti-Fed group, in Lenexa, Kan. He noted that financial panics regularly troubled the economy before the Fed was created. He might not have changed their minds, he said, but the crowd was polite and appreciated his willingness to dissent.

ECONOMY SANDBAGS PLANS
To Build Nuclear Reactors
Just a few years ago, the economic prognosis for new nuclear reactors looked bright, with companies reporting plans to build 28 new reactors. The economic slump, which has driven down demand and the price of competing energy sources, and the failure of Congress to pass climate legislation has changed all that, at least for now. PAGE B1
CBS'S PRIME-TIME SUCCESS
Three weeks into a new television season, new shows are collapsing, and crises are appearing all over network prime-time schedules -- except at CBS, which has managed to avoid, on every night, across every hour of prime time, the kind of failure that has visited all of its main competitors.

TWITTER COURTS AD REVENUE
Twitter's hockey-stick growth -- it has exploded to 160 million users, from three million, in the last two years -- is reminiscent of Google and Facebook in their early days. Those Web sites are now must-buys for advertisers online, and the ad industry is watching Twitter closely to see if it continues to follow that path. PAGE B1

Full text: WASHINGTON -- At a private dinner on Friday at the Canadian Embassy, finance officials from seven world economic powers focused on the most vexing international economic problem facing the Obama administration.
Over seared scallops and beef tenderloin, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner urged his counterparts from Europe, Canada and Japan to help persuade China to let its currency, the renminbi, rise in value -- a crucial element in redressing the trade imbalances that are threatening recovery around the world.
But the next afternoon, the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund ended with a tepid statement that made only fleeting and indirect references to the simmering currency tensions.
The divergence between the mounting anxieties over Chinese policy and the cautious official response was a striking display of the difficulty of securing international economic cooperation, two years after the financial crisis began.
Above all, officials say, the crisis has shifted influence from the richest powers toward Asia and Latin America, whose economies have weathered the recession much better than those of the United States, Europe and Japan.
"We have come to the end of a model where seven advanced economies can make decisions for the world without the emerging countries," said one European official involved in the weekend talks. "Like it or not, we simply have to accept it."
The debate over currency valuation is pivotal. World leaders broadly agree that for the global economy to be more stable, imbalances between creditor countries like China and Germany and debtor countries like the United States and Britain have to be fixed. Correcting those imbalances, some economists say, will help create jobs in the United States and reduce the threat of inflation and asset bubbles in China.
The shifting dynamics have most noticeably affected the United States, which pushed more forcefully than its counterparts for stronger pressure on China but has been unable to persuade them to stand with it at the forefront of the debate.
In general, the Europeans have taken a far more conciliatory line toward China. The French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said on Saturday, "It's not helpful to use bellicose statements when it comes to currency or to trade."
In interviews, American and European officials involved in discussions over the Chinese currency last week outlined several reasons a unified position has been so hard to forge.
For one thing, China has moved adroitly to deflect criticism of its currency policies, by pledging to move at a gradual pace and by pointing to other sources of global imbalances. This leaves Western diplomats struggling to strike the right balance between forceful rhetoric and patient cajoling in pressuring China to act.
Another factor is that the most dire part of the crisis has passed, and many countries are now more concerned with their own national economies and no longer feel the urgency act in concert.
"We are moving from a consensual to a more confrontational period in global economic governance," said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, senior director of policy programs at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, which promotes trans-Atlantic cooperation.
Complicating the effort is a dispute between the United States and Europe over how to change board representation within the I.M.F. to give greater voice to the fast-growing economies that are propelling global growth. The Americans want emerging countries, especially China, to have more representation, and thus take on more responsibility. But Europe is reluctant to give up some of its positions on the board.
And significantly, in the eyes of many countries, the United States has lost some of the standing it needs to shape global policy. Not only is Wall Street viewed by many as having initiated the world financial crisis, but also, a number of countries fear that policies by the Federal Reserve are pushing down the dollar's value -- the same kind of currency weakening for which the Obama administration has criticized China.
"Other countries are no longer willing to buy into the idea that the U.S. knows best on economic policy, while at the same time the emerging markets have become increasingly influential and independent," said Kenneth S. Rogoff of Harvard, a former chief economist at the I.M.F.
The inconclusive I.M.F. outcome means that the renminbi's exchange rate will again be a focus when President Obama and other leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers gather next month in Seoul, South Korea. Officials said the United States would keep up pressure on China in the weeks leading up to that meeting.
Despite the bland language of the I.M.F. statement on Saturday, American and European officials said the weekend meetings were not a failure.
After all, the 187-member I.M.F. is not a customary forum for decisive collective action, and changes in national economic policies typically occur in a gradual, incremental fashion. A Treasury official pointed out that the gatherings focused high-level attention on the currency problem, and ended with an agreement for the I.M.F. to play a greater role in monitoring its members' exchange-rate practices and the "spillover effects" of each country's economic policies on the rest of the world.
Even so, economic and political forces have made it difficult for the United States to address what Mr. Geithner has called the "central existential challenge of cooperation."
"Even though this is inherently a collective problem, there is no specific mechanism in the I.M.F. or G-20 that looks up to the challenge," he said Sunday. "Our aim is to change that by encouraging countries to buy into a stronger set of norms and behaviors on these issues."
In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Geithner in essence accused China of setting off a cycle of "competitive nonappreciation," in which countries block their currencies from rising in value to support their exporters -- as Japan, Brazil and South Korea have recently tried. Economists have warned that this type of policy could lead to a destructive currency war.
Other officials have quietly expressed worry that the United States is itself contributing to the currency imbalance: the Federal Reserve has adopted an expansionary monetary policy intended to stimulate the economy, has contributed to the weakening of the dollar against other currencies.
Edwin M. Truman, a former top official at the Fed and the Treasury Department, said that while Europe and Japan want the renminbi to appreciate, "they don't want the dollar to depreciate along with it."
Allowing the renminbi to rise would make Chinese exports more expensive and American exports cheaper. That would assist with rebalancing: getting China to spend more and save less and the United States to spend less and save more.
A vital part of the American strategy has been to argue that China would also benefit from letting the renminbi rise.
Doing so, many economists say, would reduce the risk of inflation and asset bubbles, and help reorient growth away from exports and coastal manufacturing areas and toward domestic consumer demand and poor rural regions in need of development. China signed on last year to a G-20 platform for "strong, sustainable and balanced growth," which has become a sort of motto for global the recovery.
But there is little agreement on how to make the motto a reality.
James D. Wolfensohn, a former president of the World Bank, said each side had a point. "The Chinese have a legitimate case that they have to keep their economy going and that they're not going to let us run their economy for them," he said. "On the other hand, we have a legitimate case that China ought to bear its share of the burden and show some leadership."

Abstract: Mr. Toomey, a former representative, is an unwavering fiscal conservative who supported the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, backed using private retirement accounts in place of Social Security and opposed the Medicare prescription drug benefit because it cost too much. At the ironworks shop, Mr. Toomey brushed aside a question from a local reporter who pointed out that real income for American workers dropped after the Bush tax cuts, saying he did not believe the data.

Full text: BROOMALL, Pa. -- The voters of Pennsylvania are angry at Washington. And Pat Toomey, the Republican nominee for United States Senate, is glad to stoke the fury.
"The policies that we are seeing coming out of Washington are preventing us from having the kind of recovery that we could be having and should be having," Mr. Toomey declared after touring the ironworks shop of a spiral staircase manufacturer here.
His speech, variations of which he offers up at stops across the state, quickly turned into a punch list of supposed misdeeds he hopes to address, perpetrated by the Democrats controlling Congress and, by extension, his opponent, Representative Joe Sestak.
Bailouts: "Taking resources from the productive companies like this one, productive workers like you, and sending them to failing companies."
The economic stimulus: "Over a trillion dollars of growing government, that's what it is."
The health care bill: "Another huge obstacle to job creation."
Climate change legislation: "Designed precisely to drive energy costs through the roof."
Some of his assertions are fair. Some are a stretch but defensible. Others are false, like Mr. Toomey's claim that a recent law passed by Congress to aid small businesses would have the federal government buy a stake in local banks. The bill would channel government-backed loans through the banks.
Details, however, are beside the point. Anger is defining this race.
"Our employees have taken a 10 percent drop in pay and we, as owners, have taken a 50 percent cut," said Ron Cohen, the chief executive of the staircase company, the Iron Shop. "I don't see Washington doing anything similar to that." He added, "All I hear are more taxes and more regulations that make staying in business harder."
These sorts of frustrations are lifting the candidacy of Mr. Toomey, 48, in his race against Mr. Sestak, a former vice admiral in the Navy who defied the Obama White House by challenging the five-term incumbent, Senator Arlen Specter, in the Democratic primary.
It was Mr. Toomey who set in motion Mr. Specter's political demise.
Mr. Toomey, a former representative, is an unwavering fiscal conservative who supported the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, backed using private retirement accounts in place of Social Security and opposed the Medicare prescription drug benefit because it cost too much. He nearly ousted Mr. Specter in the 2004 Senate primary.
Mr. Toomey's determination to win the nomination this year led Mr. Specter to become a Democrat after 44 years in the Republican Party.
Mr. Toomey grew up in Rhode Island, attended Harvard, worked as a derivatives trader on Wall Street and then owned, along with his brothers, two nightclubs and a sports bar in Allentown, Pa.
He served in the House from 1999 to 2004, kept his promise to retire after three terms, and then became president of the Club for Growth, a nonprofit group favoring low taxes and limited government.
Mr. Toomey could hardly have hoped for a better political climate for his antitax, small government message. For months, polls have shown him in the lead.
"These guys in Washington are creating an environment that is having a chilling effect on small businesses and medium and big businesses, as well, and that's a big part of why we don't have the job growth that we badly need," Mr. Toomey said in his visit to the ironworks shop.
"They are creating a staggering amount of debt, debt that is eventually going to have much higher interest rates, probably lead to very high inflation," he continued. "It's a very worrisome combination, and we have got to get on a new track."
What that new track would be was harder to explain.
Mr. Toomey says he favors making the Bush-era tax cuts permanent for all Americans -- which would add $700 billion more to the deficit over 10 years than the plan advocated by President Obama to let the lower rates expire for the rich. But he also expresses a desire to reduce the deficit.
At the ironworks shop, Mr. Toomey brushed aside a question from a local reporter who pointed out that real income for American workers dropped after the Bush tax cuts, saying he did not believe the data.
Mr. Toomey's own prescription for the economy includes repealing laws approved by the Democrats, blocking other Democratic goals and, of course, extending the tax cuts. "We need to eliminate all these threats of downside uncertainty," he said.
He also said that Washington should cut spending, though he offered no specifics.
In Pennsylvania, as elsewhere, any connection to Washington is a liability. Mr. Sestak, who is still serving in the House, refers to his opponent as "Congressman Toomey" at every opportunity. Mr. Sestak's own campaign prefers to call him "Admiral Sestak."
Mr. Sestak graduated from the United States Naval Academy and, over a 31-year career, ascended to the rank of vice admiral. He earned a doctorate in political economy from Harvard and commanded a battle group in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In his campaign, Mr. Sestak emphasizes both his military services and his independence. He is also not backing down from his votes in favor of the major Democratic legislation. He uses his young daughter's battle with brain cancer to help explain why he supported the health care law.
In speeches, he talks in dramatic tones about his Navy service, in particular the days after the Sept. 11 attacks. But while skeptics typically preface their questions or criticism by saying they admire his military service, Mr. Sestak is clearly the underdog.
After a 40-minute speech by Mr. Sestak to the Rotary Club in York, Webster McCormack, 85, did not waste a moment before rendering a verdict: he will vote for Mr. Toomey.
"They have to cut taxes," Mr. McCormack said. "You keep the government out of our pockets and we can do a better job of running our businesses."
During the question-and-answer session at the Rotary speech, Scott Wagner, the owner of a local waste management company, stood up with a printout of the entire health care law and offered it to Mr. Sestak. "Sir, I don't need it," Mr. Sestak shot back. "I've read every word."
But Mr. Wagner, who raises money for Republican candidates, was not done. "You see this?" he said. "This is not good for business."
In an interview, Mr. Wagner expressed deep anger at the government. "We're being regulated to death," he said. But when asked for examples, he offered only I.R.S. Form 2290, which is used to file the "heavy use vehicle tax" -- a tax enacted in 1982 -- and the I-9 immigration form to prove an employee is legally allowed to work in the United States, which has been required since 1986.
Mr. Wagner said there was no doubt about how he would vote. "I'm supporting Pat Toomey," he said. "We're on the Titanic," Mr. Wagner added. "The Titanic is going down and the music is playing fast."

Full text: ECONOMIC growth is precarious, unemployment is painfully high, debt levels are staggering and the stock market isn't all that cheap.
That's the view of Jeremy Grantham, the chief investment strategist at GMO, the Boston investment firm, who believes that the stock market is bound to endure some very lean years. But in the near term, there is a good chance that the market will rally, he said.
Why? "We are entering the sweet spot of the presidential election cycle. It's very hard to bet against it."
The presidential election cycle? Well, yes. A cottage industry has sifted the data going back more than a century and found that the stock market has generally done much better in the second half of a president's four-year term than in the first. If history is a reliable guide -- a big "if" -- the market outlook should be brightening.
Since 1942, for example, the 200 days after a midterm election have produced "a remarkably consistent uptrend," regardless of who wins, said Eric C. Bjorgen, a senior research analyst at the Leuthold Group. In a recent report, he found that in all 17 instances, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had gains averaging more than 18 percent.
Are these numbers just a fluke? Quite possibly. There isn't much hard evidence, and the history of presidential elections is too short for the patterns to pass a rigorous statistical test. Still, some people who have examined the cycle surmise that it reflects the simple desire of politicians to get themselves or their parties re-elected.
"I think a president is elected and tries to get rid of the dirty stuff in the economy as quickly as possible, so that by the time the next election comes around, he looks like a hero," said Yale Hirsch, the former editor of The Stock Trader's Almanac. He started analyzing the presidential election cycle in the almanac's first edition in 1968. "The stock market is reacting to what the politicians are doing," he said.
If the causes of the pattern aren't clear, the numbers themselves are startling. "There is a strong historical tendency for the market to trend higher over the course of the third year of the presidential cycle," said Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, an investment consulting firm.
Here are the average annualized returns for the Dow Jones industrial average from 1900 to 2009, as calculated by Ned Davis Research for the different years of a presidential term: 5.5 percent for Year 1; 3.7 percent for Year 2 (which would be this year); 12.6 percent for Year 3 (which would be next year); and 7.5 percent for Year 4.
The pattern is strong enough to count as "remarkable," Mr. Hayes said, a word echoed by many strategists
"The pattern is quite remarkable," said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.
"These numbers are remarkable," Mr. Grantham said.
"I love those numbers," said Linda A. Duessel, equity market strategist at Federated Investors, who said that knowledge of the cycle had bolstered her cautiously bullish views of the market.
A husband-and-wife team, James R. Booth, now a professor of finance at DePaul University, and Lena Chua Booth, a professor at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, were unable to explain the pattern in a 2003 paper in The Review of Financial Economics. They tried to map the cyclical stock market returns to a deeper "political business cycle," but didn't find significant correlations to factors like inflation or interest rates.
"We were unable to come up with an explanation," Mr. Booth said.
Kevin Grier, an economics professor at the University of Oklahoma, hasn't studied the market cycle, but in a 2008 paper in Public Choice, he found evidence of a political business cycle corresponding closely to the election calendar. From 1961 to 2004, the money supply tended to start rising in the second year of a presidential term, followed by a rise in G.D.P., he concluded.
In a telephone interview, he said that he was only conjecturing, but that he believed that political influence on the Federal Reserve was responsible for the rise. "I think the idea that the Fed is divorced from politics and from real world affairs and conducts matters from an ivory tower setting is more of a myth than a reality," he said. But with one exception, he said, "there is no smoking gun."
That exception was in the Nixon administration. In 2006, with the aid of the Nixon White House tapes, Burton A. Abrams, an economics professor at the University of Delaware, found that in 1971 and early in the 1972 election year, Nixon pressured Arthur F. Burns, then the Fed chairman, to expand the money supply with the aim of reducing unemployment, expanding G.D.P. and ensuring Nixon's re-election. Nixon also imposed wage and price controls to constrain inflation. He won in a landslide -- only to resign in disgrace in the wake of the Watergate scandal.
BUT Nixon's excesses may not have much bearing on the behavior of other presidents.
Even if presidents want to influence events, "it's very difficult to change the course of the economy," Mr. Grantham said. But, he added, it's very easy to influence the markets, which are sensitive to signals from Washington. He says he is sure that many money managers will make bets based on the current cycle, but he advised individual investors to anchor their decisions on economic fundamentals.
As for Ms. Sonders, she said the election cycle didn't supply enough information for formulating an investment strategy, adding that knowledge of it was "an important arrow to have in your quiver."
For his part, Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn., who has studied the cycle extensively, said he did not rely on it to set strategy. "It's interesting to note it," he said. "But I don't really pay much attention to it. I pick individual stocks. In a market like this, that's the way to make money."

Abstract: "A lot of time and effort and skill and money go into trying to arbitrage differences between Merck and Pfizer or Bank of America and Citigroup, and very little trying to arbitrage discrepancies between U.S. Treasury TIPS and small caps or emerging-market bonds and European large value," said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation and manager of four world allocation funds at GMO, an investment firm in Boston.

Full text: THERE may be something to that adage about the devil being in the details. The strong interest in world allocation funds suggests that investors think so, anyway -- or maybe that they just think details are devilishly difficult for money managers to get right.
Instead of filling their portfolios one stock or bond at a time, the way conventional funds do, world allocation funds seek to outperform through big-picture calls. In the investment style of hedge funds, they may make significant bets on or against broad asset classes or geographic regions, based on macroeconomic factors or social or industrial trends.
The bets are sometimes huge. A very large sale of stock index futures by a Waddell & Reed world allocation fund was blamed by federal regulators late last month for initiating the flash crash -- the sharp, brief plunge in the stock market on May 6.
In world allocation funds, managers can move on to other investments when they have decided that the economic or commercial landscape has changed -- or if they just think something else will work better. These funds, known colloquially as go-anywhere funds, recently held $192 billion in assets, a 2.6 percent increase in three years, according to Morningstar. That may sound like nothing special, but assets in conventional stock funds plunged 27.1 percent in the same span, as a result of weak performance and investor disenchantment.
"There was a perception among a lot of investors that traditional asset allocation did not work to their expectations in the last bear market," Kevin McDevitt, a Morningstar analyst, said in explaining the interest in world allocation funds. Investors had assumed that "as long as they were properly diversified, they would be protected in a downturn, and the feeling is it wasn't the case."
"They began looking for actively managed funds where the manager makes broad value judgments across all asset groups," Mr. McDevitt said. "It seems to be a contradiction, but there's an expectation that some managers will be able to make good relative value calls and get you ahead of the next crisis."
Contradiction or not, the idea holds water. In the five years through September, the average world allocation fund had a compound annual return of 4.4 percent, less than the 5.5 percent gain of the average bond fund but well ahead of the 1.7 percent return of the average domestic stock fund.
Analysts like the idea of world allocation funds, but they often express reservations and caveats. Emphasizing broad decisions is a sound strategy, but other approaches are valid, too, they say, and funds' charters may limit their ability to "go anywhere."
Across the industry, practitioners of the approach remain a small minority, despite its rising popularity and recent healthy returns. Portfolio managers continue to try to beat their rivals mainly by accumulating many small victories rather than a few big ones.
"A lot of time and effort and skill and money go into trying to arbitrage differences between Merck and Pfizer or Bank of America and Citigroup, and very little trying to arbitrage discrepancies between U.S. Treasury TIPS and small caps or emerging-market bonds and European large value," said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation and manager of four world allocation funds at GMO, an investment firm in Boston. Having few competitors doing what he does helps his performance, he said.
Mr. Inker's portfolios had a substantial investment in TIPS, or Treasury inflation-protected securities, earlier this year, but he cut his exposure after yields fell. Lately, he has been buying high-quality American stocks, stocks in emerging markets and such esoteric fare as Australian and New Zealand bonds.
Ryan Caldwell, co-manager of Ivy Asset Strategy and Waddell & Reed Asset Strategy, two almost identical portfolios, has high hopes for China, though they have hurt returns in the short run. A big stake in Chinese stocks, which suffered some sharp drops in the global decline this spring, has left his funds trailing many peers this year.
MR. CALDWELL'S funds were alluded to in the flash-crash report released by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulate stock and futures markets, respectively. Sales by a mutual fund of futures contracts worth $4.1 billion over 20 minutes were one of several factors that combined to send stock prices tumbling, the report said. It did not name the fund, but officials later said the manager was Waddell & Reed.
Mr. Caldwell confirmed that large amounts of futures contracts were sold for his portfolios on the day of the flash crash, but he said that similar trades had been made on several other occasions without incident. He added that the trades on the crash day did not significantly hurt his performance.
He was unavailable when sought for comment on the government report.
Big runs of strength and weakness are common for world allocation funds. "We know that concentrating and taking bigger bets can increase risk and inject a lot of volatility," Mr. Caldwell said. The Ivy and Waddell funds continue to have the best five-year performance among world allocation funds, however. The Waddell fund, for example, returned more than 11 percent, annualized, in the five years through Sept. 30.
He has 13 percent of his portfolios in gold because, he said, he is "negative on every developed market currency." He has 77 percent of assets in stocks spread broadly worldwide and a 50 percent short position in stock index futures; that leaves a net 27 percent exposure. The rest is in cash.
That ability to bet against something and not just for it is essential for a world allocation fund, said Ron Carson, head of the Carson Wealth Management Group in Omaha.
"Performance has been hurt on a lot of these funds because they can go anywhere but remain fully invested," he said. He prefers managers "who have an ability to go anywhere and also to hedge exposure or go short."
Another criticism of world allocation funds is their expense. Security selection is a secondary consideration, but it still must be done. The cost of scouring the world for the best markets and then picking stocks or bonds can make the funds more expensive to operate than a typical stock fund, Mr. McDevitt at Morningstar said. Still, he finds them potentially useful holdings.
"They have the whole equity universe to draw from, so if foreign stocks or emerging market stocks look expensive, they can overweight U.S. stocks," he said. "The average investor has a hard time doing that. The funds are worth considering, at the very least."
Roger G. Ibbotson, a professor in the Yale School of Management and founder of Ibbotson Associates, says he is not convinced that a broad asset-allocation approach is best. In his view, it may be harder to beat the competition by getting a small decision right, but the sheer number of opportunities makes it worth the effort.
"At the micro level, the individual stock level, there are thousands of possibilities for distortions," Mr. Ibbotson said. "At the macro level, everyone else is looking at the same data." While some investors may be able to interpret the data better, "there is no special information."
But he says he has no special knowledge himself about the superiority of one path over the other. "Either strategy could work," he said. "It's not clear which one is better. It's easier at the micro level to find examples where it works, but at the macro level, especially in a crisis, you can find people who make good bets."
Mr. Carson says he wouldn't put all his assets into go-anywhere funds, but he suggests that managers who don't sweat the details could have an edge on their peers. "For sure, picking the right market is more important" than stock-picking, he said. "If I'm right about the market, I can afford to make selection mistakes, but if I'm wrong about the market, I need to be perfect in my selection and I may still lose money."

Abstract: Contrary to the prevailing conventional wisdom, the researchers suggested that pork bellies, coffee and crude oil had a place in individual portfolios alongside stocks, bonds and cash. Despite the current gush of enthusiasm, some investment experts say commodity offerings, particularly indexed E.T.F.'s that are passively managed, haven't proved that they can provide retail investors with the combination of simplicity and low costs that, say, a stock index fund built around the Standard & Poor's 500 can.

Full text: IN 2005, K. Geert Rouwenhorst and Gary B. Gorton, now finance professors at Yale, published a paper about the investment benefits of an asset class that was then the province of specialists: commodities. Contrary to the prevailing conventional wisdom, the researchers suggested that pork bellies, coffee and crude oil had a place in individual portfolios alongside stocks, bonds and cash.
Five years later, commodities have become an investing vogue, and Professor Rouwenhorst has jumped, part time, into money management. As a partner in SummerHaven Investment Management in Stamford, Conn., he helped create the United States Commodity Index fund, an exchange-traded fund that opened to investors in August. SummerHaven manages the fund's assets for its sponsor, United States Commodity Funds in Alameda, Calif.
The new E.T.F. is one of a flurry of commodity offerings that have appeared since the professors published their research. In the intervening years, EPFR Global of Cambridge, Mass., a tracker of mutual fund flows, counts a fivefold increase, to about 200, in the number of commodity funds and commodity E.T.F.'s.
And these funds are scooping up money at a time when stocks have often been stumbling along and bonds are offering skimpy yields. This year through September, investors plowed $18.3 billion into commodity offerings, versus $11.9 billion for the first nine months of 2009, EPFR said. Equity funds, by contrast, have had net outflows.
An E.T.F. that invests across commodity sectors does not buy actual commodities -- that is, barrels of oil or buckets of wheat -- but instead purchases derivative securities called futures. Futures give investors exposure to price movements of commodities without forcing them to own and store the products.
Despite the current gush of enthusiasm, some investment experts say commodity offerings, particularly indexed E.T.F.'s that are passively managed, haven't proved that they can provide retail investors with the combination of simplicity and low costs that, say, a stock index fund built around the Standard & Poor's 500 can.
Compared with a simple stock fund, an indexed commodity E.T.F. can be expensive and complex. As for cost, the iShares S.&P. GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust, for example, carries expenses of 0.75 percent of assets, while S.& P. 500 index funds from Fidelity and Vanguard have expense ratios of 0.1 percent.
As for complexity, the indexes and approaches of commodity funds and E.T.F.'s, can be hard for average investors to understand. For that reason, Vanguard doesn't offer them.
"Most individual investors don't get the difference between owning a futures contract and a bar of gold," said John Ameriks, Vanguard's head of investment counseling and research.
Recently, some indexed commodity E.T.F.'s have not delivered much in the way of performance. "I can't say that passive investing in commodities won't have its time," said Paul Justice, director of North American E.T.F. research at Morningstar. "But it hasn't worked in the last two to three years."
The broadly diversified commodity mutual funds and E.T.F.'s followed by Morningstar lost an average of about 10 percent, annualized, over the three years through Sept. 30, while the S.& P. 500 lost 7.2 percent, annualized.
As Professors Rouwenhorst and Gorton contend, the argument for commodities investing via futures is straightforward: Over the long run, it provides stocklike returns, inflation protection and diversification. The professors' work has found an audience among investment firms and helped popularize the idea that commodities futures have a place in retail investors' portfolios.
Their findings have not been the only factor in the rising popularity. James B. Rogers Jr., an author and investment manager, has evangelized about commodities' potential for years. The industrialization of developing economies, like those of China and India, has also brought favorable attention. These countries will have to gorge on raw materials like oil and iron ore to sustain their torrid growth.
"China accounts for roughly half the growth in global demand for iron ore," said Frederick Sturm, manager of the Ivy Global Natural Resources fund.
Though the commodity story can captivate, difficulties can arise in executing the strategy. Even the matter of building a commodity index stirs debate. Unlike large-capitalization United States stocks, for which the S.& P. 500 is a de facto standard, the sector hasn't settled on a benchmark. Investment companies build their funds and E.T.F.'s around different ones, and new indexes continue to arrive.
"There's no clear, dominant index that's written into pension-plan policies or ingrained in individual investors' heads," said Christopher A. Burton, manager of the Credit Suisse Commodity Return Strategy fund.
The first index that came into widespread use was the S.& P. GSCI, created by Goldman Sachs and now owned by S.& P. It apportions weight to various commodities based on world production volumes. Critics say it overemphasizes energy, which recently accounted for about 70 percent of the index's value, and have offered alternatives. The Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index, for example, uses production volume and trading activity to calculate weights. It caps the heft of any single commodity group at 33 percent.
The E.T.F. that Professor Rouwenhorst helped create has its own index, the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index. To build it, SummerHaven screens 27 commodities monthly and, from those, picks the 14 that show signs of having the lowest worldwide inventories. These 14 are then equally weighted in the index and, by extension, the E.T.F.
Disagreement over basic questions like benchmarking is partly why Morningstar suggests actively managed funds for average investors who want to invest in commodities.
"You want a manager who can go long and short and has flexibility to pick whatever commodities and maturities he wants," Mr. Justice said. Futures, like bonds, come with maturities, and some index funds automatically buy the futures whose maturities are shortest.
One actively managed fund that Morningstar recommends is Pimco Commodity Real Return Strategy, though Mr. Justice cautions that the expense ratio of its Class A shares, at 1.29 percent, is higher than he likes to see.
Campbell R. Harvey, a finance professor at Duke, also argues for active management when venturing into commodities. Like Professors Rouwenhorst and Gorton, he dug into commodity returns before the asset class was fashionable. But he and his co-author, Claude B. Erb, a fund manager at TCW in Los Angeles, arrived at a different conclusion.
In a paper published in 2006, they found "no premium for passively investing in commodities" as a group over the long term, Professor Harvey said. And technological change may explain why. When faced with rising prices and shortages, humans find ways to produce and use commodities more efficiently or replace them, he said.
As whale oil, for example, became scarce, people replaced it in lamps and candle wax with petroleum-based oils and waxes. Innovation counterbalances the scarcity that would raise prices over time.

Abstract: Mr. Zhou said the Chinese government was committed to doing its part by encouraging growth of its service sector, which would lessen its dependence on the export-oriented manufacturing sector; by improving its health care and retirement pension systems, which would allow Chinese consumers to save less; and by spending more on rural development to lessen the economy's dependence on rapidly urbanizing coastal areas.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The head of China's central bank said Friday that he favored letting the Chinese currency rise in value, but only gradually, as exchange-rate tensions overshadowed an international meeting of finance ministers and central bankers.
Gathered here for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund, the top finance officials of Britain, France and Japan all expressed concern about rising currency tensions -- but did not adopt the urgent language the United States has used in prodding China to act. The head of the I.M.F., Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said the question was not whether, but when the Chinese currency, the renminbi, would rise in value.
In a forum sponsored by the I.M.F. and the British Broadcasting Corporation, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said that China "needs a market-based exchange-rate regime" and would "try to move the exchange rate gradually to more equilibrium." But the process had to occur "in a gradual way," he said, "rather than shock therapy."
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who has been urged by American officials to play a greater role in speaking out on the exchange-rate issue, struggled to toe a diplomatic line, encouraging China without appearing to criticize it. "For a long time I've repeatedly said that the renminbi is undervalued," he said at the forum, with Mr. Zhou seated to his left, "but the solution to this is not to expect that China will revalue its currency overnight."
Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Columbia University economist and a former chief economist of the World Bank, cautioned that a currency revaluation alone would not do much to reduce the large American trade and current account deficits with the rest of the world. Those reductions, he said, require fundamental changes in private and public savings in the United States.
"The focus on just the exchange rate is detracting attention from much more fundamental issues," he said during the forum with Mr. Zhou and Mr. Strauss-Kahn.
Last year, the Group of 20 economic powers agreed on a framework for "rebalancing" the global economy as part of their response to the global financial crisis. Under that agreement, the United States is supposed to shift toward saving and investing more and spending and borrowing less.
Mr. Zhou said the Chinese government was committed to doing its part by encouraging growth of its service sector, which would lessen its dependence on the export-oriented manufacturing sector; by improving its health care and retirement pension systems, which would allow Chinese consumers to save less; and by spending more on rural development to lessen the economy's dependence on rapidly urbanizing coastal areas.
"The package may be the better thing to focus on," rather than just the currency issue, Mr. Zhou said.
But many of those structural changes will take time, while Western patience on the currency issue appears to be running thin.
In separate news briefings, officials acknowledged that the currency issue threatened to overshadow the I.M.F. annual meetings, which have tackled other themes like how to harmonize changes in international financial regulation and how rich, debt-burdened nations could cut back public spending without harming the fragile recovery. But they avoided comments that might antagonize China.
George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said, "We do need to move toward market-oriented exchange rates that reflect fundamentals," and added that the I.M.F. and the Group of 20 had to play a role in addressing the imbalances.
Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, played down talk of a currency war, saying "we want to talk about peace." Japan's finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said he expected "steady implementation" of China's promise in June to permit greater exchange-rate flexibility, even though the renminbi has risen only slightly in value since then.
Japan is one of several countries, like South Korea and Brazil, that has taken recent steps to halt or slow the appreciation of its currencies. Those currencies have risen in value, in part, because investors in Europe and the United States, where interest rates are extremely low and growth is sluggish, have gone overseas in search of higher yields. The result has been a surge in capital into rapidly growing economies in Asia and Latin America.
Mr. Noda said Friday that Japan's intervention was intended primarily to moderate volatility in exchange rates and not as a large-scale, permanent policy.
In an interview, the financier George Soros, who has argued that movement on China's currency is essential for avoiding a global currency conflict, said he saw merit in China's caution but noted that international pressures were mounting.
"A 20 percent or more jump in the value of the renminbi would create widespread bankruptcies in the export industry, and the objective of increasing consumption would be undermined by increasing unemployment," Mr. Soros said, expressing sympathy with the position of China's premier, Wen Jiabao, who warned this week that rapid appreciation of the currency would cause major social disruptions.
"On the other hand, 10 percent annual appreciation should be tolerable for the Chinese economy, and it would be a tremendous relief both for the United States, and for the other developing countries that are currently bearing the brunt of the capital flows," Mr. Soros said.
"It is no longer just a conflict between the United States and China," he said. "The rest of the world -- Japan, Europe and the developing world -- are all up in arms." Mr. Soros said that China was threatened by inflation, and the United States by deflation. Rebalancing would help to reduce both threats, he said.
The currency issue increasingly looks to be the dominant theme of the Group of 20 summit meeting that President Obama and other world leaders will attend in November in Seoul, South Korea.
"Currency issues must be debated, must be discussed, must be resolved in pretty closed circles -- and sometimes, behind closed doors as well -- to be efficient," said Ms. Lagarde, the French finance minister.
"But that clearly has to happen," she said.
