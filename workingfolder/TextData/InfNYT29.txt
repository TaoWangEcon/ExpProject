Full text:   LOWE'S is introducing a new round of advertising to promote home improvement projects in the spring, its prime revenue-generating period. The ads, which began appearing on Sunday, reflect an effort by Lowe's to take advantage of the rebounding housing market and catch up to Home Depot, the country's most profitable national home improvement company.
Spring, said Matthew Fassler, who follows Lowe's for Goldman Sachs, is "Christmas for home improvement retailers."
According to David Gober, a retail analyst for Morgan Stanley, 28 percent of Lowe's sales are generated in the second quarter of the calendar year, representing 36 percent of its total operating profit.
As part of its new advertising, an extension of the "Never stop improving" campaign introduced in 2011, Lowe's is for the first time advertising directly to men, in a spot that was first shown Sunday during a Nascar race on Fox, and that will be broadcast during the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament. On Tuesday, Lowe's will begin running ads created for specific regions and weather conditions.
The ads were created by the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, a division of the Omnicom Group, which has worked with Lowe's since 2006.
Mr. Gober said home improvement retailers "took a pretty significant decline" when the housing bubble burst about five years ago. "Throughout the recession and in the early stages of recovery," home improvement spending per home was depressed "well below long-term levels."
Mr. Gober said there had been "some recovery, particularly in the last six months of last year," in spending, as "existing home sales and home prices seemed to have turned the corner."
According to Mr. Fassler, sales of new and existing homes rose more than 10 percent in January, the seventh consecutive month of double-digit growth.
A report released last week by the Home Improvement Research Institute, a trade group, and IHS, an information company, predicted that home improvement spending in the United States would grow 4.3 percent this year, down from last year's increase of 5.4 percent.
However, the forecast said inflation in major building materials would affect the comparison between 2012 and 2013; it said spending growth in 2012, on a constant dollar basis, was 2.9 percent; and it predicted that spending growth would jump 3.4 percent this year.
Lowe's faces a formidable rival in Home Depot, whose same-store sales have outperformed Lowe's in almost every quarter in the last four years, including the fourth quarter of 2012. Home Depot has been doing better than Lowe's, Mr. Gober said, in part because of improved distribution, in-store merchandising and outreach to women by Home Depot. He also said Home Depot stores are in "areas that have seen better jobs growth."
The new Lowe's advertising includes a 60-second TV spot by the film and television director Peter Berg, which began running Monday. It depicts a family moving into a new neighborhood and embarking on home improvement projects that inspire others to do the same. It is being shown on network television and on cable channels like A&E, Bravo and History Channel.
A second 60-second TV spot -- which first ran Sunday and will run during the N.C.A.A. Tournament -- shows men gathered in a backyard, pretending to be competing in various sports, using home improvement tools like a tape measure and sledgehammer as sports equipment. A voice-over says, "You'll probably never bat in the ninth inning of game seven, or have to make a shot with 20,000 fans screaming at you, or choreograph an original touchdown dance. But you do have a sport, and every weekend is your chance to take the field."
Other 15-second TV spots -- depicting a woman gardening and a man seeding his lawn -- will run in different regions according to the advance of spring there.
The content of new digital advertising will be determined by the weather. One ad, for example, says Sunday's forecast is sunny, with a temperature of 68 degrees, and continues, "It's a beautiful day outside. Now's the time to clean up your yard." Digital advertising is running on Web sites like CBSSports.com, Weather.com and eHow.
Thomas J. Lamb, chief marketing officer of Lowe's, said the new advertising -- which will run through June -- is aimed at homeowners, home improvement professionals and contractors. John Osborn, president and chief executive of BBDO New York, said the campaign is "more targeted, more focused on where the customer lives and how the customer lives."
Mr. Lamb declined to reveal Lowe's budget, although Mr. Osborn described the new advertising as "more ambitious and more calibrated because the messaging is more integrated across more channels."
According to Kantar Media, Lowe's spent $118 million in all media in the second quarter of 2011, while it spent $106 million in the same period last year. Total advertising expenditures by Lowe's in 2011 were $344 million, while they were $277 million in the first nine months of 2012.
Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, praised the broad reach of the new advertising across TV, computer and mobile devices. "The idea of going back and forth between the first and second screen is where advertising is going," she said.
Debra J. Mednick, executive director of home for NPD Group, a market research company, called the advertising "smart and well-thought out," and said Lowe's "did its homework. They understand their target audience and are capitalizing on the momentum in the economy, specifically the housing market."

Full text:   DETROIT -- This city was already sinking under hundreds of millions of dollars in bills that it could not pay when a municipal auditor brought in a veteran financial consultant to dig through the books. A seasoned turnaround man and former actuary with Ford Motor Co., he was stunned by what he found: an additional $7.2 billion in retiree health costs that had never been reported, or even tallied up.
"The city must take some drastic steps," the consultant, John Boyle, warned the City Council in delivering his report at a public meeting in 2005. Among the options he suggested was filing for bankruptcy.
"I thought all hell would break loose -- I thought the flag would finally be raised," Mr. Boyle recalled in an interview last week. But his warning drew little notice. "It was utterly astounding," he said.
The financial crisis that has made Detroit one of the largest cities ever to face mandatory state oversight was decades in the making, a trail of missteps, of trimming too little, too late, of hoping that deep-rooted structural problems would turn out to be cyclical downturns that might melt away as the economy picked up.
Some factors were out of the city's control. As auto industry jobs moved elsewhere over the decades, for example, Detroit lost much of its affluent tax base. Lower than expected state revenue sharing did not help, nor did corruption allegations in the administration of Kwame M. Kilpatrick, a mayor who resigned in 2008 and was convicted on Monday of racketeering and other federal charges.
But recent findings from a state-appointed review team and interviews with past and present city officials also suggest a city that over the years was remarkably badly run.
The state review team found in recent months that the city's main courthouse had $280 million worth of uncollected fines and fees. No one could tell the team how many police officers were patrolling the streets, even though public safety accounted for a little more than half the budget. The city was borrowing from restricted funds and keeping unclaimed property that it was required to turn over to the state. In some city departments, records were "basically stuff written on index cards," as one City Council member put it.
"This was bad decisions piled on top of each other," Gary Brown, the Detroit City Council president pro tem, said the other day. "It has all been a strategy of hope. You keep borrowing where every piece of collateral is already leveraged. You have no bonding capacity -- you're at junk status. You're overestimating revenues and not managing the resources. Now the chickens have come home to roost."
Once the nation's fourth-largest city, Detroit had grown up around the auto industry, booming right along with it in the 1950s. City workers gained ground with pay increases intended to keep pace with those the United Auto Workers won for its members, analysts said.
"It was easy to do so back in the 1950s," said Joseph L. Harris, Detroit's former auditor general. "The city had 1.8 million residents then."
But as auto jobs moved elsewhere and the region aged, Detroit's labor costs -- retiree health care costs, especially -- ballooned.
At the same time, officials papered over growing deficits with more borrowing. Finally Detroit's legal debt limit, which is linked to the total value of real estate in the city, fell when the mortgage bubble burst and property values plunged. Today the city says its debt limit is $1 billion, and it has effectively lost its ability to issue debt in the name of its taxpayers.
When a city cannot borrow, it cannot function; New York City showed that in 1975, Cleveland in 1978. But even as Detroit has approached the critical limit, some city leaders have seemed unaware, quarreling over smaller, symbolic issues like whether to lease a city-owned park to the state.
"It is peeling an onion," Mayor Dave Bing said of his growing understanding after he took office in 2009 of the depths of the city's financial woes. "You dig and you dig and you dig, and you really start to find out how bad the problem was. "
Mr. Bing knew plenty about the city's struggles before taking office and ran on a platform of reversing the spiraling finances. Still, within his first six months in office, the city came close to not making payroll.
"That's a scary moment," he recalled in an interview. "You've got people living from paycheck to paycheck, week to week, and you're about to run out of cash. You can only imagine what kind of impact that that's going to have just on the life of the average person."
The big structural imbalance was hard to see building up, because until 2008, when a new accounting rule took effect, cities like Detroit were not required to keep track of their workers' lifelong health care bills. That is why Mr. Boyle found a $7.2 billion promise that no one knew about. Detroit's general-obligation debt to its bondholders, by contrast, was a little less than $1 billion that year, safely within the city's legal debt limit, then $1.4 billion.
But while the numbers are particularly grim here, the basic story line is hardly unique. The same path, long and slow, can be found from Providence, R.I., to Stockton, Calif.
To preserve cash, the city resorted to increasing its workers' future pensions at contract time, instead of raising their pay. That helped balance the immediate budgets, but set up a time bomb sure to explode as more workers retired.
The cost of the retirees' pensions also grew because of an inflation-protection feature that compounds every year. Detroit cannot renege on paying the benefits, at least outside of bankruptcy, because the State Constitution makes it unlawful to reduce pensions after public workers earn them.
By the 2000s, Detroit was borrowing to solve budget shortfalls. Meanwhile, property tax revenues fell, not just because of departing residents, but also as values fell and some people quit paying. The city has reported collecting 84 percent of property tax levied, but a Detroit News analysis suggests a collection rate closer to half of property owners.
In recent years, city officials have made deep cuts in staff and operations, leaving residents complaining of darkened streetlights, slow police response times and bus delays. But while cutting workers can help reduce the current year's costs, it moves many of those people into the ranks of retirees, putting heavy long-term pressure on Detroit's two public pension funds.
By late 2011, a sense of crisis descended on Detroit. In November, Mayor Bing, a Democrat, addressed the city on live television, warning that Detroit would run out of money without concessions from unions, layoffs and privatization. A month later, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, called for a review of Detroit's finances, a first step in cases where the state is preparing to send an emergency financial manager.
City officials held off further intervention by committing to a legal agreement with the state in 2012 that laid out measures to save money. By fall, a board overseeing the agreement said progress was moving too slowly. While City Council members are contesting the matter during a hearing in Lansing on Tuesday, Mr. Snyder's administration is preparing to name an emergency manager within days. Mr. Bing says his administration has drawn up a plan to spare the city, though he acknowledges that it has yet to be fully put into effect.
Under Michigan law, the emergency manager would ultimately have the authority to remove local elected officials from most financial decision making, change labor contracts, close or privatize departments, and even recommend that Detroit enter bankruptcy proceedings, a possibility that experts say raises the prospect of the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history, at $14 billion worth of long-term obligations.
None of the decisions, experts here say, will be simple, and some wonder whether Detroit can be saved at all. Some 700,000 residents now live in this vast 139-square-mile city that once was home to nearly two million people. That number may fall to close to 600,000 by 2030 before the population begins to rise again, one regional planning group projects. By pushing costs into the future while its population is shrinking, Detroit has left the people least able to pay with the biggest share of its bills.
"Detroit is a microcosm of what's going on in America, except America can still print money and borrow," Mr. Boyle said.

Abstract: Democrats plan to rely heavily on closing tax loopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthy to produce new revenue, while Republicans will focus on slashing spending to balance the budget in 10 years.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Congress this week will begin taking the first steps toward a more structured and orderly budget process, beginning what both parties hope is a move away from the vicious cycle of deadline-driven quick fixes.
In the Senate, Democrats were putting the finishing touches on a budget they plan to introduce on Wednesday, their first in four years, while House Republicans were preparing to introduce a spending plan of their own on Tuesday morning.
The two proposals, which would set spending targets for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, will be miles apart ideologically and difficult to merge. Democrats plan to rely heavily on closing tax loopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthy to produce new revenue, while Republicans will focus on slashing spending to balance the budget in 10 years.
But the fact that both houses of Congress are working on their budgets simultaneously after years of impasse raised some measure of hope -- albeit slight -- that Democrats and Republicans might be able to work out some sort of compromise.
Compromise between the two parties, however, is only half of a more complicated bargain. Democrats also have to bridge the divide among a politically diverse group of Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee.
The committee chairwoman, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, said Monday that she expected all 12 members of her majority to vote in favor of the Democrats' budget, even if some members so far remain uncommitted.
"I have a really diverse committee," Mrs. Murray said, adding, "They all recognize that we have some really common goals, and we have worked it out."
That diversity is one of the major reasons Senate Democrats have not written a spending plan of their own since 2009, given the challenge of bringing together senators from Oregon to Virginia to Vermont who do not always agree on issues like whether cuts should fall more heavily on military or nonmilitary programs, and which tax loopholes to eliminate.
"Dealing with the difference of opinion is tough," said Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an independent who has tried to ensure that the Democrats' budget does not include an adjustment to the inflation rate that would calculate it in a way that would decrease federal benefits. Mr. Sanders said he was confident the inflation rate calculation would be untouched, but he was not prepared to sign on to Mrs. Murray's plan until he sees the final document.
"We've had long talks; we'll see what happens," he said.
The committee is closely divided between 12 Democratic votes and 10 Republican votes.
In another sign that both parties continue to look for ways to meet in the middle, President Obama is to visit Capitol Hill for four separate meetings this week with the Democratic and Republican conferences of both houses. The president and his aides have said that this rare display of bipartisan outreach, coming a week after Mr. Obama dined with a dozen Republican senators, is intended to help foster cooperation between the parties.
Against this backdrop, the Senate Appropriations Committee was preparing to lay out a separate stopgap spending plan to keep the government financed through September. The House passed its plan last week.
Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, who framed the Senate's action as a first step in a longer process, said, "This week will offer another opportunity for the Senate to return to regular order, an opportunity for this body to legislate through cooperation, through compromise, as we used to do."
"This legislation," Mr. Reid continued, "will be a test of the Senate's good will. America's economy is poised to grow and expand. The last thing it needs is another manufactured crisis such as a government shutdown to derail its progress."
The movement expected in Congress this week will draw attention to one of the more unusual aspects of business in Washington. When it comes to writing budget resolutions, the House and the Senate have worked on entirely separate paths. Senate Democrats, unable to always agree and not eager to take votes that could prove politically unpopular, have avoided drawing up large-scale a budget.
House Republicans, meanwhile, have made the budget the focus of their efforts. And they have seized on the issue as a way of portraying Democrats as inept and unfocused.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee snidely commented on Monday that Democrats had claimed "for more than 1,400 days that the dog ate their homework." And Republican senators have churned out news releases noting what could have been accomplished since the Democrats last passed a budget, like 179 round-trip missions to the moon and 292 expeditions to the summit of Mount Everest.
But even if Democrats do pass a budget in the Senate, it will mean little unless it can be merged with the House Republican budget and pass both houses of Congress.
"I think because of all the attention on the failure to pass a budget in regular order, Democrats are at least obligated to," said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, who was until recently a member of the Budget Committee.
"But I don't think there's much optimism that we're going to reconcile a budget with this House quickly," he added.

Abstract: The improving job market could falter, particularly if cutbacks in government spending mandated by the so-called sequester take a substantial bite out of economic growth.

Full text:   Wall Street is hopeful that American companies, after years of gaining ground at the expense of their employees, will start to succeed because of the rising fortune of those workers.
Less than a week since the Dow Jones industrial average hit its all-time high, the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is on track to surpass its own 2007 high. The reason, in no small part, is because of investor confidence in the growing economic strength of American households.
This is a shift from the last few years, when stocks and corporate profits soared primarily because of cost-cutting and increased productivity from a shrinking or slow-growing work force. The Federal Reserve's stimulus programs helped corporate America, but they did little to help improve the lives of most American workers, whose wages declined while unemployment remained stuck at high levels.
A surprisingly good employment report on Friday was the strongest of a number of recent indicators that the benefits of the Fed's program are now starting to trickle down to ordinary Americans, who should, in turn, push up sales at American companies. In addition to brisk job growth in recent months, the February employment report gave some of the first evidence of a sustained upturn in wages, and showed that it was spread across many industries.
The improving job market could falter, particularly if cutbacks in government spending mandated by the so-called sequester take a substantial bite out of economic growth. But even a more modest upturn comes not a moment too soon for American companies.
Growth in corporate profits has slowed in recent quarters as the earlier gains from productivity and cost-cutting reached their limits. Many strategists are now seeing signs that the slowdown in expense reduction -- the so-called bottom line -- is being made up for by top-line growth in revenues from reviving American consumers.
"You can only cut and cut and cut for so long, eventually you have to have growth," said Paul Hickey, a founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. "Now we're starting to see some signs that is happening."
In the fourth quarter, American companies experienced the biggest increase in sales per share of any quarter since the financial crisis, according to figures from RBS Securities. In announcing their most recent financial results, many executives spoke about the boost they have gotten from American customers, and the money they are putting back into the pockets of their own employees.
Daniel S. Fulton, the chief executive of Weyerhaeuser Company, a timber company, told investors in January, "Most of the hiring that we have done in the company has been production employees that we've been putting back to work, in order to be able to ramp up and respond to the increased opportunities for wood products." The improving prospects for corporate revenues are encouragement to hesitant investors who have been wondering whether to get back into the stock market but worried that the current rally could already be reaching its peak. After six straight days of gains, the S.& P. 500 closed Friday just 14 points, or 0.9 percent, from the record high of 1,565.15 it hit in October 2007. Factoring in inflation, however, the index is still far from earlier peaks, as is the Dow.
The sequestration's automatic spending cuts have not yet appeared in economic data and there are fears it could exert a future drag on the economic recovery. But Friday's employment report -- showing a gain of 236,000 jobs and a dip in the jobless rate to 7.7 percent -- suggested that American businesses have largely shrugged off the 2 percentage point increase in the payroll tax that was expected to inflict more pain.
Even if corporate revenues climb further, it won't necessarily lead to rising share prices. Investors have already factored the optimistic economic signs while making their investments.
What's more, skeptical strategists say there are significant threats ahead for both consumers and corporations. The basic fear in trading circles is that the economic recovery will not be able to survive the Fed's ending its bond-buying programs. When the Fed does step back from its support for the market, it is expected to send up interest rates, which could dampen lending and the housing market.
"How do you wean an economy off of this easy money policy, which was never meant to be as protracted as it has become?" said Edward Marrinan, the head of macro credit strategy at RBS Securities.
But the Fed has so far been adamant that it will maintain its support for the economy at least until the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 percent. The trajectory the economy has been following is what Fed officials broadly projected when they began giant purchases of bonds in 2008. The money was expected first to shore up the balance sheets of the banks and then help push up the stock portfolios of higher-income Americans. But lower interest rates were also expected eventually to lift the housing market, and then corporate investment in new employees. Data released in recent weeks suggest both are happening.
A number of Wall Street economists responded to the February jobs data by increasing their projection for economic growth this year. Goldman Sachs raised its estimate to 2.6 percent from 2.2 percent, while the bond guru William H. Gross went further and doubled his firm's previous projection to 3 percent in an interview with Bloomberg Radio.
The Ford Motor Company is one of many that came into the year facing expectations that its revenues would stagnate as a result of a recession in Europe and budget fights in Washington. The company did show declines in its European sales, but it surprised analysts by reporting a 5.5 percent increase in revenue in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. In January and February, the company's sales have continued to be better than expected. Ford executives have shown their confidence by announcing a new hiring push, including 450 jobs at a plant in Ohio.
"We are seeing housing really kick in a little bit more," Ford's chief economist, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, said in a March 1 call. "I think it's encouraging to see that consumers may have a little bit of nerves of steel in light of the sequestration."
Most Americans are still far from the income they had before the crisis, and many of the new jobs are not particularly stable or high paying. But Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said there were the foundations for a virtuous circle.
"This is how growth feeds on itself -- increased employment leads to increased spending," Mr. O'Sullivan said.

Abstract: Or $117.5 million for a nearly nine-acre estate in Woodside, Calif., in Silicon Valley, the highest price ever paid for a residence in the United States? [...]there are the global billionaires, a crowd with an almost insatiable appetite for trophy properties, like the penthouse at 15 Central Park West that the daughter of Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian potash fertilizer billionaire, bought last year for $88 million, or $13,000 per square foot. The buyer of the $117.5 million home in Woodside, for example, was Japan's second-richest man, Masayoshi Son, according to The Los Angeles Times.

Full text:   Watching a ballet, you cannot help but marvel at the power of the movement, and the ability of the dancers to soar through the air, time and again, as if there were no limits to their stamina.
And so it is --well, almost -- with the market for high-end properties, where the intensity of sales, at heights never seen before, defied gravity in 2012, whether it was in New York, London, Miami, Los Angeles or Hong Kong.
Is there a day of reckoning on the horizon? Just how many more buyers will be willing to pay $88 million for an apartment in Manhattan, or $121 million for a 10,000-square-foot Chelsea house like the one the developers Nick and Christian Candy bought in London in September? Or $117.5 million for a nearly nine-acre estate in Woodside, Calif., in Silicon Valley, the highest price ever paid for a residence in the United States?
The short answer is a lot. New reports out this week suggest that the residential luxury-buying ballet is very likely poised for a sustained performance.
The buying seems to draw traction from the fact that there will be so many more newly minted rich people hunting for properties. Over the next 10 years, some 95,000 more people around the world are expected to see their wealth grow to at least $30 million, according to a forecast by Knight Frank, a London-based real estate company, which puts the current number of such people at 189,835.
Then there are the global billionaires, a crowd with an almost insatiable appetite for trophy properties, like the penthouse at 15 Central Park West that the daughter of Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian potash fertilizer billionaire, bought last year for $88 million, or $13,000 per square foot.
The number of billionaires will grow by 85 percent over the next decade, to 4,076, Knight Frank forecasts.
Europe and Asia, which have more billionaires than anywhere else, will still lead the way. New York City is emerging as a favorite. "There was a stage three to five years ago where London was quite clearly the main market for Russian and European super-wealthy buyers, but New York is becoming so much more on the radar of these buyers," said Liam Bailey, head of research for Knight Frank. "Latin American wealth really isn't coming to London, it is going to Miami and New York."
The buyers of luxurious penthouses, town houses and country estates are increasingly coming from the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- where people are becoming very rich at a stunning rate. Even with inflation concerns in some of those countries, the combined annual G.N.P. growth of those four countries is equivalent to the creation of a new economy the size of Italy.
Knight Frank said that through 2022 China would see its pool of billionaires grow by 214 percent, to 483; Brazil by 157 percent, to 136; and India by 84 percent, to 225.
Consider, too, what is happening in Brazil, a country that has driven high-end sales in Miami, and to some extent New York, more than any other of late. The number of Brazilians with at least $30 million in assets is expected to climb by nearly 140 percent over the next decade, according to Knight Frank. A growing middle class and production of natural resources are at the heart of the wealth creation.
The Brazilians aren't focused on buying fancier properties at home, although they are doing that as well. They want second and third homes abroad, and they want them now. Knight Frank found that Web searches by South Americans in 2012 for luxury residential properties surged by 82 percent, although they tend to focus on the lower end of that market. It was the region of the world with the biggest uptick. (Africa was second, with 48 percent, followed by Europe.)
Whether they know it or not, the global wealthy are facing stiffer competition from one another. Russians seemed to be everywhere scouring for trophy properties in 2012. They are facing increasing competition from Asian buyers, especially from China and Hong Kong, as well as from Latin America, Knight Frank said.
The buyer of the $117.5 million home in Woodside, for example, was Japan's second-richest man, Masayoshi Son, according to The Los Angeles Times. Forbes has estimated his wealth at $8.6 billion.
Last year I seemed to trip almost unintentionally over the trail of a few Russian oligarchs and their real estate. Mr. Rybolovlev, who bought a $100 million home in Palm Beach, Fla., and the $88 million apartment in New York (bought by his eldest daughter, Ekaterina, through a trust), also has homes in Geneva and Monaco, and was once on the hunt in Los Angeles for a trophy home (he didn't find it, brokers there say).
Vladislav Doronin, the Moscow-based real estate developer who dates the model Naomi Campbell, has spent more than $20 million to renovate a home on Star Island in Miami. He also has homes on the Spanish island of Ibiza, at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, and at One Hyde Park in London; the latter two have become billionaire dens.
London, Miami and New York came to epitomize the so-called safe-haven market in 2012. Even with burgeoning demand from the wealthy for property -- as a safer and potentially more profitable investment than stock markets and other financial instruments -- the number of "desirable locations remains virtually static," Knight Frank said. So buyers continue to focus on these few "key hubs." But Knight Frank predicted that wealthy people this year would expand their searches to include European cities previously thought to be too economically distressed: Milan, Madrid, Barcelona and Dublin, which will join Munich, Berlin, Zurich, Geneva and Vienna as "core European targets."
Some governments, concerned about affordability, are challenging the buying spree, through efforts to tinker with the luxury property markets. Last March the British government, seeking to crack down on tax avoidance, bolstered its "stamp duty" by 40 percent on properties valued over £2 million. Last month the Hong Kong government, concerned about a property bubble, raised stamp duties and tightened mortgage lending. But while the changes imposed in the United Kingdom have added revenue to government coffers, they have done little to slow the buying, Knight Frank said. Singapore also raised its stamp duty and made it tougher for foreigners to buy.
In the end, the global luxury property market is functioning in its own universe, seemingly removed from general real estate trends. It "remains relatively impervious to these trends and more closely follows the luxury goods market," Christie's International Real Estate said in a study released this week.
Cash is king. Buyers paid cash in every deal over $20 million brokered last year by Hilton & Hyland Real Estate in Beverly Hills, Calif., which saw a 64 percent increase in year-on-year sales volume, to $1.8 billion, from $1.1 billion in 2011, said Jeffrey Hyland, a co-owner.
Banks in New York, at least, have begun to lend more for construction financing. But credit for home purchases remains tight in the broader United States real estate market.
"Lenders are still afraid of their own shadow," said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a New York appraisal company. "Credit standards are just as tight" as they were after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Yet credit remains an afterthought in the world's most expensive property markets, which continue to soar and show no signs of tiring.

Full text:   THE recovery in housing, the stock market and the overall economy has finally gained sustainable momentum -- or so it is said.
That opinion seems to be based on several salient facts. Unemployment has been declining, from 10.0 percent in October 2009 to 7.7 percent last month. More spectacularly, the stock market has more than doubled since 2009 and has been especially strong for the last six months, with the Dow Jones industrial average reaching record closing highs last week and the S.& P. 500 flirting with superlatives, too.
And the housing market, seasonally adjusted, has been rising. The S.& P./Case-Shiller 20-city home price index gained 7 percent in 2012.
These vital signs make many people believe that we've turned the corner on the economy, that we've started a healing process. And their discussions often note one particular sign of systemic recovery: confidence. There is considerable hope that the markets are heralding a major development: that Americans have lost the fears and foreboding that have made the financial crisis of 2008 so enduring in its effects.
Hope is a wonderful thing. But we also need to remember that changes in the stock market, the housing market and the overall economy have relatively little to do with one another over years or decades. (We economists would say that they are only slightly correlated.) Furthermore, all three are subject to sharp turns. The economy is a complicated system, with many moving parts.
So, amid all those complications, there are other possibilities: Could we be approaching another major stock market peak? Will the housing market's takeoff be short-lived? And could we dip into another recession?
There are certainly risks. Congress is mired in struggles over the budget crisis and the national debt. The government is questioning the risk to taxpayers in its huge support of housing through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration and the Federal Reserve. Problems in Europe, Asia and the Middle East could easily shift people's confidence. There have been abrupt and significant changes in confidence in European markets since 2009. Is there any reason to think that the United States is immune to similar swings?
For years, I've been troubled by the problem of understanding the social psychology and economic impact of confidence. There hasn't been much research into the emotional factors and the shifts in worldview that drive major turning points. The much-quoted consumer sentiment and confidence indexes don't yet seem able to offer insight into what's behind the changes they quantify. It also isn't clear which factors of confidence drive the separate parts of the economy.
Along with colleagues, I have been conducting surveys about aspects of stock market confidence. For example, since 1989, with the help of some colleagues at Yale, I have been collecting data on the opinions and ideas of institutional investors and private individuals. These data, and indexes constructed from them, can be found on the Web site of the Yale School of Management.
I have called one of these indexes "valuation confidence." It is the percentage of respondents who think that the stock market is not overvalued. Using the six-month moving average ended in February, it was running at 72 percent for institutional investors and 62 percent for individuals. That may sound like a ton of confidence, but it isn't as high as the roughly 80 percent recorded in both categories just before the market peak of 2007.
HOW do the these figures relate to other stock market measures? I rely on the measure of stock market valuation that Prof. John Campbell of Harvard and I developed more than 20 years ago. Called the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, or CAPE, this measure is the real, or inflation-adjusted, Standard & Poor's 500 index divided by a 10-year average of real S.& P. earnings. The CAPE has been high of late: it stands at 23, compared with a historical average of around 15. This suggests that the market is somewhat overpriced and might show below-average returns in the future. (The use of the 10-year average reduces the impact of short-run, or cyclical, components of earnings.)
For perspective, compare today's valuation, confidence and CAPE figures to those of other important recent periods in the stock market. In the spring of 2000, a sharp market peak, only 33 percent of institutional investors and 28 percent of individual investors thought that the market was not overvalued. The CAPE reached 46, a record high based on data going back to 1871. (For the period before 1926, we rely on data from Alfred Cowles 3rd & Associates.) Yet most respondents in 2000 thought that the market would go up in the next year, so they hung in for the time being. That suggests that the 1990s boom was indeed a bubble, with investors suspecting that they might have to beat a hasty exit. They ended up trying to do just that, and brought the market down.
But then consider the valuation confidence in October 2007, another major peak, after which the stock market fell by more than 50 percent in real terms. At that peak, the CAPE was at 27 -- a little higher than it is now, though not extraordinarily lofty. In 2007, valuation confidence was 82 percent for institutional investors and 74 percent for individual investors, or not far from today's levels. Investors at the time didn't think that they were floating on a bubble, and they saw the probability of a stock market crash as unusually low. Yet a plunge soon occurred. The cause appears not to have been so much the bursting of an overextended bubble but the subprime mortgage crisis and a string of financial failures that most investors couldn't have known about.
Clearly, confidence can change awfully fast, and people can suddenly start worrying about a stock market crash, just as they did after 2007.
Today, the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory changes may help prevent another crisis. Even so, regulators can't do much about some of the questionable thinking that seems to drive changes in confidence.
For example, why is a record high in the United States stock market a reason for optimism? Nothing is remarkable about reaching a market record: the S.& P. Composite Index has done it 1,007 times, based on daily closes, since the beginning of 1928. That's about once every 23 trading days, on average, though the new records tend to come in bunches.
The important fact is that we haven't set a nominal stock-market record in six years. And we haven't set one in 13 years if we use the inflation-corrected S.& P. Composite total-return index. That this index may be about to set a record means only that we haven't made any real money in the stock market in 13 years, which hardly seems a reason for confidence.
But public thinking is inscrutable. We can keep trying to understand it, but we'll be puzzled again the next time the markets or the economy make major moves.

Full text:   MORE than five years after the stock market began to slide in the fall of 2007, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered all of the ground lost in the recession and rose to new highs this week.
The Dow, the American market barometer with the longest history, has recorded only four longer periods in which the market was unable to set a new high. It came nowhere near, of course, the quarter-century it took the market to recover all of the ground lost in the Great Depression, but in magnitude it was second only to that fall among long-lasting declines.
At the worst, almost exactly four years ago, the Dow was down 54 percent from its closing price on Oct. 9, 2007. While that was nowhere near the 89 percent disaster seen during the Depression, it exceeded the 47 percent fall after the 1919 peak and the 46 percent plunge after the 1973 high.
All of those figures are in nominal dollars, excluding the effect of inflation. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the Dow remains nearly 10 percent below its 2007 level when adjusted for changes in consumer prices. That peak, too, was a little lower than the 2000 high when adjusted for prices. So on an inflation-adjusted basis, the market is still below where it was 13 years ago.
The Dow contains 30 stocks at any given time, but S&P Dow Jones Indexes, which now manages the index, periodically removes companies and replaces them with others. The accompanying charts list the performance of the 36 stocks that were in the Dow over some part of the period since 2007.
The one that many readers will not recognize is Mondelez. It was known as Kraft Foods when it replaced the American International Group, the disgraced and bailed-out insurance company, in the index in 2008. But last year, Kraft split up and was taken out of the index. There is still a company called Kraft, which sells products in North American grocery stores, but Mondelez is the larger part, selling snack foods around the globe.
Mondelez, by whatever name, is one of seven Dow companies that outperformed the index both on the way down -- from Oct. 9, 2007, through March 9, 2009 -- and on the way back, through Tuesday, when the index first closed over its 2007 peak. The charts end on that day. The others are Altria, I.B.M., Home Depot, Travelers, Pfizer and United Technologies.
Altria, the tobacco company, was kicked out of the index in 2008. Had it stayed, it would have been the best-performing Dow company from peak to peak, gaining 117 percent. Among the companies now in the index, Home Depot was the best performer, with a 108 percent gain.
The charts show the large benefits, and large risks, available to those who speculate in stocks that have lost nearly all their value. Four of the companies -- Bank of America, General Motors, Citigroup and A.I.G. -- were off more than 90 percent when the market hit bottom. Three of them have since tripled or better. The fourth, General Motors, continued to fall, and the old shares became worthless after the company went through bankruptcy. The current G.M. shares went to creditors of the old company, not to shareholders.
Percentage gains from very low levels can be deceptive, however. A.I.G. is up more than 500 percent over the last four years, but it is still 97 percent lower than it was when the market peaked in 2007. Similarly, Citigroup is down 90 percent, and Bank of America is off 78 percent.
Four Dow stocks did worse than the index on the way down and also on the way up. Besides General Motors, they are Alcoa, Cisco and Merck.

Full text:   WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting a pickup in the labor market and the pace of economic growth.
The decline in jobless claims, released on Thursday, may foreshadow a strong report on February employment.
The figures were the latest to indicate the economy's resilience amid higher taxes, although a separate report showing that the United States trade gap widened in January dimmed the near-term outlook a bit.
"Fundamentally, we are getting on a little better footing right now," said Omair Sharif, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Stamford, Conn.
Initial claims for state jobless aid fell 7,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 340,000, the Labor Department said. It was the second consecutive weekly decline, and it confounded economists' expectations for an increase to 355,000.
The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, fell 7,000 to 348,750, the lowest level since March 2008.
On Jan. 1, a 2 percent payroll tax cut ended and tax rates rose for wealthy Americans. In addition, $85 billion in federal budget cuts took effect on March 1 that could slice as much as 0.6 percentage point from growth this year.
Economists were encouraged by the drop in claims. "It suggests that some jobs are being created, and there is income that is falling into the consumers' pockets," said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.
In another sign of improving economic conditions, household debt grew at its fastest pace since early 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Federal Reserve said in a report. Consumers continued to increase their borrowing in January from December, adding $16.2 billion in debt.
Meanwhile, a separate report showed that worker productivity fell at its fastest pace in four years in the fourth quarter, but the decline was likely to be temporary as economic growth is expected to increase after stalling in late 2012.
"First-quarter growth is going to be substantially stronger than where we ended last year," Mr. Bullard said.
The economy grew at a 0.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first three months of this year range as high as 2.8 percent, mostly reflecting an increase in the pace of business restocking.
The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit widened to $44.45 billion in January from $38.14 billion in December. Exports fell, giving back the bulk of December's gains, while imports rebounded after being depressed by disruptions to port activity in the previous months.
The inflation-adjusted trade deficit widened to $48 billion from $44.2 billion in December. Economists said this suggested that trade would be a small drag on first-quarter growth.
"The sharp deterioration in trade shaves a bit from the outlook for growth in the first quarter," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. "There are signs that domestic demand is firming, which would provide a major offset to weakness abroad."
While the latest jobless claims data fell outside the period for the government's report on February employment due on Friday, economists said they would not be surprised if job growth during the month beat expectations.
A Reuters survey of economists said employers probably added 160,000 jobs last month, a small increase from 157,000 in January. That would just be enough to hold the jobless rate steady at 7.9 percent.
Economists say job gains of at least 250,000 a month are needed to significantly reduce unemployment. Job growth averaged 200,000 in the three months through January.
Worker productivity fell at a 1.9 percent annual rate, the weakest pace since the fourth quarter of 2008, the Labor Department reported. A month ago it estimated that productivity, hourly output per worker, fell at a 2 percent pace.
It increased at a 3.1 percent rate in the third quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the decline in productivity to be revised to a 1.6 percent rate.
The drop largely reflects a surge in hiring while output continued to expand at a slower pace. The economy added about 600,000 jobs in the fourth quarter, but gross domestic product grew at only a 0.1 percent rate.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDCARACAS, Venezuela -- Heads of state from around Latin America flocked to Venezuela for the funeral on Friday of Hugo Chávez, a tribute to the undiminished drawing power of the charismatic leftist leader, although perhaps not to the lasting influence of his socialist-inspired policies.
Mr. Chávez, who died Tuesday of cancer at 58, was one of the loudest voices in Latin America, pushing a vision of regional unity and defiance of Washington, sweetened with cheap oil shipments to needy neighbors. But the legacy of Mr. Chávez's Bolivarian revolution remains more limited than he would have liked.
"It didn't catch on," said Alejandro Toledo, a former president of Peru. "The important thing is that Mexico has not followed his example, Chile has not followed his example, Peru has not followed his example, Colombia has not followed his example, Brazil has not followed his example. I'm talking about big countries with large, sustained economic growth."
Venezuela ranked 13th of 18 countries in per capita economic growth from 1999 to 2011, according to World Bank data for Mexico and Central and South America. It has high inflation and chronic shortages of basic goods. It has one of the highest rates of violent crime, and it is riven by bitter political divisions.
"Those indicators were not lost on other parts of the hemisphere," said Patrick Duddy, a former United States ambassador to Venezuela.
And while poverty went down significantly during Mr. Chávez's years as president, other countries, like Brazil, Peru and Colombia, made progress in reducing poverty while following paths very different from that of Mr. Chávez.
Brazil, in particular, has emerged as a model that some governments in the region are seeking to emulate, balancing a friendlier approach to private enterprise with innovative social programs that have lifted millions from poverty into the middle class.
"The intention of Venezuela to be the shining light of the new left has not been realized," said Leonardo Valente, a professor of international relations at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. "The other countries that have governments to the left and center-left are looking to Brazil and other countries that have a different position, a more balanced position."
Yet Mr. Chávez had many influential and enthusiastic allies, as evidenced by the international outpouring that followed his death on Tuesday.
In an opinion article published in The New York Times on Thursday, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, whose policies are credited with the country's strong economic growth and poverty reduction, lauded Mr. Chávez for his commitment to improving the lives of his country's poor.
And he praised him for his pursuit of regional unity, including his role in starting groups like the Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas.
But some analysts point out that Mr. Chávez also clashed with some regional leaders and undermined efforts at integration that did not mesh with his ideological views. And his fiery clashes with the United States were seen by many as counterproductive.
"What happens with Chávez's passing is the temperature goes down a little bit, the decibel level goes down," said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. "Chávez has been a very polarizing figure."
President Evo Morales of Bolivia, a close friend of Mr. Chávez, was among the first leaders to arrive in Caracas this week, and he made the entire seven-hour walk on Wednesday beside Mr. Chávez's coffin from the hospital where he died to a military academy where he lay in state.
People stood in line for hours for the chance to pass briefly by the glass-covered coffin where Mr. Chávez lay, wearing a green uniform and a red beret like the one he wore when he first appeared on the nation's television screens after the failed 1992 coup that he led.
"He looked just like he did in life," said Luis Cabrera Aguirre, a retired rear admiral who served as an adviser to Mr. Chávez.
Vice President Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez's designated successor, announced that the government intended to embalm the body -- "just like Ho Chi Minh, like Lenin, like Mao" -- so Venezuelans could see him eternally on display in the Museum of the Revolution.
Throughout the day on Thursday, government television broadcast the nonstop passage of mourners. Many saluted the president's remains. Others crossed themselves. One elderly woman beat her breast and nearly fainted. Meanwhile, conflicting accounts of Mr. Chávez's last hours emerged.
The Reuters news agency reported that a government official had said that Mr. Chávez fell into a coma on Monday and died the next day of respiratory failure.
But the head of Venezuela's presidential guard, Gen. José Ornella, told The Associated Press that Mr. Chávez died of a major heart attack after mouthing the words, "I don't want to die. Please don't let me die."
Many questions remained over what is next for Venezuela. Foreign Minister Elías Jaua said Wednesday that Mr. Maduro would become interim president and that the government would adhere to the Constitution, which says the nation should proceed to a new election within 30 days. Late Thursday officials said that Mr. Maduro would be sworn in president on Friday. But no election plans have yet been announced.
A decree declaring a seven-day period of national mourning had already appeared with Mr. Maduro's signature, identifying as "president in charge." It was also signed by two dozen cabinet ministers.
Mr. Maduro is expected to run for president against Henrique Capriles Radonski, a state governor who lost an election to Mr. Chávez in October.
Most political observers expect that Mr. Maduro will ride a wave of loyalty and grief over Mr. Chávez's death to an election victory. Yet looming economic problems and deep political divisions will make for a difficult transition, which the region will be watching closely.
Oil is the heart of Venezuela's economy -- the country has the world's largest estimated reserves -- and, although the United States buys more Venezuelan oil than any other country, it was also at the center of Mr. Chávez's foreign policy and its anti-American thrust.
Mr. Chávez forged close ties with fellow OPEC member Iran, in defiance of the United States-led effort to isolate that country over its nuclear program. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran was expected to attend the funeral.
And Mr. Chávez shipped oil to Syria despite international repudiation of President Bashar al-Assad's aggressive response to an internal uprising.
Closer to home, Mr. Chávez assured himself of the loyalty of his neighbors by shipping billions of dollars of oil and fuel a year to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean under special agreements that required them to pay for only a portion of the cost up front, often with products like chicken, soybeans, wheat or clothing. The remainder of the cost was structured as a long-term loan at low interest.
The program was popular among his supporters in Venezuela, who saw it as a high-minded expression of solidarity with other underdeveloped nations. But the opposition was bitterly opposed, seeing it as a costly giveaway at a time of many unattended needs at home. Even if Mr. Chávez's supporters remain in control, a rocky economy and stagnant oil production could ultimately make it hard to keep the oil program going at present levels.
The most extreme consequences of such a change would be felt in Cuba, a main ally, which has been propped up by large shipments of Venezuelan oil. But other countries, like Nicaragua and Bolivia, will feel the bite, and it may hamper the ability of a successor to retain the support of regional leaders.
"Venezuela's influence in Latin America was built on the back of oil exports and oil wealth," said Blake Clayton, an energy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Whoever succeeds Chávez will have a hard time retaining, let alone increasing, the country's influence with its neighbors."
Correction: March 27, 2013, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on March 8 about the legacy of the Bolivarian revolution of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who died earlier that week, misinterpreted data from the World Bank about Venezuela's rank in economic growth in relation to that of other countries. Venezuela ranked 13th of 18 countries in per capita economic growth from 1999 to 2011, according to statistics for Mexico and Central and South America. It did not have one of the lowest rates of economic growth in the region during the 14 years that Mr. Chávez held office.

Full text:   TAHARA, Japan -- Just two months into office, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is showing an increasing willingness to take on some pillars of Japan's establishment -- the central bank and the country's politically influential farmers -- in an aggressive attempt to finally breathe some new life into Japan's listless economy.
Mr. Abe has already forced the departure of the cautious head of the central Bank of Japan and nominated a replacement who vowed Monday to do "whatever it takes" to fight crippling deflation that has eroded profits and wages and stifled spending. Mr. Abe is also expected to announce soon that his nation will join negotiations on an American-led Pacific free-trade pact that the Obama administration hopes will offset China's growing economic and political might, but that could also force Japan to make painful, market-opening changes it has resisted for nearly two decades.
Joining the pact risks alienating farmers, longtime staunch supporters of Mr. Abe's conservative Liberal Democratic Party, who would face more intense competition from cheaper imports.
But the broader public appears more willing to embrace drastic economic measures at a time when Japan, the region's waning economic superpower, feels threatened by China, helping push Mr. Abe's approval ratings to around 70 percent in recent polls. That is a vast improvement from his disastrous first term in office six years ago, and from concerns that his hawkish views might alienate him once again from voters.
"The future of Japan's economic growth depends on us having the willpower and the courage to sail without hesitation onto the rough seas of global competition," Mr. Abe declared in a speech to Parliament last Thursday.
Critics warn that his stimulus measures, including a new wave of public works projects, could increase Japan's already crushing public debt, or set off a currency war as the prospect of drastic easing by the central bank has caused the yen's value to plummet.
They also worry that Mr. Abe's effort to combat deflation could include radical steps that they warn could disturb global financial markets by unleashing a flood of Japanese money into developing economies, causing dangerous, speculative bubbles.
The many economists who support Mr. Abe's plans, however, have a different warning: that any economic benefits could prove short-lived unless they are accompanied by a longer-term growth strategy.
The trade pact, they say, will be a good litmus test of Mr. Abe's willingness to force such deeper structural changes in Japan. It could also force the country to face a long-debated and difficult decision: whether it is willing to trade some of the egalitarianism it takes such pride in to embrace a freer form of capitalism that could break the grip of vested interests and reverse a long decline.
"The T.P.P. is a battle over what kind of country we want Japan to be," said Hisaharu Ito, a top official in Aichi Prefecture's Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, referring to the trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. His organization represents some 10,000 full-time farmers who fiercely oppose the trade group.
He added, "Do we want to turn into a harsh society of winners and losers, or remain a gentler society where benefits are shared?"
Japan's joining the trade group could have an added advantage for the United States, possibly opening some of Japan's still impenetrable markets to American products.
Here in Tahara, a city in central Aichi, where rice paddies and cabbage fields run up against a Lexus plant, Shigeaki Okamoto is the rare voice in the farming community pushing for change. He says Japanese farmers could compete without the tariffs they have been sheltered behind if they were allowed to become entrepreneurial.
Mr. Okamoto tried to export rice to China, only to be told that a company controlled by a farm co-op has a monopoly on sales to that country. He says such restrictions are typical of government bureaucrats and farming co-op officials who have tried to block him every step of the way with arbitrary regulations and even attempts to ostracize him from others farmers.
"Japan is wrapped in an invisible web that prevents you from showing any sort of initiative," said Mr. Okamoto, 51.
Mr. Abe's promises of economic revival have already created a budding optimism in urban areas like Tokyo, where the stock market has rallied and restaurants seem more crowded than they were during years in which many people resigned themselves to Japan's fading prospects. The new, if fragile, hopefulness has been boosted by rising corporate profits, as a weakening yen has brought desperately needed relief to badly shaken electronics corporations and other exporters struggling to compete with Chinese and Korean rivals.
The yen has dropped 20 percent in recent months, on the strength of Mr. Abe's promises to rethink Japan's priorities.
While the new prime minister is off to a strong start, political analysts said it was too early to tell if he will be the rare decisive Japanese leader who can make a real impact, like his mentor, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, whose liberalizing policies Mr. Abe is apparently seeking to continue.
Economists say the jury is still out on whether Mr. Abe's measures, popularly called Abenomics, will be drastic enough to restore growth to a $5.9 trillion economy that in yen has shrunken back to the same size it was in the early 1990s and caused the country to slip behind China on the list of the world's largest economies. (The current ranking is the United States first, followed by China and Japan.)
Mr. Abe started his push for changes at the Bank of Japan less than a month after taking office in December, pressing its leaders to set a target of causing rising prices, or inflation, at a rate of 2 percent per year. When the bank failed to follow quickly with bold measures to accomplish that goal, Mr. Abe's Liberal Democrats threatened to rewrite the law to make the bank more obedient.
That was enough to drive the incumbent central bank governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, who has long been criticized for inaction, to announce that he would step down three weeks earlier than planned. On Thursday, Mr. Abe nominated his replacement, Haruhiko Kuroda, an Oxford-trained former Finance Ministry official.
Even Mr. Abe's own economic advisers say it is unclear what Mr. Kuroda will do, and point out that he is more cautious than other people whose names were floated as possible replacements for Mr. Shirakawa. Still, at parliamentary hearings on his nomination on Monday, Mr. Kuroda pledged to do "whatever it takes to escape from deflation," without giving specifics.
Mr. Abe's advisers say they expect Mr. Kuroda to at least catch up with the more aggressive increase of the money supply adopted by the United States' Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, since the 2008 financial crisis.
One adviser, Nobuyuki Nakahara, a former member of the Japanese bank's governing Policy Board, said Mr. Kuroda's most likely first steps would be to sharply increase purchases of corporate bonds and real-estate-linked securities.
Mr. Nakahara and others call it ironic that the Bank of Japan has fallen behind the Fed, given that the Japanese central bank a decade ago pioneered Mr. Bernanke's current strategy of flooding the economy with money, known as quantitative easing.
There have been calls for the Japanese bank to once again break new ground by taking more unprecedented steps, like buying foreign bonds or unlimited numbers of newly issued Japanese treasuries, which would essentially hand a blank check to the Japanese government.
Many Japanese voters seem to agree that bolder steps are needed as anxiety grows over Japan's geopolitical standing versus China's.
"People here realize that economic revival is tied to Japan's security," said Robert Feldman, an economist in Tokyo at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela died Tuesday afternoon after a struggle with cancer, the government announced, leaving behind a bitterly divided nation in the grip of a political crisis that grew more acute as he languished for weeks, silent and out of sight, in hospitals in Havana and Caracas.
Close to tears and his voice cracking, Vice President Nicolás Maduro said he and other officials had gone to the military hospital where Mr. Chávez was being treated, sequestered from the public, when "we received the hardest and most tragic information that we could transmit to our people."
In short order, police officers and soldiers were highly visible as people ran through the streets, calling loved ones on cellphones, rushing to get home. Caracas, the capital, which had just received news that the government was throwing out two American military attachés it accused of sowing disorder, quickly became an enormous traffic jam. Stores and shopping malls abruptly closed.
As darkness fell, somber crowds congregated in the main square of Caracas and at the military hospital, with men and women crying openly in sadness and fear about what would come next.
In one neighborhood, Chávez supporters set fire to tents and mattresses used by university students who had chained themselves together in protest several days earlier to demand more information about Mr. Chávez's condition.
"Are you happy now?" the Chávez supporters shouted as they ran through the streets with sticks. "Chávez is dead! You got what you wanted!"
Mr. Chávez's departure from a country he dominated for 14 years casts into doubt the future of his socialist revolution. It alters the political balance not only in Venezuela, the fourth-largest supplier of foreign oil to the United States, but also in Latin America, where Mr. Chávez led a group of nations intent on reducing American influence in the region.
Mr. Chávez, 58, changed Venezuela in fundamental ways, empowering and energizing millions of poor people who had felt marginalized and excluded. But his rule also widened society's divisions, and his death is sure to bring vast uncertainty as the nation tries to find its way without its central figure.
"He's the best president in history," said Andrés Mejía, 65, a retiree in Cumaná, an eastern city, crying as he gathered with friends in a plaza. "Look at how emotional I am -- I'm crying. I cannot accept the president's death. But the revolution will continue with Maduro."
The Constitution says that, since Mr. Chávez was at the start of a term, the nation should "proceed to a new election" within 30 days, and Foreign Minister Elías Jaua said in a television interview that Mr. Maduro would take the helm in the meantime. The election is likely to pit Mr. Maduro, whom Mr. Chávez designated as his political successor, against Henrique Capriles Radonski, a young state governor who lost to Mr. Chávez in the presidential election in October.
But in light of Mr. Chávez's illness, there has been heated debate in recent months over clashing interpretations of the Constitution, and it is impossible to predict how the transition will proceed.
"We, your civilian and military companions, Commander Hugo Chávez, assume your legacy, your challenges, your project, accompanied by and with the support of the people," Mr. Maduro told the nation.
Only hours earlier, the government seemed to go into a state of heightened alert as Mr. Maduro convened a crisis meeting in Caracas of cabinet ministers, governors loyal to the president and top military commanders.
Taking a page out of Mr. Chávez's time-tested playbook, Mr. Maduro warned in a lengthy televised speech that the United States was seeking to destabilize the country, and the government expelled the two American military attachés, accusing one of seeking to recruit Venezuelan military personnel to carry out "destabilizing projects." He called on Venezuelans to unite as he raised the specter of foreign intervention.
During the speech, Mr. Maduro said the government suspected that the president's enemies had found a way to cause his cancer, a possibility that Mr. Chávez had once raised. Mr. Maduro said scientists should investigate the source of his illness.
Mr. Chávez long accused the United States of trying to undermine or even assassinate him; indeed, the Bush administration gave tacit support for a coup that briefly removed him from power in 2002. He often used Washington as a foil to build support or distract attention from deeply rooted problems at home, like high inflation and soaring crime.
American officials had hoped to improve relations with Venezuela under Mr. Maduro, with informal talks taking place last year. But more recently, the government has appeared to shift into campaign mode, taking sweeping aim at the Venezuelan opposition and playing up the opposition's real or alleged ties to the United States.
"We completely reject the Venezuelan government's claim that the United States is involved in any type of conspiracy to destabilize the Venezuelan government," Patrick Ventrell, a State Department spokesman, said after the expulsion of the American attachés. He added, "Notwithstanding the significant differences between our governments, we continue to believe it important to seek a functional and more productive relationship with Venezuela."
Mr. Chávez's cancer was diagnosed in June 2011, but throughout his treatment he and his government kept many details about his illness secret. He had three operations in Cuba between June 2011 and February 2012, as well as chemotherapy and radiation treatment, but the cancer kept coming back.
Then on Dec. 8, just two months after winning re-election, Mr. Chávez stunned the nation by announcing in a televised address that he needed yet more surgery. That operation, his fourth, took place in Havana on Dec. 11.
In the aftermath, grim-faced aides described the procedure as complex and said Mr. Chávez's condition was delicate. They eventually notified the country of complications, first bleeding and then a severe lung infection and difficulty breathing.
After previous operations, Mr. Chávez often appeared on television while recuperating in Havana, posted messages on Twitter or was heard on telephone calls made to television programs on a government station. But after his December operation, he was not seen again in public, and his voice fell silent.
Mr. Chávez's aides eventually announced that a tube had been inserted in his trachea to help his breathing, and that he had difficulty speaking. It was the ultimate paradox for a man who seemed never at a loss for words, often improvising for hours at a time on television, haranguing, singing, lecturing, reciting poetry and orating.
As the weeks dragged on, tensions rose in Venezuela. Officials in Mr. Chávez's government strove to project an image of business as usual and deflected inevitable questions about a vacuum at the top. At the same time, the country struggled with an out-of-balance economy, troubled by soaring prices and escalating shortages of basic goods.
The opposition, weakened after defeats in the presidential election in October and elections for governor in December, in which its candidates lost in 20 of 23 states, sought to keep pressure on the government.
Then officials suddenly announced on Feb. 18 that Mr. Chávez had returned to Caracas. He arrived unseen on a predawn flight and was installed in a military hospital, where, aides said, he was continuing treatments.
Over nearly a decade and a half, Mr. Chávez made most major decisions and dominated all aspects of political life. He inspired a fierce, sometimes religious devotion among his supporters and an equally fervent animus among his opponents. As many of his followers say, "With Chávez everything, without Chávez nothing."
But that leaves his revolution in a precarious spot without its charismatic leader.
"In regimes that are so person-based, the moment that the person on which everything hangs is removed, the entire foundation becomes very weak because there was nothing else supporting this other than this figure," said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College.
Mr. Chávez's death could provide an opportunity for the political opposition, which was never able to defeat him in a head-to-head contest. Mr. Capriles lost to Mr. Chávez by 11 percentage points in October. But he has twice beaten top Chávez lieutenants in running for governor of his state, Miranda, which includes part of Caracas.
And Mr. Maduro is far from having Mr. Chávez's visceral connection to the masses of Venezuela's poor. Even so, most analysts believe that Mr. Maduro will have an advantage, and that he will receive a surge of support if the vote occurs soon.
But even if Mr. Maduro prevails, he may have a hard time holding together Mr. Chávez's movement while fending off resistance from what is likely to be a revived opposition.
Mr. Chávez's new six-year term began on Jan. 10, with the president incommunicado in Havana. In his absence, the government held a huge rally in the center of Caracas, where thousands of his followers raised their hands to pledge an oath of "absolute loyalty" to their commander and his revolution. Officials promised that Mr. Chávez would have his inauguration later, when he had recovered.
But the hoped-for recovery never came. Now, instead of an inauguration, Mr. Chávez's followers are left to plan a funeral.
The foreign minister, Mr. Jaua, announced that on Wednesday Mr. Chávez's body would be taken to the military academy in Caracas and lie in state there.
Mr. Jaua said that the government would hold a ceremony on Friday with visiting heads of state and that officials would announce later where Mr. Chávez would be laid to rest.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDThe economy may be struggling to recover, but by one closely watched measure the fear that not long ago paralyzed the markets has lifted.
The oldest and most popular gauge of the stock market on Tuesday surged past the nominal high it last reached more than five years ago, before the financial crisis hit with full force.
In the past, such a recovery would have led to celebrations on Wall Street and spread optimism about the economy. But the gain by the Dow Jones industrial average -- the stocks of 30 American corporate giants like Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil and Microsoft -- was a more downbeat event.
Wall Street executives were not dismissing the rally out of hand, but after several years of turbulence they were not cracking open the Champagne either.
"The market reflects an improving economy in the U.S. and abroad," said James P. Gorman, the chief executive of the Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley. "It helps individuals through their 401(k)'s and other investments. That being said, it has been a very fast move, and prudent investors would be well served to tread carefully and look for improving economic evidence to support any moves to higher levels."
It has taken nearly five and half years for the Dow to get this far. Now there are concerns about whether the forces that have driven the market rally -- the huge stimulus actions by the Federal Reserve and banner corporate profits -- will be sufficient to push it higher.
Ordinary investors, who have largely sat on the sidelines of the market, will be asking themselves whether it is time to start investing in stocks again, given the gains that have taken place.
"What's amazing about this bull market is that people still don't think it's real," said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors, a money management firm. "We think this could be the biggest bull market of our careers."
The Dow broke through with a gain of 125.95 points, or 0.9 percent, closing at 14,253.77 on Tuesday. Since hitting a low in March 2009, with the panic of the financial crisis still fresh, the market measure has more than doubled.
The recovery is remarkable because the American housing market remains weak, Europe still has moments of severe instability, and fiscal battles drag on in Washington.
Using other yardsticks, however, the performance of the blue-chip Dow does not look quite as impressive.
The much broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the benchmark favored by investment professionals, was slightly below its 2007 high even after it climbed 14.59 points on Tuesday, nearly 1 percent, to 1,539.79. And when adjusted for inflation, both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 were well below their levels at the start of the last decade.
The Nasdaq composite index also surged Tuesday, rising 42.10 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,224.13, but it remains well below its 2000 high, when it topped 5,000.
Previous highs occurred when investors believed the economy could keep growing without any extraordinary assistance. By contrast, this rally has occurred on the back of enormous monetary stimulus by the Fed and the world's other central banks.
Since the end of 2007, five major central banks have injected some $6 trillion into the global economy, according to figures from the Bank for International Settlements. This was done to prevent bank runs and revive economies.
As the stimulus forced down interest rates, it eventually whetted investors' appetite for riskier assets like stocks.
"Central banks do matter. Central banks have always mattered," said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates, who started work as a Wall Street economist on the day the stock market crashed in 1987.
The looming question is what will happen when the Fed stops its stimulus. Mr. Rosenberg said that after the crisis the stock market declined sharply on two occasions when the Fed signaled that it might temper its monetary easing.
"In both cases, the Fed backtracked," he said.
Still, the Fed's easy money does not look like it is going to dry up soon. The stock market's sharp move up in recent days occurred after two senior officials from the Federal Reserve, including the chairman Ben S. Bernanke, emphasized their commitment to a slack monetary policy.
The Fed has said that it will keep up the stimulus until unemployment is well below current levels. And Fed policy makers will be all the more likely to take that stance if fiscal policy acts as a brake on the economy.
The strength of the stock market is not strongly reflected in the real economy. Consumer confidence is well below the level it hit during the last high in October 2007. The unemployment rate was then 4.7 percent, compared with 7.9 percent now.
Some analysts question how much further the stock market can rise if the Fed's actions do not lift the economy out of its sluggishness.
"I don't think the market is going to look past several quarters of weak growth," said Barry C. Knapp, a markets strategist with Barclays. He said the types of stocks that have done well this year are those that investors buy when economic growth is low, like health care and consumer staples.
Still, the recent rally has a strong corps of believers who have been bullish for a long time.
"I think 2013 is a year where those who've been really skeptical of this market have to rethink their arguments," said Thomas Lee, the chief U.S. Equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase.
While acknowledging that much of the market's gains have come from the Fed's monetary policies, Mr. Lee said that corporate profits have continued to rise, and that other signs of confidence in the markets, like mergers and stock buybacks, have also rebounded.
"I think we'll have a bull market for several more years," he said. "It's been a pretty healthy rally."
Stocks can become more vulnerable to declines when their valuations climb to historical highs. But right now stocks do not look particularly pricey.
Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale, has built a model for gauging whether stocks are cheap or expensive. Right now, stock valuations are above historical averages, but well below the stratospheric highs they have reached in bubbles, he said. According to his model, stocks are signaling that they can return about 3 to 4 percent a year.
"That's not horrible," he said, though he was quick to add that the stock market had a mind of its own.
The stock market's volatility has scared retail investors for several years. A total of $556 billion has been taken out of mutual funds focused on American stocks since October 2007, according to the Investment Company Institute. That is an enormous pot of money that largely missed out on the market's recovery.
But recent figures show a sudden change of mind among retail investors. In January, some $32 billion in net investments flowed into mutual and exchange-traded funds that focus on American stocks, according to TrimTabs Investment Research, one of the highest one-month figures in the data company's records.
Mr. Gorman of Morgan Stanley said, "I would hope retail investors don't pile into the market at this point, but step in cautiously."
In the bond market, interest rates edged higher, although they remain historically low. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note slipped 5/32, to 100 30/32, while its yield rose to 1.90 percent from 1.88 percent late Monday.
Correction: March 9, 2013, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a milestone high reached by the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday misstated the recent increase in investments in domestic exchange-traded and equity funds as measured by TrimTabs Investment Research. The net inflow into equity funds was $32 billion in January; it was not $77 billion in January, as stated in some copies, nor was it $55.1 billion in January and February, as stated in other editions.

Full text:   BEIJING -- Wen Jiabao, in his final address as China's prime minister, warned on Tuesday of the growing divisions between rich and poor, the hazards of unchecked environmental degradation and the risks posed by unbalanced economic growth.
"Social strains are clearly increasing," he said in a speech that was otherwise thick with glowing statistics and rosy socialist-style jargon about the nation's achievements.
Addressing nearly 3,000 delegates at the opening of the annual National People's Congress, Mr. Wen also announced that the government would continue to lavishly finance the Chinese military, spending $116 billion in 2013, a 10.7 percent rise over last year, but slightly below the 11.2 increase that occurred in 2012.
Mr. Wen, the nation's top economic steward, set a 7.5 percent target for growth in the coming year, an enviable rate in much of the world but well below the double-digit increases that have in recent years made China one of the world's fastest growing economies. He also pledged to create more than nine million jobs in Chinese cities and to keep the rate of inflation at 3.5 percent.
"Development is still the key to solving all our problems," he said.
But the speech, his last state-of-the-nation address before he retires at the end of the 13-day congress, was notable for what was missing. In contrast to his speeches of years past, there was no mention of political reform and only a passing reference to the rampant corruption that Communist Party leaders have acknowledged could threaten their hold on power. Instead, Mr. Wen, famous for his liberal pronouncements, coolly reaffirmed the party's heavy-handed approach to the nation's political and economic affairs.
"China is still in the primary stage of socialism and will remain so for a long time," he said.
Also absent in Mr. Wen's sprawling 29-page report was any discussion of re-education through labor, the widely detested system of extralegal detention that allows the police to jail petty thieves, prostitutes and antigovernment bloggers without trial for up to three years.
"In a sense, his speech was quite disappointing," said Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. "He spent a lot of time trying to justify his last years in office."
An emotive populist, Mr. Wen became the party's human face during his decade as prime minister. He was dispatched to disaster zones to comfort earthquake victims or, in 2008, to calm migrant workers stranded by a snowstorm that disrupted travel for millions during the Chinese New Year holiday. But despite his popularity among ordinary Chinese, his vocal advocacy of political reform often put him at odds with the party's conservative leadership.
Mr. Lam, for one, said he thought the muted reaction to Mr. Wen's speech at the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday reflected his diminished stature among party stalwarts.
"Compared to the long applause that followed the swan song of Zhu Rongji, the response was pretty weak," Mr. Lam said, referring to Mr. Wen's predecessor.
Although it is never easy divining the intentions of China's cautious and cryptic leadership, the highly scripted speeches delivered during the annual legislative sessions often provide clues about the government's priorities.
Mr. Wen's work report pledged a continuation of policies to promote technological innovation, increased spending on rural health insurance and the creation of 6.7 million units of low-cost housing.
But Mr. Wen, and the departing president, Hu Jintao, leave behind a host of nettlesome problems, including a perilous wealth gap and an economy increasingly dominated by state-owned enterprises and a privileged elite. Increasingly urgent, too, is the pollution that has fouled the nation's water, soil and air, a point underscored by the noxious haze that settled over the capital on Tuesday.
Broadcast live on national television, the prime minister's work report is a highlight of tightly choreographed political theater that rarely strays from a stolid procession of speeches, news conferences and invariably pro-government votes -- all of it intended to give a united and untroubled public face to a reliably secretive party leadership.
Last year, however, the script was challenged by a divisive scandal surrounding Bo Xilai, the combative party chief of Chongqing, whose fall unleashed months of revelations about murder, corruption and political infighting. Most analysts agree that the proceedings this year will ignore the plight of Mr. Bo, who is awaiting prosecution on charges of corruption, abuse of power and obstruction of justice.
The new president, Xi Jinping, and the man who will succeed Mr. Wen, Li Keqiang, have raised expectations for change by vowing to end flagrant privileges and self-enrichment by officials and their families. "Now we're looking for signs that the hopes can be satisfied," said Deng Yuwen, an editor for The Study Times, a newspaper published by the Central Party School in Beijing. "The congress won't have any breakthroughs, but it can indicate where and how fast the leaders want to take things."
The delegates at the gathering are selected through a process that rewards loyalists; about 70 percent are Communist Party members, and many are officials. Few dare defy the leadership's will by voting against proposals or abstaining from ballots, and the congress has never voted down a proposal put before it.
The meeting is likely to approve a modest restructuring of government ministries and agencies. Over the past few months, analysts and well-connected business executives have said that Mr. Li wanted a drastic reorganization, to create enlarged ministries for financial regulation, environmental protection and other areas.
But recent Chinese news reports have described a more limited plan that is most likely to include folding the scandal-laden and deeply indebted Ministry of Railways into the Ministry of Transport, and strengthening food and drug safety regulators to bring greater oversight of industries that are frequently hit by consumer safety concerns.

Abstract: The government also said it would make it harder for people to buy a second home.

Full text:   SHANGHAI -- Faced with a difficult combination of an economy addicted to cheap credit, exorbitant real estate prices fueled by that credit and mounting public concern that housing is no longer affordable, China's government is laying plans for steep new taxes on home sellers.
But those plans set off a sharp drop in Chinese stocks on Monday, as investors worried that the taxes could take a heavy toll on developers, an important sector of the Chinese economy. Any slowdown in real estate investment could ripple quickly across the entire economy, reducing demand for steel, cement, household appliances and many other mainstays of China's manufacturing-dependent economy.
China's cabinet, or State Council, said late Friday that it would insist that home sellers pay a uniform 20 percent capital gains tax on their profit. The government also said it would make it harder for people to buy a second home.
Because China, as the world's second-largest economy behind the United States, now plays an increasingly important role in global demand for many goods, the drop in Chinese share prices quickly reverberated through stock and commodity markets across Asia. Stocks in Europe also fell; in the United States the stock market dipped early but recovered to register modest gains by the end of the day.
Fearing a real estate bubble, the Chinese government began imposing a series of administrative measures through 2011 and engineered a slowdown in bank lending that, by last spring, had turned into an actual credit squeeze. Real estate prices weakened slightly, but the measures also resulted in a steep deceleration in the construction industry last spring and summer, causing a sharp slowdown in economic growth across China.
"This shows the government is determined to dampen the property market," said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silver Crest Asset Management in New York and a former professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing. "But they go through cycles when they want to pump up the economy, and then they want to cool it down. And this is what's happening again."
The slowdown alarmed China's leaders and prompted them to unleash a flood of fresh credit last autumn and this winter from banks, semiregulated trusts and other sources.
With loans readily available again, there are signs now that rising real estate prices might be back. The National Statistics Bureau reported that prices jumped in 54 of the 70 cities tracked by the government in January. In Shanghai, for example, average property prices were up as much as 40 percent in the first two months of the year, compared to the same time last year.
"Despite the policy-induced slowdown in activity, Chinese property remains on a wildly unsustainable path," Mark Williams, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. "Developers actually completed just short of 11 million properties last year."
In another worrying trend for the Chinese government, the flood of credit in the last few months has failed to cause a sharp uptick in sectors other than real estate; instead, the Chinese economy seems to be settling into a slower long-term growth rate even when receiving strong monetary stimulus.
The Chinese state news media said in recent days that the government was considering other measures in the hope of holding down housing prices. The announcements led to a weekend rush among those eager to buy and sell properties before the policy took effect.
With analysts predicting a sharp drop in property transactions after the policy takes effect, the Shanghai composite index fell 3.65 percent Monday to close at 2,273.40. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index dropped 1.5 percent, to 22,537.81. Property developers were hit particularly hard. Shares of Vanke, one of the biggest property developers in China, fell the daily limit of 10 percent in Shenzhen. Poly Real Estate also dropped 10 percent in Shanghai. Early Tuesday, Chinese markets showed signs of stabilizing as shares gained slightly.
As share prices fell on Monday, the government opened its annual parliamentary meeting in Beijing, a session that is expected to complete the nation's once-a-decade leadership transition and also set the agenda for the leadership team. Among the major challenges Beijing's new leaders face is how to cope with a widening income gap and how to address inflation and the high cost of housing for ordinary Chinese. Another social issue is a generational divide, as tens of millions of young people are finding that home prices have soared far beyond their buying capacity.
A popular comparison among recent college graduates is that their typical paycheck of $500 a month means that in an entire year, they could save only enough to buy two square meters, or 21.5 square feet, of an apartment in a large coastal city, and then only if they spent nothing on food or anything else. Buying an 800-square-foot apartment could take the paychecks of an entire career, by that calculation.
Affluent families often spend heavily to help children buy their first homes, particularly sons -- a popular perception holds that young men have trouble finding spouses if they do not own a home. But buying a city apartment with family backing is seldom an option for the more than 10 million rural residents pouring into Chinese cities each year, as China maintains one of the world's fastest paces of urbanization.
Compounding the national angst over high real estate prices this winter has been a series of cases in which low-ranking government officials and bank managers on modest salaries have mysteriously been found to own dozens of homes. Some Chinese cities have responded to the acrimony in recent weeks by severely restricting public access to real estate records. The government's plan for a capital-gains tax on home sellers is a new suggestion that had received little public discussion. Previous tax plans to cool the sector had been focused on introducing annual taxes on the assessed value of luxury homes, which have experienced the fastest appreciation over the last decade.
The Chinese government has pushed hard for the annual tax because it would raise the carrying cost of homes and prompt more owners to rent or sell their homes, instead of leaving them vacant as speculative investments, as many do now. But local governments lack systems for assessing the value of homes. And many developers and homeowners have argued strenuously that an annual tax would be unfair because the government already owns the land in China and issues very long leases for it, requiring that a sizable fee be paid up front for each year of the lease.

Full text:   TOKYO -- The nominee to become the next Bank of Japan governor said Monday that he would do "whatever is needed" to finally end deflation in the world's third-largest economy.
Haruhiko Kuroda, the nominee, who announced last week that he would resign as president of the Asian Development Bank, also called on the government to put its finances on a sounder footing to maintain investor confidence in the country's long-term solvency.
"If I am confirmed as governor, I will clearly communicate to markets that I am prepared to do whatever it takes to beat deflation," Mr. Kuroda told a confirmation hearing in Parliament.
"The Japanese economy has suffered from deflation for over 10, almost 15 years, which is a global anomaly of the most extreme. As prices have fallen, corporate profits and wages have shrunk, depressing consumption and investment and triggering even lower prices in a vicious cycle," he said.
"But to avoid a rise in interest rates and a loss of confidence in Japan's public finances, it is also critical to restore fiscal health in the mid- to long term," Mr. Kuroda said.
If confirmed, Mr. Kuroda is set to lead a crucial part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's three-pronged plan to spur economic growth. Mr. Abe has pledged to push the Bank of Japan to do more to pump money into the economy, spend generously on public works to stimulate growth and draw on private sector expertise to devise a fresh economic strategy that would make that growth sustainable. The Japanese economy ranks only behind those of the United States and China in size.
Under pressure from Mr. Abe, the central bank has already promised to expand its asset-purchase program to achieve a 2 percent inflation goal, compared with a negative rate of inflation that has dogged Japan for most of the last 15 years. Japan has also kept its policy interest rate close to zero for years, to no avail.
Mr. Kuroda said, however, that the "scale and scope" of the Bank of Japan's asset purchases had so far not been enough to achieve inflation and that it would be natural for the central bank to buy longer-term bonds.
He also acknowledged that as Japan tackled deflation, the yen would weaken, but he stressed that devaluation was a side effect of an economic policy to bolster growth and not a goal in itself. His comments were in response to concerns that policies that weakened the yen would touch off a global round of devaluations as countries sought to weaken their currencies to lift their exports.
"There is evidence that currencies tend to fall for countries that ease monetary policy on a large scale," Mr. Kuroda said, "but the B.O.J.'s policy is not targeting currencies."
"The important thing is to ensure price stability and achieve the 2 percent price stability goal, although it could affect currencies in that process," he said.
The opposition Democratic Party, which still leads Mr. Abe's Liberal Democratic Party in Parliament's upper house, has signaled that it will not block Mr. Kuroda's nomination. The current Bank of Japan governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, is scheduled to step down on March 19.

Abstract: The path charted by United Technologies, an industrial giant based in Hartford that is one of 30 companies in the Dow, underscores why corporate profits and share prices continue to rise in a lackluster economy and a stagnant job market.

Full text:   With the Dow Jones industrial average flirting with a record high, the split between American workers and the companies that employ them is widening and could worsen in the next few months as federal budget cuts take hold.
That gulf helps explain why stock markets are thriving even as the economy is barely growing and unemployment remains stubbornly high.
With millions still out of work, companies face little pressure to raise salaries, while productivity gains allow them to increase sales without adding workers.
"So far in this recovery, corporations have captured an unusually high share of the income gains," said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "The U.S. corporate sector is in a lot better health than the overall economy. And until we get a full recovery in the labor market, this will persist."
The result has been a golden age for corporate profits, especially among multinational giants that are also benefiting from faster growth in emerging economies like China and India.
These factors, along with the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep interest rates ultralow and encourage investors to put more money into riskier assets, prompted traders to send the Dow past 14,000 to within 75 points of a record high last week.
While buoyant earnings are rewarded by investors and make American companies more competitive globally, they have not translated into additional jobs at home.
Other recent positive economic developments, like a healthier housing sector and growth in orders for machinery and some other durable goods, have also encouraged Wall Street but similarly failed to improve the employment picture. Unemployment, after steadily declining for three years, has been stuck at just below 8 percent since last September.
With $85 billion in automatic cuts taking effect between now and Sept. 30 as part of the so-called federal budget sequestration, some experts warn that economic growth will be reduced by at least half a percentage point. But although experts estimate that sequestration could cost the country about 700,000 jobs, Wall Street does not expect the cuts to substantially reduce corporate profits -- or seriously threaten the recent rally in the stock markets.
"It's minimal," said Savita Subramanian, head of United States equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Over all, the sequester could reduce earnings at the biggest companies by just over 1 percent, she said, adding, "the market wants more austerity."
As a percentage of national income, corporate profits stood at 14.2 percent in the third quarter of 2012, the largest share at any time since 1950, while the portion of income that went to employees was 61.7 percent, near its lowest point since 1966. In recent years, the shift has accelerated during the slow recovery that followed the financial crisis and ensuing recession of 2008 and 2009, said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays.
Corporate earnings have risen at an annualized rate of 20.1 percent since the end of 2008, he said, but disposable income inched ahead by 1.4 percent annually over the same period, after adjusting for inflation.
"There hasn't been a period in the last 50 years where these trends have been so pronounced," Mr. Maki said.
At the individual corporate level, though, the budget sequestration could result in large job cuts as companies move to protect their bottom lines, said Louis R. Chenevert, the chief executive of United Technologies. Depending on how long the budget tightening lasts, the job cuts at his company could total anywhere from several hundred to several thousand, he said.
"If I don't have the business, at some point you've got to adjust the work force," he said. "You always try to find solutions, but you get to a point where it's inevitable."
The path charted by United Technologies, an industrial giant based in Hartford that is one of 30 companies in the Dow, underscores why corporate profits and share prices continue to rise in a lackluster economy and a stagnant job market. Simply put, United Technologies does not need as many workers as it once did to churn out higher sales and profits.
"Right now, C.E.O.'s are saying, 'I don't really need to hire because of the productivity gains of the last few years,' " said Robert E. Moritz, chairman of the accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers.
At 218,300 employees, United Technologies' work force is virtually unchanged from seven years ago, even though annual revenue soared to $57.7 billion in 2012 from $42.7 billion in 2005.
The relentless focus on maintaining margins continues, even though profit and revenue have never been higher; four days after the company's shares soared past $90 to a record high last month, United Technologies confirmed it would eliminate an additional 3,000 workers this year, on top of 4,000 let go in 2012 as part a broader restructuring effort.
"There's no doubt we will continue to drive productivity year after year," Mr. Chenevert said. "Ultimately, we compete globally."
When companies do hire, it is often overseas, where the growth is. Take 3M, another company among the Dow 30 that is trading at a record high.
Unlike United Technologies, the work force at 3M, based in Minnesota, has grown substantially in recent years, rising to 87,677 last year from 76,239 in 2007. But of those 11,438 positions added, only 608 were in the United States.
Even as President Obama and Congress have battled over the budget in recent months and growth has slowed to a crawl in the United States, the economic picture has actually brightened overseas. Asia has rebounded and Europe stabilized, factors helping the kind of big companies that make up the Dow, said Julia Coronado, chief North American economist at BNP Paribas.
"You're investing in the global economy," she said, "and you're getting access to stronger growth abroad."
The Federal Reserve has also played a crucial role in propelling the stock market higher, economists and strategists say, even if that was not the intent of policy makers. The Fed has made reducing unemployment a top priority, but in practice its policy of keeping rates very low and buying up the safest assets to stimulate the economy means investors are willing to take on more risk in search of better returns, hence the buoyancy on Wall Street amid the austerity in Washington and gloom on Main Street.
Of the broader market's 13 percent rise in 2012, about half was a result of the Fed's actions, Mr. Harris of Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates.
"The Federal Reserve has done a good job stimulating financial conditions and lifting the market," he said. "It's been less successful in stimulating job growth."

Full text:   "DOWNTON ABBEY" has tapped our inner Anglophile on a wide front. But Americans were not so besotted with Britain in the first half of the 20th century, when it was a powerhouse of international trade. Until World War II, Britain ran international finance to its liking, and Americans were thirsting to chop it down to size. We need to understand that to grasp the importance of the Bretton Woods monetary conference.
Representatives of some 44 nations gathered in July 1944 at Bretton Woods, a resort spot in New Hampshire, to hammer out a world monetary system, replacing the gold standard that had failed so woefully. But only two nations mattered: Britain and the United States.
In "The Battle of Bretton Woods" (Princeton University Press, $29.95), Benn Steil, a senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, describes that effort from its roots and projects its effect on today's conflicts among the dollar, the euro and the Chinese renminbi. Although America's global dominance has long since melted away, no substitute is yet strong enough to shove the dollar aside, in part because of Bretton Woods.
Britain entered the conference exhausted and broke, crippled by the war. It desperately needed flexible exchange rates to rekindle its vital exports to pay for the imports it required to live. It clung to a privileged access to trading with its empire, one-fourth of the Earth's land and people.
America was unscathed at home and far stronger in 1945 than in 1941. Owner of the bulk of the world's gold bullion, a stunning 20,000 metric tons, the United States wanted to emerge from World War II with fixed conversion rates assured by a dollar tied to gold. And it went without saying that it was bent on becoming the globe's financial capital.
Representing America at Bretton Woods was Harry Dexter White, an economics professor who had joined the Treasury as an adviser in 1934. By dint of intellect and hard work, he became grudgingly accepted as its ranking expert on international finance. He labored as the brains buttressing the Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau, who described himself as "just a farmer," albeit a close gentleman-farmer friend of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Morgenthau presided at Bretton Woods but White ran the show.
Dr. Steil presents evidence that White was also an informant for the Soviet Union, a starry-eyed admirer of what he saw as its remarkable economic success. For years, Dr. Steil says, White provided documents to the Soviets and favored their side in policy debates. In 1948, White fended off the House Un-American Activities Committee, denying that he was a Communist. A more adverse light was shed on his activities when wartime codes were broken years after his death. Dr. Steil is more convinced of the espionage claims surrounding White than some historians who see his actions as more innocent. There is no sign that his interest in the Soviets affected his work at Bretton Woods.
Taking Britain's part at the 1944 conference was the celebrated John Maynard Keynes, who knew full well that war had reduced Britain to a hapless debtor, obliged to accept whatever the United States offered. The book confirms that Keynes was an intellectual giant with flawless intuition for finance, but it also exposes his caustic criticisms of lesser men and his tin ear for workaday diplomacy. The Americans considered him too bright for his britches and bottled him up at every opportunity.
White had prepared so well that the actual conference was well-orchestrated, everything the Americans wanted. "Now the advantage is ours here, and I personally think we should take it," Morgenthau said to White, who fully agreed. As White said, "If the advantage was theirs, they would take it."
The Americans wanted free trade and open markets; they feared postwar inflation. Bretton Woods helped by providing for stable but convertible currencies, tied within limits to the dollar and ultimately to gold. It also created the International Monetary Fund, a money pool from which nations with trade deficits could borrow to satisfy international accounts. And it set up what became the World Bank, initially focused on rebuilding Europe, and later on the developing world. Britain lost out on looser exchange rates, and its imperial trade preferences were doomed.
On item after item, Keynes found a stone wall. What Dr. Steil calls his "most tangible legacy" from Bretton Woods was pathetic. Norway moved to abolish the Bank for International Settlements for cooperating with the Nazis, a motion that Keynes vehemently opposed. The delegates eventually agreed that the bank would be "liquidated at the earliest possible moment." The bank is still in business today.
Keynes ended up having to play an impossible hand. In 1945, he was left to sell Parliament on accepting arrangements that he had exhausted himself resisting. Four months later, he was dead. History later vindicated his advocacy of flexible exchange rates. The Bretton Woods system, not fully in effect till 1961, died only a decade later when President Richard M. Nixon ended the gold standard. The United States was running such large international deficits, paying out so many dollars, that not even Fort Knox had enough gold.
"The Battle of Bretton Woods" should become the gold standard on its topic. The details are addictive. But be warned: the book is dense. Every skirmish, every exchange -- and the book gets into hundreds of thems -- was presumably meaningful to the participants. But while some episodes mattered much, many did not. The author is no Robert Caro, who in his multivolume biography of Lyndon B. Johnson delves into minute details but also explains their larger significance.
Perhaps that is what is missing here -- an unmistakable voice, a sense that this rich history is told by one mind. Mr. Caro is known for working on his own, with the assistance of his wife. In his acknowledgments, Dr. Steil thanks 10 research assistants and an advisory panel of 18 luminaries. The book sometimes reads like a succession of brilliant but loosely connected graduate seminar papers -- an assemblage, a very fine one, but an assemblage nevertheless.

Abstract: Mr. Buffett's preferred performance measure -- lagged the broader stock market, increasing 14.4 percent, compared with the market's 16 percent return. Mr. Buffett lamented that 2012 was only the ninth time in 48 years that Berkshire's book value increase was less than the gain of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.

Full text:   Over the last half-century, Warren E. Buffett has built a reputation as a contrarian investor, betting against the crowd to amass a fortune estimated at $54 billion.
Mr. Buffett underscored that contrarian instinct in his annual letter to shareholders published on Friday. In a year when Mr. Buffett did not make any large acquisitions, he bought dozens of newspapers, a business others have shunned. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, has bought 28 dailies in the last 15 months.
"There is no substitute for a local newspaper that is doing its job," he wrote.
Those purchases, which cost Mr. Buffett a total of $344 million, are relatively minor deals for Berkshire, and just a small part of the giant conglomerate. And Mr. Buffett has begun this year with a bang, announcing last month his takeover, along with a Brazilian investment group, of the ketchup maker H. J. Heinz for $23.6 billion.
Despite the Heinz acquisition, Mr. Buffett bemoaned his inability to do a major deal in 2012. "I pursued a couple of elephants, but came up empty-handed," he said, adding that "our luck, however, changed early this year" with the Heinz purchase.
Written in accessible prose largely free of financial jargon, Berkshire's annual letter holds appeal far beyond Wall Street. This year's dispatch contained plenty of Mr. Buffett's folksy observations about investing and business that his devotees relish.
"More than 50 years ago, Charlie told me that it was far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than to buy a fair business at a wonderful price," Mr. Buffett wrote, referring to his longtime partner at Berkshire, Charlie Munger.
Mr. Buffett also struck a patriotic tone, directly appealing to his fellow chief executives "that opportunities abound in America." He noted that the United States gross domestic product, on an inflation-adjusted basis, had more than quadrupled over the last six decades.
"Throughout that period, every tomorrow has been uncertain," he wrote. "America's destiny, however, has always been clear: ever-increasing abundance."
The letter provides more than entertainment value and patriotic stirrings, delivering to Berkshire shareholders an update on the company's vast collection of businesses. With a market capitalization of $250 billion, Berkshire ranks among the largest companies in the United States.
Its holdings vary, with big companies like the railroad operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the electric utility MidAmerican Energy, and smaller ones like the running-shoe outfit Brooks Sports and the chocolatier See's Candies. All told, Berkshire employs about 288,000 people.
The letter, once again, did not answer a question that has vexed Berkshire shareholders and Buffett-ologists: Who will succeed Mr. Buffett, who is 82, as chief executive?
Last year, he acknowledged that he had chosen a successor, but he did not name the candidate.
He has said that upon his death, Berkshire will split his job in three, naming a chief executive, a nonexecutive chairman and several investment managers of its publicly traded holdings.
In 2010, he said that his son, Howard Buffett, would succeed him as nonexecutive chairman.
Berkshire's share price recently traded at a record high, surpassing its prefinancial crisis peak reached in 2007 and rising about 22 percent over the last year.
The company reported net income last year of about $14.8 billion, up about 45 percent from 2011. Yet the company's book value, or net worth -- Mr. Buffett's preferred performance measure -- lagged the broader stock market, increasing 14.4 percent, compared with the market's 16 percent return.
Mr. Buffett lamented that 2012 was only the ninth time in 48 years that Berkshire's book value increase was less than the gain of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. But he pointed out that in eight of those nine years, the S.& P. had a gain of 15 percent or more, suggesting that Berkshire proved to be a most valuable investment during bad market periods.
"We do better when the wind is in our face," he wrote.
For Berkshire's largest collection of assets, its insurance operations, the wind has been at its back. We "shot the lights out last year" in insurance, Mr. Buffett said.
He lavished praise on the auto insurer Geico, giving a special shout-out to the company's mascot, the Gecko lizard.
Investors also keep a keen eye on changes in Berkshire's roughly $87 billion stock portfolio. Its holdings include large positions in iconic companies like International Business Machines, Coca-Cola, American Express and Wells Fargo. He said Berkshire's investment in each of those was likely to increase in the future.
"Mae West had it right: 'Too much of a good thing can be wonderful,' " Mr. Buffett wrote.
He also heaped praise on two relatively new hires, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who now each manage about $5 billion in stock portfolios for Berkshire. Both men ran unheralded, modest-size money management firms before Mr. Buffett plucked them out of obscurity and moved them to Omaha to work for him.
He called the men "a perfect cultural fit" and indicated that the two would manage Berkshire's entire stock portfolio once he steps aside. "We hit the jackpot with these two," Mr. Buffett said, noting that last year, each outperformed the S.& P. by double-digit margins.
Then, sheepishly, employing supertiny type, he wrote: "They left me in the dust as well."
A former paperboy and member of the Newspaper Association of America's carrier hall of fame, Mr. Buffett devoted nearly three out of 24 pages of his annual report to newspapers.
While Mr. Buffett has been a longtime owner of The Buffalo News and a stakeholder in The Washington Post Company, he told shareholders four years ago that he wouldn't buy a newspaper at any price.
But his latest note reflects how much his opinion has turned. His buying spree started in November 2011, when he struck a deal to buy The Omaha World-Herald Company, this hometown paper, for a reported $200 million. By May 2012, he bought out the chain of newspapers owned by Media General, except for The Tampa Tribune. In recent months, he continued to express his interest in buying more papers "at appropriate prices -- and that means a very low multiple of current earnings."
"Papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time," wrote Mr. Buffett.
Mr. Buffett said in a telephone interview last month that he would consider buying The Morning Call of Allentown, Pa., a paper that the Tribune Company is considering selling. But Mr. Buffett said he had not contacted Tribune executives.
"It's solely a question of the specifics of it and the price," he said about the Allentown paper. "But it's similar to the kinds of communities that we bought papers in."
Mr. Buffett has plenty of cash to make more newspaper acquisitions. To cover his portion of the Heinz purchase, Mr. Buffett will deploy about $12 billion of Berkshire's $42 billion cash hoard. That leaves a lot of money for Mr. Buffett to continue his shopping spree for newspapers -- and more major acquisitions like Heinz.
"Charlie and I have again donned our safari outfits," Mr. Buffett wrote, "and resumed our search for elephants."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   PARIS -- The unemployment rate in the euro zone edged up in January to another record, official data showed on Friday, as the ailing European economy continued to weigh on the job market.
That, along with new data showing a decline in inflation in the euro zone, could prompt the European Central Bank to take steps to stimulate the economy when its governing council meets on Thursday, analysts said.
Unemployment in the 17-nation euro zone climbed to 11.9 percent in January from 11.8 percent the previous month, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union.
For the 27 nations of the European Union, the jobless rate was 10.8 percent, up from 10.7 percent in December. All of the figures were seasonally adjusted.
A separate Eurostat report showed price pressures easing in February. In the euro zone, the annual inflation rate was 1.8 percent, down from 2 percent in January and below the central bank's 2 percent target.
The jobless data suggests "that wage growth is set to weaken from already low rates" and further depress consumer spending, which has already been hurt by government austerity measures, wrote Jennifer McKeown, an economist at Capital Economics in London, in a research note.
Ms. McKeown said that the low inflation and high joblessness "should leave the E.C.B.'s policy options open," and that the central bank "might discuss an interest-rate cut or other unconventional policies."
There was some bright news on Friday. A survey of European purchasing managers by Markit, a data and research firm, showed that German manufacturing output grew for a second consecutive month in February as new business levels improved.
The composite German purchasing managers' index rose to 50.3 -- just above 50, the level that separates growth from contraction -- from 49.8 in January. And the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden reported that German retail sales rose 3.1 percent in January from December, when sales fell 2.1 percent.
Another bit of data this week also supports the view that the German economy will recover from a fourth-quarter slump. The European Commission's economic sentiment indicator for the euro zone rose to 91.1 in February from 89.5 in January, with German confidence leading the gain.
"German industry is clearly rebounding and taking advantage from better external traction," wrote Gilles Moëc, an economist at Deutsche Bank in London.
Employment is sometimes seen as a lagging indicator of economic growth because companies try to avoid adding to their costs until they are convinced that a rebound is at hand.
But despite the glimmers of hope in German industry, there are few reasons to regard a recovery as imminent. Markit's overall euro zone purchasing managers' index was unchanged in February at 47.9, indicating continued contraction.
Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, forecast on Feb. 22 that the euro zone economy would shrink 0.3 percent this year, about the same as last year. The bloc's debt problems, and the tax increases and government spending cuts that have been prescribed as the remedy, have sapped spending power, reducing business demand for labor.
In absolute terms, Eurostat estimated that 19 million people in the euro zone and more than 26 million in the European Union were unemployed in January.
Spain's unemployment rate was 26.2 percent, and Portugal's was 17.6 percent. Austria had the lowest rate, at 4.9 percent, followed by Germany and Luxembourg, at 5.3 percent each.
Greece's unemployment rate in November, the latest month for which Eurostat has figures for the country, was 27 percent.
France, which has the second-largest euro zone economy, after Germany's, had a 10.6 percent jobless rate in January. Britain, which is not a euro member, had a 7.7 percent rate in November.
That compares with unemployment rates of 7.9 percent in the United States in January and 4.2 percent in Japan in December.

Abstract: Economists expect government spending to continue to drag on the economy this year, especially if Congress does not avert the spending cuts, which would shave around 0.6 percentage point off growth.

Full text:   Breathe a tiny sigh of relief, if not exactly contentment: the American economy grew just barely in the last quarter of 2012.
Output expanded at an annual rate of 0.1 percent, which is basically indistinguishable from no growth at all and which is far below the growth needed to get unemployment back to normal. But at least the economy did not shrink, as the Commerce Department estimated in January, when the first report suggested that output had contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent.
The department's latest estimate for economic output, released on Thursday, showed that growth was depressed by declines in military spending (possibly in anticipation of the across-the-board spending cuts that are to begin on Friday) and in how much companies restocked shelves.
"The good news with business inventories is that what they take away in one quarter they tend to add to the next," said Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics, referring to the measure of this restocking process. "So there's a good chance that first-quarter numbers will be better than originally thought."
The growth in output was revised upward from the original estimate partly thanks to updated, and improved, data on business investment and net trade. Imports were lower than previously reported and exports were higher.
Economists expect government spending to continue to drag on the economy this year, especially if Congress does not avert the spending cuts, which would shave around 0.6 percentage point off growth. Many hope that even if the cuts go through, Congress will quickly reverse them.
"They can always change their minds when they have to renew the continuing budget resolution at the end of this month or in April or May," said Mr. Ashworth. "My expectation is that at most the cuts stay a month or two, and in most departments, with a wink or a nod, they won't do anything crazy."
Even if government does lop off $85 billion in the so-called sequester, as current law states, the private sector will offset most of this drag, thanks to the housing recovery and other sources of strength. Forecasts for the first quarter call for annual growth of 2.4 to 3 percent.
Monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve, while under fire from some Republicans, is also helping offset the fiscal contraction.
"With monetary policy working with a lag and still being eased, the boost to the economy is probably still growing," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
The combination of monetary expansion and fiscal tightening has helped lead to a painfully slow decline in the unemployment rate. The jobless rate stood at 7.9 percent in January. The recent end of the payroll tax holiday is also expected to hold back consumer spending and with it job growth.
The Labor Department reported on Thursday that first-time claims for unemployment benefits decreased by 22,000, to 344,000, last week. The less-volatile four-week moving average fell to 355,000 from 361,750.
"I think it's largely steady as she goes for employment," said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse, of the indications from the latest growth report. "I still think we're in kind of a 175,000-jobs-a-month clip for a while, but with some downside risks later in the year from the sequester."

Full text:   We're just a few weeks away from a milestone I suspect most of Washington would like to forget: the start of the Iraq war. What I remember from that time is the utter impenetrability of the elite prowar consensus. If you tried to point out that the Bush administration was obviously cooking up a bogus case for war, one that didn't bear even casual scrutiny; if you pointed out that the risks and likely costs of war were huge; well, you were dismissed as ignorant and irresponsible.
It didn't seem to matter what evidence critics of the rush to war presented: Anyone who opposed the war was, by definition, a foolish hippie. Remarkably, that judgment didn't change even after everything the war's critics predicted came true. Those who cheered on this disastrous venture continued to be regarded as "credible" on national security (why is John McCain still a fixture of the Sunday talk shows?), while those who opposed it remained suspect.
And, even more remarkably, a very similar story has played out over the past three years, this time about economic policy. Back then, all the important people decided that an unrelated war was an appropriate response to a terrorist attack; three years ago, they all decided that fiscal austerity was the appropriate response to an economic crisis caused by runaway bankers, with the supposedly imminent danger from budget deficits playing the role once played by Saddam's alleged weapons of mass destruction.
Now, as then, this consensus has seemed impenetrable to counterarguments, no matter how well grounded in evidence. And now, as then, leaders of the consensus continue to be regarded as credible even though they've been wrong about everything (why do people keep treating Alan Simpson as a wise man?), while critics of the consensus are regarded as foolish hippies even though all their predictions -- about interest rates, about inflation, about the dire effects of austerity -- have come true.
So here's my question: Will it make any difference that Ben Bernanke has now joined the ranks of the hippies?
Earlier this week, Mr. Bernanke delivered testimony that should have made everyone in Washington sit up and take notice. True, it wasn't really a break with what he has said in the past or, for that matter, with what other Federal Reserve officials have been saying, but the Fed chairman spoke more clearly and forcefully on fiscal policy than ever before -- and what he said, translated from Fedspeak into plain English, was that the Beltway obsession with deficits is a terrible mistake.
First of all, he pointed out that the budget picture just isn't very scary, even over the medium run: "The federal debt held by the public (including that held by the Federal Reserve) is projected to remain roughly 75 percent of G.D.P. through much of the current decade."
He then argued that given the state of the economy, we're currently spending too little, not too much: "A substantial portion of the recent progress in lowering the deficit has been concentrated in near-term budget changes, which, taken together, could create a significant headwind for the economic recovery."
Finally, he suggested that austerity in a depressed economy may well be self-defeating even in purely fiscal terms: "Besides having adverse effects on jobs and incomes, a slower recovery would lead to less actual deficit reduction in the short run for any given set of fiscal actions."
So the deficit is not a clear and present danger, spending cuts in a depressed economy are a terrible idea and premature austerity doesn't make sense even in budgetary terms. Regular readers may find these propositions familiar, since they're pretty much what I and other progressive economists have been saying all along. But we're irresponsible hippies. Is Ben Bernanke? (Well, he has a beard.)
The point is not that Mr. Bernanke is an unimpeachable source of wisdom; one hopes that the collapse of Alan Greenspan's reputation has put an end to the practice of deifying Fed chairmen. Mr. Bernanke is a fine economist, but no more so than, say, Columbia's Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and legendary economic theorist whose vocal criticism of our deficit obsession has nonetheless been ignored. No, the point is that Mr. Bernanke's apostasy may help undermine the argument from authority -- nobody who matters disagrees! -- that has made the elite obsession with deficits so hard to dislodge.
And an end to deficit obsession can't come a moment too soon. Right now Washington is focused on the idiocy of the sequester, but this is only the latest episode in an unprecedented run of declines in public employment and government purchases that have crippled our economy's recovery. A misguided elite consensus has led us into an economic quagmire, and it's time for us to get out.

As Negotiators Ease Demands on Iran, More Nuclear Talks Are Set

Abstract: [...]Iran must allow more regular and thorough access to monitoring from the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that it keeps its promises and cannot suddenly "break out" quickly to create a nuclear warhead, the official said.

Full text:   ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Two days of talks between six world powers and Iran over its nuclear program ended on Wednesday with specific agreement for further meetings in March and April over a proposal that would sharply constrain Iran's stockpile of the most dangerous enriched uranium, in return for a modest lifting of some sanctions.
But the six powers dropped their demand that Iran shut down its enrichment plant at Fordo, built deep underneath a mountain, instead insisting that Iran suspend enrichment work there and agree to take a series of steps that would make it hard to resume producing nuclear fuel quickly. The six also agreed, in another apparent softening, that Iran could keep a small amount of 20 percent enriched uranium -- which can be converted to bomb grade with modest additional processing -- for use in a reactor to produce medical isotopes.
It was unclear whether any of these new positions would pave the way for any kind of agreement. Iran's negotiators must now take the new proposal back to Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, at a time of intense maneuvering and infighting in Iran. The two sides agreed that technical experts would meet to discuss the proposal on March 18 and 19 in Istanbul, while the negotiations at this higher political level would resume, again in Almaty, on April 5 and 6.
The chief Iranian negotiator, Saeed Jalili, called this week's meeting positive, asserting at a news conference that the six powers, representing the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany, had offered a revised proposal that was "more realistic" and "closer to the Iranian position."
Mr. Jalili, whose comments were notably short of the aggressive wording he has used in the past, called the meeting "a turning point."
But senior Western diplomats were less enthusiastic, saying that Iran had not in fact responded to the proposal of the six and that real bargaining had not yet begun. A senior American official described the meeting as "useful" -- refusing to call it positive -- and emphasized that it was "concrete results" that counted, not atmospherics.
A senior European diplomat was even more skeptical, saying that the technical meeting was essentially to explain the proposal to the Iranians once again, and that Iran might very well come back in April with an unacceptable counterproposal that swallows the "carrots" of the six and demands more.
The senior American official said that as a first step toward building confidence and reducing the urgency around the issue, the six were demanding that Iran "significantly restrict" its accumulation of medium-enriched uranium, which could be turned to bomb-grade material in a matter of weeks or months. Iran has a growing stockpile of that fuel, but it has diverted a considerable amount to the Tehran research reactor, which the United States provided to Iran during the shah's rule to make medical isotopes.
Iran must also suspend enrichment at Fordo and accept conditions that "constrain the ability to quickly resume enrichment there," the official said, without being specific. In Washington, a senior administration official said those steps included dismantling part of the system that feeds low-enriched fuel into the plant's centrifuges; it would take weeks or months to rebuild that system, giving the Western allies time to respond.
Third, Iran must allow more regular and thorough access to monitoring from the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that it keeps its promises and cannot suddenly "break out" quickly to create a nuclear warhead, the official said.
In return, the official said, the six would suspend some sanctions. But the relief would not involve oil or financial transactions, which have done the most damage to Iran's main source of revenue. The group of nations said that if Iran took the deal, they would also promise not to vote for new sanctions through the Security Council or the European Union.
"What matters are concrete results on the most urgent issues, on 20 percent enrichment and on Fordo," the official said, "the most destabilizing and urgent elements of Iran's nuclear program."
The decision to drop the demand that Iran fully dismantle the plant was unexpected. But one official familiar with the strategy said the United States and its allies were "trying to come up with something face-saving for the Iranians" that would allow them to claim that they had resisted demands to shutter the plant even though production had ended.
One American official denied that there was any "softening of our position," citing further constraints on Iran, but conceded that Iran was being offered some more sanctions relief in response to its concerns and in an effort "to gain traction for these talks."
If the American position was an effort to show the toughness of the offer, Mr. Jalili was at pains to sound both conciliatory and triumphant.
With presidential elections scheduled for June in Iran and visible political infighting there, Mr. Jalili's news conference was a study in politics, Iranian style, with Mr. Jalili insisting that the six had moved toward Iran because of the "failure" of economic sanctions.
The willingness of Iran to agree so quickly to a new set of meetings and venues was also a marked change, indicating some sense of urgency and also of a political need to show Iranians that progress was being made to reduce the pain of sanctions. The sanctions have cut 8 percent from Iran's gross domestic product, produced high inflation and chopped the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, by half.
But Western officials said the tough sanctions put pressure on Iran's government to negotiate. "There is a cost to Iran and its people every day they don't solve this problem," one senior Western official said. "And that cost will go up."

Full text:   LEXINGTON, Mass.
THE significance of America's national debt is a serious question, but you would not know this from the current political rhetoric, which consists mostly of vague apocalyptic warnings. I want to present a calmer view, by emphasizing six facts about the debt that many Americans may not be aware of.
Roughly half of outstanding debt owed to the public, now $11.7 trillion, is owned by foreigners. This part of the debt is a direct burden on ourselves and future generations. Foreigners are entitled to receive interest and principal and can use those dollars to acquire goods and services produced here. If our government had used borrowed money to improve infrastructure or to improve the skills of workers, the resulting extra production would have made repayment easier. Instead, over the last decade, it used the money for wars and tax cuts.
The Treasury owes dollars, America's own currency (unlike Greece or Italy, whose debt is denominated in euros). So the Treasury can always make payments when due -- unless it is prevented from doing so by political blackmail over the statutory debt limit, which is now due to be reached in May. Notwithstanding the unprecedented credit-rating downgrade by Standard & Poor's in 2011, no foreign lenders realistically expect us to default. If they did, they would be insisting on higher interest rates, which they aren't. Of course, if we were stupid enough to default even once, the cost of borrowing would go much higher, for a long time.
One way to effectively repudiate our debt is to encourage inflation. When prices rise, interest and principal are repaid in dollars that are worth less than they were when they were borrowed. (This applies to Treasury's borrowing at home as well as abroad.) The Federal Reserve has promised to keep buying bonds and to maintain near-zero interest rates until unemployment eases, a strategy that some fear could lead to uncontrolled inflation, though there is no indication so far that that will happen.
Treasury bonds owned by Americans are different from debt owed to foreigners. Debt owed to American households, businesses and banks is not a direct burden on the future. Of course the payments of interest and principal are a burden on current and future taxpayers, but they will ultimately be received by American people and organizations, many of them taxpayers. Some of our grandchildren would be paying off others of our grandchildren; the result will be a net transfer from American taxpayers to American bondholders.
The real burden of domestically owned Treasury debt is that it soaks up savings that might go into useful private investment. Savers own Treasury bonds because they are seen as safe, default-free assets, and the government can borrow at lower rates than corporations can. If there were less debt, and fewer bonds for sale, savers seeking higher returns would invest in corporate bonds or stocks instead. Business investment would expand and be more profitable.
But in bad times like now, Treasury bonds are not squeezing finance for investment out of the market. On the contrary, debt-financed government spending adds to the demand for privately produced goods and services, and the bonds provide a home for the excess savings. When employment returns to normal, we can return to debt reduction.
In the long run we need a clear plan to reduce the ratio of publicly held debt to national income. But for now the best chance to reinvigorate the economy, spur business investment and encourage consumer spending is through public borrowing and spending. Instead, we're heading into an ill-advised, across-the-board austerity program.

Full text:   ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Talks between Iran and six world powers over its nuclear program will go into a second day here, with Western diplomats waiting to get a clear response from Tehran to an offer of step-by-step sanctions relief in return for confidence-building measures from Iran, Western diplomats said on Tuesday.
The six powers want Iran, as a first step, to stop enriching uranium to 20 percent and to export its stockpile of that more highly enriched uranium, which can be more quickly turned into bomb-grade material. The six also want Iran to shut down its Fordo enrichment facility, built deep into a mountain, which Iran has steadily refused to do. In return, the six -- the five permanent members of the Security Council, plus Germany -- have offered Iran further sanctions relief, reportedly including permission to resume its gold and precious metals trade as well as some international banking activity and petroleum trade.
The ultimate goal of talks with Iran is to get the country to comply with Security Council resolutions demanding that it stop enrichment altogether until it can satisfy the International Atomic Energy Agency that it has no weapons program and no hidden enrichment sites. In return, all sanctions -- which have so far cost Iran 8 percent of its gross domestic product, sharply increased inflation and collapsed the value of the Iranian currency, the rial -- would be lifted.
No one expects that kind of breakthrough in this round, especially with Iranian presidential elections coming in June and any major concession likely to be perceived as weakness. But the hope is for an incremental movement toward Iranian compliance in return for a modest lifting of sanctions.
On Tuesday night around 10 p.m., a senior Western official said, "We had a useful meeting today; discussions took place this evening; we are meeting again tomorrow." Another official said the Wednesday meeting would begin at 11 a.m.
Senior Western diplomats have said that this meeting would be a low-level success if it produced a specific agreement to meet again soon, or to meet more often at the technical level, so that there would be an element of momentum to the negotiations. The talks have been intermittent since beginning in October 2009, with the last meeting eight months ago in Moscow.
The six nations talking with Iran have remained united and share an impatience over what they perceive to be its delaying tactics. The Russian envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who has been most opposed to increasing sanctions, said that time was running out for the talks. He told the Interfax news agency that easing sanctions would be possible only if Iran could assure the world that its nuclear program was for exclusively peaceful purposes.
"There is no certainty that the Iranian nuclear program lacks a military dimension, although there is also no evidence that there is a military dimension," he said.
He said Moscow hoped the talks would now move into a phase of "bargaining," rather than just offering proposals. "There needs to be a political will to move into that phase," Mr. Ryabkov said. "We call on all participants not to lose any more time."
Tuesday's talks began at 1:30 p.m. with a plenary session that lasted about 2 hours, 30 minutes, largely taken up with the six laying out their latest modified proposal to the Iranians. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, is the chairwoman and speaks for the six. There was also discussion of the proposal by the Iranians and some questions asked, the diplomats said.
The rest of the afternoon and evening were taken up with waiting for an Iranian response, a senior European diplomat said. "Optimistic people are saying that there is modest progress, but realistic people like myself want to wait and see what the Iranians will come back with tomorrow, which can often be a surprise."
There were a few brief bilateral meetings with the Iranian delegation by the Russians, British and Germans, diplomats said, but not with the French or the Americans. The one and only bilateral meeting between the Americans and the Iranians in the course of the talks was in October 2009 in Geneva, although the chief American negotiator now, Wendy R. Sherman, the under secretary for political affairs in the State Department, has repeatedly said that she is open to another such meeting.
"The onus is very much on the Iranians," said Michael Mann, a spokesman for Ms. Ashton. He said at Wednesday's plenary, "We hope to get a more detailed response" from the Iranians to the offer of the six.

Abstract: Talks between Iran and six world powers over its nuclear program resume here on Tuesday after a break of eight months, but there is a general atmosphere of gloom about their prospects for success, even if narrowly defined. Since talks in Moscow last June, Iran has continued to increase its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 percent purity, has begun to install a new generation of centrifuges and has not yet completed an agreement on inspection of suspect military sites with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a deal originally advertised as all but done last May.

Full text:   ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Talks between Iran and six world powers over its nuclear program resume here on Tuesday after a break of eight months, but there is a general atmosphere of gloom about their prospects for success, even if narrowly defined.
Since talks in Moscow last June, Iran has continued to increase its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 percent purity, has begun to install a new generation of centrifuges and has not yet completed an agreement on inspection of suspect military sites with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a deal originally advertised as all but done last May.
With presidential elections in Iran scheduled for June, senior Western diplomats involved with these talks expressed skepticism that Tehran's chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, would be willing to make compromises that could be portrayed as weakness at home.
Mr. Jalili is the personal representative of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, considered the dominant voice on the nuclear issue. Ayatollah Khamenei has recently expressed continued mistrust of the United States and its intentions, saying that he would not allow the kind of bilateral talks between Washington and Tehran that most analysts think would be crucial to any resolution.
At the same time, Iran has taken some of its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium and converted it into reactor fuel, which cannot easily be turned back. The conversion means that Iran now has less of the uranium needed to make a bomb, reducing the sense of urgency among the six powers, and Israel, that its nuclear program needs to be slowed.
But the total Iranian stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium has nonetheless grown since November to 167 kilograms from 135 kilograms, according to the most recent I.A.E.A. report -- closer to, if still significantly below, the 240 kilograms or 250 kilograms many experts consider necessary, once enriched further, to produce a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies that its nuclear program has any military aim. The six world powers, the "P5-plus-1" group, which are the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- and Germany, want Iran to obey Security Council resolutions ordering it to suspend enrichment and open itself up fully to I.A.E.A. inspectors, to ensure that there is no effort to build a nuclear weapon.
To press Iran to comply, the Security Council, the United States and the European Union have created an increasingly painful set of economic sanctions on Iran, as part of a dual-track strategy -- negotiations and sanctions. Iran has insisted that as a precondition for serious negotiations, the world should lift all the sanctions and recognize Iran's "right to enrich," which Iran asserts it has as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
The negotiations have been tedious, with Iran appearing to be playing for time, diplomats say. The six powers had asked for a resumption of talks as early as December, but Iran rejected dates and sites before finally suggesting Almaty.
The choice pleased Western diplomats for its symbolic value, since Kazakhstan, when it became independent of the Soviet Union, freely relinquished the nuclear weapons it had inherited from Moscow. American officials are holding up Kazakhstan, one of the world's largest producers of uranium and a maker of nuclear fuel, as an example to Iran of the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy and compliance with the I.A.E.A.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan appealed to Tehran in a New York Times Op-Ed article in March 2012 to abandon what he suggested was its pursuit of nuclear power status. "Kazakhstan's experience shows that nations can reap huge benefits from turning their backs on nuclear weapons," he wrote.
While expectations are low, the six hope to leave here with some momentum and signs of Iranian willingness to engage in what all have agreed should be a reciprocal and step-by-step process of lifting sanctions in return for Iranian actions to comply.
"Iran needs to understand that there is an urgent need to make concrete and tangible progress" in these talks, said Michael Mann, the spokesman for Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief and chairwoman of the P5-plus-1 group.
Mr. Mann said that the six powers had together "prepared a good and updated offer for the talks which we believe is balanced and a fair basis for constructive talks" and "responsive to Iranian ideas."
He and other Western diplomats refused to detail the offer before it was presented to the Iranians, but one senior diplomat called the offer "substantial and serious" and said recent news reports that suggested only some loosening in sanctions regarding gold sales "do not reflect the full offer." The diplomat said the offer was "not a big bang deal, more an agreement on a package of confidence-building measures."
"Our main concern is the enrichment over 5 percent," which brings uranium closer to becoming bomb-grade, he said. "Iran has a great deal to gain by engaging," the diplomat said. "Once the international community has the assurances it needs, sanctions will start to be lifted."
Another Western diplomat said that the offer had been updated to account for the new enrichment Iran has done in the eight months since Moscow. There, the offer was described as "stop, shut, ship" -- demanding that Iran stop enrichment of uranium to 20 percent purity; shut the Fordo underground enrichment facility, which is heavily protected deep inside a mountain; and ship abroad its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium to be turned into nuclear fuel.
The six said in Moscow that they would reciprocate initially by lifting some sanctions, including on parts for American civilian aircraft that Iran has long sought, and provide fuel for an Iranian nuclear reactor.
The sanctions have hurt the Iranian economy, especially the sanctions on oil exports, which make up a large part of the economy. French officials say that Iran's annual economic output has fallen by 8 percent because of the sanctions, inflation is very high -- officially at 27.4 percent in 2012 but unofficially much higher -- and the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, has dropped by about half over the past year.
Though Iranian officials insist that their economy is resilient, a senior American official said, "They're beginning to feel the pressure of the sanctions."
As for Iran's presidential elections in June, the American official acknowledged that the vote "may constrain their political space," but said that the nuclear negotiations had their own pace, which the six would like to accelerate. "We all understand that when it comes to the nuclear file, the key decisions are in the hands of the supreme leader," the official said, referring to Ayatollah Khamenei. "And he is not going to change."

The Vet Debt Trap

Abstract: Titled "Assessing the Current and Future Workforce Needs in Veterinary Medicine" and conducted under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, the study found little evidence of vet shortages. Some vets and professors say the school, which is owned by DeVry Inc., a publicly traded educational company based in New Jersey, is a vivid example of all that has gone haywire for aspiring doctors of veterinary medicine, or D.V.M.'s, as they are known.\n

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDHAYLEY SCHAFER chose her dream job at the age of 5. Three years later, her grandmother told her that if she wrote it down, the dream would come true. So she found a piece of blue construction paper and scrawled on it with a pencil: "Veterianian." "No one told me how to spell it," she remembers. "They just said, 'Sound it out.' "
At the age of 30, she still has the sign, which is framed on her desk at the Caring Hearts Animal Clinic in Gilbert, Ariz., where she works as a vet. She also has $312,000 in student loans, courtesy of Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Or rather, $312,000 was what she owed the last time she could bring herself to log into the Sallie Mae account that tracks the ever-growing balance.
"It makes me sick, watching it increase," she says. "There's also the stress of how am I going to save for retirement when I have this bear to pay off."
They don't teach much at veterinary school about bears, particularly the figurative kind, although debt as large and scary as any grizzly shadows most vet school grads, usually for decades. Nor is there much in the curriculum about the prospects for graduates or the current state of the profession. Neither, say many professors and doctors, looks very promising. The problem is a boom in supply (that is, vets) and a decline in demand (namely, veterinary services). Class sizes have been rising at nearly every school, in some cases by as much as 20 percent in recent years. And the cost of vet school has far outpaced the rate of inflation. It has risen to a median of $63,000 a year for out-of-state tuition, fees and living expenses, according to the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, up 35 percent in the last decade.
This would seem less alarming if vets made more money. But starting salaries have sunk by about 13 percent during the same 10-year period, in inflation-adjusted terms, to $45,575 a year, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. America may be pet-crazed and filled with people eager to buy expensive fetch toys and heated cat beds. But the total population of pets is going down, along with the sums that owners are willing to spend on the health care of their animals, one of the lesser-known casualties of the recession.
Today, the ratio of debt to income for the average new vet is roughly double that of M.D.'s, according to Malcolm Getz, an economist at Vanderbilt University. To practitioners in the field, such numbers are ominous, and they portend lean times for new graduates.
"We're calling for more bodies coming through the veterinary educational pipeline at higher and higher cost at the very point in time that we need fewer and fewer," says Dr. Eden Myers, a vet in Mount Sterling, Ky., who runs the Web site JustVetData, where she crunches numbers about the profession. "And they are going to get paid less and less."
For years, the veterinary medical association contended that the United States needed more vets, not fewer, especially in rural areas. To support this view, in 2007, the organization helped underwrite a study, hoping to bolster a call for government assistance to help meet a putative shortfall of 15,000 vets by 2024.
The results, released last year, came to a strikingly different conclusion. Titled "Assessing the Current and Future Workforce Needs in Veterinary Medicine" and conducted under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, the study found little evidence of vet shortages. It also concluded that "the cost of veterinary education is at a crisis point."
The current president of the veterinary medical association, Dr. Douglas G. Aspros, isn't talking about unmet needs. Instead, he sounds like a man ready to rethink many of the premises his organization has long espoused.
"It's not a sustainable model," he says of vet school economics. "For the long-term success and health of the veterinary practice, we've got to look at every end of it."
That is a common sentiment among working vets, many of whom say the job market is the worst they have seen. But the deans of many vet schools see growth and opportunities, and one of them is Dr. Elaine Watson of Ross, the only profit-making vet school accredited by the veterinary medical association. Some vets and professors say the school, which is owned by DeVry Inc., a publicly traded educational company based in New Jersey, is a vivid example of all that has gone haywire for aspiring doctors of veterinary medicine, or D.V.M.'s, as they are known.
When you factor in cost of living and commuting costs, Ross is one of the more expensive places in the world to get a degree. And Ross mints D.V.M.'s at a remarkable clip. Last year, it graduated 287 of them -- triple the number of many American schools.
Dean Watson, not surprisingly, says focusing on the oversupply of vets is shortsighted. She says educators ought to think about how the field will look in 10 or 20 years. At any rate, she adds, students come to Ross with their eyes open. "They've made the decision that they desperately want to be vets," she says, "and they all realize that when they start taking on debt."
ROSS is on the southern coast of St. Kitts, an island that once did a robust trade in sugar cane but today earns much of its money through tourism. The campus is a five-minute drive from the harbor town of Basseterre, where a cruise ship is often anchored. The hodgepodge of lecture halls and small labs are scattered around a grand, triangular-shaped outdoor amphitheater in front of the student union, with an unobstructed view of the sea.
One afternoon in January, Dr. Kathleen Yvorchuk was teaching a course called Introduction to Physical Exam. That day's lesson was the correct way to check a horse for a sinus infection. The trick is to knock on the bone that runs above a horse's muzzle -- knock hard, like that bone is a door -- and then listen.
"If they have a mass in their sinuses, it will sound dense and it thuds," Dr. Yvorchuk told a handful of students. A horse named Chocolate stood by, awaiting knocks. "Please recognize, this is a large animal and you're not going to hurt it."
The students took turns knocking on the forehead of Chocolate, who seemed impervious, as well as sinus-infection-free.
Students spend seven semesters at Ross, one after another, without summer breaks. This allows them to get through the program in less time, but to critics, Ross is a bit like a factory that is constantly building up production. This same criticism has also, in a milder form, been leveled at many of the 28 vet schools in the United States.
There are roughly 91,000 working vets in the country, about one-tenth the number of M.D.'s. But this relatively small universe is expanding rapidly. State budget cuts have led many domestic schools to make up lost revenue by adding students, in some cases by 10 percent in one year. Four more vet schools, both public and private, are either in the planning phases or under construction, one in New York, two in Arizona and one in Tennessee. If all are ultimately built, there will be thousands of additional D.V.M.'s on the market in coming years.
At the same time, the veterinary medical association's Council on Education has picked up the pace of its accreditation of foreign schools, like Ross on St. Kitts, giving its imprimatur to 10 of them since 2000. The goal, says Dr. Aspros, the association's president, is to make the United States the global standard setter for veterinary medicine. He defends this practice by noting that you don't need a diploma from a school accredited by the association to practice in the United States; graduates from unaccredited schools simply have to jump through a few additional hoops. But the association's seal of approval means students can qualify for certain federal loans. Because tuition at foreign schools is not subsidized by any states, graduates from places like Ross tend to wind up with larger-than-average debts.
And the level of debt for American graduates, says Dr. Alan M. Kelly, former dean of the veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania, who led the study on work force needs, is already too high. "The general guideline is that your debt should never be twice your starting salary," Dr. Kelly says. "The debt of graduates today, on average, is three times their starting salary. Well, this is a cataclysm."
For Dr. Schafer, the burden of her student loan has dictated some crucial decisions, including where to live. After she graduated from Ross in 2011, she wanted to head home to San Diego, but she realized the city was too expensive, given her debts. She has a sister who lives in Scottsdale, so she settled on Arizona.
It took an intensive, monthlong search to find a job. Her technique was to walk unannounced into a clinic -- she eventually visited a couple of dozen -- and introduce herself to anyone who seemed to work there. She got lots of sympathetic smiles and heard many variations of "We're not hiring." She finally found Caring Hearts through a help-wanted ad, and beat out 30 other applicants.
The job pays well -- $60,000, which is higher than the average starting salary for vets in this country. Her days now start at 7 a.m. and are booked until 7:30 p.m. with new-puppy exams, emergency surgeries and anything else that rolls in the door.
"There is no typical day," she says. "I love the job."
Her childhood mission to become a veterinarian was no whim. Soon after she made that sign, she started collecting animals on the 11-acre plot in the town outside San Diego where she grew up. Not just dogs, cats and a horse, but also chickens, fish and iguanas.
"My parents didn't know how to say no," she says, laughing. "When I was 12, we went to buy some equipment for my horse, and I told the guy selling it that I was going to be a veterinarian. So he told my dad, 'You should buy her this pregnant goat.' Which he did."
Today, her debt exceeds her salary by a factor of five -- much higher than the recommended twice-starting-salary ratio. She signed up for income-based repayment, a government program available to federal student loan recipients. (A newer program with slightly more generous terms, called Pay As You Earn, or PAYE, is available to more recent graduates.) Both income-based repayment and PAYE allow graduates to lead relatively normal lives by paying back a modest percentage of their income based on a formula. After a fixed amount of time, from 10 to 25 years, the balance of the debt is discharged.
That's the good news. The bad news is that the interest on the debt keeps growing and taxes must be paid on the amount discharged, as if it is income. Dr. Schafer sends $400 a month to Sallie Mae, a sum that will rise. But what kind of tax bill awaits her? Asked to run the numbers, GL Advisor, a financial services company that specializes in student loans, calculated that Dr. Schafer's debt is likely to exceed $650,000 when her tax bill lands 25 years after the start of the loan, which means she will owe the Internal Revenue Service roughly $200,000. That will happen while she is still deep in her career, perhaps around the time she wants to send some children to college.
"What I've done isn't a bright move," she says. "But I can afford to eat. I bought a car. Nothing fancy, but functional."
Dr. Schafer wound up with this huge debt because Ross was the only school to give her a come-hither after American schools refused her. She was twice turned down by the University of California, Davis, where she was an undergraduate, in large part, she says, because she received Bs as a freshman and sophomore. "There were 120 openings and more than 1,000 applicants," she says. "It's competitive."
Getting admitted to Davis would have cut her tuition bills more than 50 percent. But she never balked at Ross's offer. Though Ross is rarely anyone's first choice, even detractors say its educational standards are high and its graduates are impressive. But the commuting costs, the foreign setting and the faint stigma that attends education at profit-making institutions have made it a school of last resort.
If getting in is easy, staying in is surprisingly hard. About 20 percent of Ross's first semester students won't make it to graduation, say administrators, an exceptionally high rate of attrition. (At American schools, it's typically closer to 2 percent.) About half of those students are bounced for poor academic performance. Dean Watson says most students flunk out early on, in the first and second semester. But some fail much later. In 2006, Diana Reyes was ejected in her sixth semester, leaving St. Kitts with $160,000 in debt and no degree.
"It was one of the saddest moments of my life," she says of the day she learned the news. She took a break, then borrowed more money to earn a technical degree from Purdue University. Today she earns $18 an hour as a technician in a veterinary clinic in Lafayette, Ind.
"My father is paying half of my loans," she says. "I can't afford them myself."
THE poor job market for new veterinarians is not the much-publicized fiasco that it is for new lawyers. But it's getting worse. For decades, new D.V.M.'s were snapped up by clinics and hospitals in the months before they graduated. In 2012, a mere 45 percent of graduating vets reported that they had accepted a permanent job offer -- as opposed to a time-limited and lower-paying internship, or a residency -- down from 84 percent in 1999. Last year, 39 percent of graduates had no job offers, up from 19 percent in 1999.
But after graduation, little data is collected about employment and salaries. Nobody knows the number of unemployed and underemployed vets. Vet-market optimists have long argued that many parts of the country are underserved. And if you look at a map of where vets set up practices, you will see large areas of the country with little or no coverage.
To address this problem, many states and the Department of Agriculture have offered loan-forgiveness programs, hoping to lure new graduates to places where vets are needed. Success stories are rare. Even with government assistance, it is hard to make it financially as a vet in areas that are both sparsely populated and poor.
Alisha Oehling, a 2009 graduate of Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, gave it a shot when she moved to Clarksville, Va. To qualify for loan forgiveness, she would have to spend 80 percent of her time treating cows and oxen. "I took all the bovine work I could get, but it was just 25 percent of my practice," she says. "There was no way to get to 80 percent."
But even if she qualified for loan forgiveness, she says, it wouldn't have made much difference. During the winter, her phone often didn't ring for days at a time. During the spring, she once worked 42 days in a row. The feast-or-famine pace was trying enough, but even worse was that many of her clients, though devoted to their animals, often couldn't afford needed care.
"The average household income is about $26,000 a year," she says. "If you have a backyard pony, you probably can't afford to spend $1,000 on it."
So recently she moved. She beat out hundreds of vets who applied for a job at a clinic in Northern Virginia, where she will work mostly on high-priced horses, and where a vet can charge more, even for vaccines.
It's slowly dawning on leaders in the field that vet schools can't simply increase the number of graduates and expect them to move to underserved areas, hanging shingles where there currently are none.
The last refuge for rosy forecasters is the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report. It states that "overall job opportunities for veterinarians are expected to be good." As Ross's public relations office points out, the report's data suggests that the country will need 22,000 new vets by 2020, far more than will be produced under the current system.
But many people believe that the bureau's report, which was written in 2009, is badly in need of an update. One of them is Henry Kasper, the economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who helped draft the report. There are others.
"We've gotten several calls from disgruntled vets who say, 'What is wrong with you guys? Are you completely blind? There is no demand for vet services,' " says Mr. Kasper. "This is pretty high on our list to really home in on the effects of the recession and see if there are long-term trends that have changed." Mr. Kasper said the full impact of the economic downturn had not yet hit when the bureau published its report. Also, the bureau looks at long-term trends, rather than short-term business cycles. Research at the time suggested, as Mr. Kasper put it, that "people will always spend money on pets because they view them as part of the family."
That belief has been tested. Not only are there fewer dogs -- from 2006 to 2011, the number of dogs in the country dropped for the first time, albeit slightly, to 70 million from 72 million, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association Sourcebook survey -- but the amount owners paid to vets fell, too. Owners reported they spent about $20 less a year in inflation-adjusted terms in that five-year span.
The declines are more significant when it comes to cats. About 36.1 million households owned at least one cat in 2011, down 6 percent from 2006. During that period, the number of cat visits to the vet declined 13.5 percent. In the business, this is known as "the cat problem."
The horse market has suffered the most. Pet horses are expensive, and the market for them since the start of the recession has been crushed. Thoroughbred racing, meanwhile, has been hurt by the expansion of casinos, reducing the number of horses in need of veterinary care.
"The estimates are that the horse population is down about 30 percent since 2008," says Dr. Stuart E. Brown of Hagyard Equine Medical Institute in Lexington, Ky. "Traditionally we have hired five to seven new grads to our internship program. Lately, it's one or two."
There is no simple solution to the problem of sinking salaries and rising debt, nor to the market saturation of vets, Dr. Aspros says. Tuition is expected to keep going up, class sizes are expected to grow and if new vet schools are built to the proper specifications, they will get the veterinary medical association's seal of approval.
An added wrinkle to the debate is gender. The number of women in vet schools has been rising for decades; today they account for 80 percent of graduates, flipping the gender mix on its head as compared to 30 years ago. As with most professions, there is a pay gap between men and women, and in the veterinary field it has widened since the downturn. Last year, starting salaries for women were 16 percent lower than for men, according to figures compiled by Dr. Myers of JustVetData, compared to a 3 percent difference in 2002. Everyone is losing ground, she says, but women are losing ground much faster than men.
"Still, when you go to meetings, almost every person in charge is an old white guy in a suit," she says. "They want to find solutions as badly as anyone else, but we're like ships passing in the night."
DISCUSSIONS about these and other vexing issues are conspicuously absent in most vet schools, say academics. Dr. James Wilson, a veterinarian, lawyer and professor who has taught at more than a dozen vet schools over the years, says he is consistently amazed at how little students know about their financial future.
Many schools do not seem eager to enlighten them. That includes Ross, where Dr. Wilson lectured for seven years, until early 2010. He was asked not to return, he says, soon after he persuaded the school to let him teach a personal finance class as part of the first-semester curriculum. (A Ross representative wrote in an e-mail that the school would not discuss personnel matters, but that "Dr. Wilson's relationship with R.U.S.V.M. did not end for the reasons he's articulated to The New York Times.")
The class, he said, had left many students with an existential case of sticker shock. "By the end of each of these sessions," Dr. Wilson says, "I witnessed much fear and considerable depression. More than once, I saw tears."
"I have said it over and over to myself and friends, 'This is as close to predatory lending as anything I've ever seen,' " Dr. Wilson continues. "The only reason it's not a high-profile crime in 2013 is because income-based repayment and pay as you earn have postponed the reality and pain for 20 to 30 years."
What Dr. Wilson learned long ago is that it is hard to talk anyone out of vet school. Many students, like Dr. Schafer, set their hearts on the job at an early age. If you are doing what you have always wanted, and you find it fulfilling, the numbers don't seem relevant. At least initially.
"It comes down to this," Dr. Schafer says. "Is there anything else I'd be happy doing? No. Is there any way around paying off the loans? No. So, what the heck? A lot of it is just trying to put it out of your mind and maybe it'll disappear."
She realizes that this is crazy. The bear that is her tuition bill has an appointment in about 23 years, and that is the one beast she doesn't know how to treat.
Correction: March 3, 2013, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the financial challenges facing the veterinary profession referred incorrectly to the federal tax treatment of forgiven debt for veterinary students. It is treated as income, not as a gift. The article also referred incorrectly to conditions under which foreign veterinary schools can have their students qualify for United States federal loans. Although a school's accreditation by the Council on Education of the American Veterinary Medical Association is needed for some loans, it is not required for all types. The article also misstated the name of the town where Alisha Oehling, a 2009 graduate of Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, once practiced. It is Clarksville, Va., not Sparksville.A chart with the article, showing trends in the profession, reversed the labels in a line graph. The bottom line was for the number of pet dogs and cats in the United States, and the top line for the number of visits to veterinarians. And another line graph in the chart mislabeled veterinary pay figures. The graph showed the average starting pay for veterinarians, not average overall pay in the profession. A corrected chart can be found at nytimes.com/businessday.

Full text:   Last year, owners of about 16.2 million cars and trucks received letters saying their vehicles had safety problems and were being recalled. But millions more were left in recall limbo because some of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's investigations into possible safety problems have been taking years longer than the agency's self-imposed goal.
Consequently, some owners may be unknowingly driving vehicles with problems, said Joan Claybrook, the onetime agency administrator and former head of Public Citizen, a consumer protection group.
Some consumer advocates say the agency needs more investigators.
But that's not true, said David Strickland, the agency's current administrator. "Clearly we are able to succeed in executing our mission and doing it very well with the staff on hand and the expertise that we have on hand," he said in a telephone interview.
Among the consumers Ms. Claybrook worries about are 1.5 million owners of 2002-5 Ford Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers and about 1.7 million owners of 1999-2003 General Motors full-size pickups and sport utility vehicles.
The Ford Explorer-Mountaineer investigation went on for 42 months, and the G.M. truck inquiry continues after 25 months. The agency's self-imposed goal is to complete such investigations, called engineering analyses, in 12 months.
Often manufacturers learn of a safety problem on their own and, as required by law, inform the agency of their plans for a recall. Other times, owners complain to the agency, prompting an investigation.
Those inquiries are the responsibility of a few more than two dozen agency investigators, a number that hasn't changed much over more than a decade. In 2001, the agency had 26. But despite the growing complexity of vehicles, there are currently 28, the agency says.
That is less than one investigator for each automaker, truck maker or parts supplier, according to Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety. "The enforcement arm of the agency is on a starvation diet," he said.
One of the agency's continuing problems has been finding money to hire enough investigators, said Michael Brownlee, who was associate administrator for enforcement when he retired in 1997.
"It was always a fight for dollars," Mr. Brownlee said. "I mean, that is the bureaucratic nightmare every year." But the current administrator, Mr. Strickland, says there are enough investigators in part because new tools for data analysis allow them to work more efficiently. Mr. Strickland noted that agency investigations resulted in 134 vehicle recalls in 2012, the second-highest number since the government began counting recalls in 1966.
That resulted in about nine million vehicles being recalled.
"Clearly we are able to succeed in doing our mission," he said.
But the number of recalls is an imperfect measure of productivity because the agency is using an accounting method under which one inquiry can generate dozens of recalls.
For example, investigations resulted in 131 recalls in 2011. But 61 of those resulted from one investigation involving Webasto aftermarket sunroofs that might loosen and fly off the vehicle. Any car dealership or business that installed one of the sunroofs was listed as a separate recall. In 2012 -- the year cited by Mr. Strickland -- there were 19 sunroof recalls.
An investigation into a brake actuator used on trailers resulted in 34 recalls in 2012.
Mr. Ditlow, of the Center for Auto Safety, said: "The historic rule at N.H.T.S.A. is one investigation, one recall. Anything else is recall inflation."
In the current budget, Congress gave N.H.T.S.A. about $800 million, which allows for about 600 employees. About $10.6 million of that goes to the Office of Defect Investigations, and about $554 million goes to states for their highway safety programs.
Over the years, appropriations for such state traffic safety programs have increased, but money for defect investigations hasn't kept up, said Jacqueline S. Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. a group financed by insurance companies. There should be more money for investigations, she added.
Concerns about how defect investigations are carried out is an old issue. For about three decades the Government Accountability Office has sporadically scolded the agency, saying it needs to improve the recall process and reduce the length of investigations. Agency officials have responded that they have been addressing concerns and improving.
An October 2011 report by the Transportation Department's inspector general noted that not all investigations were completed in a timely manner. The report said a review of 20 engineering analyses found 40 percent missed the deadline by an average of six months. The worst case was 17 months.
But the agency has been far tardier.
In August 2009, it opened an investigation over complaints from 200 owners of 2002-5 Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer S.U.V.'s who said the vehicles moved even if the automatic transmission was in Park. The complaints included 85 "alleged crashes and 32 alleged injuries."
The inquiry continued for 42 months, two and a half years beyond the agency's 12-month goal. It was officially concluded -- without a recall -- shortly after a reporter asked an agency official about it. The closing report said there "were very few incidents occurring in recent years."
Another continuing engineering analysis involves about 1.7 million 1999-2003 full-size pickups, including the popular Chevrolet Silverado, and S.U.V.'s including the Suburban.
The concern is that brake lines are so susceptible to rust they may burst, making the vehicles harder to stop.
That investigation was prompted by Robert Slamer of Middletown, Ohio. Early in 2010, he asked for an investigation after a brake line burst on his 2003 Silverado 2500 heavy-duty pickup -- with about 51,000 miles on the odometer -- while his wife, Martha, was hauling a load of hay. Mr. Slamer says it took a long time to stop even through the vehicle was traveling slowly.
The agency granted Mr. Slamer's request in January 2011 and opened an engineering analysis. In researching the issue, the agency found 519 complaints, including 13 crashes and two injuries. That investigation is not complete.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Slamer said he was worried that someone would be injured or killed and that he was amazed the investigation was still going on after two years.
Mr. Strickland said that every investigation was different, that some were far more complicated than others, that accuracy was crucial and that the 12-month goal was self-imposed.
"The most important thing is for us to get it right," he said.
A review of agency records shows that six of the 15 engineering analyses begun in 2011 are still under way.
During such long investigations some consumers are left waiting. One of those is Julie Miller of Hopewell Junction, N.Y., who owns a 2004 Ford Freestar.
Last April, the agency opened an engineering analysis into reports that corrosion in the minivan's rear wheel wells was so severe that the third row of seats might not be solidly anchored.
Ms. Miller says she is afraid to use the Freestar to carry her family of five and doesn't know what to do about getting it fixed.
She says a welder told her he could fix the back seat for $800. A body shop that works with a Ford dealership gave her an estimate of $11,000, apparently to replace the wheel wells.
She worries that if she opts for the $800 repair and Ford agrees to a recall, the automaker may tell her that the fix was not done in the recommended manner and will refuse to reimburse her.
"I honestly don't know what we are going to do," she said.

Abstract: "The stock market is the same place it was in 2000 with double the earnings," said Todd M. Morgan, senior managing director at Bel Air Investment Advisors. Michael Sonnenfeldt, the founder of Tiger 21, an investment club whose members each have at least $10 million to invest, said the feeling from the group's annual conference was that the 14,000 level on the Dow was worrisome because it could be the result of all the money the Federal Reserve has put into the system and not based on company fundamentals.

Full text:   THERE are always reasons not to buy stocks. Investors may think the Dow Jones industrial average is too high, as was the case in 1954 when the index topped 360. In 1941, there was Pearl Harbor. In 1962, the Cuban missile crisis. In 1997, the Asian financial crisis.
The list, adding up to 78 for each of the years from 1934 to 2012, was compiled by Bel Air Investment Advisors.
But the punch line to this list was that stocks went up by an annual compounded rate of 10.59 percent over those 78 years, with occasional plateaus, and that $1 million invested in 1934 was worth $2.4 billion in 2012.
As for the last three years, the list singled out the European financial crisis in 2010, the downgrade of United States' credit rating in 2011 and the political polarization of 2012. Investors were, in fact, generally reluctant to buy stocks. Yet in each of those years, stocks either rose in value or, at worst, were flat.
The reason for such hesitancy is obvious. Investors are still scarred from the 2008 crash and they perceive stocks as risky, a feeling reinforced by a good bit of volatility in the markets in recent years. Yet as stocks rallied earlier this year, money from individual investors began to trickle back into equity funds. This could be good for an intrepid few.
"The stock market is the same place it was in 2000 with double the earnings," said Todd M. Morgan, senior managing director at Bel Air Investment Advisors. "Stocks are set to outperform bonds over the next three to five years."
This may very well be true, but most people still think fearfully about stocks. What would it take to get more people to buy stocks? And by this, I don't mean going all in as investors did in the late 1990s, but creating some semblance of a balanced portfolio.
Mr. Morgan and other advisers said that investors are being misled by talk about near-record levels for the Dow Jones and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index today. When adjusted for inflation, the levels approached earlier this year are not true highs. A new high for the Dow, for example, would be around 15,600.
What is more telling are the earnings and dividends of companies. Niall J. Gannon, executive director of wealth management at the Gannon Group at Morgan Stanley, calculated that the dividends on S.& P. 500 stocks were $15.97 in 2000 and $31.25 in 2012. Earnings per share were $56 in 2000 and $101 in 2012. In other words, two major measures of a stock's attractiveness have doubled in the last 12 years, but the index has not kept pace.
"A big mirage is going on in investors' minds," Mr. Gannon said. "They think stocks are expensive because they've used index levels as the measure."
And investors aren't confident that stocks will continue to rise, given the volatility in recent years. They may well fall in the short term, but over the next few years they are more likely to give investors a better return than bonds. Mr. Gannon pointed to an earnings yield on the S.& P. 500 of around 7 percent.
But these are rational arguments for individual companies. They do not account for concerns that the actions of the Federal Reserve have skewed stock prices, another rational fear.
Michael Sonnenfeldt, the founder of Tiger 21, an investment club whose members each have at least $10 million to invest, said the feeling from the group's annual conference was that the 14,000 level on the Dow was worrisome because it could be the result of all the money the Federal Reserve has put into the system and not based on company fundamentals.
The group, he said, was also worried that the Federal Reserve, having kept interest rates artificially low for so long, could have created a situation where investors suddenly demand higher interest rates at a government bond auction. A crisis like that could lead to deflation, and not inflation -- where stocks are considered a hedge.
What's telling is that Tiger 21 members reported increasing their allocation to equities by 3 percentage points in the last six months. "It's not a stampede," he said. "The focus has been on dividend-paying stocks, not growth stocks or tech stocks."
For people with far less than $10 million to invest, the catalyst to buy stocks will probably be losing money in the bonds they own. "Over the last three years, you've lost out not being in stocks," said Bernie Williams, vice president of discretionary money management at USAA Investments. "But you still made money in bonds. From that perspective, investors are not really feeling the pain."
There is an alternative view, of course, that says the unwillingness of people to invest in stocks now is completely normal and that what happened in the 1990s with stocks and in the 2000s with real estate were anomalies, at least for average investors.
"The alternative to investing or saving is spending today and that is always infinitely more pleasurable," said Don Phillips, president of investment research at Morningstar. "Throughout the '80s and '90s, you had this amazing bull market and it gave you this immediate gratification that usually only spending gives you. Now we've been through a more realistic period, and people realize that is not always the case. The reward is deferred, and there may be severe losses."
Mr. Phillips noted that if people were able to pick a winning stock 55 or 60 percent of the time, they would be remarkably successful. But in spending money on something they want today, their success rate is automatically 100 percent.
"I think for a mature American adult, investing should be an expectation," Mr. Phillips said. "So much of the discussion around the recent tax increases is that investing is something only the 1 percent does. That fuels this mind-set that makes investing seem unrealistic for most people."
Greg B. Davies, head of behavioral finance at Barclays Wealth and Investment Management, said people could persuade themselves to increase their allocation to equities by joining investment clubs where the group, in theory, would be better at making a decision that was painful. People could also slowly buy the stocks they want, a process called dollar-cost averaging.
"The classical economics position on all of this is that it is irrational and you should ignore it," Mr. Davies said. "That's not very helpful advice. We do have an emotional response."
He said he would instead encourage average investors to forget about maximizing their risk-adjusted returns and aim for their "best anxiety-adjusted returns."
For those with more fortitude, the simplest solution is to take the long view -- as in 10 or 20 years, which is a lot of delayed gratification.
"Whenever you're having a discussion like this, time horizon is a key consideration," said Bill Stromberg, head of global equities at T. Rowe Price. "Most investors have been conditioned to think the next six to 12 months out. It's too hard for anyone to predict what's going to happen then."
And while no one I spoke with expected stocks to return to double-digit returns year after year, a simple argument could be made for a return based on a dividend of 2 percent and earnings growth of 5 to 6 percent.
"That's not a home run for anyone, but it's better than you get in bonds," Mr. Stromberg said.
It is entirely possible that stocks will lose value across the board this year or the stocks you pick will fall significantly. But that is why every adviser stresses diversification and a long view. What matters is how a portfolio's returns look in a decade or two, not tomorrow.

Full text:   CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
THE average price of gasoline in the United States, $3.78 on Thursday, has been steadily climbing for more than a month and is approaching the three previous post-recession peaks, in May 2011 and in April and September of last year.
But if our goal is to get Americans to drive less and use more fuel-efficient vehicles, and to reduce air pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases, gas prices need to be even higher. The current federal gasoline tax, 18.4 cents a gallon, has been essentially stable since 1993; in inflation-adjusted terms, it's fallen by 40 percent since then.
Politicians of both parties understandably fear that raising the gas tax would enrage voters. It certainly wouldn't make lives easier for struggling families. But the gasoline tax is a tool of energy and transportation policy, not social policy, like the minimum wage.
Instead of penalizing gasoline use, however, the Obama administration chose a familiar and politically easier path: raising fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. The White House said last year that the gas savings would be comparable to lowering the price of gasoline by $1 a gallon by 2025. But it will have no effect on the 230 million passenger vehicles now on the road.
Greater efficiency packs less of a psychological punch because consumers pay more only when they buy a new car. In contrast, motorists are reminded regularly of the price at the pump. But the new fuel-efficiency standards are far less efficient than raising gasoline prices.
In a paper published online this week in the journal Energy Economics, I and other scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimate that the new standards will cost the economy on the whole -- for the same reduction in gas use -- at least six times more than a federal gas tax of roughly 45 cents per dollar of gasoline. That is because a gas tax provides immediate, direct incentives for drivers to reduce gasoline use, while the efficiency standards must squeeze the reduction out of new vehicles only. The new standards also encourage more driving, not less.
Other industrialized democracies have accepted much higher gas taxes as a price for roads and bridges and now depend on the revenue. In fact, Germany's gas tax is 18 times higher than the United States' (and seven times more if the average state gas tax is included). The federal gasoline tax contributed about $25 billion in revenues in 2009.
Raising the tax has generally succeeded only when it was sold as a way to lower the deficit or improve infrastructure or both. A 1-cent federal gasoline tax was created in 1932, during the Depression. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan raised the tax to 9 cents from 4 cents, calling it a "user fee" to finance transportation improvements. The tax rose again, to 14.1 cents in 1990, and to 18.4 cents in 1993, as part of deficit-reduction deals under President George Bush and President Bill Clinton.
A higher gas tax would help fix crumbling highways while also generating money that could help offset the impact on low- and middle-income families. Increasing the tax, as part of a bipartisan budget deal, with a clear explanation to the public of its role in lowering oil imports and improving our air and highways, could be among the most important energy decisions we make.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- There are widening divisions among officials of the Federal Reserve over the value of its efforts to reduce unemployment, but the authors of its bond-buying policy remain firmly in control, according to an official account of the January meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee.
An increasingly outspoken minority of Fed officials are concerned that monthly purchases of about $85 billion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities are doing more harm than good. They argue the effort may need to end even before the nation's unemployment rate drops, because it is encouraging excessive risk-taking and could make it harder to control inflation.
But the Federal Open Market Committee reiterated its determination in January to hold course until there was "substantial improvement" in the outlook for job growth, and several officials cautioned at the meeting that the greater risk to the economy was in stopping too soon, according to the account, which was published after a standard three-week delay.
Those officials "noted examples of past instances in which policy makers had prematurely removed accommodation, with adverse effects on economic growth, employment and price stability," it said. "They also stressed the importance of communicating the committee's commitment to maintaining a highly accommodative stance of policy as long as warranted by economic conditions."
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, said investors should not be misled by the amount of space in the Fed's account concerned about its current policies, because the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and his supporters, continue to regard the asset purchases as a necessary and effective strategy to foster job growth.
"We view Mr. Bernanke as being firmly in charge of the committee, and very dovish indeed," Mr. Shepherdson wrote in a note to clients. He said he expected the Fed's asset purchases to continue at the current pace for the rest of the year.
While officials pushing for an earlier end to asset purchases do not have nearly enough votes on the 12-member committee to force a change in policy, they could reduce the impact of the Fed's efforts by convincing investors that purchases are even slightly more likely to end sooner.
Historically, it is often true that outspoken opposition has produced a moderation in Fed policy, because the committee prefers to operate by consensus. But Mr. Bernanke in recent years has demonstrated that he can and will maintain majority support in the face of persistent dissent.
His hand is strengthened by the fact that some Fed officials want to do still more to stimulate the economy. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has said that the Fed should hold short-term interest rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 percent. The Fed has said that it intends to hold rates near zero at least until unemployment falls below 6.5 percent. The rate in January was 7.9 percent.
The Fed could also be fortified in its current policies if Congress continues to cut spending. Another round of across-the-board cuts is scheduled to take effect March 1. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cuts would reduce growth by 0.6 percentage points this year, and employment by about 750,000 jobs.
There is little internal support for increasing the pace of securities purchases, but the account says that some officials raised the possibility of maintaining a portion of the Fed's investment portfolio for a longer period as the economy recovers.
The theory, which also underpins the Fed's plan to suppress interest rates for several more years, is that the Fed cannot do much more now, but it can compensate by maintaining its efforts for longer than it otherwise would. Holding onto the assets longer would maintain downward pressure on interest rates.
The account said the committee planned a review of the asset purchase policy at its next scheduled meeting on March 19 and 20.
The meeting account shows Fed officials generally expected a slow improvement in economic conditions this year, and were not overly concerned that the economy had not expanded, or expanded only modestly, in the final months of 2012. But they do not expect the economy to expand fast enough to significantly reduce unemployment.
The account also indicated that "a number" of officials are concerned that the economy is suffering permanent damage, partly because people unemployed for long periods are losing their skills, which could impede growth for years to come.
The Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said in a speech this month that inflation remained low and steady, while unemployment remained stubbornly high. As a result, she said, "it is entirely appropriate for progress in attaining maximum employment to take center stage in determining the committee's policy stance."
But some Fed officials have expressed growing unease that, even if inflation remained under control, asset purchases might disrupt financial markets. One concern is that low interest rates will encourage excessive risk-taking, inflating new asset bubbles that will inevitably pop. The Fed's purchases also may disrupt the normal operations of financial markets by constraining the supply of safe assets.
A Fed governor, Jeremy C. Stein, said this month that he saw "a fairly significant pattern of reaching-for-yield behavior emerging in corporate credit," referring to a rise in the sale of new junk bonds, or high-risk corporate debt.
Mr. Stein said he did not see any reason for an immediate change in Fed policy, but Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, cited similar concerns in opposing the current policy at the January meeting.

Full text:   Stanford last year became the first university to raise more than $1 billion in a single year, according to the Council for Aid to Education's annual college fund-raising survey.
Partly because of large donations from entrepreneurial alumni who have made their fortunes in Silicon Valley, Stanford has been the top fund-raiser for eight straight years.
Last year, the university, near Palo Alto, said its five-year capital campaign, which ended in December 2011, had taken in a record-setting $6.23 billion, far exceeding its original goal of $4.3 billion, and surpassing by more than $2 billion any other single higher-education campaign.
"Stanford has been doing a remarkable job," said Ann E. Kaplan, the director of the council's report. "By any standard, it's been amazing. They have some very big ideas, and they're good at capturing people's imagination, thinking about what they can do and what they could be."
The report, released Wednesday, found that colleges and universities in the United States raised $31 billion last year, or 2.3 percent more than in 2011, slightly ahead of the inflation rate. That is still slightly less than the $31.6 billion record, set in 2008, before the financial crisis cut deeply into charitable giving.
"What happens in higher-ed fund-raising does tend to mirror what goes on in the economy as a whole," Ms. Kaplan said. "We haven't come out of this recession as fast as some previous ones. The will to make the gifts is there; now we just need the value of the underlying assets, of individuals and foundations, to come back."
After Stanford, the fund-raising sums drop: Harvard raised $650 million; Yale, $544 million; the University of Southern California, $492 million; and Columbia, $490 million.
Together, the top 10 universities raised $5.3 billion of the $31 billion total.
Among public universities, the University of California, Berkeley, was the leading fund-raiser, bringing in $405 million.
The $1.035 billion in gifts to Stanford last year comes to about $56,000 for each of its 18,500 students.
According to the council's report, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, a specialized health institution, raised the largest amount per enrolled student, $590,719.
Of the 20 institutions that raised the most per student, five are medical schools and five are schools of theology. Deep Springs College, a private two-year college in California, is fourth on the list, which also includes two private liberal arts colleges, Hillsdale College in Michigan and Amherst College in Massachusetts. The remaining six institutions are private research universities: Stanford, Yale, California Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton and Harvard.
The report found that in the 2012 fiscal year, contributions for current operations increased 6.2 percent, while gifts for capital purposes, like endowments and buildings, declined 3.2 percent.
After Stanford's fund-raising success, other institutions have upped their ante: Columbia, which announced a $4 billion campaign in 2006, has collected more than that, and raised its goal to $5 billion by December 2013. The University of Southern California has started a seven-year, $6 billion capital campaign.
It is a truism of fund-raising, Ms. Kaplan said, that a rising tide lifts all boats.

Full text:   The New York State teachers' union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday challenging the constitutionality of the state's cap on annual increases in local property taxes, one of the signature measures of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's time in office.
The lawsuit by the union, New York State United Teachers, asserts that the tax cap interferes with local control of schools, and that a requirement that 60 percent of voters support any override of the limit dilutes the voting power of those who favor exceeding the cap.
The tax cap, which Mr. Cuomo persuaded the Legislature to approve in 2011, limits annual increases in local property taxes to 2 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. A vast majority of school districts -- 642 of 678, or about 95 percent -- stayed within the tax cap last year, according to the governor's office.
(The cap does not affect New York City.)
The teachers' union, which filed its lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Albany, has been mulling a legal challenge ever since it failed to persuade lawmakers to reject Mr. Cuomo's proposal.
"Today we fund education at more than a billion dollars less than we did in 2008," the union's president, Richard C. Iannuzzi, said in a phone interview. "When you take that context and you layer it with the property tax cap, we're violating, in our minds, two very fundamental principles of democracy, which is 'one person, one vote,' and equal opportunity."
The teachers' union has sparred with Mr. Cuomo over education financing ever since he took office more than two years ago. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, reduced money for education in his first budget, and he frequently derides the state's education bureaucracy; the union, for its part, worries that the tax cap will prompt school boards to lay off teachers and curtail programs.
The union argues that the cap has a disproportionately onerous effect on school districts in low-income areas, since the amount those districts can raise by increasing their tax levy under the cap is far less than what wealthy districts with a larger tax base can raise. As such, the lawsuit argues, the tax cap violates the guarantee of equal protection under the law.
Mr. Cuomo, speaking to reporters in Albany, said that high property taxes were forcing people to leave their homes, and that when it came to improving the state's schools, "the answer can't always be putting your hand in the pocket of the taxpayer of the State of New York."
"People have a right to go to court," Mr. Cuomo added. "God bless America. God bless our system. I think the property-tax cap has been one of the best things that we've done for the State of New York."

Abstract: Across industries and geographic areas, many other jobs that didn't used to require a diploma -- positions like dental hygienists, cargo agents, clerks and claims adjusters -- are increasingly requiring one, according to Burning Glass, a company that analyzes job ads from more than 20,000 online sources, including major job boards and small- to midsize-employer sites.

Full text:   ATLANTA --The college degree is becoming the new high school diploma: the new minimum requirement, albeit an expensive one, for getting even the lowest-level job.
Consider the 45-person law firm of Busch, Slipakoff & Schuh here in Atlanta, a place that has seen tremendous growth in the college-educated population. Like other employers across the country, the firm hires only people with a bachelor's degree, even for jobs that do not require college-level skills.
This prerequisite applies to everyone, including the receptionist, paralegals, administrative assistants and file clerks. Even the office "runner" -- the in-house courier who, for $10 an hour, ferries documents back and forth between the courthouse and the office -- went to a four-year school.
"College graduates are just more career-oriented," said Adam Slipakoff, the firm's managing partner. "Going to college means they are making a real commitment to their futures. They're not just looking for a paycheck."
Economists have referred to this phenomenon as "degree inflation," and it has been steadily infiltrating America's job market. Across industries and geographic areas, many other jobs that didn't used to require a diploma -- positions like dental hygienists, cargo agents, clerks and claims adjusters -- are increasingly requiring one, according to Burning Glass, a company that analyzes job ads from more than 20,000 online sources, including major job boards and small- to midsize-employer sites.
This up-credentialing is pushing the less educated even further down the food chain, and it helps explain why the unemployment rate for workers with no more than a high school diploma is more than twice that for workers with a bachelor's degree: 8.1 percent versus 3.7 percent.
Some jobs, like those in supply chain management and logistics, have become more technical, and so require more advanced skills today than they did in the past. But more broadly, because so many people are going to college now, those who do not graduate are often assumed to be unambitious or less capable.
Plus, it's a buyer's market for employers.
"When you get 800 résumés for every job ad, you need to weed them out somehow," said Suzanne Manzagol, executive recruiter at Cardinal Recruiting Group, which does headhunting for administrative positions at Busch, Slipakoff & Schuh and other firms in the Atlanta area.
Of all the metropolitan areas in the United States, Atlanta has had one of the largest inflows of college graduates in the last five years, according to an analysis of census data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. In 2012, 39 percent of job postings for secretaries and administrative assistants in the Atlanta metro area requested a bachelor's degree, up from 28 percent in 2007, according to Burning Glass.
"When I started recruiting in '06, you didn't need a college degree, but there weren't that many candidates," Ms. Manzagol said.
Even if they are not exactly applying the knowledge they gained in their political science, finance and fashion marketing classes, the young graduates employed by Busch, Slipakoff & Schuh say they are grateful for even the rotest of rote office work they have been given.
"It sure beats washing cars," said Landon Crider, 24, the firm's soft-spoken runner.
He would know: he spent several years, while at Georgia State and in the months after graduation, scrubbing sedans at Enterprise Rent-a-Car. Before joining the law firm, he was turned down for a promotion to rental agent at Enterprise -- a position that also required a bachelor's degree -- because the company said he didn't have enough sales experience.
His college-educated colleagues had similarly limited opportunities, working at Ruby Tuesday or behind a retail counter while waiting for a better job to open up.
"I am over $100,000 in student loan debt right now," said Megan Parker, who earns $37,000 as the firm's receptionist. She graduated from the Art Institute of Atlanta in 2011 with a degree in fashion and retail management, and spent months waiting on "bridezillas" at a couture boutique, among other stores, while churning out office-job applications.
"I will probably never see the end of that bill, but I'm not really thinking about it right now," she said. "You know, this is a really great place to work."
The risk with hiring college graduates for jobs they are supremely overqualified for is, of course, that they will leave as soon as they find something better, particularly as the economy improves.
Mr. Slipakoff said his firm had little turnover, though, largely because of its rapid expansion. The company has grown to more than 30 lawyers from five in 2008, plus a support staff of about 15, and promotions have abounded.
"They expect you to grow, and they want you to grow," said Ashley Atkinson, who graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2009 with a general studies degree. "You're not stuck here under some glass ceiling."
Within a year of being hired as a file clerk, around Halloween 2011, Ms. Atkinson was promoted twice to positions in marketing and office management. Mr. Crider, the runner, was given additional work last month, helping with copying and billing claims. He said he was taking the opportunity to learn more about the legal industry, since he plans to apply to law school next year.
The firm's greatest success story is Laura Burnett, who in less than a year went from being a file clerk to being the firm's paralegal for the litigation group. The partners were so impressed with her filing wizardry that they figured she could handle it.
"They gave me a raise, too," said Ms. Burnett, a 2011 graduate of the University of West Georgia.
The typical paralegal position, which has traditionally offered a path to a well-paying job for less educated workers, requires no more than an associate degree, according to the Labor Department's occupational handbook, but the job is still a step up from filing. Of the three daughters in her family, Ms. Burnett reckons that she has the best job. One sister, a fellow West Georgia graduate, is processing insurance claims; another, who dropped out of college, is one of the many degree-less young people who still cannot find work.
Besides the promotional pipelines it creates, setting a floor of college attainment also creates more office camaraderie, said Mr. Slipakoff, who handles most of the firm's hiring and is especially partial to his fellow University of Florida graduates. There is a lot of trash-talking of each other's college football teams, for example. And this year the office's Christmas tree ornaments were a colorful menagerie of college mascots -- Gators, Blue Devils, Yellow Jackets, Wolves, Eagles, Tigers, Panthers -- in which just about every staffer's school was represented.
"You know, if we had someone here with just a G.E.D. or something, I can see how they might feel slighted by the social atmosphere here," he says. "There really is something sort of cohesive or binding about the fact that all of us went to college."

Full text:   Never mind about North Korea; the talk in some quarters is that the biggest threat to Asia and the rest of the world today may very well be a "currency war," in which countries race to devalue their currencies in a desperate attempt to stimulate growth.
Yet the reality is much different. It is really a debate about how industrialized countries will grow out of their economic malaise, and even the term "currency war" is being misused.
That catchy phrase was first uttered by Guido Mantega, the Brazilian minister for finance, in 2010. What he was referring to was actually something more complicated than countries racing to depreciate their currencies, which is what most people refer to today when they use the phrase.
Instead, Mr. Mantega was really talking about the United States. The huge quantitative easing undertaken by the Federal Reserve has created an environment of low interest rates and put downward pressure on the dollar while pushing the currencies of other countries up.
As they say in physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and the Fed's actions have pushed hot money into countries, mostly emerging markets like Brazil, with higher interest rates. This creates bubblelike asset prices and spurs inflation.
Normally, the response of Brazil or another such country would be to ease its monetary policy and possibly also lower interest rates in an effort to tamp down demand for its currency. The problem is that Brazil has stubbornly high inflation at 6 percent and can't respond the way the United States could.
And that is what is really going on with the world's currencies. Bigger, more mature countries are responding to their own economic downturns by adopting easy money policies. But the problem is that the emerging market economies can't respond with similar effectiveness because of their own economic or political issues.
Nonetheless, the currency war talk has been revived because of an alarming fall in the value of the Japanese yen, which is down more than 20 percent against the dollar since November. The decline has reaped billions of dollars for hedge funds betting against the currency. It's nice for these already rich traders, but there will also be yen losers, with potentially bigger consequences.
The slide in the yen is a product of an effort by Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to revive the no-growth, no-inflation Japanese economy that has been mired in stagnation for more than two decades.
Mr. Abe is not only openly advocating an inflationary policy with a 2 percent target, and more stimulus, he is talking down the yen. And this week, Japan is expected to appoint a new head of the Bank of Japan. Whoever that may be is expected to be on board with Mr. Abe's plan for further stimulus and inflation, a course that is likely to result in further yen depreciation.
As a result, Japanese exports have suddenly become significantly cheaper. And when an exporting powerhouse like Japan devalues its currency that quickly, other nations suddenly find that their goods are much less competitive on the global marketplace.
And once again, the issue is not that every country will depreciate, but how emerging market economies respond. These countries could respond in the easiest manner by letting their currencies appreciate. Many economists would say this is the ideal. Both the United States and Japan would benefit by having a cheaper currency and more growth, while developing nations would benefit by having a stronger currency and ability to buy more goods for consumption.
For many emerging market countries, this is hard to do politically, because it will mean that in the short term, their goods will be less competitive and their manufacturing bases will decline, meaning lost jobs.
Instead, these countries are more likely to try to deal with the yen's depreciation by doing the exact opposite. They will try to halt the appreciation of their currency. Obviously, economic policy is complicated and economists love to disagree, so the responses of each country may vary, but there are three common policy ways to lower a currency rate: do a round of quantitative easing to expand the balance sheet of the central bank; lower interest rates; or impose capital controls.
The various possible responses show that the currency war is really about genuine policy disagreements between economies over how to address the easy money policies of the bigger industrialized countries, in light of the fact that many emerging market companies cannot respond with the same policies. The European Union has chosen another path by declining to adopt a stimulus approach.
This explains why the world's financial officials and central bankers have not taken much of a stand.
After Lael Brainard, an under secretary for the Treasury, decried the "loose talk about currencies" and said that the United States supported "efforts to reinvigorate growth and to end deflation in Japan," financial ministers of the Group of 20 nations released a communiqué.
It stated that their policy was not "to target our exchange rates for competitive purposes" and that "excess volatility of financial flows and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability."
This followed a slightly different statement from the Group of 7 nations saying that the countries "have been and will remain oriented toward meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that we will not target exchange rates."
Bland prose like this is typical of these gatherings, yet the Group of 7 appeared to endorse Japan's efforts. But if you look at the statement from the Group of 20, which includes Brazil and South Korea, it was less favorable, saying merely that there would not be a competitive devaluation. And no surprise, these are the countries most effected by the actions of the United States and Japan.
Ultimately, though, talk of a true currency war, where countries competitively devalue their exchange rates in a zero sum game that recalls the old Matthew Broderick film "War Games," is overstated. Remember that in "War Games," just by playing, you lose.
The reason is that even for those countries that can devalue, too much is at stake in this game. Instead, we are more likely to get what Goldman Sachs in a recently released research report called a "global exchange rate mechanism, but in a new noncooperative variant."
Countries will act within bands based on their options and status, but no one country will take the same tack at the same time because of their different economic positions In other words, a country can't merely turn on a switch and start a currency war of the sort people are talking about. Some don't want to, others cannot and the rest are constrained in how they can act.
And while disruptions may happen from time to time, equilibrium is more likely to set in as each country responds slowly. So the currency game will play out in slow motion as each country adopts its preferred approach.
This is a game that has been going on for years. Instead of a currency war, what we are seeing is the everyday problems of a global economy where countries are highly connected and quite distinct.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDTOKYO -- Since taking office less than two months ago, Japan's outspokenly hawkish new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has been in what some political analysts are calling "safe driving mode." He has carefully avoided saying or doing anything to provoke other Asian nations, while focusing instead on wooing voters with steps to revive the moribund domestic economy.
So far, his approach seems to be working. His plans for public-works projects, stimulus measures called "Abenomics," have sent the Tokyo stock market surging along with Mr. Abe's own approval rating, which is now at 71 percent, according to the latest poll by Yomiuri Shimbun. On Friday, he will seek to build on his strong start when he meets President Obama at a Washington summit meeting aimed at improving relations with the United States, which regards Japan as its most important ally in Asia.
Mr. Abe, 58, has said he wants to be what Japan has not seen in almost a decade: a steady-handed leader who lasts long enough in office to actually get things done. Analysts say his success hinges on whether he can lead his Liberal Democratic Party to victory in upper house elections in July, and end the split Parliament that undermined many of his predecessors.
What is less clear is what he will do if he wins that election. One trait that makes Mr. Abe a bit of an enigma, some analysts say, is that he seems to have two sides: the realist and the right-wing ideologue. In analysts' view, if he does jettison some of his current caution, for instance by trying to revise Japan's antiwar Constitution to allow a full-fledged military instead of its current Self-Defense Force, he risks provoking a standoff with China over disputed islands, and possibly isolating Japan in a region still sensitive to its early-20th-century militarism.
"In his first six weeks, he has done everything he can to show he is a moderate," said Andrew L. Oros, director of international studies at Washington College in Chestertown, Md. "But after July, he might feel he has a freer rein to do things that he thinks are justified."
Part of the problem, Mr. Oros and others say, is that Mr. Abe faces conflicting political pressures. His base in the governing party's most conservative wing expects bold steps to end what it sees as Japan's overly prolonged displays of contrition for World War II. But he must also convince the broader public that he is a coolheaded, competent steward of a declining nation that also depends on China for its economic future.
There is also the ghost of his past failure. The last time he was prime minister, six years ago, he stepped down amid criticism that he had been "clueless" for having pursued a nationalistic agenda of revising the Constitution and history textbooks, and for not doing more to reduce unemployment and spur the economy.
This time, Mr. Abe is acting with the determined carefulness of a man given a second chance. He has focused on extricating Japan from its recession with steps that have quickly buoyed the country's economy, the world's third-largest. Since being named prime minister after his party's election victory in December, Mr. Abe has promised $215 billion in public works spending to create jobs and promote growth.
He has also publicly pressured the central bank, the Bank of Japan, to move more aggressively to end years of corrosive price declines known as deflation -- threatening, for example, to amend the law on the bank's independence if it does not reach its target of 2 percent inflation. The bank's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, announced this month that he would step aside to allow Mr. Abe to appoint a new chief who will work more closely with the government by pumping more money into the economy to prompt banks to lend more and companies to spend more.
"Mr. Abe has clearly learned the lessons of his past failure," said Norihiko Narita, a political scientist at Surugadai University, near Tokyo. "And the biggest lesson is that voters care more about the economy."
Abenomics has already affected the yen, helping to drive down its value by 20 percent in just four months. This has strengthened Japan's struggling export industries by making their products cheaper abroad, but also led to warnings of a trade war in which other nations push down the values of their currencies.
However, the biggest criticism of Abenomics is that it will provide only a short-lived adrenaline shot for growth, while producing little more than superfluous bridges and roads, and adding to Japan's already stifling national debt. Economists say Mr. Abe's policies so far contain few of the deeper-reaching structural reforms that they say are needed to produce sustainable growth by encouraging competition in Japan's sclerotic economy.
They say the most symbolic step would be joining a Pacific-wide free trade pact that would force Japan to open sheltered domestic markets, like farm products. Mr. Abe appears to personally favor entering the pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the United States champions as a way of binding the economically vibrant region together. Japanese and American officials say Mr. Abe may even privately promise Mr. Obama that Japan will soon join the pact. But he cannot afford to say so in public for fear of alienating the farmers who have been strong supporters of the Liberal Democrats -- at least not until the July elections.
Similarly, fears of angering voters on Okinawa will also probably prevent Mr. Abe from offering progress on another issue that has long caused problems with the United States, the relocation of the unpopular American air base at Futenma. This has led some analysts to wonder what Mr. Abe's visit to Washington will actually be able to produce.
Plans for the summit meeting seemed to get off to a rocky start last month when the administration declined a Japanese request for a visit in January, saying the American side was not ready. This was reported as a snub in Japan's tabloid press. Perhaps to make amends, the Americans have increased the time that Mr. Abe will spend with Mr. Obama, adding a luncheon at the White House to the schedule.
For Mr. Abe, strengthening ties with the United States is crucial as Japan faces a growing challenge from China for control of the disputed islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Analysts say Mr. Abe will probably tell Mr. Obama that he wants Japan to act as a fuller military partner with the United States, at a time when the Pentagon faces steep budget cuts. But it is unclear if more radical steps, like rewriting the Constitution, would sit well with the majority of Japanese voters who wish Mr. Abe to remain moderate.
"Mr. Abe is to the right of the mainstream," said Koji Nakakita, a politics professor at Tokyo's Hitotsubashi University, "and that carries a huge potential risk for him."
Correction: February 21, 2013, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of editing errors, an article on Tuesday about efforts by Japan's outspokenly hawkish prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to appear more moderate in his first six weeks in office referred incorrectly to a request for a meeting in January that the Obama administration declined, and misspelled part of the name of the Japanese newspaper whose latest poll gave Mr. Abe an approval rating of 71 percent. Mr. Abe was proposing to travel to the United States; the Japanese did not ask President Obama to visit. And the newspaper is Yomiuri Shimbun (not Shimbum).

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- The president of the European Central Bank sought on Monday to ease fears that countries including Japan were deliberately weakening their currencies.
The comments by the president, Mario Draghi, appeared to show how some of the world's most senior economic policy makers were continuing to limit the possibility of a so-called currency war.
Over the weekend, finance ministers from the Group of 20 pledged to refrain from devaluing their currencies to gain a competitive advantage in global trade.
During an afternoon of scheduled testimony before the European Parliament's economic and finance committee in Brussels, Mr. Draghi said that the euro's current exchange rate was close to its long-term average. He advised officials not to make alarmist comments.
"Most of the exchange rate movements that we have seen were not explicitly targeted; they were the result of domestic macroeconomic policies meant to boost the economy," Mr. Draghi told the committee, without mentioning any countries by name. "In this sense, I find really excessive any language referring to currency wars."
But Mr. Draghi also seemed to suggest that central banks could succumb to mutual suspicion about whether exchange rates were being deliberately weakened.
"The less we talk about this, the better it is," he said.
Underscoring the point, Mr. Draghi said he had "urged all parties" to exercise "very, very strong verbal discipline" at the meeting of the G-20 finance ministers in Moscow over the weekend.
A loose monetary policy intended to spur growth often has the effect of devaluing a currency, making a country's exports more affordable and its competitors' exports more expensive. For example, a strong euro means that exports like cars and wines become more expensive abroad. That puts European producers at a disadvantage in competing with foreign producers on world markets.
Yet a strong euro also brings some advantages for Europe. Certain imports -- like energy, in the form of oil and natural gas -- become more affordable.
The euro hit a record of 127.18 yen on Feb. 2, up from 114.48 yen at the start of the year. It stood at just 94.31 yen in July 2012. The euro traded at 125.46 yen on Monday, up slightly, and was flat against the dollar, at $1.335.
Since the rapid strengthening of the euro against the yen and other major currencies, there has been a concerted push by industrialized nations to convey the message that they will let the markets determine the value of their currencies.
Last week, the Group of 7 sought to quell fears of a developing currency war.
Over the weekend, the G-20 finance ministers issued a statement saying that a loose monetary policy, including steps to weaken currencies, were acceptable if used as a means to stimulate domestic growth.
But they also warned that such policies should not be used to benefit a country's position in global trade.
Guntram B. Wolff, the deputy director of Bruegel, a research organization, said that he believed Japan's central bank policy makers were carrying out an expansionary monetary policy in an appropriate way -- as a means to spur economic growth, not as a way to aid Japanese exporters.
Instead, Mr. Wolff said, Mr. Draghi might be concerned about the Federal Reserve, where policy makers are considering continuing their expansionist monetary policy until the unemployment rate falls significantly, and about the Bank of England, which may end up pursuing similar policies as it revises the way it sets goals for economic growth.
"The bigger question is what central banks in the developed world are doing -- I'm thinking here about the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve -- and whether we have a danger of competitive devaluation," Mr. Wolff said.
"While we claim that all of this is done for domestic purposes, the internal and external goal can become the same, and then you have the risk that this turns toxic."
Over the last few years, emerging-market countries like Brazil have openly accused slow-growing advanced countries like the United States of unfairly pushing down the value of their currencies with their aggressive monetary policies. And, for years, the United States has accused export-reliant emerging economies, in particular China, of manipulating their currencies, too.
More recently, in Japan, stimulus programs backed by the newly elected prime minister, Shinzo Abe, have kept interest rates near zero and flooded the economy with money, which has reduced the cost of Japanese products around the world.
In Europe, while confidence has grown that the European Union will be able to manage its sovereign debt crisis, the euro has made significant gains against the dollar and other currencies. That is making European exports more expensive, a factor that could hamper growth.
The gains have prompted François Hollande, the president of France -- which has traditionally taken a more interventionist stance in economic matters -- to call for a European exchange-rate policy.
Mr. Draghi did allow that the relative strength of the euro "is important for growth and price stability" and that "to the downside," an "appreciation of the euro is a risk." He said the European bank would assess whether the exchange rate was having an effect on inflation.
But for now, Mr. Hollande has little influence on the issue. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, gave the French request short shrift this month, and a senior German official has denounced the French initiative as a poor substitute for policy overhauls.
"Can you have a managed exchange rate in Europe?" asked Karel Lannoo, the chief executive of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research organization in Brussels.
"Probably not, when you consider how hard it would be to agree on a rate and the means to maintain it. "

Full text:   WASHINGTON
TODAY'S Republicans are very good at tending the fire of Ronald Reagan's memory but not nearly as good at learning from his successes. They slavishly adhere to the economic program that Reagan developed to meet the challenges of the late 1970s and early 1980s, ignoring the fact that he largely overcame those challenges, and now we have new ones. It's because Republicans have not moved on from that time that Senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, in their responses to the State of the Union address last week, offered so few new ideas.
When Reagan cut rates for everyone, the top tax rate was 70 percent and the income tax was the biggest tax most people paid. Now neither of those things is true: For most of the last decade the top rate has been 35 percent, and the payroll tax is larger than the income tax for most people. Yet Republicans have treated the income tax as the same impediment to economic growth and middle-class millstone that it was in Reagan's day. House Republicans have repeatedly voted to bring the top rate down still further, to 25 percent.
A Republican Party attentive to today's problems rather than yesterday's would work to lighten the burden of the payroll tax, not just the income tax. An expanded child tax credit that offset the burden of both taxes would be the kind of broad-based middle-class tax relief that Reagan delivered. Republicans should make room for this idea in their budgets, even if it means giving up on the idea of a 25 percent top tax rate.
When Reagan took office, he could have confidence in John F. Kennedy's conviction that a rising tide would lift all boats. In more recent years, though, economic growth hasn't always raised wages for most people. The rising cost of health insurance has eaten up raises. Controlling the cost of health care has to be a bigger part of the Republican agenda now that it's a bigger portion of the economy. An important first step would be to change the existing tax break for health insurance so that people would be able to pocket the savings if they chose cheaper plans.
Conservative views of monetary policy are also stuck in the late 1970s. From 1979 to 1981, inflation hit double digits three years in a row. Tighter money was the answer. To judge from the rhetoric of most Republican politicians, you would think we were again suffering from galloping inflation. The average annual inflation rate over the last five years has been just 2 percent. You would have to go back a long time to find the last period of similarly low inflation. Today nominal spending -- the total amount of dollars circulating in the economy both for consumption and investment -- has fallen well below its path before the financial crisis and the recession. That's the reverse of the pattern of the late 1970s.
Trying to boost economic growth through looser money is usually a mistake, as Reaganites rightly argued. They were right, too, to think that the Federal Reserve should make its actions predictable by adhering to a rule rather than improvising depending on its assessment of current conditions. The best way to put those impulses into practice is to require the Fed to stabilize the growth of nominal spending. That rule would allow looser money only when nominal spending is depressed. Keeping nominal spending on track is more or less what the Fed did from 1984 through 2007, a period that Republicans sometimes call the Reagan boom (since they see Bill Clinton as having largely kept his policies) and that economists generally call the Great Moderation. Relatively stable nominal spending growth promoted relatively stable economic growth, and it can again.
The Republican economic program of the 1980s also fought against government-imposed restrictions on economic activity: decontrolling energy prices, for example. Today we should target different restrictions. Software patents have become a source of unproductive litigation that entrenches large tech companies and inhibits creativity. Republicans shouldn't support those patents. Economic growth has to trump corporate executives' campaign donations.
Conservatives should retain their skepticism about government intervention, the preference for letting markets direct economic resources and the zeal for ending government-created barriers to economic growth that they inherited from Reagan. In his first Inaugural Address, Reagan famously said that "government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." The less famous yet crucial beginning of that sentence was "in our present crisis." The question is whether conservatism revives by attending to today's conditions, or becomes something withered and dead.

Full text:   President Obama was right about the need to increase the federal minimum wage, but it was too bad that he pulled his punches in calling on Congress to lift the wage only to $9 an hour by the end of 2015, from $7.25 an hour, where it has been since 2009.
His proposal would boost the annual pay of an employee working full time at the minimum wage from $14,500 now to $18,000, which is still very low. Several economic measures -- including purchasing power, average wages and productivity gains -- indicate that the minimum wage should be at least $10 an hour today, not $9 an hour three years from now. In 2008, Mr. Obama campaigned on raising the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour.
Politically, the lowball proposal is understandable. Congressional Republicans are bound to oppose any increase. Representative John Boehner, the House speaker, lashed out against the proposal the day after the president's State of the Union address, a stance that will very likely further alienate important constituencies from the Republican Party, including women, who represent more than half of the estimated 18 million people currently working at or near the minimum wage, and Hispanics, who represent one-fourth.
Combined with tax credits for the working poor, Mr. Obama's proposal could lift a minimum wage worker who is currently below the poverty line ($18,498 for a family of three in 2012) out of poverty. But the minimum wage is more than an antipoverty program. In fact, most workers at or near the minimum wage live in households with moderate family incomes above poverty levels but below the national median of roughly $60,000. For them, and for the broader economy, an adequate minimum wage can help ensure fair pay and stimulate the economy by putting more money in consumers' wallets.
Opponents of an increase in the minimum wage argue that it will harm small businesses, but that fear is exaggerated. Research shows that the extra cost is offset by lower labor turnover, small price increases or other adjustments. In addition, many low-wage workers at small businesses are tipped workers whose employers have been shielded for decades from minimum wage increases, and thus have room for an increase.
Over all, the argument that a higher wage will kill jobs has been debunked by a range of studies showing that a higher minimum wage boosts pay without measurably reducing employment, while improving productivity. One study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago found that a $1 increase in the minimum wage results, on average, in $2,800 in new spending by affected households in the following year, in large part because the increase helps workers accumulate down payments to buy cars. Owning a car, in turn, helps workers to keep their jobs.
On Wednesday, Congressional Democrats said they would introduce bills to gradually raise the wage to $10.10 an hour. Both Mr. Obama and Democratic lawmakers have also called for annual inflation adjustments, an important change that would be made better by adjusting the minimum wage to keep it in line with increases in average wages, rather than with consumer prices. A higher minimum wage would be good for workers and for the economy. The challenge is to get it through Congress.

Full text:   President Obama laid out a number of good ideas in his State of the Union address. Unfortunately, almost all of them would require spending money -- and given Republican control of the House of Representatives, it's hard to imagine that happening.
One major proposal, however, wouldn't involve budget outlays: the president's call for a rise in the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $9, with subsequent increases in line with inflation. The question we need to ask is: Would this be good policy? And the answer, perhaps surprisingly, is a clear yes.
Why "surprisingly"? Well, Economics 101 tells us to be very cautious about attempts to legislate market outcomes. Every textbook -- mine included -- lays out the unintended consequences that flow from policies like rent controls or agricultural price supports. And even most liberal economists would, I suspect, agree that setting a minimum wage of, say, $20 an hour would create a lot of problems.
But that's not what's on the table. And there are strong reasons to believe that the kind of minimum wage increase the president is proposing would have overwhelmingly positive effects.
First of all, the current level of the minimum wage is very low by any reasonable standard. For about four decades, increases in the minimum wage have consistently fallen behind inflation, so that in real terms the minimum wage is substantially lower than it was in the 1960s. Meanwhile, worker productivity has doubled. Isn't it time for a raise?
Now, you might argue that even if the current minimum wage seems low, raising it would cost jobs. But there's evidence on that question -- lots and lots of evidence, because the minimum wage is one of the most studied issues in all of economics. U.S. experience, it turns out, offers many "natural experiments" here, in which one state raises its minimum wage while others do not. And while there are dissenters, as there always are, the great preponderance of the evidence from these natural experiments points to little if any negative effect of minimum wage increases on employment.
Why is this true? That's a subject of continuing research, but one theme in all the explanations is that workers aren't bushels of wheat or even Manhattan apartments; they're human beings, and the human relationships involved in hiring and firing are inevitably more complex than markets for mere commodities. And one byproduct of this human complexity seems to be that modest increases in wages for the least-paid don't necessarily reduce the number of jobs.
What this means, in turn, is that the main effect of a rise in minimum wages is a rise in the incomes of hard-working but low-paid Americans -- which is, of course, what we're trying to accomplish.
Finally, it's important to understand how the minimum wage interacts with other policies aimed at helping lower-paid workers, in particular the earned-income tax credit, which helps low-income families who help themselves. The tax credit -- which has traditionally had bipartisan support, although that may be ending -- is also good policy. But it has a well-known defect: Some of its benefits end up flowing not to workers but to employers, in the form of lower wages. And guess what? An increase in the minimum wage helps correct this defect. It turns out that the tax credit and the minimum wage aren't competing policies, they're complementary policies that work best in tandem.
So Mr. Obama's wage proposal is good economics. It's also good politics: a wage increase is supported by an overwhelming majority of voters, including a strong majority of self-identified Republican women (but not men). Yet G.O.P. leaders in Congress are opposed to any rise. Why? They say that they're concerned about the people who might lose their jobs, never mind the evidence that this won't actually happen. But this isn't credible.
For today's Republican leaders clearly feel disdain for low-wage workers. Bear in mind that such workers, even if they work full time, by and large don't pay income taxes (although they pay plenty in payroll and sales taxes), while they may receive benefits like Medicaid and food stamps. And you know what this makes them, in the eyes of the G.O.P.: "takers," members of the contemptible 47 percent who, as Mitt Romney said to nods of approval, won't take responsibility for their own lives.
Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, offered a perfect illustration of this disdain last Labor Day: He chose to commemorate a holiday dedicated to workers by sending out a message that said nothing at all about workers, but praised the efforts of business owners instead.
The good news is that not many Americans share that disdain; just about everyone except Republican men believes that the lowest-paid workers deserve a raise. And they're right. We should raise the minimum wage, now.

Full text:   Pistachio nuts, one of Iran's most profitable products, appear to be latest victim of domestic inflation, so much so that the government has ordered a moratorium on exports as part of an effort to increase the supply at home and reduce the price, which has doubled just in the past month. The Associated Press quoted Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi as saying the export ban would last for six months. But it was unclear whether the move, which he announced Friday, would reduce domestic prices, particularly in time for Nowruz, the coming New Year holiday when pistachios are in especially high demand. It was also unclear to what extent the higher price reflected the declining value of the rial, Iran's currency, which has been weakened by the effects of Western sanctions and what critics call the government's economic mismanagement. The chairman of Iran's chamber of exports, Asadollah Asgaroladi, was quoted by the Fars News Agency as calling the export moratorium a mistake that would do little to ease the price and probably cost Iran more than $500 million in lost export revenue. He was also quoted as saying the ban would only strengthen the competitiveness of pistachios from the United States, which surpassed Iran in total pistachio production last year.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Incomes rose more than 11 percent for the top 1 percent of earners during the economic recovery, but not at all for everybody else, according to new data.
The numbers, produced by Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, show overall income growing by just 1.7 percent over the period. But there was a wide gap between the top 1 percent, whose earnings rose by 11.2 percent, and the other 99 percent, whose earnings declined by 0.4 percent.
Mr. Saez, a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal, an economic laurel considered second only to the Nobel, concluded that "the Great Recession has only depressed top income shares temporarily and will not undo any of the dramatic increase in top income shares that has taken place since the 1970s."
The disparity between top earners and everybody else can be attributed, in part, to differences in how the two groups make their money. The wealthy have benefited from a four-year boom in the stock market, while high rates of unemployment have continued to hold down the income of wage earners.
"We have in the middle basically three decades of problems compounded by high unemployment," said Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center research group in Washington. "That high unemployment we know depresses wage growth throughout the wage scale, but more so for the bottom than the middle and the middle than the top."
In his analysis, Mr. Saez said he saw no reason that the trend would reverse for 2012, which has not yet been analyzed. For that year, the "top 1 percent income will likely surge, due to booming stock prices, as well as retiming of income to avoid the higher 2013 top tax rates," Mr. Saez wrote, referring to income tax increases for the wealthy that were passed by Congress in January. The incomes of the other "99 percent will likely grow much more modestly," he said.
Excluding earnings from investment gains, the top 10 percent of earners took 46.5 percent of all income in 2011, the highest proportion since 1917, Mr. Saez said, citing a large body of work on earnings distribution over the last century that he has produced with the economist Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics.
Concern for the declining wages of working Americans and persistent high levels of inequality featured heavily in President Obama's State of the Union address this week. He proposed raising the federal minimum wage to $9 from $7.25 as one way to ameliorate the trend, a proposal that might lift the earnings of 15 million low-income workers by the end of 2015.
"Let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full time should have to live in poverty," Mr. Obama said in his address to Congress.
Mr. Obama's economic advisers say that he has been animated by the country's yawning levels of inequality, and the administration has put forward several proposals to address the gap. Those include higher taxes on a small group of the wealthiest families and an expansion of aid to lower- and middle-income families through programs like the Affordable Care Act.
The data analyzed by Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez shows that income inequality -- as measured by the proportion of income taken by the top 1 percent of earners -- reached a modern high just before the recession hit in 2009. The financial crisis and its aftermath hit wealthy families hard. But since then, their earnings have snapped back, if not to their 2007 peak.
That is not true for average working families. After accounting for inflation, median family income has declined over the last two years. In 2011, it stagnated for the poorest and dropped for those in the middle of the income distribution, census data show. Median household income, which was $50,054 in 2011, is about 9 percent lower than it was in 1999, after accounting for inflation.
Measures of inequality differ depending on whether they are measured after or before taxes, and whether or not they include government transfers like Social Security payments, food stamps and other credits.
Research led by the Cornell economist Richard V. Burkhauser, for instance, sought to measure the economic health of middle-class households including income, taxes, transfer programs and benefits like health insurance. It found that from 1979 to 2007, median income grew by about 18.2 percent over all rather than by 3.2 percent counting income alone.
In an interview, Mr. Burkhauser said his numbers measured "how are the resources that person has to live on changing over time," whereas Mr. Piketty and Mr. Saez's numbers measure "how are different people being rewarded in the marketplace."
"That's a fair question to ask, but it's a very different question to ask than, 'What resources do Americans have?' " Mr. Burkhauser said. Notably, many of the Obama administration's progressive policies have been aimed at blunting the effects of income inequality, rather than tackling income inequality itself.
Mr. Saez has advocated much more aggressive policies aimed at income inequality. "Falls in income concentration due to economic downturns are temporary unless drastic regulation and tax policy changes are implemented," Mr. Saez said in his analysis.
The recent policy changes, including tax increases and financial regulatory reform, he wrote, "are not negligible but they are modest relative to the policy changes that took place coming out of the Great Depression. Therefore, it seems unlikely that U.S. income concentration will fall much in the coming years."

Full text:   The Group of 7 industrialized countries appeared to tamp down talk of a currency war in a statement this week that said markets should determine exchange rates and that countries should use fiscal and monetary policies to achieve faster growth. It may help curb fears that stagnant economies will devalue their currencies to make their exports more affordable relative to competitors.
The statement came in response to sharp moves in currencies like the euro and the yen and calls by some Group of 7 countries like France for policies that could lead to competitive devaluations.
The yen, for instance, has fallen by about 11 percent against the dollar since the recent election in Japan of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has pushed for economic stimulus and more aggressive asset purchases by the Bank of Japan to fight deflation. Critics say those policies are aimed at lowering the value of the yen, which Mr. Abe's government has denied.
And last week President François Hollande of France proposed that euro-zone nations should adopt a policy to manage the value of the common currency to maintain the competitiveness of European goods. (The euro has appreciated about 2 percent against the dollar and nearly 10 percent against the yen this year.)
Such misguided thinking can lead only to chaos and retaliation. If all countries were to competitively devalue their currencies, the result would be a downward spiral that would benefit no one, but could lead to high inflation. Certainly in Europe, altering exchange rates is not the answer; reviving economies will require giving up on austerity, which is choking demand and investment.
Developing countries like Brazil and Mexico also complain that looser monetary policy in industrialized nations can produce effects similar to currency manipulation. When central banks in countries like Japan and the United States pump more money into their financial systems, investors are driven to put their money into emerging markets where interest rates are higher. That pushes up currencies like the real and peso, making exports from those countries more expensive on the world market. Instead of responding to this effect by manipulating their exchange rates, those countries could protect themselves from volatile capital flows by regulating them.
With much of Europe in a recession, Japan struggling with deflation, and the weak American economy potentially falling back into a recession if the automatic spending cuts go through, the global economy is fragile. The last thing the world needs is a currency war.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour from $7.25 and to automatically adjust it with inflation, a move aimed at increasing the earnings of millions of cooks, janitors, aides to the elderly and other low-wage workers.
The proposal directly addresses the country's yawning levels of income inequality, which the White House has tried to reduce with targeted tax credits, a major expansion of health insurance, education and other proposals. But it is sure to be politically divisive, especially given the weakness of the recovery and the continued high levels of joblessness.
The proposal would see the federal floor on hourly wages reach $9 in stages by the end of 2015. Tying the minimum wage to inflation would allow it to rise along with the cost of living. If enacted, the measure would boost the wages of about 15 million low-income workers, the White House estimated. The $9 minimum wage would be the highest in more than three decades, accounting for inflation, but still lower than the peaks reached in the 1960s and 1970s.
"Even with the tax relief we've put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That's wrong," Mr. Obama said in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. "Let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on earth, no one who works full time should have to live in poverty."
The White House said that the move would have profoundly positive effects for low-income families without unduly burdening businesses or raising the unemployment rate. It cited research showing "no detectable employment losses from the kind of minimum wage increases we have seen in the United States." The White House also pointed to companies like Costco, the retail discount chain, and Stride Rite, a children's shoe seller, that have previously supported increasing the minimum wage as a way to reduce employee turnover and improve workers' productivity.
But the move would almost certainly face stiff opposition. Many companies that hire low-wage workers -- both small businesses and large businesses -- have in the past vociferously opposed raising the minimum wage, as it increases their cost of business. By making employees more expensive for companies to hire, some economists argue that higher minimum wages increase the unemployment rate -- a particularly toxic possibility given the high levels of joblessness that remain long after the recession has ended.
Moreover, some economists, like David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine, have even argued that minimum wages are counterproductive at reducing poverty.
On top of that, conservatives have often argued that higher minimum wages burden job creators, especially during times when the economy is weak. House Speaker John A. Boehner voted against a 2006 bill letting the minimum wage rise to its current level of $7.25 from $5.15. The legislation ultimately passed with bipartisan support in 2007, though many Republicans voted against it.
But many centrist, labor and liberal groups have pushed for higher minimum wages, and left-of-center research groups praised Mr. Obama's new push on Tuesday evening.
"The president said he was putting jobs and the economy front and center tonight, and that's exactly what he did by calling for a minimum wage increase," Christine Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, said in a statement. "A higher minimum wage is key to getting the economy back on track for working people and the middle class. The president's remarks also cement the growing consensus on the left and right that one of the best ways to get the economy going again is to put money in the pockets of people who work."
Many state and local government set their own minimum wages above the federal floor. Currently Washington is the only state that sets a minimum wage above $9 an hour, but several states exceed the current rate of $7.25.
The White House said that the $1.75 increase in the minimum wage would be enough to offset roughly 10 to 20 percent of the increase in income inequality since 1980. According to data compiled by the economists Thomas Piketty, at the Paris School of Economics, and Emmanuel Saez, at the University of California, Berkeley, inequality has worsened considerably during that time, and many metrics show that wages have stagnated or declined for millions of working families. The income share of the top 1 percent of earners has doubled, to 20 percent in 2011 from 10 percent in 1980. Between 1980 and 2008, according to analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, the top 10 percent of earners captured 98 percent of all income gains.
The proposal is one of several that the White House has put forward to tackle that inequality. In the speech, Mr. Obama also proposed expanding early childhood education programs -- another path that experts say can tackle inequality by leveling the playing field and increasing mobility among children from low-income families. "Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than $7 later on by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime," Mr. Obama said. "Let's do what works, and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Let's give our kids that chance."
In his 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama proposed lifting the minimum wage yet higher, to $9.50. Under the current proposal, the White House said that a family earning $20,000 to $30,000 would see an additional $3,500 of income a year.
"This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families," said Mr. Obama on Tuesday night. "It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank, rent or eviction, scraping by or finally getting ahead. For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while C.E.O. pay has never been higher."

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- Seven top industrial nations, including the United States and Germany, pledged on Tuesday to let foreign exchange markets determine the value of their currencies.
The statement by the Group of 7 prompted relief in Japan, where policy makers have been under fire, accused of unfairly seeking to give their economy a shot in the arm by bringing down the value of the yen. The statement "properly recognizes that steps we are taking to beat deflation are not aimed at influencing currency markets," said Taro Aso, the Japanese finance minister.
But a Group of 20 official said that the statement was meant to warn Japan not to manipulate its exchange rates in its efforts to lift its moribund economy, and that concerns about Japan's policies and the prospect of competitive currency devaluation would be a chief topic at a coming Group of 20 meeting in Russia.
The statement and conflicting follow-ups from economic officials and finance ministries around the world caused confusion on Tuesday, with some market participants interpreting the situation as quelling fears of a so-called currency war and others interpreting it as stoking them. The yen climbed against the dollar and the euro as officials voiced their concerns about Japan's policies.
In the statement, the Group of 7 nations said they would consult closely to avoid moves that could hurt stability. But they restated a commitment to market-determined exchange rates.
"We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that we will not target exchange rates," the Group of 7 said in the statement, which was posted on the Web site of the Bank of England. Britain holds the rotating presidency this year.
Concerns had been mounting in recent weeks about the effects of an ultraloose monetary policy in Japan that has pushed the yen lower against top currencies. The yen's weakness had also prompted talk of a so-called currency war if other parts of the world followed suit in devalution.
Some international economic officials have brushed off the growing accusations of unfair or competitive currency manipulation.
"This increasing talk of currency wars is very much overblown," Olivier Blanchard, the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said in January. "Countries have to take the right measures to get their own economies back to health."
But loose monetary policy intended to increase growth often has the effect of devaluing a currency, thus making a given country's exports more affordable and its competitors' exports more expensive. Over the last few years, emerging market countries like Brazil have openly accused slow-growing advanced countries like the United States of unfairly pushing down the value of their currencies with their aggressive monetary policies.
For years, the United States has criticized export-reliant emerging economies, in particular China, over manipulating their currencies, too.
This week, the Obama administration said that it supported countries' efforts to increase economic growth and lower unemployment, but not by manipulating their exchange rates.
"We support the effort to reinvigorate growth and to end inflation in Japan," Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said during a briefing Monday. But she emphasized that the Group of 7 had a "longstanding set of rules" committing its members to float their currencies except during rare instances of market turbulence.
As some officials in Japan have argued the country should push down the value of the yen, some Europeans have supported doing the same for the euro. The euro's rise in value has become a particular concern, as it could make exports more expensive and dent growth if demand for European products falls. Those concerns prompted France to call for an exchange-rate policy.
On Monday, Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister, said he wanted Europeans to present a common plan this week at the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of 20 nations in Moscow.
But the head of the German Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, said on Monday that the French initiative was a poor substitute for policy overhauls that, if adopted, would do more for growth.

Full text:   ONE of the tax-fairness controversies in the presidential campaign last year grew out of the news that 33 of the wealthiest Americans paid little or no income tax in 2009, in part because they probably applied stock market losses to counter capital gains.
If they did, they now have plenty of less exalted company.
That tactic, called tax-loss harvesting, is one of several sophisticated financial techniques no longer confined to the ultrarich -- say, those making more than $200 million, with the means to deploy family offices or personal bankers to the task. Because of a combination of technology and entrepreneurship, people a rung or two down the wealth ladder -- with perhaps $250,000 to $10 million in investable assets -- can avail themselves of similar tools. Partly this is because technology has simplified and sped up the work for all income levels.
"Before, if you had a lot of money, you could have analysts doing all your calculations in a manual way, in Excel," said Mike Paulus, president of Addepar, a three-year-old firm based in Silicon Valley that offers digital sophistication in portfolio aggregation. "Due to technology, we can democratize it," he said.
The new products are a cut above the mass-market, do-it-yourself budgeting and retirement planning tools available online, often from mutual fund houses. Financial experts say the new approaches allow users to include more personalized and complex factors, like itemized tax deductions or the types of cars they hope to buy in retirement.
The techniques have grown over the last five years and now include comprehensive digital portfolio aggregation, a service offered by Addepar, and access to sophisticated investments, along with tax strategies like loss-harvesting. They are usually marketed to financial advisers and planners, rather than to the investors themselves.
The tax strategies, in particular, will become more important than ever, proponents say, now that, under new fiscal cliff legislation, capital gains taxes have risen and deductions have been scaled back for the better-off.
But the reliance on technology worries even some people who market the tools and advisers who use them. "What's important is the conversation with the adviser," said Linda Strachan, senior vice president of product management for financial planning products at Zywave, a financial software provider based in Milwaukee. Zywave's clients are financial advisers whose clients, in turn, typically have $200,000 to $2 million in assets.
The new products are most prevalent in the areas of financial and retirement planning and are becoming more common in investment strategy.
Jacque LeFore, president of LeFore Consulting, a financial advisory firm in Portland, Ore., is using a Zywave program to adjust the tax and spending strategies of a pair of retired technology managers from Idaho, with about $800,000 in liquid assets, as they start collecting Social Security next year. He also uses a cloud-based product called eMoney for cash-flow planning and for aggregating investments and liabilities.
People with $50 million or $100 million in net worth have " hired C.P.A.'s and attorneys to do more proactive planning like this," Mr. LeFore said.
Those in his clients' income range -- about $200,000 to $8 million in liquid assets -- cannot afford that kind of personalized advice, he said. Yet earlier planning tools were not sophisticated enough to handle all their investments.
Joel P. Bruckenstein, a consultant and newsletter publisher who specializes in the technology of financial planning, said a financial plan that took eight hours to produce five years ago could now be done in two or three.
Technological innovation has also made some of the most exclusive investments -- like hedge funds or their near equivalents -- available to smaller accounts.
In theory, hedge funds typically demand a minimum investment of $1 million, although even that amount cannot guarantee access to the best managers, who may be so popular that they have shut their funds to all but their close friends. But Maz Jadallah, a money manager in San Franciso, said he had built a portfolio that "clones" the strategies of top-performing hedge fund managers by tracking their specific holdings, which they are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter.
The minimum investment in one of his AlphaClone accounts, which began in 2008, is $100,000, and his clients have $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets.
Of course, markets change, so planners must constantly readjust. That is where strategies like tax-loss harvesting come in.
In 2005, three financial advisers from different firms created an automated market-monitoring tool, which they later sold to TD Ameritrade, called iRebal, short for Intelligent Rebalancing. Rebalancing means that iRebal -- and rival products like Tamarac and RedBlack -- constantly buy and sell holdings to ensure that each person's account maintains its desired overall allocation to various asset classes, even as markets shift and particular stocks and bonds gain and lose value.
This strategy becomes even more complex when programs aim to do it in the most tax-efficient way.
Before these automated products were available, said J. D. Bruce, president of the wealth management firm Abacus Wealth Partners in Los Angeles, the process was so labor-intensive that his firm could handle only a monthly rebalancing for most clients. Now, it is done at least twice a week.
True, that still may not be up to the standards of the superrich. A family office "has a team of people that's watching your portfolio every day, looking for rebalance opportunities and tax-loss harvesting," said Christopher J. Cordaro, one of the creators of iRebal and chief executive of RegentAtlantic Capital, a wealth management firm in Morristown, N.J. Perhaps a more automated tool will eventually help less wealthy investors catch up to that.
Most of these new tactics would not be possible without advanced technology, including crowdsourcing, cloud computing and ever-faster database analysis. In creating Addepar's framework, Mr. Paulus, the president, said, "We borrowed how Google looks at the world and how Facebook looks at the world." In addition, the company collected ideas through open-source Web communities.
But many experts caution that personal, professional advice must still accompany such tools.
Mr. Bruckenstein, the newsletter publisher, said that even the snazziest computer programs were no better than the assumptions put into them regarding inflation, investment returns, interest rates, taxes and future earnings. "Garbage in, garbage out," he said.
Mr. Bruce of Abacus, though, said that technology like iRebal actually improved the conversation with clients. Because what he calls "the arcane underpinnings" are so smooth, he said, "now we can talk about the things that really matter, which are people's feelings around their money."

Abstract: Lambda Legal, the gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy organization, filed an administrative grievance, arguing that denying benefits to a married couple, gay or straight, was contrary to Maryland law. Tax issues for same-sex married couples are numerous and often require expert advice to navigate. Because same-sex couples are not permitted to file federal returns jointly, they cannot combine incomes and deductions to take advantage of lower tax rates and the benefits that can accrue, say, from balancing profits and losses in financial transactions.

Full text:   FOR Colette Hayward and Margaret Selby, the problem is this: Maryland recognizes their 2009 marriage, but the federal government does not.
The ramifications are maddeningly complex, no more so than when they deal with the Internal Revenue Service. Two years after taking legal action to assert their rights as a married couple, they are paying a price when they pay their taxes.
For Ms. Hayward, 47, a lawyer who owns two construction businesses, and Ms. Selby, 48, a Baltimore County police officer, a big issue involves insurance benefits they fought to achieve. They are paying taxes on those benefits, even though such benefits for spouses normally are not taxed.
For same-sex couples across the United States, an offshoot of being married is a dizzying set of complications in computing taxes. Although nine states and the District of Columbia have approved same-sex marriages -- two others recognize marriages conducted elsewhere -- the federal 1996 Defense of Marriage Act prohibits such unions from being recognized by the federal government.
Ms. Hayward, 47, and Ms. Selby, 48, have two children and three grandchildren. They were together for 18 years before they married in Massachusetts. Soon after their marriage in 2009, Ms. Selby filed a request with the Baltimore County Police Department to add Ms. Hayward to her health care coverage and to make sure she was eligible for other benefits available to officer's spouses. She was turned down.
Lambda Legal, the gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy organization, filed an administrative grievance, arguing that denying benefits to a married couple, gay or straight, was contrary to Maryland law. It cited a 2010 opinion by the Maryland attorney general, Douglas F. Gansler, which noted the state's longstanding law recognizing out-of-state marriages, including same-sex ones.
In 2011, an arbitrator ruled in the couple's favor. But the victory came with a catch. Generally, health insurance benefits are not taxable, and adding a spouse or child to an insurance policy has no tax consequences. But because of DOMA, their insurance is treated not as a spousal benefit, but as imputed income, and thus subject to federal income tax. Ms. Hayward said Baltimore County told the couple that adding her to the policy increased the cost of the insurance by about $8,000 a year. She figures that it will increase their overall tax bill by about $2,500 to $3,000.
"We never expected this," Ms. Hayward said. "We didn't sit there studying the I.R.S. code thinking we might be facing a major tax hit."
Tax issues for same-sex married couples are numerous and often require expert advice to navigate.
Because same-sex couples are not permitted to file federal returns jointly, they cannot combine incomes and deductions to take advantage of lower tax rates and the benefits that can accrue, say, from balancing profits and losses in financial transactions.
Issues also arise when same-sex couples have children or other dependents, because they cannot file joint tax returns and may not both be legal parents. That complicates exemption claims and child care benefits, including education tax breaks.
PERHAPS most significantly for couples with major assets, DOMA prevents same-sex couples from taking advantage of estate tax exemptions, about $5.1 million for 2012 -- but double that for couples -- after indexing for inflation. If one member of a same-sex couple dies and leaves a spouse $5 million, those assets would be taxed. For heterosexual couples, there would be no tax.
That tax disparity is at the heart of the first challenge to DOMA to reach the United States Supreme Court. It was filed by Edith Windsor, who married Thea Spyer in 2007. When Ms. Spyer died in 2009, she left Ms. Windsor her share of their cottage in Southampton, N.Y., valued at $550,000 and an apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan valued at $1.3 million. The result was a $600,000 federal and state estate tax bill.
"I was indignant and hurt," Ms. Windsor said. "If her name had been Theo instead of Thea I would have owed no taxes."
The extra costs extend even to the tax-filing process. For same-sex couples in states that recognize their marriages, couples must prepare two sets of federal returns -- one that they will actually file, and another prepared as if they were married, to help prepare their state tax return.
Not having a marriage recognized for tax purposes can actually be an advantage, and the repeal of DOMA could cost some same-sex married couples some money. Just as many married couples are hit with the so-called marriage tax, many same-sex couples save money by being forced to file separately.
"I think a lot of same-sex married couples in high income ranges have no idea that once their marriage is recognized they will be paying a lot more in federal income tax because of the marriage tax penalty," said Patricia Cain, a tax law professor at Santa Clara University, who is herself in a same-sex marriage. "I just ran the figures on a couple in the $2 million range, and in 2013 they'll be paying $35,000 more in federal tax filing jointly."
Still, she said, both for social-equity reasons and because of the contradictions, ambiguities and holes in the current tax system, the repeal of DOMA cannot happen too soon. The confusion applies not just to marriage but to its dissolution as well, she said.
"We need to have marriage recognized, so we can know how to do divorce," she said.
She said that she was confident DOMA would eventually fall, but that there was no way to predict what the Windsor case would bring or whether the Supreme Court would make a broad ruling on DOMA or a narrow one -- say, on how it would affect the estate tax for same-sex couples.
Back in Maryland, Ms. Hayward said she and Ms. Selby had considered dropping the insurance but had decided against it.
"It's going to cost us more, but we fought so hard for it, we figure we should stick it out," she said. "We're hoping there's going to be some movement on DOMA that will make this a nonissue. I'm very optimistic. I may be naïve, but I'm very optimistic."

Full text:   IF 2012 was the beginning of a long, inevitable slide toward tax increases, 2013 might just turn out to be the lurching start of tax reform.
For more than a decade, lawmakers in both parties have lamented the complexity of the federal tax code, even as they layered on new deductions, credits and variable tax rates intended to reward some activities and punish others.
The deal struck by the White House and Senate on New Year's Day to head off the huge tax increases of the so-called fiscal cliff actually made matters worse on the complexity front. The highest marginal tax rate was increased to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for couples earning over $450,000 ($400,000 for individuals). In doing so, however, negotiators increased the total number of tax brackets to seven from six.
Tax rates on capital gains and dividends for families earning less than that $450,000 threshold remain at 15 percent, but those who earn more will have some of their investments taxed at 20 percent. And personal exemption and tax deduction phase-outs, known as PEP and Pease, are coming back starting at incomes as low as $250,000. President George W. Bush banished those in 2001. (PEP stands for personal exemption phaseout, and Pease for former Representative Donald J. Pease, the Ohio Democrat who created the deduction cap.)
The changes may sound like enough to make you ditch your tax-preparation software and run screaming as fast as you can to a professional accountant.
But by the end of the year, efforts in both the House and Senate to overhaul the tax code, simplify it and strip out many bewildering and contradictory tax breaks might bear fruit. That's because both political parties have an incentive, although not the same incentive, to move forward.
"Tax reform is alive and well," said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "There's such a need to simplify the code, to help the code be more competitive, to address a lot of inequities," he said, adding that because the New Year's tax deal did practically nothing to close loopholes and unclutter the tax code, "the road is clear."
Republicans are being driven by a long-held desire for simplification, pressed hard by the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan. Conservatives in the House have been clamoring to take on tax reform since they swept to power in 2010. And after a year of listening sessions, tutorials and hearings, Mr. Camp and the rest of the House Republican leadership want to move forward.
For Democrats, it's mainly about the money. The deal to avert the fiscal cliff contained tax rate increases, which President Obama has been demanding since his 2008 run for the White House. But the rate increases were not as inclusive as those he had campaigned for -- he wanted tax rates to rise on incomes above $250,000, dividends to be taxed as ordinary income and inherited estates to face considerably higher rates and lower exemptions from taxation than the final deal demanded.
On the estate tax, Mr. Obama wanted to subject the value of estates over $3.5 million to a 45 percent tax, higher than the 2012 level of 35 percent on estates over $5 million. The final deal did get a higher rate -- 40 percent -- but kept the exemption at $5 million, or $10 million for married couples, indexed for inflation. With that indexing, the exemption comes in at about $5.1 million for 2012 -- double for a couple -- a level that exempts all but a tiny number of inheritances.
By raising taxes on incomes over $400,000, Congress also effectively raised only the top marginal income tax rate, not the top two, as the president and most Democrats had wanted. (It is the "marginal" rate because it applies only to income above a certain threshold.)
Raising tax rates further won't be simple, said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who as a leader of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has spent more than a decade examining tax shelters and dodges. The only way to raise more revenue for deficit reduction at this point, he said, lies with a tax code overhaul that curtails or eliminates breaks that favor the affluent and hits corporations that use offshore tax structures to shelter profits.
Think mortgage interest deductions for second homes, the low "carried interest" tax rate paid by many private equity fund managers who take their fees in the form of capital gains skimmed off their clients' earnings, or post office box subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands. There could even be some limit on deductions for charitable giving.
"To me this is not about tax increases," Mr. Levin said. "This is tax-avoidance termination, long overdue."
The maneuvering over these issues is well under way in Congress. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Senate Democrats hoped to pass a budget blueprint this spring that would include a parliamentary device called reconciliation to put tax reform on a fast track. Under reconciliation, a Congressional budget gives instructions to the tax-writing committees to draft legislation that saves (or costs) a specific amount of money over the window of the budget, usually 10 years.
Reconciliation protects that legislation, drafted later in the year, from a filibuster in the Senate, meaning that it could pass with a simple, 51-vote majority. Mr. Bush passed his large 2001 and 2003 tax cuts under these terms. Now Democrats want to turn the tables and use the tactic to raise revenue. They have yet to say how much, but Mr. Obama's last offer to Republicans for a deficit-reduction "grand bargain" asked for $1.2 trillion in new revenue over 10 years. The tax increases of the New Year's deal raised about half that much, so another $600 billion in revenue through tax reform is a likely target.
But Mr. Schumer's suggestion has created its own problems. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the finance committee, said the reconciliation device would poison any tax reform effort, leaving Republicans feeling strong-armed and voiceless.
"I know Chuck wants to order the committee to do what he wants it to do," Mr. Hatch said of the Schumer plan. "But that isn't the way it's going to work. In fact, that's the way to create chaos."
The House budget, likely to be passed by April 15, will also include tax reform instructions. But the House's version would raise no more revenue than the current tax code -- albeit at the higher level of the post-fiscal-cliff tax regime.
In normal times, Senate and House negotiators working out a final budget blueprint for both chambers might be counted on to split the difference, say, with a plan that raised $300 billion over 10 years. But these are not normal times, and Republicans in the House and Senate say that when it comes to taxes, they have given in enough.
Moreover, the white-shoed tax lobbyists of K Street are already circling the Capitol, seeking to protect the tax breaks that their clients have paid them to protect. Before a formal push for tax reform even begins, a coalition of universities, philanthropies and others have all but made sure that no real harm will come to the deduction for charitable giving, for example. And electric power utilities have banded together to protect the low rate on dividends, saying that most dividends go to ordinary retirees, not the superrich.
To those who remember the struggle with lobbyists over the 1986 tax-code overhaul, 2013 is developing into "Showdown at Gucci Gulch II." Then again, no one gave the 1986 tax reform effort much chance at success -- yet it was enacted.
"There are a lot of crosscurrents here: the need for revenues, spending cuts," Mr. Baucus said of the task at hand. "There's just a lot going on."

Full text:   Readers discuss safety-net programs, better-paying jobs and support for parents.
To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof is clearly right: Too many young children from poor families face diminished opportunities by the time they're just 2 years old, and we should do more to help them overcome the formidable obstacles before them ("For Obama's New Term, Start Here," column, Jan. 24). But his portrayal of today's safety net deserves a broader look.
Noting that the "official" poverty rate is no lower today than in the late 1960s, Mr. Kristof said our anti-poverty programs largely address symptoms of poverty without reducing poverty itself.
But the official poverty measure considers only cash income in determining whether a family is poor. It counts cash welfare payments, which have fallen dramatically since the late 1960s, but not benefits like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, which provide much more assistance now than then.
The government's more comprehensive poverty measure that counts these other benefits shows that safety-net programs now cut the number of poor people nearly in half -- by more than 40 million -- compared with where the nation would be without these programs.
Moreover, numerous studies show that key safety-net programs do more than reduce poverty. Children who had access to food stamps in early childhood were healthier as adults. Medicaid coverage is associated with better health, lower mortality and less household debt. The earned-income tax credit substantially increases work among poor single parents and leads to improvement in children's school performance.
Still, as Mr. Kristof argues, for too many poor families, existing programs aren't sufficient. Unfortunately, there's no silver bullet. So we should move aggressively to identify, test and evaluate a variety of new approaches and to institute and spread effective initiatives, to help more poor children advance and poor adults surmount barriers to success in the labor market. But as we do so, we shouldn't lose sight of the safety net's considerable accomplishments or the progress that has been made.

Both Mr. Kristof and Mr. Greenstein are right: far too many have been left behind, as Mr. Kristof says, but many more would have been so without the safety net, as Mr. Greenstein says.
But with the truncating of cash assistance, poverty has become primarily working poverty. Roughly four out of five poor households have a worker in them. Workers have steadily increased their productivity over the last three decades, but wages have stagnated. Yet costs still rise, especially the basics -- housing, energy, health care -- even faster than inflation. Meeting the rent is a challenge, with the "luxuries" of health insurance or decent child care simply unaffordable.
Moreover, poverty rates are higher among blacks and Hispanics, while single mothers account for a disproportionate half of poor families. Yet our anti-poverty programs have consistently ignored racial/ethnic and gender-based discrimination. Ensuring that women and people of color are paid equal wages would significantly affect poverty rates.
Finally, when we force people to choose between being successful workers and successful parents, the country loses. It is equally important to ensure that parents can both care for their children and provide adequately for them.
For if today's children get boosts in the early years, but then enter deeply unequal and segregated schools, and then a labor market that provides unequal and inadequate wages, little will change for this or future generations facing poverty.
DIANA PEARCE Seattle, Feb. 7, 2013
The writer is a senior lecturer and director of the Center for Women's Welfare at the University of Washington School of Social Work.
Mr. Greenstein is correct that safety-net programs help mute some aspects of poverty, but to encourage child development we need to work more directly with the adults in a child's life. Significant research demonstrates that strong, stable, positive relationships between parents and children, particularly during the first years of life, are the linchpin for cognitive and social development.
The problem is that investing in programs that help parents is hard to do politically. Conservatives do not want the government telling parents how to raise their children and assume that government programs encourage unhealthy dependency. Liberals worry that emphasizing parenting is just another opportunity to denigrate poor families of color.
Rather than demonizing dependency or assuming that helping parents is stigmatizing, we should recognize that families and the government are both dependent -- on each other. Just as families need the government, the government needs healthy, stable families to do the critical work of preparing young children for school. Fighting poverty begins at home, with greater support for parents of very young children.

The writer is an associate professor at Fordham Law School and the author of the forthcoming "Flourishing Families: Harnessing Law to Foster Strong, Stable, Positive Relationships."
It's devastating that our overall poverty rate is above 15 percent. More insidious, however, than the alarming rates of poverty among children, older persons, people of color and military veterans is the all-time-high rate of income inequality in America. The widening gap between the very few at the top -- the 1 percent of the 1 percent -- versus the tens of millions in the bottom half is trumping poverty as the major domestic threat to America's economic security.
As Mr. Greenstein documents, a great deal of the Great Society works and works well. No social program, private business or human enterprise is perfect. Head Start, the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP, né food stamps), the earned-income tax credit, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and other programs have been effective for decades in lifting millions out of poverty.
President Obama is renowned for his insistence on evidence-based solutions. As he prepares for his State of the Union address, I hope he will amplify on his commitment to make America more economically equitable.
DON MATHIS President and Chief Executive Community Action Partnership Washington, Feb. 6, 2013
Mr. Greenstein correctly points out that government safety-net programs such as food stamps and Medicaid have enabled millions of people to have a better quality of life. However, if we have any hope of fighting poverty beyond the safety net that still permits millions to live with the despair of chronic poverty, we cannot rely on government alone.
We must build a substantial network of nongovernmental organizations that have demonstrated success both in the United States and abroad with small, customized, bottom-up efforts that have learned to unlock doors that governments aren't able or willing to enter.
Organizations like Kiva, GlobalGiving and the Acumen Fund have demonstrated how ordinary individuals can have an enormous impact through microcredit lending programs. The power of collaboration between government and nongovernment individuals and organizations has enormous, yet unrealized potential.
PETER SCHMIDT Phillipsburg, N.J., Feb. 6, 2013
The Writer Responds
As Ms. Pearce suggests, more jobs and higher wage levels would significantly reduce poverty. In the late 1990s, when unemployment tumbled, poverty fell, real wages rose and more people with limited education and skills found jobs. Unfortunately, in today's global economy, wages for lower-paying jobs won't likely regain their levels of several decades ago (in inflation-adjusted terms), and even a higher minimum wage, while helpful, would only modestly reduce poverty.
That's one reason the improvements of recent decades in the earned-income tax credit and low-income component of the child tax credit are so important -- they significantly supplement low wages for parents. It's also why some lawmakers' interest in cutting these tax credits for low-income working families -- to help finance new tax-rate cuts or reduce deficits -- is so misguided. We should also worry about the substantial number of poor people with limited education or other impediments who don't find steady work even in full-employment years.
What should we do? First, "do no harm" -- don't cut crucial supports like the earned-income tax credit. The Simpson-Bowles fiscal panel rightly called for shielding poor and disadvantaged Americans in deficit reduction. Second, in 2009 and 2010, states successfully used federal funding to subsidize the creation of 250,000 jobs for low-income parents and youth, mostly in the private sector, until the funds ran out. We should build on that promising initiative. Finally, as Mr. Kristof noted and Ms. Huntington explains, we should focus on those deeply poor families for whom we need more intensive, individualized services and identify better ways to give them -- and their children -- a greater shot at success.

Full text:   If Steve Boedefeld graduates from Appalachian State University without any student loan debt, it will be because of the money he earned fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and the money he now saves by eating what he grows or kills.
Zack Tolmie managed to escape New York University with no debt -- and a degree -- by landing a job at Bubby's, the brunch institution in TriBeCa, where he made $1,000 a week. And he had entered N.Y.U. with sophomore standing, thanks to Advanced Placement credits. All that hard work also yielded a $25,000 annual merit scholarship.
The two are part of a rare species on college campuses these days, as the nation's collective student loan balance hits $1 trillion and continues to rise. While many students are trying to defray some of the costs, few can actually work their way through college in a normal amount of time without debt and little or no need-based financial aid unless they have an unusual combination of bravery, luck and discipline.
"I literally never went out," Mr. Tolmie says. "There just was not time to do that."
Plenty of influential people assume that teenagers can ask parents for loans if all else fails, as Mitt Romney suggested during the 2012 presidential campaign. Others recall working their way through college themselves, including Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina who heads a House subcommittee on higher education and work force training. "I spent seven years getting my undergraduate degree and didn't borrow a dime of money," she once said at a subcommittee meeting, adding that she was bewildered, given her own experience, by tales of woe she had heard from people with $80,000 in debt.
But students nowadays who try to work their way through college without parental support or loans face a financial challenge of a different order than the one that Ms. Foxx, 69, confronted as a University of North Carolina undergraduate more than 40 years ago. Today, a bachelor's degree from Appalachian State, the largest university in her district, can easily cost $80,000 for a state resident, including tuition, room, board and other costs. Back in her day, the total was about $550 a year. Even with inflation, that would translate to just over $4,000 for each year it takes to earn a degree.
And the paychecks that Mr. Tolmie managed in the big city are only a dream in towns like Boone, where employers have their pick of thousands of Appalachian State undergraduates. Even the most industrious, like Kelsey Manuel, a junior who drives 10 miles each way to a job in a resort where she earns $10 to $11 an hour, often cannot work enough to finish college debt-free.
No one tracks how many students are trying to work their way through without parental assistance or debt, but plenty work long hours while also attending classes full time. As of 2010, some 17 percent of full-time undergraduates of traditional age worked 20 to 34 hours a week, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. About 6 percent worked 35 hours or more.
Students who work fewer than 30 hours a week (excluding federal work-study jobs) while in college were 1.4 times more likely to graduate within six years than students who spent more than 30 hours a week in a job, according to an article by Pilar Mendoza, an assistant professor of higher education administration at the University of Florida, in The Journal of Student Financial Aid last year. Their grades are likely to be better, too, since they have more time to study.
But working less has financial consequences. "You have two choices," Ms. Mendoza says of students whose families could not or would not contribute to their college costs. "You either work, or you acquire debt."
Banking on Brunch
Zack Tolmie chose to work. He first caught sight of New York University on television when he was a freshman in high school in Altamont, N.Y., outside Albany. While his parents wanted him to attend college, their savings suffered in the 2001 recession.
So Mr. Tolmie got a job at a Johnny Rockets restaurant. By the time he started college in 2007, he had saved $8,000, four times as much as his parents had accumulated for him.
Impressed by the pluck he had demonstrated in passing so many Advanced Placement tests, N.Y.U. guaranteed Mr. Tolmie $25,000 in merit scholarships each year, which left him with about $75,000 that he needed to earn over three years. "I had a chart on my desk so that every time I sat down I would need to look at it," he says. "Every two weeks I needed X amount. That first year, it would have been around $600 after taxes."
He got his lucky break when a server from Bubby's spotted him working elsewhere and said he would probably be happier working with her. He let her boss know how eager he was. "I made it clear I wanted to work as much as possible," he says. Waiters could earn $300 each on the weekend brunch shift, with its rapid turnover of tables and parade of mimosas.
As the new guy, he lacked the seniority to get those shifts. But he would show up for them anyway because colleagues would often bail out if a willing replacement was standing by. Then, he would work a double shift and stay until midnight. "It was kind of funny," he says. "I was waiting tables so I could go to school, and so many times I thought, 'If only I didn't have to go to school, I could just work day shifts.' "
Mr. Tolmie picked a double major in math and economics, in part because he knew he could finish in three years. Inevitably, there were trade-offs, including his B-plus average. "I could have probably done better if I had devoted an extra 10 hours each week," he says. "But that wasn't really an option."
He also didn't have much of a social life. "The absolute worst was hearing about friends back at home and the colleges they went to, especially the ones that have proper campuses," he says. "I didn't have a friend that I'd bring home for Christmas break."
Mr. Tolmie received his degree in 2010 and works as a mortgage broker. He looks at people around him and is glad he didn't take another approach to paying for college.
"There is someone I worked with at the restaurant who went to school for music," he says. "But music doesn't pay well. And with the hours as a waiter, he can't do what he wants to do as a musician. He's working, enslaved to the student loan debt, all for a career he's not able to pursue."
Homegrown Groceries
Appalachian State costs less than half what N.Y.U. does, but there are not many jobs in Boone, N.C., where a teenager can make $300 in a couple of hours.
Steve Boedefeld's solution was to earn much of the money he needed before he got there. A native of Ridgedale, Mo., he was a straight-A student in high school and an avid reader of military history, particularly Vietnam chronicles. "I remember reading all of those books," he says. "And I didn't want my grandson to look back and ask me why I didn't go when my country was at war." The financial benefits to enlisting with the elite Army Rangers were attractive, too.
"My folks tried everything to keep me from joining the Army," he says. "They told me that I could go to school wherever I wanted and that they would pay for it. But I was pretty much dead-set that I could do it on my own. Their parents didn't float their bill, so why should I be different?"
Mr. Boedefeld enlisted in 2006 and finished his service in 2010, after three tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, each lasting three to six months. The discipline that allowed him to endure Ranger training and survive combat has carried over to his financial life. As a soldier in a war zone away from his wife, Jennifer, he earned as much as $5,000 a month, much of it tax-free thanks to longstanding rules governing combat pay. They put away $10,000 to $15,000 annually. "One of my friends calls me an economy killer," he said.
The Boedefelds arrived in Boone with enough money for a down payment on a fixer-upper. They moved there because Appalachian State offered a degree in renewable energy that interested Mr. Boedefeld, now 25. He joined the North Carolina National Guard to get in-state tuition rates, and his service enables him to buy reasonably priced health insurance for his wife and two sons.
With his National Guard service, his $2,000 a month or so in G.I. Bill benefits and the $10 an hour he makes working 15 to 20 hours a week for an electrician, the family is debt-free, save for their mortgage. They have found a number of low-cost ways to stretch the budget they keep posted on the refrigerator.
"We definitely live on what we can grow in the garden and what I can hunt for," he says, over a dinner of homemade venison enchiladas topped with salsa made of vegetables from the garden outside. "I try to plan so that we make at least two deer meals a week."
He is also known in the neighborhood as the guy to call when a tree is down. He cuts and splits it to fuel the wood stove that heats the family's house.
Even after all of the chopping, hunting and parenting, Mr. Boedefeld is on schedule to graduate in the spring and hopes to teach technology, engineering and design to high school students. He has maintained a 3.8 grade-point average, in part by having little contact outside of class with other students.
He worries about those who arrive on campus without any direction. "I think some students are naïve," he says. "It's half their fault and half because they just don't know what college is meant for. People are going to school because they think they should, when you should go to school for an investment."
Investing in Oneself
When Kelsey Manuel, 21, transferred from a community college near her home in Lexington, N.C., to Appalachian State, she worried about enrolling without a clear career goal. But she soon settled on a hospitality major, having worked as a waitress near her home. She made $16,000 in 2011.
Those earnings, however, kept her from being eligible for much federal financial aid, and she was only able to earn just over $12,000 in 2012 at a similar job at a hotel about 10 miles from campus. Her parents have not been able to help her pay for college, and she is now on pace to end up with at least $30,000 in student loan debt.
Esther Manogin, director of the office of student financial aid at Appalachian State, worries that students fail to place debt in context. "You could not buy a new S.U.V.," she says, for the average debt level of the university's graduates, which is likely to be around $25,000 for this year's freshmen who borrow and finish their degrees. "I don't encourage them to take out loans if they don't need them. But if that's the only way they can get an education and realize their dream, then I think it's an excellent investment in themselves."
According to the College Board, the average debt among all bachelor's degree recipients from public universities was $13,600 for the 2010-11 school year. The average among all those who borrowed was $23,800, and many of them were probably getting at least some financial assistance from their parents. The average full-time undergraduate at a four-year public university during the 2012-13 school year is paying a net price of $12,110 for tuition, room, board and other fees after taking grant aid and tax credits into consideration, though not everyone who wants or needs to work to pay for college will qualify.
As it is for many students who work long hours and have little spending money to show for it, Ms. Manuel's financial situation sets her apart and exposes her to any number of slights. Joining a sorority is out of the question, given the dues and the fact that many social functions occur during prime working hours.
Then there are the comments about her banged-up Toyota with nearly 134,000 miles on it. "I heard someone say recently: 'Don't let her drive her car. You should see it!' " she says. "I don't have money to get it fixed."
Friends from Lexington wonder why she doesn't often return to visit, without realizing that if she didn't work she would literally be losing money. And peers at school ask why she cannot spend the money she's earned. "Before it's even made, it has a home," she says.
She worries that her long hours on the job may put her academic performance and future employment prospects in jeopardy.
Indeed, this is Ms. Manogin's biggest fear about students like this. "I just don't see how they cannot let their grades suffer," she says. "Research says that for every hour of class, you need to allocate three hours of study."
She declined to comment on Representative Foxx's nose-to-the-grindstone, debt-free exhortation. "Probably anything I say about Virginia Foxx will get me fired," she says.
Ms. Manuel, though, didn't hesitate to note the long odds of earning enough while enrolled in college full-time to avoid student loans. "If I could make that kind of money, believe me, I'd do it." A spokeswoman for Representative Foxx declined an interview request.
Ms. Manuel says she does wish that she had saved more money from previous jobs. But so far, she doesn't regret having enrolled at Appalachian State.
"I know that in the end, I'm probably going to be in a better situation," she says. "I'm going to know the value of a dollar. These are the things that you just need to learn to grow up."

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela announced Friday that it was devaluing its currency, a step that had long been deemed necessary but could push the spiking inflation even higher.
The devaluation, which lowered the currency's value against the dollar by nearly a third, was aimed at solidifying government finances and easing a tight market for dollars that has choked back imports and led to shortages of basic goods.
The move had been widely anticipated, but it had been unclear whether officials would make what could be a politically risky decision with President Hugo Chávez still out of the country after undergoing cancer surgery in Cuba on Dec. 11.
If Mr. Chávez were to die or were too ill to continue as president, a special election would have to be called, and many analysts thought that the government might try to postpone a devaluation until after that occurred.
"It is a sign of pragmatism that they carry out a devaluation even though we're all aware there is some likelihood of a presidential election being held soon," said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "This shows that they're willing to correct basic economic distortions."
The currency, the bolívar, will be set at 6.3 to the dollar. It had been set at 4.3.
Venezuela's finance minister, Jorge Giordani, said that Mr. Chávez, who has not been seen or heard in public for more than eight weeks, had approved the measures.
"Here is the president's signature if you want to recognize it or if you still have doubts," Mr. Giordani said, holding up a document during a televised news conference.
The devaluation will help the government balance its books by giving it more bolívars for the dollars it earns selling oil on the world market. Venezuela's economy is highly dependent on oil, with petroleum sales making up about 95 percent of total exports. The country is the fourth-largest foreign oil supplier to the United States.
Government spending soared last year during the campaign to re-elect Mr. Chávez, leading to a large deficit, even though, at more than $100 a barrel, the price of oil is very high.
Pressure to devalue had been building for months, as the black market exchange rate rose to more than four times the official rate. The imbalance was evident in the prices of many goods. A Big Mac at McDonald's costs 70 bolívars, or $16.27, at the official pre-devaluation rate.
But the devaluation will also make imported goods more expensive, which will probably make inflation worse. Inflation for the 12 months ended on Jan. 31 was 22.2 percent, one of the highest rates in Latin America.
Surging inflation could cause political problems for the government. But the exchange rate had reduced the dollars available to importers, leading to shortages of goods like sugar, chicken and toilet paper. Many analysts believe that voters blame the government more for shortages than for inflation.

Abstract: The president of the European Central Bank on Thursday cited the rising value of the euro as a possible threat to the region's economic recovery, comments that immediately sent the euro down sharply against the dollar and yen. "The exchange rate is not a policy target, but it is important for growth and price stability," Mr. Draghi said at a news conference after the regular monthly policy meeting of the E.C.B.'s Governing Council, in which the central bank left its main interest rate at 0.75 percent, as expected.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The president of the European Central Bank on Thursday cited the rising value of the euro as a possible threat to the region's economic recovery, comments that immediately sent the euro down sharply against the dollar and yen.
Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, denied that the central bank was trying to influence the value of the euro, no doubt mindful of provoking a currency war with Japan or the United States. But he then made statements that investors interpreted as meaning the E.C.B. could take action if the euro rose too much.
"The exchange rate is not a policy target, but it is important for growth and price stability," Mr. Draghi said at a news conference after the regular monthly policy meeting of the E.C.B.'s Governing Council, in which the central bank left its main interest rate at 0.75 percent, as expected.
Separately, the Bank of England also kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday, at 0.5 percent, amid worries that the British economy could fall back into a recession for the third time in five years. The pound has been falling against the euro and the dollar this year, pressured by investor concerns that the British economy may not manage to recover anytime soon.
Mr. Draghi, during the news conference, was careful to avoid any explicit threat to take action to push down the euro, or to criticize any other countries. He said the euro's current value was not far from its historical norm. But he noted that economic policy by other countries, none of which he identified, could affect exchange rates.
"Draghi's biggest challenge was to show his magic skills of verbal interventions and to talk down the euro exchange rate," Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients. "He succeeded."
Having traded at nearly $1.36 to the dollar earlier on Thursday, the euro dropped to below $1.34 after Mr. Draghi's comments. In July it was trading just above $1.21.
Its record high of just below $1.60 was reached in April 2008, when the U.S. banking crisis was gathering steam.
Recent data have supported the E.C.B.'s view that the euro zone will emerge from recession this year, a view Mr. Draghi repeated Thursday. German industrial production rose 0.3 percent in December from November, according to a report Thursday, reversing a decline in the previous month and signaling a pickup in Germany, which has the largest euro zone economy.
But the recovery is threatened by the rising value of the euro, which could hurt European exports by making them more expensive for foreign buyers. In recent weeks, the euro has risen substantially against the dollar, to its highest levels in a year.
Few analysts had expected the E.C.B. to shift its monetary policy Thursday. Some predict that the benchmark rate could stay at its present level for an extended period as the euro zone slowly returns to growth.
But Mr. Draghi also emphasized Thursday that inflation was headed below the E.C.B.'s target of about 2 percent. The lack of price pressure would allow the E.C.B. space to cut rates if it chose.
Mr. Draghi argued that the appreciation of the euro "is a sign of return of confidence." Some analysts said it could take a bigger increase in the currency's value before the E.C.B. would consider taking action, like a cut in the benchmark interest rate.
A stronger euro means that products ranging from cars to wine become more expensive abroad, putting European producers at a disadvantage against foreign competitors. But there are also positive effects. Imports, particularly oil, become less expensive for Europeans, which helps stimulate the economy.
"The main factor behind the euro strength is the easing of the sovereign debt crisis, which is clearly positive for the euro zone growth," Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note. "The E.C.B. is likely to tolerate further euro appreciation and is quite unlikely to cut rates again."
During the news conference, Mr. Draghi deflected persistent questioning about a deal that the Irish central bank announced Thursday. It said that the E.C.B. had agreed to stretch out repayments for the 2009 bailout of Anglo Irish Bank to 40 years, instead of the 10 years previously scheduled.
The Irish Parliament approved legislation early Thursday to liquidate Anglo Irish Bank, after negotiating with the E.C.B. to swap the so-called promissory notes used to bail out the Irish lender for long-term government bonds.
Mr. Draghi said the E.C.B.'s Governing Council merely "took note" of the Irish action. But he declined to provide any details.
He may have wanted to avoid any impression that the central bank was giving a financial break to the Irish government. The E.C.B.'s charter prohibits it from directly financing euro zone governments.
Mr. Draghi did, however, applaud efforts by the Irish government to restore growth and get government finances under control. "All in all the outlook is very positive," he said.
He also strenuously defended himself against criticism that, in his previous job as governor of the Bank of Italy, he had not done enough to prevent problems at Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which has required a [Euro]3.9 billion bailout by the Italian government.
Mr. Draghi was governor of the Italian central bank, responsible for bank supervision, during the period when Monte dei Paschi was getting in trouble several years ago. The former Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, with whom Mr. Draghi has tense relations, has tried to capitalize on the issue during the current Italian election campaign.
Mr. Draghi said the Bank of Italy had done all it could, and noted that it lacked the power to remove managers at Monte dei Paschi or to pursue criminal wrongdoing. "You should certainly discount much of what you hear and read as part of the regular noise that elections produce," Mr. Draghi said.

Abstract: The official, Jeremy C. Stein, a Fed governor, highlighted a surge in junk bond issues, the popularity of certain kinds of real estate investment trusts and shifts in bank balance sheets as areas the Fed is watching closely, although he played down any immediate threat to the financial system or the broader economy. "Overheating in the junk bond market might not be a major systemic concern in and of itself, but it might indicate that similar overheating forces were at play in other parts of credit markets, out of our range of vision," he said.

Full text:   Some financial markets are showing signs of overheated speculation as investors take larger risks in response to the persistence of low interest rates, a senior Federal Reserve official said in a speech on Thursday.
The official, Jeremy C. Stein, a Fed governor, highlighted a surge in junk bond issues, the popularity of certain kinds of real estate investment trusts and shifts in bank balance sheets as areas the Fed is watching closely, although he played down any immediate threat to the financial system or the broader economy.
"We are seeing a fairly significant pattern of reaching-for-yield behavior emerging in corporate credit," Mr. Stein said in St. Louis. He added, however, "It need not follow that this risk-taking has ominous systemic implications."
Mr. Stein gave no indication that Fed officials were contemplating any change in their aggressive efforts to hold down interest rates. Rather, he described the signs of overheating as an emerging trend that might require a response if it intensified over the next 18 months.
But the speech nonetheless underscored that the Fed regards investment bubbles, rather than inflation, as the most likely negative consequence of its push to reduce unemployment by stimulating economic growth.
Mr. Stein also challenged the general view among central bankers that excessive speculation was best addressed through targeted regulation like loan underwriting standards, and not broad changes in monetary policy. He urged an "open mind" about the use of higher interest rates and changes in the Fed's investment portfolio to curtail such speculation.
Such a shift could alter the mechanics of the Fed's eventual retreat from its long-running stimulus campaign, now aimed at maintaining control over inflation.
"By no means does today's speech signify a change in the Fed orthodoxy regarding the use of interest rates to address financial imbalances," wrote Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, after the speech. "But Stein is an emerging thought leader on the board, and his critique is likely to stimulate further debate."
The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and amassed almost $3 trillion of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. The caution of chastened investors is one factor restraining the economic recovery. By lowering the cost of borrowing and limiting the availability of safe investments, the central bank is both pushing and pulling investors to take larger risks.
But low rates can help to drive asset prices to unsustainable levels, as in the dot-com bubble that popped in 2000 and, of course, the recent housing bubble.
Critics of the Fed's policies have pointed to the junk bond market as an area where low interest rates are encouraging excessive speculation. Investors are eagerly providing money to companies and countries with low credit ratings, and they are accepting historically low junk bond interest rates in return. Junk bond issuance in the United States set a new annual record last year -- by the end of October.
"We must not ignore the possibility that the low-interest rate policy may be creating incentives that lead to future financial imbalances," Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, warned in a speech last month. Ms. George cited this same concern about financial destabilization in casting the sole dissenting vote at the most recent meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee.
The Fed has invested much time and effort in improving its ability to assess market conditions. Mr. Stein said Thursday, drawing on that work, that it did see evidence of overheating in the junk bond market. Relative prices remain around historical norms, but junk bonds make up a rising share of total corporate issuance, historically an indicator that investors are taking outsize risks.
And Mr. Stein said he took the junk bond data, along with similar patterns in other kinds of investments, as potential evidence of a broader trend.
"Overheating in the junk bond market might not be a major systemic concern in and of itself, but it might indicate that similar overheating forces were at play in other parts of credit markets, out of our range of vision," he said.
Changes in regulation offer a relatively precise way to address such problems. If mortgage lending standards loosen, the Fed can tighten those standards rather than raising interest rates and reducing other kinds of lending too.
But Mr. Stein said that regulators could fix only the problems they could find. Monetary policy "gets in all of the cracks," he said. "Changes in rates may reach into corners of the market that supervision and regulation cannot."
He also suggested that the Fed could reduce the profitability of certain kinds of investments by adjusting its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds.
While emphasizing that he was not seeking imminent changes in policy, Mr. Stein closed on a cautionary note: "Waiting for decisive proof of market overheating," he said, "may amount to an implicit policy of inaction."

Full text:   TEHRAN -- All over this city of 12 million people, high-rises are under construction, local engineers and Chinese contractors are rushing to finish a multilevel highway, and the streets are lined with billboards promoting the latest tablets and washing machines made by South Korean companies like Samsung and LG. Supermarkets are fully stocked, and it seems as if new restaurants and fast food joints are opening up every day, and never lacking for customers.
In short, you would not know that oil exports from Iran have dropped by a million barrels a day, and that the free fall in the currency has caused huge inflation -- a result of American- and European-led sanctions as well as economic mismanagement by the Iranian government. The West escalated the economic war another notch on Wednesday, imposing a new set of restrictions intended to force Iran into what amounts to a form of barter trade for oil, because payments for oil deliveries can no longer be sent to accounts inside Iran.
A senior Obama administration official called the latest step "a significant turning of the screw," repeating the administration's four-year argument that the mullahs here face a "stark choice" between holding on to their nuclear program and reviving their oil revenue, the country's economic lifeblood.
But there is little confidence among American officials in Washington -- and little evidence on the streets of Tehran -- that even newly stringent sanctions have much chance of forcing Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, into striking the deal that most Americans and Europeans, and even some Israelis, say could defuse the crisis.
The sanctions, while the source of constant complaint and morbid jokes, have not set off price riots or serious opposition to the Iranian government. In fact, the past year has not been all that bad, as Saeed Ranchian, 39, a shopkeeper peddling perfumes in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, said the other day while he was sipping tea and as droves of shoppers strolled by on newly paved sidewalks. Surrounded by colognes with elaborate foreign names like "Le Chevalier Primero," Mr. Ranchian admitted that with prices doubling and Iran's currency crashing, "you would expect people to buy less."
"But in Iran, when prices go up, people start buying more, fearing even higher prices," he said, adding with a laugh that the country's economy "has rules that no one understands."
Obama administration officials were disturbed by a new analysis, prepared for the president and his staff, that paints a picture of the supreme leader as so walled off from what is happening with his country's oil revenues that he is telling visitors that the sanctions are hurting the United States more than they are hurting Iran.
"The people may be suffering in Iran," one senior official involved in Iran strategy said last week, "but the supreme leader isn't, and he's the only one who counts."
The outlines of a nuclear deal have been clear for months: an Iranian agreement to limit the number of centrifuges that produce uranium, a cap on the amount of fuel in Iranian hands, and an agreement to ship its most potent stockpiles -- the stuff that can be quickly converted to bomb fuel -- out of the country. It would also have to agree to expose its history of nuclear work, including any on weapons technology, which it has refused to show international inspectors. In return, Iran would get an acknowledgment that it has a right to peaceful nuclear enrichment, and a gradual lifting of the sanctions. The Iranians have insisted that the sanctions be lifted first.
Instead, Iran announced last week that it would deploy a new generation of centrifuges, four to six times as powerful as the current generation. And while the United States, its European partners and Russia and China agreed to resume talks with the Iranians at the end of the month, administration officials have low expectations for the results.
"The Iranians didn't want to be in these talks, and it's hard to imagine any kind of a deal before their elections" in June, said one senior official, referring to the coming presidential vote. "Maybe if they had to put up with two more years of pain."
R. Nicholas Burns, who as under secretary of state helped push through many of the early sanctions resolutions against Iran during the Bush administration, said, "Even the tough Obama sanctions on their own are unlikely to work as Khamenei is dug in and obdurate." Mr. Burns added that for diplomacy to succeed "the U.S. must remain patient and commit to direct talks at the highest levels. But, ultimately both Obama and Netanyahu also need to make the threat of force more credible to Tehran. Combined with sanctions, this may be the most effective way to convince Iran to agree to a peaceful, negotiated settlement."
That does not necessarily mean the sanctions have failed to have any effect. All financial transactions have been cut off, making it extremely difficult for Iranians to make overseas payments. Europe for the first time is boycotting Iran's crude, which is costing the country $4 billion to $8 billion each month.
The existing sanctions on financial transactions have also forced Iran to engage in unfavorable oil-for-goods barter trade with its biggest customers, China and India. Chinese goods and medicine from India are prominently featured in stores and pharmacies across the country.
And now Iranian economic ingenuity will be tested again. Under the new crackdown, the United States is tightening the rules governing countries it has allowed to keep buying Iranian oil, as long as they show they are weaning themselves of it. From now on, when China, Japan, South Korea and India, among others, pay for oil deliveries, they will be required to put that money into a local bank account, which Iran can use only to buy goods within that country.
It is a way of keeping the money from ever being repatriated to Iran, even through third parties. Under American law, violators would be denied access to the United States banking system, though as a political matter it is difficult to imagine that ever being enforced. Meanwhile, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has asked Parliament to approve more cash handouts for most Iranians as a cushion for tougher times to come.
"Of course, the situation could be much better, people are stretching their financial limits," Mr. Ranchian said. "But for now, at least, they are coping."
The Iranian economy's resiliency could surprise Westerners. The way Iran's economy is structured, with strong links between state bodies and semiofficial and private businesses, helps shield the country, said Saeed Laylaz, an economist and columnist for the Sharq newspaper, which is critical of the government.
Mr. Laylaz, who spent several months in jail after the 2009 protests against President Ahmadinejad's re-election, explained how Iranian importers and exporters are constantly shifting between buying and selling products, making profits on exchange rates. Regional trade is up because of the low rial, he said. "Some are making a fortune these days."
Others are more pessimistic, saying the effects of the sanctions have still not been fully felt.
"If the sanctions, government mismanagement and inflation continue naturally in the future, we will encounter serious difficulties," said Mohsen Farshad Yekta, a professor of economics at the University of Economic Sciences in Tehran.
Right now, Mr. Obama's aides seem content with stalemate. They believe that Ayatollah Khamenei is proceeding with the nuclear program in the most incremental way, carefully avoiding going above, at least for now, a stockpile of more than 250 kilograms of medium-enriched uranium -- enough to make a single bomb. But to try to demonstrate its seriousness, the American military and two dozen allies are running an exercise this week in the Persian Gulf, practicing how to intercept banned technology and weapons heading into, or out of, Iranian ports.

Full text:   Snack cake aficionados rejoice, the Twinkie will live.
Its demise nearly came at the hands of corporate America's machinations. Its survival, however, depends on some of those same machinations. In the end, it was the extreme outcome of a liquidation in bankruptcy that made the 83-year-old brand salvageable.
The history of the cream-filled snack illustrates a number of the forces that have driven American capitalism over the last hundred years. Its first owner, Continental Baking Company, bought companies left and right in the 1920s, including the Taggart Baking Company, maker of Wonder bread, in 1925.
But the Twinkie was an in-house invention. It was created in 1930 by an executive working at Continental Baking who was looking for a product to sell after strawberry season ended, when the factory line for cream-filled strawberry shortcake sat empty. The yellowish, cream-filled Twinkie was a hit and the company quickly expanded.
Continental Baking continued its acquisition spree and by 1968 it was a motley assortment of baking brands that fed on America's tastes for sweet and easy food. It was then acquired by Harold Geneen's ITT, a conglomerate that sold not only Twinkies but also munitions. There, the brand sat for 16 years until Continental Baking was sold in 1984 for $475 million to Ralston Purina.
By then the baking business had entered a slow growth phase as inflation in baked goods, which had allowed the company continually to raise prices, subsided. Ralston Purina was unable to produce growth in the brands and ended up selling the bakery for about $400 million in 1995 to Interstate Bakeries.
Interstate Bakeries became the largest bakery in the country, but the sentiment around the deal was aptly expressed by a food industry analyst, who said at the time that Ralston Purina's sale "basically allows them to get rid of a dog."
Interstate Bakeries was itself a mongrel of many brands put together by serial acquisitions. Unfortunately, Interstate turned out to be better at acquiring companies than managing them. The brands had been passed around often and in the traveling it appears management never could get a more coherent vision for the company other than acquiring yet more unhealthy brands and leaving them to languish.
Then, at the turn of the millennium, the company was hit by a double blow: a taste for health and less carbohydrates among consumers and a botched attempt to put an additive in its breads to give them longer shelf life. You can tell that something is wrong with a food company when its strategy to save itself is to make its food last weeks longer.
It was also not the time to lack vision. The company's historically high labor and food costs could no longer be covered up by rising prices. Consumers demanded ever cheaper snack food prices.
The company entered bankruptcy in 2004. More than four years later, it emerged, now owned by Ripplewood, which put up $130 million to acquire it. It was then that the company rebranded itself as Hostess Brands.
Despite the company's cost reductions, and its lowering the employee head count by about 10,000, that was still not enough. The company had more than $800 million in debt coming out of bankruptcy, which was actually over $150 million more than it started with. Not to mention that it had spent $170 million on advisers during bankruptcy.
Indeed, people close to Hostess also say that Ripplewood's plan was yet another merger: to sell the company to the Sara Lee Corporation. But when Sara Lee sold its bakery operations to Grupo Bimbo, there was no Plan B.
The company filed for bankruptcy again in 2012. It lost $341 million in the previous fiscal year, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ. And management, which had gone through six chief executives in a decade, had been unable to execute a turnaround plan.
When the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union drew a line in the sand in November and said it would rather risk liquidation, it was over.
It was a principled position that the brands would do better with a fresh start and new management. Hostess filed a plan to liquidate the company and fire almost all its 18,000 employees.
The news spread that the Twinkie had finally met its match, along with Wonder bread, the Devil Dog and all the other products. It was then that the mechanisms of corporate America were put in motion to revive Hostess.
Hostess's investment banks went to work and lined up potential bidders. In fact, they didn't have to do much, as the announcement of the company's liquidation and the publicity that followed brought in more than 80 bidders in a few days. It also led to a quick run on Twinkies and other Hostess brands.
The interest came as a surprise to Hostess. Its executives - fearing that liquidation would destroy everything - had worked hard with the Teamsters union for a plan to save the company, only to be frustrated by the bakers union at the last minute. But liquidation has proved to be the Twinkie's savior.
Instead of trying to work out a compromise by reorganizing in bankruptcy, the company used the bankruptcy process to escape all its past burdensome debts. Freed of 394 union contracts, more than $2 billion in pension liabilities and any need to retain factories, the value of the Twinkie was reduced solely to what people were willing to pay for the brand. News of the Twinkies demise was the best thing that ever could have happened to the company.
Two private equity firms, C. Dean Metropoulos & Company and Apollo Global Management, have agreed to pay $410 million to buy the Hostess business, including Twinkies. And Flowers Foods has agreed to buy Wonder and Hostess's other bread businesses for $360 million. Even Drake's will survive; McKee Foods has agreed to pay $27.5 million for the business.
These are so-called stalking horse bids. In bankruptcy there is an open auction of the liquidated business, which in this case is expected to occur in bankruptcy court in February and March, when others will bid.
All told, it appears that the sale of Hostess may reap over a billion dollars, almost twice what the creditors initially expected if it had not been liquidated. In other words, the liquidation of Hostess has made the company worth more.
There's a lesson here. While corporate machinations and passing along brands can damage them, the clean bill of liquidation allowed corporate America to re-evaluate the Twinkie.
Sure, there will be future battles as Hostess's old unions struggle to have their employees rehired and new management tries to restart the company. And nothing can heal the wounds of the employees who have lost savings and pensions as well as jobs.
But the brands will now come under better management and, we can hope, more capable owners who can turn to reviving these businesses. In other words, while extreme finance was the cause of Hostess's demise, it may very well now be the Twinkie's savior.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- The Chinese government issued a long-awaited plan on Tuesday to narrow the gulf between rich and poor, offering broad vows to lift the incomes of workers and farmers and choke off corrupt wealth but few specific goals to rein in the nation's wide inequality.
The proposal was mired for months in an internal dispute about whether to aggressively scale back the rising salaries and benefits of some officials working for state-owned businesses and banks. The document that emerged from the discussions is filled with commitments to deal with that issue and other sources of public concern about the gap between the incomes of residents of dirt-poor villages and those living in privileged urban enclaves.
"There are some stark problems in income distribution that need urgent solving," said the plan, which was issued on the central government's Web site. "Chiefly, there remain quite large disparities in urban-rural development and incomes, income allocation is poorly ordered, and there are quite serious problems with invisible and unlawful sources of income." The plan was drafted by the National Development and Reform Commission and other central agencies.
The income distribution plan was an initiative promised by the departing Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, who leaves office in March. But it also underscores the extent to which the new generation of leaders under Xi Jinping has promised to expand state spending on health care, education and social welfare.
Mr. Xi, who was appointed Communist Party chief in November and is set to become state president in March, has said he wants to accelerate economic changes in the spirit of Deng Xiaoping, who initiated market-based liberalization from the late 1970s after decades of rule by Mao Zedong.
But in the process of introducing market forces in China, such changes have starkly widened income disparities, and Mr. Xi has said that the party must defuse widespread public dissatisfaction with poor public services and, above all, corruption.
The income plan, however, does not offer specific new initiatives to reduce corruption.
Beyond a general commitment to eliminate sources of illegal income, the plan says that officials must abide by already announced rules to report earnings and assets to superiors. Many experts, however, have said such rules are ineffective without public disclosure as well.
The new plan also says that by the end of 2015 state-owned corporations under central administration should increase the returns they pay the government by five percentage points, with the additional payments to be used for social welfare.
Average disposable annual income for Chinese urban residents in 2012 was the equivalent of about $4,000, an increase of 9.6 percent after taking inflation into account. Average rural net income was just under $1,300 per person, a rise of 10.7 percent after adjusting for inflation, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics announced in January.
The bureau also said that in 2012 China's Gini coefficient, a widely used index of income inequality, was 0.474, slightly higher than levels of inequality in the United States, where income disparity now stands as one of the highest among advanced industrial nations. But some economists have said China's measure is actually much higher, when illicit and poorly reported sources of wealth are taken into account.
"Deepening reform of the income distribution system is an extremely arduous and complex task of systemic engineering," the new plan says. "It cannot be achieved in one step."

Full text:   UNLESS lawmakers act by March 1, the budget sequestration process will start cutting government spending automatically -- reductions that would amount to $1.2 trillion by 2021. Congress and the White House agreed in 2011 to the sequestration, and many people see it as a kind of political gimmick.
But I believe that it can turn out to be a very good thing -- and that most of these cuts should proceed on schedule, though with some restructuring along the way.
One common argument against letting this process run its course is a Keynesian claim -- namely, that cuts or slowdowns in government spending can throw an economy into recession by lowering total demand for goods and services. Nonetheless, spending cuts of the right kind can help an economy.
Half of the sequestration would apply to the military budget, an area where most cuts would probably enhance rather than damage future growth. Reducing the defense budget by about $55 billion a year, the sum at stake, would most likely mean fewer engineers and scientists inventing weaponry and more of them producing for consumers.
In the short run, lower military spending would lower gross domestic product, because the workers and resources in those areas wouldn't be immediately re-employed. Still, that wouldn't mean lower living standards for ordinary Americans, because most military spending does not provide us with direct private consumption.
To be sure, lower military spending might bring future problems, like an erosion of the nation's long-term global influence. But then we are back to standard foreign policy questions about how much to spend on the military -- and the Keynesian argument is effectively off the table.
On a practical note, the military cuts would have to be defined relative to a baseline, which already specifies spending increases. So the "cuts" in the sequestration would still lead to higher nominal military spending and roughly flat inflation-adjusted spending across the next 10 years. That is hardly unilateral disarmament, given that the United States accounts for about half of global military spending. And in a time when some belt-tightening will undoubtedly be required, that seems a manageable degree of restraint.
The other half of sequestration would apply to domestic discretionary spending, where the Keynesian argument against spending cuts has more force.
But here, too, much of the affected spending should be cut anyhow. Farm support programs would be a major target, and most economists agree that those payments should be abolished or pared back significantly. Regulatory agencies would also lose funds, but instead of across-the-board cuts, we could give these agencies the choice of cutting their least valuable programs -- or, for that matter, we could cut farm subsidies even further.
Of course, much discretionary spending goes toward useful projects -- building or repairing roads, for example, or research toward medical innovation. Limiting these investments would bring the Keynesian argument into play, and perhaps harm productivity, too. So we should look to substitute some areas for others -- and turn to Keynesian macroeconomics for guidance.
THE Keynesian argument suggests that spending cuts do the least harm in economic sectors where demand is high relative to supply. Thus, the obvious candidate for the domestic economy is health care, and the sequestration would cut many Medicare reimbursement rates by 2 percent. We could go ahead with those cuts or even deepen them, because America has had significant health care cost inflation for decades.
We already have huge demand in our health care system, along with a corresponding shortage of doctors. And the coverage extension in the Affordable Care Act will add to the strain. In this setting, cutting Medicare reimbursement rates wouldn't result in fewer health care services over all. Yes, doctors might be less keen to serve Medicare patients but might be more available for others, including the poor and the young. In the long run, the improved access for those groups would yield much return on investment, and would move the health care system closer to many of the European models.
In any case, these Medicare cuts would be unlikely to bring a macroeconomic debacle, and would ease long-term fiscal pressures. We could address the shortage of doctors by removing some barriers to entry into the profession, and, in possible new legislation for immigration, easing the way for more medical professionals to come to the United States.
Most generally, there is an issue of global investor perceptions. As the credit rating agencies have noted, some investors wonder whether spending cuts of any kind are possible in the nation's current political environment. And even if the economic recovery is causing budget deficits to shrink, there are plenty of negative signals about our political ability to address longer-term fiscal concerns, which will become more severe as the population ages.
Simply accepting the automatic spending cuts of the sequestration, without modification, could look like more dysfunctional politics, too. Though many of the reductions have merit, others need orderly renegotiation so the resulting cuts aren't just necessary acts of fiscal restraint, but also net pluses for the economy.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWHEN you see a car being driven firmly within its lane and well under the speed limit, there's nothing to worry about.
Or is there?
If you're David A. Rosenberg, the glass-half-empty economist, there most certainly is. He says the world economy is like that car. And where others see stability and recovery, he sees "a car being driven by a drunk, lurching from side to side on the road, narrowly avoiding the ditches each time."
At this particular moment, he says, the car happens to be in the middle of the road. But he can't help but ask, "Is that because the driver has sobered up, or is it because the car is just passing through the middle on its way to the ditch on the other side?"
Mr. Rosenberg isn't certain of the answer. But despite the cheer pervading the stock market and the relatively upbeat perspective of most economists, he says he isn't convinced that the car will remain safely out of those ditches.
Formerly the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, and now proudly back in his native Canada as chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto, Mr. Rosenberg writes a market newsletter that is always provocative, often cantankerous and frequently out of step with the Wall Street consensus. He has been called a "permabear," a label that he says is exaggerated but not entirely without merit.
"I'd say I'm as pragmatic as possible and not locked into one position," he says, "but I do understand that I have a much better record forecasting rain than in predicting the return of sunshine."
His record bears that out. Mr. Rosenberg correctly called the start of the last two recessions. But he was late in recognizing the strength of what has become a long bull market. In May 2009, when the stock market was in an early stage of its climb, his worries about the economy made him resolutely bearish on stocks. "I'd lock in my gains right now," he told me then.
But his clients have generally done very well if they've followed his cautious advice, which called for buying fixed-income securities early in the bond market's long boom. His mantra is "safety and income at a reasonable price."
For a gimlet-eyed perspective on the current stock market joy, I called him last week and asked him what, exactly, has been propelling shares higher.
His answer, in two words, was "the Fed" -- the Federal Reserve and its monthly $85 billion purchases of bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which are being piled on top of a balance sheet that swelled to a gargantuan $3 trillion last week.
Other analysts have pointed to a recent surge in stock mutual fund purchases by individuals, as opposed to the big institutional investors like pension funds, endowments and other money managers. The earnings season has been reasonably strong, and, at least in recent weeks, there has been no outright global economic disaster emanating from Washington, the euro zone, Tokyo or the oil fields of the Middle East.
These factors are all relevant, he allows, but they pale next to the direct and powerful relationship between the growth of the Fed's balance sheet and the stock market.
The Fed's control of short-term interest rates has always had a major impact on the markets, and the adage "Don't fight the Fed" is a bit of Wall Street wisdom that has stood up for decades. But since the Fed lowered its benchmark Fed funds rate to near zero in December 2008, short-term rates have ceased to be a meaningful indicator because they cannot be lowered any further.
Instead, to provide further monetary stimulus to the economy, the Fed has embarked on a series of quantitative-easing measures -- direct purchases of financial assets.
Mr. Rosenberg says his calculations show that there is now an 85 percent correlation between the growth of that Fed balance sheet and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. If that relationship continues -- and he's not certain that it will -- the market could keep rallying, though he says he believes it's due for a correction. On Wednesday, the Fed reiterated its pledge to keep interest rates low and to keep making asset purchases for what effectively will be many months to come.
The Fed's expansionary policies are contingent on weakness in the labor market and the overall economy. Well, the unemployment rate in January rose to 7.9 percent, the Labor Department announced on Friday. And the Fed says that as long as inflation is below 2.5 percent -- and it is well below that level now -- and unemployment is above 6.5 percent, it will keep rates ultralow. In addition, the gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the last quarter of 2012, the first decline recorded since 2009.
MR. ROSENBERG says he does not believe that we are in a recession now but that we are very close to one. "Anemic growth is my baseline scenario," he says. A shock could undermine the economy. And there is no assurance, of course, that the Fed can keep propping up equity asset prices.
So he advises that for diversification alone, investors should keep holding onto bonds and other carefully selected fixed-income instruments; in addition, there is a great likelihood that inflation will stay low and longer-term rates will be constrained, which would be beneficial for fixed-income prices.
He recommends playing the equity markets cautiously by seeking high-dividend-paying stocks of well-managed companies. At the moment, he says, those include Blackstone, the asset manager, and Merck, the drug maker, among United States stocks. And he suggests that United States citizens hedge their bets by keeping 20 percent of their assets in Canada, which, he says, is fiscally sound and is likely to have higher growth and lower inflation than its southern neighbor. He advises holding Brookfield Infrastructure, which owns and manages utilities, energy and timber assets, and Crescent Point Energy, an oil and gas exploration company.
Above all else, he says, preserve your assets and your safety. Watch out for reckless behavior in the economy as well as on the roads. You never know what is about to come hurtling your way.
Correction: February 10, 2013, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Strategies column last Sunday, about the views of the Canadian economist David A. Rosenberg on the world economy, erroneously included one company on a short list of dividend-paying United States stocks. Yahoo's stock does not currently pay a dividend.

Abstract: The mutual fund giant Vanguard advises, "Research shows that your asset mix -- how you spread your money across stocks, bonds and cash -- has a far greater impact on long-term returns than your individual investments." For many years, the rule of thumb for most long-term investors was "60/40," a 60 percent allocation to stocks and 40 percent to bonds. Besides having the virtue of simplicity, less volatile and lower-return bonds were meant to smooth out the ups and downs of the riskier stock market while giving investors some of the greater possible gains of stocks.

Full text:   Squeezed by historically low interest rates, a wide range of investors -- from retirees living on fixed incomes to huge endowments and pension funds trying to meet budgets -- are trying to figure out how to generate income.
Some Duke University undergraduates think they have the answer.
Business and economics programs at American colleges and universities have long sponsored stock- and other asset-picking contests for their students. But last semester, faced with the current ultralow interest rate environment, Duke's undergraduate economics department ran a competition in asset allocation for the first time. Students had to decide what percentage of assets to put in fixed-income investments and what percentage to invest in other categories. The asset management firm BlackRock was a co-sponsor of the contest, which was open to any Duke sophomore or junior.
"Where is someone supposed to get yield these days?" said Emma B. Rasiel, an associate professor of economics. "That's what got us thinking."
It's a pressing question for nearly every investor, and has left even professional financial advisers scratching their heads. The United States is now in the fifth year of a low interest rate environment. Ten-year Treasuries, the benchmark United States interest rate, yielded 5 percent in July 2007, just before the recession began. This week, the rate was below 2 percent, and last July, 10-year rates were the lowest ever recorded. This week, the one-month Treasury bill, the lowest-risk bond investment because of its short duration, was yielding practically nothing: 0.04 percent.
How much of their assets to allocate to bonds and other categories may well be the most important decision investors make. The mutual fund giant Vanguard advises, "Research shows that your asset mix -- how you spread your money across stocks, bonds and cash -- has a far greater impact on long-term returns than your individual investments."
For many years, the rule of thumb for most long-term investors was "60/40," a 60 percent allocation to stocks and 40 percent to bonds. Besides having the virtue of simplicity, less volatile and lower-return bonds were meant to smooth out the ups and downs of the riskier stock market while giving investors some of the greater possible gains of stocks. Vanguard estimates that an investor with a 60/40 allocation can expect an average annual return of 8.6 percent, based on data going back to 1926. That allocation resulted in a decline in 21 of the next 86 years. In the worst year, 1931, it resulted in a drop of 26.6 percent, while in the best year, 1933, it produced a gain of 36.7 percent.
By comparison, a 100 percent allocation to stocks produced an average annual gain of 9.9 percent, with a decline in 25 of the 86 years and much greater volatility. A 100 percent allocation to bonds resulted in an average gain of 5.6 percent, with a decline in just 13 of the 86 years.
But those are long-term averages. The results can vary substantially depending on the starting point. In the decade ending in 2009, stocks had average annualized returns of negative 3 percent and lagged bond returns by more than 9 percent, a record disparity, according to T. Rowe Price.
Hardly anyone expects those high bond returns now. Despite the paltry yields, fixed-income investors have been cushioned for the last few years by falling interest rates, which allowed the value of their bonds to increase as yields declined. (Bond prices move inversely to interest rates.) But with short-term rates now near zero and longer-term rates still at historical lows, it's almost impossible for rates to decline any further. Indeed, they have been creeping up in recent months. And if and when rates rise more substantially, bond investors will be stuck with not only slim yields, but also losses on their principal.
Given this, should investors abandon the tried-and-true 60/40 approach and move more aggressively into stocks?
"The traditional 60/40 approach to building a portfolio is on the way out," said Michael Fredericks, head of retail asset allocation for BlackRock and lead portfolio manager for the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund. It is being replaced, he said, by "tactical" asset allocation, a strategy in which investors change their allocation based on the current pricing of asset classes.
If bonds are overpriced, as many now believe, and stocks are underpriced, at least relative to other assets, then the allocation should shift toward stocks. "We're not telling clients to sell all their bonds," Mr. Fredericks said. "They do balance out the riskier assets in a portfolio. But most investors need to consider putting more in stocks."
In his own Multi-Asset Income Fund, which has traditionally focused on fixed-income assets, Mr. Fredericks said he had reduced the amount invested in high-yield bonds and moved into stocks that pay high dividends, using an options strategy to lock in gains and protect against market drops. The fund had more than 25 percent of its assets in equities at the end of the year, with the remainder in various forms of fixed income. Last year, it returned just over 13 percent.
For the Duke contest, the students were asked to design a portfolio for an investor who was expecting to retire or begin withdrawing assets around 2020, just seven years away. That time frame ordinarily calls for a conservative -- that is, bond- and cash-oriented -- allocation to minimize volatility and the potential for loss. A traditional rule of thumb for older investors is that the percentage of assets in bonds should equal their age. So, 70-year-olds should have 70 percent of their assets in bonds.
Alex Kim, a Duke junior from New Zealand majoring in economics, told me that he and his teammates -- Yuefeng Du and Yuci Zhang -- faced the same quandary as most investors: how to generate income while minimizing risk and preserving assets for retirement. They examined model portfolios from Fidelity, Vanguard and BlackRock. "We looked at historical returns for each asset class and then adjusted those for current market conditions," Mr. Kim said.
As the members of the team formulated their strategy last fall, they shared the concerns of many experts that bonds were overvalued. But they saw little risk in the short term to principal, given the Federal Reserve's public commitment to keep interest rates low until the economy improves. At the same time, they worried that the Fed's easy money policy would lead to inflation, which has traditionally eroded fixed-income returns.
They were bullish on United States stocks, especially those of large companies, based on their predictions of a continuing recovery in housing, rising consumer confidence, strong retail sales and the continuing impact of the Fed's quantitative easing program. They were also optimistic that Congress would avoid the so-called fiscal cliff and other threatened political calamities. But they were pessimistic about Europe and emerging markets, given the euro zone crisis and what they saw as slowing growth in countries like China and Brazil.
The team's contest entry called for allocating 43 percent to United States stocks -- 30.3 percent to a Russell 2000 index fund and 12.7 percent to a Russell 2000 fund that invests in midsize companies. They made no allocation to international stocks. Like more traditional models, they maintained a large allocation to fixed income, but weighted it heavily toward Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, whose yields rise with inflation. They allocated 32.1 percent to TIPS and 24.9 percent to an aggregate bond fund.
The result was a 9.7 percent projected annual return, with less volatility than the model funds they examined. The team ran projected returns for cases including both bull and bear markets, and their allocation outperformed the BlackRock model "in all scenarios," Mr. Kim said.
Professor Rasiel winnowed the field of more than 30 entrants to 10 finalists, who presented their strategies to BlackRock executives in late November. The executives announced the winner a few weeks later: Mr. Kim's team. BlackRock praised the team's research, its modeling in bull and bear market assumptions and its "strong understanding of macroeconomic drivers."
The prize was an interview and a shot at an internship at BlackRock this summer. Mr. Kim is waiting to hear if he got one, and said he was aiming for a career in investment banking.
The runner-up team embraced a similar strategy to Mr. Kim's team, but was even more concerned about inflation. It put 68.2 percent of its assets into TIPS. It was also bullish on riskier equities from emerging markets, with a 16 percent allocation. The remainder was in United States equities. The projected annualized rate of return was 10 percent, with slightly lower projected volatility than the winning entry.
Before investors rush to replicate either approach in their own portfolios, they might want to consider that these are college undergraduates, however talented and motivated they may be. It's much too early to assess the winning team's results, but so far they have been right about United States stocks: the market has rallied strongly since they made their submission.
But projections and models are only as good as the underlying assumptions. Given the heavy allocation to currently low-yielding TIPS, the students are likely to outperform more traditional portfolios only if inflation picks up in the next seven years. Mr. Kim conceded that his team's projected return for TIPS (5.66 percent) and bonds (5.91 percent) "may be optimistic, given current market conditions."
Financial advisers stress that all asset allocation plans need to be tailored to each investor's circumstances and risk tolerance. Faced with the same low interest rate environment, professional asset allocators with the same time horizon as the Duke contestants have emphasized stocks over bonds.
The Fidelity Freedom 2020 Fund, for example, had almost 56 percent of its assets in stocks at the end of last year, including more than 15 percent in international equities. Only 8 percent was in TIPS. Vanguard's Target Retirement 2020 Fund was even more weighted toward stocks, with an allocation of just under 64 percent, nearly 20 percent of which was in international equities.
After all the models and projections, they've ended up pretty close to the old 60/40 approach.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- In the five months since the Federal Reserve started a campaign to increase growth and reduce unemployment, the economy has slowed and unemployment has increased.
The Labor Department said on Friday that the jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent last month, up from 7.8 percent in December, in the latest evidence that the economy still is not growing fast enough to repair the damage of a recession that ended in 2009.
Some economists found the disappointing data an indication the Fed had reached the limit of its powers, or at least of prudent action. But there is evidence that the Fed is not trying as hard as it could to stimulate growth: it is allowing inflation to fall well below the 2 percent pace it considers most healthy.
Inflation, unlike job creation, is something the Fed can control with some precision. Higher inflation could accelerate economic growth and job creation by encouraging people to spend more and make riskier investments.
Yet annualized inflation fell to 1.3 percent in December, and asset prices reflect an expectation that the pace will remain well below 2 percent in the next decade.
"By their own framework, they're not doing enough," said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan. "They said that they were going to expand the economy and keep inflation around 2 percent, and they just haven't done it."
The rest of the government is making that task more difficult. Federal spending cuts, tax increases and the prospect of further cuts March 1 are hurting growth. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has warned repeatedly that monetary policy cannot offset such fiscal austerity.
And it is likely that the latest economic data does not reflect the full impact of the Fed's efforts. Despite the rise in unemployment, job creation has increased in recent months, consumer spending has strengthened and the housing market is healing. Partly because monetary policy is slow-acting, most forecasters expect modest growth this year.
But the Fed also is acting with a clear measure of restraint. Mr. Bernanke and other officials have made clear that they believe the central bank could do more to increase the pace of inflation and bolster growth and job creation. They simply are not persuaded that the benefits outweigh the potential costs -- in particular, the risk that their efforts will distort asset prices and seed future financial crises.
The Fed is constrained in part because it already has done so much. The central bank has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, and it has accumulated almost $3 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to push down long-term rates and encourage riskier investments.
Under its newest effort, announced in September and extended in December, it will increase its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds by $85 billion a month until the job market improves. The Fed also said that it planned to hold short-term rates near zero even longer, at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent.
In normal times, the Fed would respond to flagging inflation and growth by cutting interest rates. At present, it could still increase the scale of its asset purchases. The two policies work in a similar way, stimulating economic activity by reducing borrowing costs and encouraging risk-taking. But asset purchases are a less direct method to reduce rates, and the available evidence suggests that the effect is less powerful.
The Fed's holdings of mortgage bonds and Treasuries also are growing so large that it could begin to distort pricing in those markets, and some transactions could be disrupted by a dearth of safe assets. Some Fed officials are concerned that asset prices for farmland, junk bonds and other risky assets are being pushed to unsustainable levels. As a result, Mr. Bernanke has said, the Fed is doing less than it otherwise would.
"We have to pay very close attention to the costs and the risks and the efficacy of these nonstandard policies as well as the potential economic benefits," Mr. Bernanke said last month, in response to a question about the low pace of inflation. "Economics tells you when something is more costly, you do a little bit less of it."
The Fed to some extent may be a prisoner of its own success in persuading investors over the last three decades that it was determined to keep inflation below 2 percent. It said in December that it would let expected inflation in the next two to three years rise as high as 2.5 percent. But expectations have not budged.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland calculated in a January report that average expected inflation over the next decade was just 1.48 percent per year.
Fed officials themselves generally expect somewhat higher inflation, but their most recent predictions, published in January, still show that none of the 19 policy makers expected inflation to exceed 2 percent over the next two years.
"It's been harder to create expected inflation than I thought before this crisis," said Mark Thoma, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon. "Probably because of their own credibility, nobody believes them even if they say it."
But Professor Thoma and others also note that the Fed could be trying harder. Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have been careful to say that they will tolerate inflation expectations above 2 percent while also insisting that it is not a Fed goal to push expectations above 2 percent.
At the meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee last week, none of the 12 voting members supported stronger action to increase inflation or growth. One member voted in opposition to continuing the existing efforts.
"They are doing $85 billion a month in purchases. Well, there's a number that's twice as large as 85 and twice as large as that," said Professor Wolfers. "It's clear that they can do more. But they keep saying one thing and doing another."
That reluctance ultimately reflects the enduring conviction of many Fed officials that their most important responsibility is maintaining stable inflation in the long run.
When inflation rises unpredictably, it disrupts economic activity by making it impossible for companies to tell the difference between increased demand for their products and generally higher prices. High inflation also taxes wealth, rewarding borrowers at the expense of lenders by eroding the value of fixed payments.
"We, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation, which has proved extremely valuable in that we've been able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four, five years," Mr. Bernanke said last year, when asked why the Fed would not push inflation higher to hasten the pace of the economic recovery. "To risk that asset for what I think would be quite tentative and perhaps doubtful gains on the real side would be, I think, an unwise thing to do."

Full text:   WASHINGTON
MUCH is being written about the preposterously high cost of college. The median inflation-adjusted household income fell by 7 percent between 2006 and 2011, while the average real tuition at public four-year colleges increased over that period by over 18 percent. Meanwhile, the average tuition for just one year at a four-year private university in 2011 was almost $33,000, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. College tuition has increased at twice the rate of health care costs over the past 25 years.
Ballooning student loan debt, an impending college bubble, and a return on the bachelor's degree that is flat or falling: all these things scream out for entrepreneurial solutions.
One idea gaining currency is the $10,000 college degree -- the so-called 10K-B.A. -- which apparently was inspired by a challenge to educators from Bill Gates, and has recently led to efforts to make it a reality by governors in Texas, Florida and Wisconsin, as well as by a state assemblyman in California.
Most 10K-B.A. proposals rethink the costliest part of higher education -- the traditional classroom teaching. Predictably, this means a reliance on online and distance-learning alternatives. And just as predictably, this has stimulated antibodies to unconventional modes of learning. Some critics see it as an invitation to charlatans and diploma mills. Even supporters often suggest that this is just an idea to give poor people marginally better life opportunities.
As Darryl Tippens, the provost of Pepperdine University, recently put it, "No PowerPoint presentation or elegant online lecture can make up for the surprise, the frisson, the spontaneous give-and-take of a spirited, open-ended dialogue with another person." And what happens when you excise those frissons? In the words of the president of one university faculty association, "You're going to be awarding degrees that are worthless to people."
I disagree. I possess a 10K-B.A., which I got way back in 1994. And it was the most important intellectual and career move I ever made.
After high school, I spent an unedifying year in college. The year culminated in money problems, considerably less than a year of credits, and a joint decision with the school that I should pursue my happiness elsewhere. Next came what my parents affectionately called my "gap decade," during which time I made my living as a musician. By my late 20s I was ready to return to school. But I was living in Spain, had a thin bank account, and no desire to start my family with a mountain of student loans.
Fortunately, there was a solution -- an institution called Thomas Edison State College in Trenton, N.J. This is a virtual college with no residence requirements. It banks credits acquired through inexpensive correspondence courses from any accredited college or university in America.
I took classes by mail from the University of Washington, the University of Wyoming, and other schools with the lowest-priced correspondence courses I could find. My degree required the same number of credits and type of classes that any student at a traditional university would take. I took the same exams (proctored at local libraries and graded by graduate students) as in-person students. But I never met a teacher, never sat in a classroom, and to this day have never laid eyes on my beloved alma mater.
And the whole degree, including the third-hand books and a sticker for the car, cost me about $10,000 in today's dollars.
Now living back in the United States, I followed the 10K-B.A. with a 5K-M.A. at a local university while working full time, and then endured the standard penury of being a full-time doctoral fellow in a residential Ph.D. program. The final tally for a guy in his 30s supporting a family: three degrees, zero debt.
Did I earn a worthless degree? Hardly. My undergraduate years may have been bereft of frissons, but I wound up with a career as a tenured professor at Syracuse University, a traditional university. I am now the president of a Washington research organization.
Not surprisingly, my college experience has occasionally been the target of ridicule. It is true that I am no Harvard Man. But I can say with full confidence that my 10K-B.A. is what made higher education possible for me, and it changed the course of my life. More people should have this opportunity, in a society that is suffering from falling economic and social mobility.
The 10K-B.A. is exactly the kind of innovation we would expect in an industry that is showing every indication of a bubble that is about to burst, as Thomas K. Lindsay of the Texas Public Policy Foundation shows in a new report titled, "Anatomy of a Revolution? The Rise of the $10,000 Bachelor's Degree." When tuition skyrockets and returns on education stagnate, we can expect a flight to value, especially by people who can least afford to ride the bubble, and who have no choice but to make a cost-effective college investment.
In the end, however, the case for the 10K-B.A. is primarily moral, not financial. The entrepreneurs who see a way for millions to go to college affordably are the ones who understand the American dream. That dream is the opportunity to build a life through earned success. That starts with education.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDOn average, college and university endowments' investments lost 0.3 percent in the last fiscal year, a sharp drop from the average return of 19.2 percent in fiscal 2011, according to a study by the Commonfund Institute and the National Association of College and University Business Officers, known as Nacubo.
The returns were dragged down mostly by the dismal performance of international equities, whose returns declined by 11.9 percent, attributable in good part to the economic turmoil in Europe and the slowdown in China. Domestic stocks had an average return of 2 percent, and fixed-income assets 6.8 percent.
The study, based on data from 831 American colleges and universities with a total of more than $400 billion in endowment assets, showed more positive long-term results. Preliminary results were released in late October.
"Over the last 10 years, the average rate of return was 6.2 percent," said John D. Walda, the president of Nacubo. "That's a good number when you compare it with various indices."
In the fiscal year that ended in June 2011, the average 10-year return was 5.6 percent.
The study, which includes large and small institutions, public and private, found that those with the largest endowments had the greatest returns last year. Among universities with endowments greater than $1 billion, the average return was 0.8 percent. Those with endowments of $25 million to $500 million had negative returns, and those with endowments under $25 million had a return of 0.3 percent.
Altogether, 71 institutions have endowments greater than $1 billion, and 145 have more than $500 million.
The colleges and universities in the study spent an average of 4.2 percent of their assets last year to support their operations, down from 4.6 percent the previous year. But while the spending rate had declined somewhat, the average dollars spent per institution grew by about 7 percent. Most colleges and universities have a policy of spending 4 percent to 5 percent of their average endowment value over the previous three years, so the sharp rises in endowment values in 2010 and 2011 increased the amount paid out last year.
The institutions with the largest endowments, which get a significant portion of their operating budgets from endowment spending, spent an average of 4.7 percent last year. The institutions with the smallest endowments spent slightly under 4 percent.
"The long-term goal of most endowments is to exist in perpetuity and grow with the rate of inflation," said Verne O. Sedlacek, president of Commonfund.
To do that while paying out 4 percent to 5 percent a year, he said, would require annual returns of at least 8 percent, given that the higher education price index has been rising about 3.8 percent a year over the last decade. "Universities are still not back to where they need to be," Mr. Sedlacek said.
Correction: February 6, 2013, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about a study of university endowments misstated the change in their investment returns. On average, college and university endowments lost 0.3 percent in the fiscal year ending in June, a sharp drop from the average gain of 19.2 percent in the 2011 fiscal year; the returns on endowments did not decline by 0.3 percent.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDLaw school applications are headed for a 30-year low, reflecting increased concern over soaring tuition, crushing student debt and diminishing prospects of lucrative employment upon graduation.
As of this month, there were 30,000 applicants to law schools for the fall, a 20 percent decrease from the same time last year and a 38 percent decline from 2010, according to the Law School Admission Council. Of some 200 law schools nationwide, only 4 have seen increases in applications this year. In 2004 there were 100,000 applicants to law schools; this year there are likely to be 54,000.
Such startling numbers have plunged law school administrations into soul-searching debate about the future of legal education and the profession over all.
"We are going through a revolution in law with a time bomb on our admissions books," said William D. Henderson, a professor of law at Indiana University, who has written extensively on the issue. "Thirty years ago if you were looking to get on the escalator to upward mobility, you went to business or law school. Today, the law school escalator is broken."
Responding to the new environment, schools are planning cutbacks and accepting students they would not have admitted before.
A few schools, like the Vermont Law School, have started layoffs and buyouts of staff. Others, like at the University of Illinois, have offered across-the-board tuition discounts to keep up enrollments. Brian Leiter of the University of Chicago Law School, who runs a blog on the topic, said he expected as many as 10 schools to close over the coming decade, and half to three-quarters of all schools to reduce class size, faculty and staff.
After the normal dropout of some applicants, the number of those matriculating in the fall will be about 38,000, the lowest since 1977, when there were two dozen fewer law schools, according to Brian Z. Tamanaha of Washington University Law School, the author of "Failing Law Schools."
The drop in applications is widely viewed as directly linked to perceptions of the declining job market. Many of the reasons that law jobs are disappearing are similar to those for disruptions in other knowledge-based professions, namely the growth of the Internet. Research is faster and easier, requiring fewer lawyers, and is being outsourced to less expensive locales, including West Virginia and overseas.
In addition, legal forms are now available online and require training well below a lawyer's to fill them out.
In recent years there has also been publicity about the debt load and declining job prospects for law graduates, especially of schools that do not generally provide employees to elite firms in major cities. Last spring, the American Bar Association released a study showing that within nine months of graduation in 2011, only 55 percent of those who finished law school found full-time jobs that required passage of the bar exam.
"Students are doing the math," said Michelle J. Anderson, dean of the City University of New York School of Law. "Most law schools are too expensive, the debt coming out is too high and the prospect of attaining a six-figure-income job is limited."
Mr. Tamanaha of Washington University said the rise in tuition and debt was central to the decrease in applications. In 2001, he said, the average tuition for private law school was $23,000; in 2012 it was $40,500 (for public law schools the figures were $8,500 and $23,600). He said that 90 percent of law students finance their education by taking on debt. And among private law school graduates, the average debt in 2001 was $70,000; in 2011 it was $125,000.
"We have been sharply increasing tuition during a low-inflation period," he said of law schools collectively, noting that a year at a New York City law school can run to more than $80,000 including lodging and food. "And we have been maximizing our revenue. There is no other way to describe it. We will continue to need lawyers, but we need to bring the price down."
Some argue that the drop is an indictment of the legal training itself -- a failure to keep up with the profession's needs.
"We have a significant mismatch between demand and supply," said Gillian K. Hadfield, professor of law and economics at the University of Southern California. "It's not a problem of producing too many lawyers. Actually, we have an exploding demand for both ordinary folk lawyers and big corporate ones."
She said that, given the structure of the legal profession, it was hard to make a living dealing with matters like mortgage and divorce, and that big corporations were dissatisfied with what they see as the overly academic training at elite law schools.
The drop in law school applications is unlike what is happening in almost any other graduate or professional training, except perhaps to veterinarians. Medical school applications have been rising steadily for the past decade.
Debra W. Stewart, president of the Council of Graduate Schools, said first-time enrollments to master of business degree programs were steady -- a 0.8 percent increase among Americans in 2011 after a decade of substantial growth. But growth in first-time foreign student enrollments -- 13 percent over the same period -- made up the difference, something from which law schools cannot benefit, since foreigners have less interest in American legal training.
In the legal academy, there has been discussion about how to make training less costly and more relevant, with special emphasis on the last year of law school. A number of schools, including elite ones like Stanford, have increased their attention to clinics, where students get hands-on training. Northeastern Law School in Boston, which has long emphasized in-the-field training, has had one of the smallest decreases in its applicant pool this year, according to Jeremy R. Paul, the new dean.
There is also discussion about permitting students to take the bar after only two years rather than three, a decision that would have to be made by the highest officials of a state court system. In New York, the proposal is under active consideration largely because of a desire to reduce student debt.
Some, including Professor Hadfield of the University of Southern California, have called for one- or two-year training programs to create nonlawyer specialists for many tasks currently done by lawyers. Whether or not such changes occur, for now the decline is creating what many see as a cultural shift.
"In the '80s and '90s, a liberal arts graduate who didn't know what to do went to law school," Professor Henderson of Indiana said. "Now you get $120,000 in debt and a default plan of last resort whose value is just too speculative. Students are voting with their feet. There are going to be massive layoffs in law schools this fall. We won't have the bodies we need to meet the payroll."
Correction: February 1, 2013, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the steady decrease in law school applications misidentified the employees at the Vermont Law School who could face layoffs and buyouts. They are staff members, not professors.

Full text:   A report on growth served as a reminder on Wednesday that the American economy remained a long way from being healed, and it put the brakes on a January rally that pushed stocks close to record levels.
Stocks started the day lower after a report showed that the economy had unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter, leading the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its biggest drop of the year.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 44 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 13,910.42, logging only its second decline in nine days. The S.& P. fell 6 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,501.96, its biggest decline since Dec. 28. The Nasdaq composite fell 11 points to 3,142.31.
The Commerce Department report covered the quarter from October through December, when the economy was hurt by the biggest cut in military spending in 40 years, fewer exports and sluggish growth in company stockpiles.
The Federal Reserve acknowledged that the economy was still struggling to regain momentum in a statement Wednesday afternoon after its two-day meeting. The Fed said that growth had "paused in recent months."
The central bank took no new action and said it would continue spending on bonds as part of its plan to keep borrowing costs low to spur growth.
"The Fed didn't really say anything out of the ordinary, so you got the reaction you should've had in the morning," said Joseph Saluzzi, a co-founder of the brokerage firm Themis Trading. "When you've spent this much money trying to prop up an economy and you still come up with a negative print, that's bad news."
Still, stocks remain on track for a great January over all.
The Dow Jones average has surged 6.2 percent since the start of the year, climbing close to 14,000 and within touching distance of its record level. The S.& P. 500 has gained 5.3 percent this month, close to its highest level in more than five years. Investors bought stocks after lawmakers reached a deal on taxes and spending and on optimism the American housing market was recovering and the jobs market was slowly getting better.
United States gross domestic product, the volume of all goods and services produced, contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the growth report showed, a sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent growth rate for the quarter from July through September.
"To ignore this is folly," said Douglas Coté, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. "Certainly, this market could continue to move forward, but ignoring the fundamentals is not something I'd counsel my clients to do."
Positive reports of company earnings helped offset the disappointing news about the economy and stemmed a bigger decline on Wednesday.
Amazon jumped $12.41, or 4.8 percent, to $272.76 after the world's biggest online retailer showed improving profit margins when it posted fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday.
Boeing, currently trying to fix battery problems that have grounded its 787 Dreamliner passenger jets, gained 94 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.59 after it reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations. Rising profits from commercial jets offset a smaller profit from defense work.
A private survey showed Wednesday that United States businesses increased hiring in January compared with a revised December reading. The payroll processor ADP said that employers added 192,000 jobs in January.
Inflation rates were steady. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32 to 96 24/32, and the yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 1.99 percent, from 2.00 on Tuesday.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- For all the talk that President Obama has shifted leftward, much of his early second-term energy seeks simply to preserve the status quo.
Mr. Obama's Inaugural Address last week celebrated the role of "collective action" in creating conditions for a modern economy, expanding individual opportunity and assisting the poor. He rejected Republican arguments that government benefits create "a nation of takers."
That partisan gibe was telling. He defended two programs, Medicare and Medicaid, begun nearly a half-century ago, and a third, Social Security, that dates from the Great Depression. The federal welfare commitments that Mr. Obama praised in observing that "a great nation must care for the vulnerable" also date back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's time.
Yet all those benefits are in the cross-fire of the president's continuing fiscal battle with Republicans in Congress. That is not because of a shift in philosophy by Mr. Obama or his party, but rather because of the looming cost of the retirements of baby boomers and of the persistent ideological boldness of partisan foes.
Mr. Obama expanded the scope of federal obligations during his first term through short-term stimulus programs and the new health care law. Encouraged by his second popular-vote majority in November and hardened by his confrontations with Republicans over the past two years, he has taken a feistier stance toward his adversaries.
None of the president's economic initiatives, however, represent a departure for Mr. Obama himself, or for his party. If President Bill Clinton set out to build a "bridge to the 21st century," said Simon Rosenberg, the president and founder of the New Democrat Network, Mr. Obama is walking across it.
John D. Podesta, an Obama adviser who served as chief of staff in the Clinton White House, called the president's second-term economic agenda "consistent with where he's been, consistent with where Clinton was."
Indeed, since World War II both parties have accepted a substantial measure of federal activism "as American as apple pie," said Kenneth Baer, a former Obama budget aide.
Mr. Obama's problem is that postwar America could afford more pie than a post-baby-boomer America will be able to. And in the era of the Tea Party, Republicans have proved increasingly willing to challenge once-settled assumptions about Washington's role.
In another political moment, Mr. Obama's attempt to preserve old governing assumptions might be labeled conservative. But Republicans, even after shifting tactics in the wake of a bracing November defeat, say he will have to fight nonstop to advance his agenda.
"His entire second term on fiscal issues is going to be essentially defensive," said Representative Tom Cole, a veteran Republican from Oklahoma. "He's trying to defend not just the New Deal legacy, but also Obamacare."
Mr. Cole added, "The problem he has is, those programs can't be defended in their current forms."
But Republicans also have not made their case for the "structural reforms" that they say have been made urgent by trillion-dollar deficits. In fact, they have failed to do so repeatedly.
In the 1990s, Speaker Newt Gingrich's attempt to rein in Medicare and Medicaid spending helped Mr. Clinton win a second term. President George W. Bush, after adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, could not persuade a Republican Congress to pass his plan for a partial privatization of Social Security.
In last year's campaign, the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, backed a plan to overhaul Medicare through spending limits on each beneficiary. But their plan pushed such savings 10 years into the future, while they attacked Mr. Obama for having cut Medicare spending to help finance the health care law.
When it comes to Republicans pushing for structural changes in benefit programs, "the record there is not good," said Peter Wehner, a former Bush White House aide. And the Republican argument will not soon get easier to make.
Mr. Obama acknowledges the need for some cuts in entitlement spending, but he campaigned successfully on higher taxes for affluent Americans as an alternative to the deep cuts that Republicans want. By refusing to negotiate this month over raising the nation's borrowing limit, Mr. Obama forced Republican leaders to set that cudgel aside without accepting the spending cuts they previously insisted on.
To swing rank-and-file Republicans behind that capitulation, House leaders promised that Mr. Ryan's new budget plan this spring would eliminate the budget deficit within 10 years. Doing so, however, will almost certainly require limiting Medicare spending much sooner than 10 years from now -- a step that Mr. Wehner said "I'm not sure I'd recommend," because it could bring more political pain.
Yet fiscal pressure on the White House will not let up even if Mr. Obama marshals public opinion against that budget. Absent a negotiated deal to reduce spending, Mr. Cole said, Republicans say they will let $1 trillion in 10-year across-the-board budget cuts take effect under the "sequestration" provision both parties agreed to in 2011. That would squeeze defense and domestic government functions alike.
A deal remains possible. In earlier, unsuccessful talks with Republicans, Mr. Obama embraced what Mr. Podesta calls "sensible reforms" to major entitlement programs, including reduced spending for affluent beneficiaries and more modest inflation adjustments.
Not even liberal advocates hold out much hope for new expansions in the government's economic role, or crackdowns on the United States' trading partners, or stimulus spending to reduce unemployment -- notwithstanding Mr. Obama's second-inaugural swagger.
Upon hearing Mr. Obama's address, "I was troubled by the assumption that the economy's in recovery, when for most Americans the recovery hasn't started," said Robert L. Borosage, a co-director of the liberal Campaign for America's Future.
"He spoke to the progressive coalition," Mr. Borosage added. But in some ways, he said, the speech "sounded like it came from the Clinton years."

Abstract: Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said in a speech this month that the Fed's efforts to push down interest rates were driving up the price of farmland, junk bonds and other risky investments.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve has left little doubt about its plans for the next few months, and thus little mystery about the statement it will release Wednesday after the latest meeting of its policy-making committee. The economy remains weak. The Fed will keep buying bonds to hold down borrowing costs.
Inside the central bank, however, debate is once again shifting from whether the Fed should do more to stimulate the economy to when it should start doing less.
Proponents of strong action to reduce unemployment won a series of victories last year, culminating in December when the Fed announced that it would hold short-term interest rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent. The rate was 7.8 percent in December.
To accelerate that process, the Fed also said it would increase its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion each month until it sees clear signs of strength in the job market.
The Fed is expected to affirm both policies on Wednesday. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said this month that the persistence of high unemployment "motivates and justifies" the efforts.
The looming question is how much longer the asset purchases will continue.
The officials who led the push for stronger action have turned to defending the need to continue asset purchases for as long as possible, while those who opposed the policy are pressing for an early end date.
Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, was among the most outspoken advocates for asset purchases last year. In a speech earlier this month, he said that the Fed's efforts to suppress interest rates were producing clear benefits, increasing sales of homes and cars.
"I consider it imperative that monetary policy continue to actively support the economy at present, since we continue to have an unacceptably high unemployment rate while, at the same time, inflation is undershooting the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target," said Mr. Rosengren, who holds a rotating seat this year on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee.
Critics of the Fed's efforts initially warned that the purchases would reduce the central bank's ability to control inflation. Increasingly, they also have emphasized that the purchases could undermine the stability of financial markets.
Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said in a speech this month that the Fed's efforts to push down interest rates were driving up the price of farmland, junk bonds and other risky investments.
Ms. George, who holds a vote on the policy-making committee this year, said that the eventual sale of the Fed's holdings also could disrupt markets.
"Like others, I am concerned about the high rate of unemployment, but I recognize that monetary policy, by contributing to financial imbalances and instability, can just as easily aggravate unemployment as heal it," she said.
Many prominent economists outside the Fed continue to argue that the central bank should be acting even more forcefully to stimulate the economy, but that view has gained little traction inside the central bank.
Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, is the only official who has publicly endorsed stronger action.
"Monetary policy is currently not accommodative enough," Mr. Kocherlakota said, noting that unemployment is too high while the pace of inflation is too low -- below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed considers healthy.
Mr. Kocherlakota said the Fed should announce its intention to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 percent, rather than the 6.5 percent threshold the central bank adopted in December.
The Fed deliberately left the duration of the asset purchase program as an open question, in contrast to the specific interest-rate threshold.
It said only that it wanted to see "substantial improvement" in the labor market, though officials have made it clear they also expect to suspend asset purchases well before the unemployment rate reaches the 6.5 percent line.
Mr. Bernanke explained at a December news conference that the Fed wanted to retain greater flexibility because asset purchases are a relatively untested strategy.
"We'll be learning over time about how efficacious they are, about what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences," he said.
But the discussion already has begun to swing toward informal thresholds.
Mr. Rosengren said last year that the Fed should certainly continue the purchases until the unemployment rate declines at least below 7.25 percent.
James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and another voting member of the committee this year, wrote this month that "there is no simple answer to this question" of when the Fed should stop buying bonds.
Then he provided one, telling CNBC that he expected the unemployment rate to drop to near 7 percent by the end of the year and that it would then be appropriate for the Fed to consider suspending its program of asset purchases.

A New Housing Boom? Don't Count on It

Author: Shiller, Robert J

Full text:   WE'RE beginning to hear noises that we've reached a major turning point in the housing market -- and that, with interest rates so low, this is a rare opportunity to buy. But are such observations on target?
It would be comforting if they were. Yet the unfortunate truth is that the tea leaves don't clearly suggest any particular path for prices, either up or down.
On the one hand, there were sharp price increases in 2012, with the S.&P./Case-Shiller 20-City Index, which I helped devise, up a total of 9 percent over the six months from March to September. That comes after what was generally a decline in prices for five consecutive years. And while prices dropped very slightly in October, the trend was quite encouraging for the market. (Our November data come out on Tuesday.)
But some of these changes were seasonal. Home prices have tended to rise every midyear and to fall slightly every fall and winter. And for some unknown reason, seasonal effects have become more pronounced since the financial crisis.
After screening out these effects, a number of indicators are up, including data for housing starts and permits as well as the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Index of traffic of prospective homebuyers, which has made a spectacular rebound since last spring.
What might explain this picture? It's hard to pin down, because nothing drastically different occurred in the economy from March to September. Yes, there was economic improvement: the unemployment rate, for example, dropped to 7.8 percent from 8.2 percent. But that extended a trend in place since 2009. There was also a decline in foreclosure activity, but for the most part that is also a continuing trend, as reported by RealtyTrac.
And, last spring, along with Karl Case of Wellesley College and Anne Thompson of McGraw-Hill Construction, I conducted a detailed survey of the attitudes of recent home buyers in four American cities, as I discussed here in October. We did not see any evidence of increased optimism.
In short, it is hard to find an exact cause for the rebound in home prices. But that isn't unusual -- we hardly ever know the real causes of major changes in speculative prices. Yet we do know that any short-run increase in inflation-adjusted home prices has been virtually worthless as an indicator of where home prices will be going over the next five or more years.
THERE is a good deal of short-run momentum in home prices -- they tend to keep going in the same direction for a year or maybe more. But those prices have generally reverted to the mean fairly quickly, in inflation-corrected terms. The upswing in home prices from 1997 to 2006 -- up 86 percent, in real terms -- was an anomaly. And that upswing was almost completely reversed by 2012. We certainly can't rule out another boom. It's possible that the 20th-century pattern of real home prices, which typically hugged the historical mean, has disappeared. Perhaps people are more speculative in their thinking, after the recent roller-coaster ride, and more prepared psychologically to buy into a bubble. But I wouldn't put any money on that.
History doesn't suggest that another big bubble will come so fast. In fact, before the most recent one, the United States had had only one major national home price boom in the last century, when real prices rose a total of 68 percent from 1942 to 1953.
After the traumatic collapse of the last price bubble, Americans seem less sanguine about owning versus renting. According to the Census Bureau, the homeownership rate has been falling, from 69.0 percent in the third quarter of 2006 to 65.5 percent in the third quarter last year.
A study of the causes of these rate movements, by Stuart Gabriel of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Stuart Rosenthal of Syracuse University, concluded that further declines seem likely, but that a forecast would depend "on uncertain forecasts of attitudes toward investing in homeownership as well as changes in credit market and other economic conditions." (The study was presented at the January meetings of the American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association/American Economic Association.) If the trend continues, it would suggest long-term declines in prices of existing detached single-family homes, because they are costly to manage as rentals.
The housing market has also been subject to new oversight, including that of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which just this month announced new ability-to-repay standards for mortgage lenders. Those standards will make wild lending harder to do.
So it seems that since 2006, our society -- including both buyers and lenders -- hasn't become more speculative in its attitudes toward housing. Instead, it has become more wary, and more regulated.
And, of course, economic clouds are still hovering. Slow overall growth continues in the United States, and European financial markets remain vulnerable.Much of our economy, notably housing, is still supported by taxpayer bailouts, which are clearly not a long-term solution. There are also lingering uncertainties about emerging-market economies, as well as the risk that a disturbance in the Middle East could cause an energy crisis.
Most experts are not predicting any big change in home prices. As of December, the Zillow-Pulsenomics Home Price Expectations Survey, which involves more than 100 forecasters, and the S.& P. Case/Shiller Composite Index Futures were both forecasting modest increases for the next half-decade, implying inflation-adjusted price growth of 1 to 2 percent a year.
The bottom line for potential home buyers or sellers is probably this: Don't do anything dramatic or difficult. There is too much uncertainty to justify any aggressive speculative moves right now. If you have personal reasons for getting into or out of the housing market, go ahead. Otherwise, don't stay up worrying about home prices any more than you do about stock prices.
I can't offer any clearer picture, and I don't see a solid basis for anyone else to do so, either.

Full text:   SAN DIEGO
IN November I quit my job as the editor of Wired to run 3D Robotics, the San Diego-based drone company I started with a partner as a side project three years ago. We make autopilot technology and small aircraft -- both planes and multirotor copters -- that can fly by themselves. The drones, which sell for a few hundred bucks, are for civilians: they don't shoot anything but photographs and videos. And they're incredibly fun to build (which we do with the ample help of robots). It wasn't a hard decision to give up publishing for this.
But my company, like many manufacturers, is faced with a familiar challenge: its main competitors are Chinese companies that have the dual advantages of cheap labor and top-notch engineering. So, naturally, when we were raising a round of investment financing last year, venture capitalists demanded a plausible explanation for how our little start-up could beat its Chinese rivals. The answer was as much a surprise to the investors as it had been to me a few years earlier: Mexico. In particular, Tijuana.
Like many Americans, until recently, when I heard "Tijuana" I thought only of drug cartels and cheap tequila. "TJ," though, is a city of more than two million people (larger than neighboring San Diego), and it has become North America's electronics assembly hot spot: most of the flat-screen TVs sold in the United States, from companies like Samsung and Sony, are made there, along with everything from medical devices to aerospace parts. Jordi Muñoz, the smart young guy who had taught me about drones and then started 3D Robotics with me, is from TJ -- and he persuaded me to build a second factory there to supplement the work we were doing in San Diego.
Shuttling between the two factories -- in San Diego, where we engineer our drones, and in TJ, where we assemble them -- I'm reminded of a similar experience I had a decade earlier. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I lived in Hong Kong (working for The Economist) and saw how that city was paired with the "special economic zone" of Shenzhen across the border on the Chinese mainland in Guangdong Province. Together, the two created a world-beating manufacturing hub: business, design and finance in Hong Kong, manufacturing in Shenzhen. The clear division of labor between the two became a model for modern China.
Today, what Shenzhen is to Hong Kong, Tijuana is becoming to San Diego. You can drive from our San Diego engineering center to our Tijuana factory in 20 minutes, no passport required. (A passport is needed to come back, but there are fast-track lanes for business people.) Some of our employees commute across the border each day; good doctors are cheaper and easier to find in TJ, as are private schools, although it's generally nicer to live in San Diego. In some ways, the border feels more like the notional borders of the European Union than a divide between the developed and developing worlds.
And it's not just TJ. To the east, in Juárez, Dell computers are built by Foxconn, the company that manufactures more than 40 percent of the world's electronics (including Apple's iPhone and iPad). To the south, in Querétaro, a factory builds the transmissions that General Motors installs in its Corvettes. The design of General Electric's GEnx turbine jet engine and the production of interior elements of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner also happen in Mexico. Manufactured goods are the country's chief export, with private investment in this sector among the highest in the world.
The notion that Mexico offers only cheap labor is just plain off the mark. Mexico graduates some 115,000 engineering students per year -- roughly three times as many as the U.S. on a per-capita basis. One result is that some machine specialists are typically easier to find in TJ than in many big American cities. So, for that matter, are accountants experienced in production economics and other highly skilled workers.
What all these pieces add up to is a model -- one that might hold the long-sought answer for how American manufacturers can compete with those in China, India and the next generation of economic powerhouses. That's because the TJ template isn't so much about outsourcing as it is quicksourcing. And that's also the way to create thousands of good jobs in the United States.
As any entrepreneur can tell you, the shorter and more nimble a supply chain is, the better.
First, a shorter supply chain means that a company can make things when it wants to, instead of solely when it has to. Strange as it may seem, many small manufacturers don't have that option. When we started 3D, we produced everything in China and needed to order in units of thousands to get good pricing. That meant that we had to write big checks to make big batches of goods -- money we wouldn't see again until all those products sold, sometimes a year or more later. Now that we carry out our production locally, we're able to make only what we need that week.
Second, there's less risk. If we make an error in a design, we've wasted at most a few days' worth of production. If there's something wrong in the production process itself, we can spot it fast. We control the component inventory, so we can see what's going into our goods and know that we're not being ripped off with used or pirated parts. And if we want to protect our intellectual property, we can do so without having to trust that other companies will uphold our interests above all others. And that's saying nothing about political risk, environmental risk or P.R. risk, all of which companies like Apple and Walmart have learned about in China the hard way.
Third, it's simply faster. We still order some parts from China, and even though we use FedEx, it always seems to take weeks, and sometimes months, longer than we'd planned. That's not a criticism of China; it's merely intrinsic to any arm's-length relationship between small buyers and big makers. If we were Apple, we'd get overnight service. But we're not, so we wait.
Finally, a short supply chain is an incentive to innovate. If you're outsourcing the manufacturing of huge parcels of a product, you can't change that product until you've sold all the ones you've already made (at least not if you want to stay in business). So that often means sitting on your hands, waiting for Version 1 to sell out before starting to make Version 2. But when you're doing just-in-time manufacturing, you can change the product every day if you want -- whether to take advantage of some better or cheaper component or to improve the design.
In the land of the long supply chain, meanwhile, things are changing, too. Inflation-adjusted labor costs in China have more than tripled in the past decade. Wages in China's southern cities are approaching $6 an hour, roughly what they are in Mexico.
Whether factors like these are enough to turn American businesses from outsourcers to quicksourcers remains an open question. But I'm betting my money that they will. The sense of possibility I felt when I first crossed from Hong Kong to Shenzhen in 1997 is what I now feel when I cross from San Diego to Tijuana. The trade routes of the 21st century don't have to follow Marco Polo from West to East. Indeed, in the new manufacturing landscape, the routes don't have to take you far at all.

Full text:   DAVOS, Switzerland -- With Europe in a sharp slowdown and the United States forging only a slow recovery, the business and academic elites gathering here are scouring the global landscape for any new economic success story. And a number of countries are stepping forward here at the World Economic Forum to peddle their tales - even if the smart money knows that betting on emerging markets continues to be risky.
Just a few years ago, Brazil and Argentina generated much of the buzz here in Davos, as their growth rates exceeded 7 percent. There was talk of a new economic engine that could help offset lagging growth in the United States and Europe.
Fast forward to today, and Brazil and Argentina have stumbled. It is an economic renaissance in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Panama and Peru that has become the focus in Latin America.
Half a world away, sub-Saharan Africa has also flashed onto the radar screen, with an average 5 percent growth rate that many hope will improve in the coming decade as investment deepens, perhaps finally fostering a new middle class.
Whether those trends are sustainable, though, remains an open question.
As far as the opinion-makers here are concerned, Africa is coming of age. At a dinner Thursday night feting "Africa's Promise," the economist Lawrence H, Summers of Harvard waved an iPhone at the audience. "By the end of the decade, half the African people will have this," he predicted. "Africa can leapfrog in terms of economic growth."
Joe Saddi, chairman of the global management consultancy Booz, is equally bullish. "The buzz in the business community is that the time of Africa is coming soon," he said. "Everyone is interested in exploring it."
But others at the dinner, which gathered many African heads of state, acknowledged that the road could be rocky.
"There is no doubt that Africa is on the move and making progress, but there will also be trouble spots," President Paul Kagame of Rwanda said. "We can't talk about Africa versus China, when Africa is still a place in which each country is on its own."
Kandeh Yumkella, director-general of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in Vienna, said the region was turning heads because of its 5 percent growth rate. "But it's almost entirely from a commodities boom," he said. "There is no creation of high-value growth."
Africa still sorely needs infrastructure and an industrial base so that it can export more than just oil and minerals to markets around the world, African officials say. What is lacking is a cohesive industrial policy that investors can grasp. "I don't see a strategic vision being forged for Africa," Mr. Yumkella said.
Small loans that are typically aimed at financing cottage industries are simply not enough to lift sub-Saharan Africa into an emerging-market powerhouse, he added. "Microfinance is basically poverty management," he said of that tactic. "We define poverty alleviation for Africans as basket weaving. Lending someone $50 a month will not create large numbers of jobs for the future."
But with lingering corruption and poor governance, significant flows of private investment may be slow in coming. "As long as the priority of African heads of state is to have bank accounts in Europe, there will be hurdles," President Alpha Condé of Guinea said. "The problem with Africa is the leaders of Africa."
Pointing to the deadly conflict in Mali, they fretted that all of Africa tends to be painted with the same brush.
"People say there was a terrorist event in Mali, so don't come to Africa," Prime Minister Raila Amolo Odinga of Kenya said. "But when things deteriorate in Venezuela, people don't say, 'Don't invest in Latin America.' Africa is held to a different standard."
Latin America, though, is going through some turbulence of its own, as growth in its two largest economies trails off sharply after several boom years, as exports wane and as domestic demand slackens. In Brazil, global uncertainties and earlier fiscal tightening had an impact larger than expected, especially on private investment, the International Monetary Fund said in a recent report on Latin America.
Argentina, for its part, recently turned toward economic nationalism and retaliatory protectionism after growth slumped.
Widespread controls in Latin America on imports and foreign exchange are also adversely affecting investment and consumer confidence, the I.M.F. said.
Growth in Venezuela has been slowed by a number of factors. "The problems there are aggravated by an absent president, an impossible macroeconomic situation with ridiculous fiscal deficit, and rising inflation," said Ricardo Hausmann, director of the Center for International Development at Harvard.
Latin American officials say the region is divided into several markets with divergent trends. "It's absolutely clear that there are two speeds in Latin America," Finance Minister Felipe Larraín Bascuñán of Chile said in an interview. "The question is what is sustainable."
His country has experienced an average growth rate of 5 percent for the last three years. As in Africa, much of that success has been based on exports of commodities, especially to China.
He cited Chile as an example of an economy that is modifying its contours for the future. Among other things, Mr. Larraín said, private investment has become the main driver of growth after the government amended tax laws to make it easier for small and medium-size businesses to operate.
Smaller Chilean companies that reinvest in themselves pay little or no corporate taxes. A credit tax on loans was slashed to 0.4 percent from 1.2 percent. The middle class has been gaining ground in Chile. And unemployment, around 6 percent, is near its lowest level in a decade, while wages are rising.
"It's a virtuous circle" Mr. Larraín said. Still, he added, "we don't want this to be a big fiesta" where growth is driven only through consumption. "We are working to make this sustainable."
Investors have also been prowling Mexico after President Enrique Peña Nieto pledged a series of energy and tax measures to lift growth and began a crackdown on violence.
Luis Videgaray Caso, finance minister of Mexico, said the changes were bearing fruit. "We are attracting investments that 10 years ago went to China," he said at a forum on Latin America. "The feeling now is that China is a complement, not a competitor."
Still, the risks of a slowdown remain, given how sharply growth has been curbed not only in the United States, but also in Europe and in major emerging economies, including the powerhouses of Latin America.
While South America's more nimble economies have profited by opening their markets and cutting regulations, "some countries are starting to ask if they should put in more protectionist measures," José Luis Silva Martinot, Peru's trade and tourism minister, said at the same forum. "In Peru we want to continue with a free market."
And despite the problems afflicting the region's biggest economies, he added, "what happens in one country will not lead to contagion - unlike in Europe."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: [...]the optimism that has pervaded the market in recent weeks is a drastic change from recent years. [...]recently, many investors had continued to shy away from stocks in the face of a trio of hovering problems -- the potential breakdown of the euro zone, fears of a stalling Chinese economy and political brinkmanship in Washington that threatened to drive the economy into a new recession. Jim Cole, a 52-year-old employee at the Bank of the West in San Francisco, had most of the money in his individual retirement account in cash at the end of 2012 as he awaited a bad outcome to the fiscal negotiations in Washington. Since Congress reached its agreement, he has put almost all of that money to work in stocks.

Full text:   Americans seem to be falling in love with stocks again.
Millions of people all but abandoned the market after the 2008 financial crisis, but now individual investors are pouring more money than they have in years into stock mutual funds. The flood, prompted by fading economic threats and better news on housing and jobs, has helped propel the broad market to within striking distance of its highest nominal level ever.
"You've got a real sea change in investor outlook," said Andrew Wilkinson, the chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak Associates.
While the rising market may lift the nation's collective spirits, it will not necessarily restore everyone's portfolios. In good times and bad, many individual investors tend to buy and sell at precisely the wrong moments. They dump stocks after the market falls and buy stocks after the market rises, the opposite of what investors aim to do.
Some market experts worry that might be happening this time, too. People who got out as stocks plummeted in 2008 and early 2009 have already missed a remarkable rally. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has soared 120 percent since March 2009, passing the 1,500 milestone. This year alone, the main indexes are up 5 percent. Now, the investing public seems more afraid of missing out than of misreading Wall Street again.
Americans' latest stock-market romance is young, and it could easily fade before it becomes something more serious. Some market watchers warn that given the big run-up in prices, the market is already ripe for at least a brief correction.
Still, the optimism that has pervaded the market in recent weeks is a drastic change from recent years. Until recently, many investors had continued to shy away from stocks in the face of a trio of hovering problems -- the potential breakdown of the euro zone, fears of a stalling Chinese economy and political brinkmanship in Washington that threatened to drive the economy into a new recession.
One after another, these threats appear to have dissipated. This week Congress found at least a short-term way around the nation's debt ceiling, sidestepping Republican threats to let the government default when it reached a self-imposed borrowing limit in February or March.
As the fog of crisis has cleared, investors have more clearly focused on the cascade of good economic data pointing to a growing housing market, shrinking unemployment and corporate earnings that were stronger than expected.
"The last few weeks represent the belief that there will be no existential threat to any large global economy in 2013," said Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist at BNY ConvergEx group.
Jim Cole, a 52-year-old employee at the Bank of the West in San Francisco, had most of the money in his individual retirement account in cash at the end of 2012 as he awaited a bad outcome to the fiscal negotiations in Washington. Since Congress reached its agreement, he has put almost all of that money to work in stocks.
"I just bought some more stock this morning," Mr. Cole said Friday. "There doesn't seem to be this swirl of impending doom hanging over the U.S. economy or the world economy looking out six to 12 months from now."
The optimism about the economy and corporate profits has helped fuel eight straight positive days for the S. & P. 500, the longest such run since 2004. The S.& P. 500 finished Friday up 8.14 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,502.96.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.65 points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,895.98, near its high. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 19.33 points, or 0.6 percent, to 3,149.71, still well below its peak in 2000.
There is no surefire data to use to gauge the behavior of retail investors. Some of those who left stock-focused mutual funds in recent years have put the money instead into specific stocks or exchange-traded funds, which hold baskets of stocks. But analysts agree that most indicators point to rising confidence in the market.
The level of bullishness among small investors has nearly doubled just since mid-November, according to a weekly survey conducted by the American Association of Individual Investors.
In the last three weeks, the market data company Lipper reported that $14.9 billion had gone into all stock-focused mutual funds, the most in any three-week period since 2001. Mutual funds focused specifically on American stocks have collected $6.8 billion since the new year, the most in all but one comparable period since the financial crisis.
This comes after investors had removed $416 billion from stock-focused mutual funds since the start of the financial crisis, according to Lipper. Those outflows continued even as the market climbed over the last few years.
Many retail investors leaving stocks have put their money into bonds, which have historically been less risky. There is now concern that those people could face losses if professional investors sell their bonds and buy stocks, which would push up interest rates and make current bond holdings less valuable. Interest rates were higher on Friday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 27/32, to 97 4/32 and the yield rose to 1.95 percent from 1.85 percent late Thursday.
Since the market bottomed in March 2009, professional investors have bid up the price of American stocks, partly in response to bumper profits at American companies. The Federal Reserve has also tried to encourage investors to move into riskier assets like stocks by pushing interest rates lower, which makes bank deposits and new bonds less attractive. The S.& P. 500 is close to its nominal high of 1,565 but remains below its record high -- reached in 2000 -- after adjusting for inflation and taking dividends into account.
But many investors have been hesitant about entering the market because of the slow recovery of the economy. Now, a number of recent data points suggests that the recovery may be gaining traction. This week, new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in five years.
Even many optimistic strategists say that a short-term break from the market rally is likely until there are more indications that the economy is growing. And given that January is historically a strong month for stocks, more bearish analysts have said the recent rally is likely to fade. One drag on growth could come from the recent increase in payroll taxes.
There is also a sizable contingent of investors who think that the European debt crisis and United States fiscal position still represent significant threats.
But Russ Koesterich, the chief investment strategist at BlackRock, said that the current threats were "mundane" in comparison to what investors faced the last few years. "We're not talking about big crises anymore," he said.

Abstract: [...]business and economics majors are rapidly gaining favor on Chinese campuses at the expense of majors like engineering, contributing to the glut of graduates with little interest in soiling their hands on factory floors. The government includes not just people in long-term jobs but also freelancers, temporary workers, graduate students and people who have signed job contracts but not started work yet, as well as many people in make-work jobs that state-controlled companies across China have been ordered to create for new graduates.

Full text:   GUANGZHOU, China -- This city of 15 million on the Pearl River is the hub of a manufacturing region where factories make everything from T-shirts and shoes to auto parts, tablet computers and solar panels. Many factories are desperate for workers, despite offering double-digit annual pay increases and improved benefits.
Wang Zengsong is desperate for a steady job. He has been unemployed for most of the three years since he graduated from a community college here after growing up on a rice farm. Mr. Wang, 25, has worked only several months at a time in low-paying jobs, once as a shopping mall guard, another time as a restaurant waiter and most recently as an office building security guard.
But he will not consider applying for a full-time factory job because Mr. Wang, as a college graduate, thinks that is beneath him. Instead, he searches every day for an office job, which would initially pay as little as a third of factory wages.
"I have never and will never consider a factory job -- what's the point of sitting there hour after hour, doing repetitive work?" he asked.
Millions of recent college graduates in China like Mr. Wang are asking the same question. A result is an anomaly: Jobs go begging in factories while many educated young workers are unemployed or underemployed. A national survey of urban residents, released this winter by a Chinese university, showed that among people in their early 20s, those with a college degree were four times as likely to be unemployed as those with only an elementary school education.
It is a problem that Chinese officials are acutely aware of.
"There is a structural mismatch -- on the one hand, the factories cannot find skilled labor, and, on the other hand, the universities produce students who do not want the jobs available," said Ye Zhihong, a deputy secretary general of China's Education Ministry.
China's swift expansion in education over the last decade, including a quadrupling of the number of college graduates each year, has created millions of engineers and scientists. The best can have their pick of jobs at Chinese companies that are aiming to become even more competitive globally.
But China is also churning out millions of graduates with few marketable skills, coupled with a conviction that they are entitled to office jobs with respectable salaries.
Part of the problem seems to be a proliferation of fairly narrow majors -- Mr. Wang has a three-year associate degree in the design of offices and trade show booths. At the same time, business and economics majors are rapidly gaining favor on Chinese campuses at the expense of majors like engineering, contributing to the glut of graduates with little interest in soiling their hands on factory floors.
"This also has to do with the banking sector -- they offer high-paying jobs, so their parents want their children to go in this direction," Ms. Ye said.
Mr. Wang and other young, educated Chinese without steady jobs pose a potential long-term challenge to social stability. They spend long hours surfing the Internet, getting together with friends and complaining about the shortage of office jobs for which they believe they were trained.
China now has 11 times as many college students as it did at the time of the Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989, and an economy that has been very slow to produce white-collar jobs. The younger generation has shown less interest in political activism, although that could change if the growing numbers of graduates cannot find satisfying work.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao acknowledged last March that only 78 percent of the previous year's college graduates had found jobs. But even that figure may overstate employment for the young and educated.
The government includes not just people in long-term jobs but also freelancers, temporary workers, graduate students and people who have signed job contracts but not started work yet, as well as many people in make-work jobs that state-controlled companies across China have been ordered to create for new graduates.
Yin Weimin, the minister of human resources and social security, said in a speech last spring that "the major emphasis will be on solving the employment problem among college graduates."
Picky College Graduates
Mr. Wang is the youngest of four children. He was born in late 1987, as the "one child policy" was barely beginning to be enforced in rural areas. His less-educated siblings have also been leery of taking well-paid factory jobs. A brother, who got a one-year degree in mobile phone equipment after high school, opened a luggage shop. Neither of his sisters attended high school. One is a saleswoman in a clothing store, and the other is a homemaker and mother who married a factory worker.
An aversion to factory labor is common in China today, said Mary E. Gallagher, the director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan and a specialist in Chinese labor issues.
"Students themselves have not adjusted to the concept of mass education, so students are accustomed to seeing themselves as becoming part of an elite when they enter college," she said.
China has a millenniums-old Confucian tradition in which educated people do not engage in manual labor. But its economy still largely produces blue-collar jobs. Manufacturing, mining and construction represent 47 percent of China's economic output, twice their share in the United States, and the service sector is far less developed.
The glut of college graduates is eroding wages even for those with more marketable majors, like computer science. In 2000, the prevailing wage at top companies for fresh graduates with computer science degrees was about $725 a month in Shenzhen, roughly 10 times the wage then of a blue-collar worker who had not finished high school, said an executive who insisted on anonymity because of controversy in China over wages.
But today, new computer science graduates are so plentiful that their pay in Shenzhen has fallen to just $550 a month, less than double the wage of a blue-collar worker. And that is without adjusting for inflation over the last decade. Consumer prices have risen 29 percent in Shenzhen, according to official data that many economists say understates the true increase in consumer prices.
If Mr. Wang were willing to take a factory job, his interest in indoor design might take him to Hongyuan Furniture, a manufacturer of home saunas a 45-minute drive south across Guangzhou from his home.
The factory now offers newcomers 2,500 renminbi a month, about $395, before overtime. Six-person dorm rooms have been replaced with two-person apartments. Workers no longer have to hand over part of their wages to the foreman. Instead, the factory now pays a bonus to foremen of $8 to $16 for each month that a new blue-collar employee stays on the job. Yet the factory still struggles to find workers.
The company's labor costs per worker -- wages plus benefits -- have been rising 30 percent or more each year. That is faster than the national pace of 21 percent for migrant workers, although there have been signs that pace may have slowed recently with a broader deceleration in the Chinese economy. And it is considerably faster than the 13 percent annual increase in minimum wages -- roughly three times inflation -- that the government has mandated through 2015.
Wages at Hongyuan Furniture are rising particularly fast because it is in an area of Guangzhou that was slower to develop. Before wages began surging five years ago, the company paid $90 to $120 a month to new workers without experience. Workers then were also expected to pay $13 to $40 of their monthly pay for the first six months to their foreman in a sort of informal apprenticeship, said Ni Bingbing, the company's vice general manager.
Plenty of college graduates apply for jobs at the company, but they are not desperate enough to accept blue-collar tasks, Ms. Ni said. The sauna factory has better ventilation than many Chinese factories, but it is not air-conditioned. The many power tools kick up a fine mist of sawdust that coats every surface -- not the sort of place where a college graduate can go to work in a dress shirt and then head straight to a restaurant or nightclub in the evening.
Subsidized by Parents
One unusual social dynamic created by the one-child policy is that many college graduates are only children with parents and grandparents who continue to nurture them into adulthood.
"Their parents, their grandparents give them money; they have six people to support them," Ms. Ni said. "They say, Why do I need to work? I can stay home and get 2,000 renminbi a month, why should I get on a bus every day to earn 2,500 a month?" That is how Mr. Wang has managed to get by for most of the last three years without a job. Despite some grumbling, his parents send him money to help support his modest lifestyle.
He rents a small but tidy studio apartment. It consists of a bedroom with a pink tile floor roughly 10 feet on a side, holding a low bed and a bedside table with a laptop on it. A plugged hole in the wall shows that a previous occupant had an air-conditioner to cope with Guangzhou's heat, but Mr. Wang makes do with a fan. An adjacent room, about 10 feet long and just three feet wide, holds a tiny kitchen, shower and toilet.
The apartment costs $64 a month. Food, Internet cafe visits and the occasional date cost him $80 a month; fixed-line Internet service costs $8 a month; and electricity and water bills together are another $8 a month, for a total of $160 a month.
In addition to covering these expenses, Mr. Wang's parents also paid back the money he borrowed from friends to pay for his three-year degree, which cost $1,270 a year in tuition and another $320 a year in living costs.
As was common in rural China until very recently, his mother never went to school while his father attended elementary school for several years before dropping out. Now in their 60s, his parents had to give up their rice farm when the local government redeveloped the land it was on; Mr. Wang's father does odd jobs as a construction worker to help support his son.
Not surprisingly, they have urged Mr. Wang to take one of the many factory jobs available. "You can get paid 4,000 renminbi [$635] a month for taking such work, but I wouldn't do it," Mr. Wang said. "Your hands are dirty, you're all dirty. It's not for me."
He has worked brief stints. After a nearly yearlong stretch out of work, he took a job several months ago as an office building security guard. It pays just $320 a month -- but he already is thinking of quitting after Chinese New Year celebrations next month, and dedicating himself full time once again to the search for an office job that would allow him to use his degree. Entry-level positions in his field pay only $240 a month, but the work is clean and safe and there is the prospect of promotion. Even better would be to find a municipal agency willing to hire him, he said.
"The best is a government job; you have job security and a retirement fund," Mr. Wang said.
Mr. Wang counts himself fortunate to have a girlfriend. She has tried to sell Amway cosmetics to her friends, but in her best month only earned $160, and often earns nothing at all in a month. Her apartment costs 1,200 renminbi, about $190, a month, and she is also subsidized by her parents -- her father is a salesman for construction materials while her mother is a nanny.
"My girlfriend says, 'What you're earning now is definitely not enough for marriage, you need at least 10,000 renminbi a month, 26,000 would be good,' so I'm under extreme stress right now," Mr. Wang said. "All the women are like that now -- they want the car, they want the apartment, they want the appliances -- of course, I always say yes to my girlfriend."
Young college graduates like Mr. Wang do not want factory jobs even though companies increasingly offer blue-collar workers the kinds of benefits that many white-collar workers could not aspire to until recently.
TAL Group, a large manufacturer of high-end shirts headquartered in Hong Kong, not only air-conditions its sprawling shirt factory in southeastern China, something many American factories still do not do, but it has even opened a library with 50 Internet-connected desktop computers for employees to use after work.
The combination of the one-child policy and rising rates of college education is only starting to hit the core of China's factory work force: 18- to 21-year-olds not in college. Their numbers are on track to plunge by 29 percent from 2010 to 2020 even if enrollments in higher education hold steady.
Decline of Technical Training
As hundreds of thousands of factories have opened across the country over the last decade, they have struggled to find workers who can operate their complicated equipment, much less fix it. Yet the number of those receiving vocational training has stagnated to the point that they are now outnumbered roughly two to one by students pursuing more academic courses of study.
"We have jobs and positions for which skilled workers cannot be found, and on the other hand, we have talented people who cannot find jobs; technical and vocational education and training is the answer," said Lu Xin, the vice minister of education, at a conference last June.
China's vocational secondary schools and training programs are unpopular because they are seen as dead-ends, with virtually no chance of moving on to a four-year university. They also suffer from a stigma: they are seen as schools for people from peasant backgrounds, and are seldom chosen by more affluent and better-educated students from towns and cities.
Many youths from rural areas who graduate from college, like Mr. Wang, are also hostile to factory jobs. He is toying with other ideas to earn a living, but learning vocational skills is not one of them. One idea is to buy rabbits from wholesalers in the countryside, set out a mat along a Guangzhou street and sell the animals as pets or food.
When told that this might involve competing with older, uneducated rural migrants willing to work for almost nothing as sidewalk vendors, he shrugged and reiterated his hostility to factory labor.
"I'm not afraid of hard work; it's the lack of status," he said. "The more educated people are, the less they want to work in a factory."

Full text:   Iran's currency, weakened by Western sanctions and economic mismanagement, has fallen further in value over the past few days in an apparent reaction to a leadership problem at the Central Bank that has stirred new concerns about political tensions, money traders and outside economists said Tuesday.
The career of the Central Bank's governor, Mahmoud Bahmani, appeared to be in jeopardy, and with it the short-lived stability for the currency, the rial, after a drop in value last year of roughly 50 percent.
Most of that decline came in October in a frenzy of speculative selling by Iranians worried that rapid inflation could render their money worthless. The government responded with a crackdown in which some money traders were arrested.
But reports in Iran on Sunday that Mr. Bahmani suddenly wanted to retire, followed by news reports on Monday that he had been discharged after a parliamentary inquiry on improper withdrawals by the Central Bank, appeared to lay the groundwork for new fiscal anxieties.
While Iran does not publicize exchange rates in unofficial trading, Reuters quoted currency traders in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, as saying it cost as much as 36,250 rials to buy a dollar on Tuesday, compared with 33,000 on Sunday.
"Without reliable official information, any change in Tehran's political winds spooks the public, and they sell rials," said Steve H. Hanke, an economics professor and currency expert at Johns Hopkins University.
Mr. Bahmani, a disciple of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is widely associated with the demise of the rial, which traded at about 10,000 to the dollar a few years ago. He has been criticized in Parliament, where many lawmakers consider the administration economically incompetent.
The rial's weakness also reflects the impact of sanctions over Iran's nuclear program, most notably the European oil embargo and the cutoff of access to global capital and credit markets. Iranian officials, who say their nuclear program is peaceful, have acknowledged that sanctions contributed to a 50 percent drop last year in oil exports.
The Mehr news agency reported that on Sunday, Mr. Bahmani had asked the president's permission to retire. Mr. Ahmadinejad rejected the request. The same day, Parliament decided to investigate the Central Bank, including the "Overnight Withdrawals" scandal, in which the Central Bank withdrew several billion dollars from Iranian banks last March.
The intrigue deepened Monday when Mehr reported a parliamentary financial oversight body had ordered Mr. Bahmani's dismissal, saying the Central Bank had "illegally withdrawn money from certain state and private banks without notifying them in advance." A court spokesman told Mehr that Mr. Bahmani had appealed the ruling.
The International Islamic Awakening News Agency quoted Mr. Bahmani as saying he was being punished because he was fighting fraud. "Some gentlemen see their interests in danger, that is why they have created this situation," he was quoted as saying.

Full text:   Another central bank, another round of unconventional monetary policy.
Following the lead of their counterparts in the United States, Japan's central bankers announced Tuesday what they called a groundbreaking effort to reinvigorate the country's long-moribund economy and defeat deflation.
With no more room left to cut interest rates and previous steps unsuccessful, the Bank of Japan is taking a page from the Federal Reserve's playbook and will pump trillions more yen into the economy by directly buying government bonds and other assets. It also doubled the country's official inflation target to 2 percent. The action came after months of intense pressure on the Bank of Japan from the country's audacious new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to take more aggressive action to bolster the economy.
But as in the United States, there are doubts about just how much of an effect the move will have in Japan. Three rounds of asset purchases since the onset of the financial crisis have successfully headed off deflation in the American economy but failed to generate the kind of growth necessary to return employment to prerecession levels.
Japan's move is also likely to further devalue the yen in the long term -- causing some to worry about a possible round of competitive devaluations as countries weaken their currencies to bolster growth in exports. On Tuesday, however, the yen actually rose against the dollar and the euro amid disappointment that the Bank of Japan's efforts had not gone far enough.
Traditionally, curbing inflation, not worrying about deflation, has been the principal task of central bankers. But when economies enter prolonged periods of slow growth, or even contraction, other concerns come to the fore. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, was keenly aware of Japan's long-running struggle with deflation as well as the American experience in the Great Depression when he began the first round of United States asset purchases, or quantitative easing, in November 2008.
After a second round of quantitative easing beginning in November 2010, the Fed started a third round in September. It said in December that it would continue to purchase $85 billion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities each month until the job market improved. After considerable pressure, European central bankers also began moving more aggressively last year, vowing to do "whatever it takes" to keep the euro zone from fracturing.
Given the scale of the efforts in the United States and Europe, many experts were disappointed by the Bank of Japan's action because the expanded asset purchases will not begin until 2014. They complained that was a waste of valuable time in turning around an economy whose descent into deflation has become a test case of the effects of doing too little in the face of an economic slowdown.
To make matters worse, the Bank of Japan's new plan to purchase 10 trillion yen, or $112 billion, in assets each month sounds more aggressive than it actually will be, said Gustavo Reis, senior international economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That is because many of the securities the Bank of Japan will be purchasing are in the form of short-term debt that will quickly mature, so the additional purchases will equal about $112 billion a year -- not a month -- beginning in 2014.
By contrast, he said, the Fed's balance sheet is expected to expand by a trillion dollars in 2013.
"The Bank of Japan should be more aggressive," Mr. Reis said. "It's a step forward, but given where their economy is, they need to do more."
In fact, with such a small annual increase in asset purchases, it is unlikely Japan will achieve 2 percent inflation, analysts said. The Consumer Price Index for 2012 fell 0.5 percent, according to government statistics. The Bank of Japan's announcement "will likely disappoint those who expected the policy board to answer Abe's call for a 'different kind of B.O.J. policy,' or significantly ramp up its pace of easing," Izumi Devalier, an economist with HSBC, said in a note to clients.
While certainly better than inaction, there is evidence that unconventional monetary policy can only do so much to lift overall economic growth.
The Fed's monetary policy seems to be having a much more significant effect on asset prices than it has on the underlying economy, said Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays. He noted that nearly four years after markets hit bottom in March 2009, stocks in the United States had more than doubled in value. By contrast, "most people would characterize the economic recovery as weak."
For all the challenges in the United States and Europe, Japan's economy, the world's third largest, has been depressed for much longer; the 1990s are regarded as a "lost decade," and the last 10 years are proving to be not much better. Deflation, an all-around fall in prices, profit and incomes, has plagued the country since the late 1990s.
Since last year, when Mr. Abe was still opposition leader, he has urged the central bank to do more after previous rounds of asset purchases failed to reverse deflation. He stepped up the pressure on the bank after a landslide victory by his Liberal Democratic Party in parliamentary elections in December, which catapulted him to office for the second time since a short-lived stint in 2006-7.
Mr. Abe's call for the Bank of Japan to increase the monetary supply has weakened the yen, a boon for exporters, which are responsible for much of Japan's growth. Earlier this month, Mr. Abe also announced an emergency stimulus of 12 trillion yen, providing even more tail wind for the Japanese economy. Those steps have pushed the Nikkei stock index 20 percent higher since mid-November, when Mr. Abe first campaigned on his expansionary platform.
In a joint statement with the government, the Bank of Japan said it was doubling its inflation target to 2 percent and said it would "pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time." The bank's board voted to keep its benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent. The bank also updated its estimates for economic growth in fiscal 2012 and 2013. The bank now forecasts growth of 1 percent for 2012 and 2.3 percent for 2013, with the increase taking into account the new measures.
Mr. Abe immediately hailed the bank's moves, telling the Bank of Japan governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, that the measures were "groundbreaking," according to Kyodo News.
Mr. Abe's critics, however, warn that the central bank will become a printing press for profligate government spending -- expenditures that carry great risks for a country whose public debt is already twice the size of its economy. Critics also say that before flooding a broken system with money, Japan must first tackle structural problems that hurt economic efficiency.
Mr. Abe maintains that deflation will undermine any efforts to grow, and that the government and central bank must act together to get prices rising again. But in a nod to critics, the joint statement said the government would also promote "all possible decisive policy actions for reforming the economic structure" and establish "a sustainable fiscal structure."
"I believe we are firmly on the path toward bold monetary easing," Mr. Abe told reporters.

Full text:   First, my congratulations and condolences to John Kerry for being nominated to be our next secretary of state. There is no one better for the job today and no worse job to have today. It is no accident that we've started measuring our secretaries of state more by miles traveled than milestones achieved. It is bloody hard to do big diplomacy anymore.
Why? Well, as secretary of state today you get to deal with Vladimir Putin, who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple. That is, even though Russia's economy is hugely corrupt and nowhere nearly as innovative as it should be, Putin sits atop a huge reserve of oil and gas that makes him think he's a genius and doesn't need to listen to anyone. When recently confronted with his regime's bad behavior, his first instinct was to block American parents from adopting Russian orphans, even though so many of them badly need homes. If there were an anti-Nobel Peace Prize, Putin would win hands down.
When Putin isn't available to stiff us, China, to whom we owe a gazillion dollars, is ready to stand in. Those two are the real nations, where there's at least someone to answer the phone -- and hang up on us. Elsewhere, the secretary of state gets to deal with failed or failing states, like Mali, Algeria, Afghanistan and Libya, whose governments cannot deliver for their people, let alone for us. If he is looking for a break, Kerry could always call on our longtime ally Egypt, whose president, Mohamed Morsi, we find out, in 2010 described Jews as "descendants of apes and pigs." Who knew?
So what's a secretary of state to do? I'd suggest trying something radically new: creating the conditions for diplomacy where they do not now exist by going around leaders and directly to the people. And I'd start with Iran, Israel and Palestine. We live in an age of social networks in which every leader outside of North Korea today is now forced to engage in a two-way conversation with their citizens. There's no more just top-down. People everywhere are finding their voices and leaders are terrified. We need to turn this to our advantage to gain leverage in diplomacy.
Let's break all the rules.
Rather than negotiating with Iran's leaders in secret -- which, so far, has produced nothing and allows the Iranian leaders to control the narrative and tell their people that they're suffering sanctions because of U.S. intransigence -- why not negotiate with the Iranian people? President Obama should put a simple offer on the table, in Farsi, for all Iranians to see: The U.S. and its allies will permit Iran to maintain a civil nuclear enrichment capability -- which it claims is all it wants to meet power needs -- provided it agrees to U.N. observers and restrictions that would prevent Tehran from ever assembling a nuclear bomb. We should not only make this offer public, but also say to the Iranian people over and over: "The only reason your currency is being crushed, your savings rapidly eroded by inflation, many of your college graduates unemployed and your global trade impeded and the risk of war hanging overhead, is because your leaders won't accept a deal that would allow Iran to develop civil nuclear power but not a bomb." Iran wants its people to think it has no partner for a civil nuclear deal. The U.S. can prove otherwise.
On Israel-Palestine, the secretary of state should publicly offer President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority the following: the U.S. would recognize the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank as the independent State of Palestine on the provisional basis of the June 4, 1967, lines, support its full U.N. membership and send an ambassador to Ramallah, on the condition that Palestinians accept the principle of "two states for two peoples" -- an Arab state and a Jewish state in line with U.N. General Assembly Resolution 181 -- and agree that permanent borders, security and land swaps would be negotiated directly with Israel. The status of the refugees would be negotiated between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which represents all Palestinians inside and outside of Palestine. Gaza, now a de facto statelet, would be recognized as part of Palestine only when its government recognizes Israel, renounces violence and rejoins the West Bank.
Why do this? Because there will be no Israeli-Palestinian breakthrough unless the silent majorities on both sides know they have a partner -- that Palestinians have embraced two states for two peoples and that Israelis have embraced Palestinian statehood. Neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor President Abbas have shown a real commitment to nurture these preconditions for peace, and our secret diplomacy with both only plays into their hands. We need to blow this charade wide open by trying to publicly show Iranians, Israelis and Palestinians that they really do have options that their leaders don't want them to see. (Israel's election on Tuesday showed that the peace camp in Israel is still alive and significant.) It may not work. The leaders may still block it or the people may not be interested. But we need to start behaving like a superpower and forcing a moment of truth. Our hands are full now, and we can't waste four more years with allies (or enemies) who may be fooling us.

Full text:   LONDON (AP) -- Hopes that United States politicians will be able to reach a deal on raising the government's debt ceiling, avoiding the risk of a disastrous default, supported global markets on Monday, with Wall Street closed for a holiday.
Congress must agree by the end of February to increase the limit on how much the nation can borrow so the government can service its debt. If it doesn't, the country could default, which would deal a heavy blow to global financial markets and undermine confidence in the world's largest economy.
Republicans appear ready to raise the debt ceiling temporarily and have also backed away from their insistence on deep spending concessions in exchange for a deal. The signs of compromise last week encouraged investors to buy into stock indexes, many of which are near multiyear highs.
"Although this again could be seen as another round of political battle, any progress to avoid immediate dangers will likely be seen as positive by the market," Gary Yau, analyst at Crédit Agricole, said in a report to investors.
The FTSE 100 in Britain closed Monday up 0.43 percent, at 6,180.98, the DAX in Germany advanced 0.36 percent, to 7,729.80. The CAC-40 in France ended the day up 0.2 percent, at 3,749.79.
United States stock and bond markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King's Birthday.
Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities in Hong Kong, said he was optimistic that an agreement on the debt ceiling would be reached because of the high price tag attached to failing to do so.
"Both parties will find some kind of solution because they all know that the debt ceiling will have to be increased," Mr. Wong said. "At the very last minute, they will sort it out."
Earlier in Asia, markets were more cautious, with Japanese shares hit hard by a rise in the yen. The Nikkei 225 fell 1.5 percent, to close at 10,747.74.
The Bank of Japan began a two-day policy meeting and has been under pressure from a new government to take more aggressive steps to fight the long deflationary slump there. Some analysts expect the bank to expand its asset-purchasing program and set an inflation target.
In commodity markets, the benchmark oil contract for February delivery was down 50 cents to $95.06 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 7 cents to finish at $95.56 a barrel on the Nymex on Friday.

Full text:   WITH all the drama about fiscal policy in Congress and at the White House, it's easy to miss the quiet policy evolution taking place nearby, at the Federal Reserve. The central bank has adopted a more aggressive monetary policy that could be very helpful to the recovering economy. But internal debate at the Fed may weaken the program before it really gets off the ground.
First, what has the Fed done recently? Until September, its bond-buying program was explicitly limited in size and duration. Fed policy makers then replaced it with an open-ended program, whose pace was to be determined by progress in healing the labor market. And they adopted simpler, more positive explanations for their actions -- jettisoning the gloomy, expectations-killing language that cited wretched economic prospects to justify every expansionary move.
Then, in December, the Fed surprised markets by replacing its somewhat confusing predictions for interest rates with numerical guidelines. It said it would keep the rate it controls -- the federal funds rate -- near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent or inflation rose above 2.5 percent.
Under the circumstances, it was significant that the policy makers took these actions at all. The economic data that came out before the September meeting were actually better than expected. And, based on forecasts released after the meeting, members of the Fed's policy-making committee were slightly more optimistic about prospects for employment and output growth than they had been three months before. That they nevertheless adopted a more expansionary policy can be read as an admission that they hadn't been doing enough earlier.
The pledge to keep rates low, even if inflation edged above 2 percent, is particularly consequential. For the last several years, the Fed has acted as if 2 percent were not just a target but a ceiling that should never be breached. But coming out of a terrible recession, with unemployment excruciatingly high, a period of very rapid growth is needed to repair the damage -- and it wouldn't be surprising for such growth to push inflation a bit over 2 percent. A Fed acknowledgment that 2.5 percent inflation would be tolerable for a short while isn't a sign that it has lost its commitment to price stability. Instead, it's a strong statement that it is committed to ensuring a faster recovery.
The more positive language, along with the "we'll do whatever it takes" approach to bond buying, seems designed to reassure Americans that conditions will improve. This, too, is important. With short-term rates close to zero, the Fed's main tool is expectations management. If it can persuade people to expect more growth -- and yes, a little more inflation -- it may help encourage companies to stop sitting on cash and start investing again.
The new policies are improvements, but I don't want to oversell them. As I suggested in a previous column, a more definitive policy shift -- like adopting a new target for monetary policy -- would likely have a greater impact on expectations and in stimulating the recovery.
And the new policy's numerical parameters are too conservative. According to the Fed's own assessments, normal unemployment over the longer run is well below 6.5 percent. If inflation remains low and unemployment gets down to 6.5 percent, there's no reason to rush to raise interest rates.
The most pressing problem, though, is that the Fed's commitment to its new policies appears shaky. Soon after the December meeting, some members of the policy-making committee spoke out against the action -- killing some of the positive buzz created by the policy statement and by a spirited news conference by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Also, the minutes of the December meeting showed that some who had voted for the new guidance on the fed funds rate were skeptical about the complementary action on bond-buying.
No one of the Fed's recent actions is particularly powerful on its own, but together they create a sense of aggressive expansion and commitment to recovery. If the Fed now stops some of them, giving the public a mixed message, the positive effect on expectations could easily evaporate.
So why has the Fed moved slowly, and why are some policy makers threatening to undo the recent actions? In a recent paper, Prof. David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley (my husband), and I found that pessimistic views about the effectiveness and costs of expansionary actions have played a major role in limiting Fed moves over the last few years. Policy makers worry that such actions will do little good and that they could cause inflation, distortions in financial markets and losses on the Fed's portfolio.
I can't say for sure that those views are wrong today. We just don't have enough experience with situations like the current one to have conclusive evidence one way or the other.
But our paper shows that in two periods when the Fed made terrible errors, the same kinds of pessimistic views were present. Faced with the Great Depression of the early 1930s and the high inflation of the early and late 1970s, monetary policy makers did little because they were convinced that action would be ineffective.
Subsequent events proved both decisions wrong. In the 1930s, a propitious gold inflow allowed the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt to conduct monetary expansion without the Fed. Real interest rates plummeted, expectations improved and investment spending and consumer purchases of durable goods took off -- jump-starting the recovery. At the end of the 1970s, a new Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, concluded that monetary policy absolutely could reduce inflation, and he led the Fed to raise interest rates to historic highs. The recession that followed was painful, but inflation did come down -- and it has been low ever since.
WHEN monetary policy makers meet again at the end of this month, they should keep these historical lessons in mind. At the very least, the Cassandras on the committee might want to reread the policy record from the 1930s. The degree to which some of them sound like their Depression-era counterparts might shock them -- and give them pause.
The Fed's new more aggressive policy shows every sign of being helpful, and there are no indications that the feared costs are materializing. So rather than trimming the policy before it can bear fruit, why not give it a chance?
Even better, why not give it some extra oomph? Rather than just continuing the bond-buying program, accelerate it somewhat. Instead of just reiterating the numerical guidelines on the funds rate, policy makers could follow the suggestion of Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, that they lower to 5.5 percent the unemployment level at which the Fed starts to consider raising interest rates. And if Mr. Bernanke wanted to be truly aggressive, he could broach the idea that in a weak economy, a strong dollar isn't necessarily desirable.
The important thing is that hypothetical fears shouldn't stop the Fed's evolution. History is on the side of doing more, not standing on the sidelines.

Abstract: Sure, there are obvious brand-name buildings and tony ZIP codes where the price of entry clearly demands a certain amount of wealth, but middle-class neighborhoods do not really exist in Manhattan -- probably the only place in the United States where a $5.5 million condo with a teak closet and mother-of-pearl wall tile shares a block with a public housing project. [...]could the relentless rise in real estate prices push the middle class to extinction? "A lot of people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth," said Cheryl King, an acting coach who lives and works in a combined apartment and performance space that she rents out for screenings, video shoots and workshops to help offset her own high rent. The average sale price of a home in Manhattan last year was $1.46 million, according to a recent Douglas Elliman report, while the average sale price for a new home in the United States was just under $230,000.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDDRIVE through almost any neighborhood around the country, and class divisions are as clear as the gate around one community or the grittiness of another. From the footprint of the house to the gleam on the car in the driveway, it is not hard to guess the economic status of the people who live there.
Even the landscape is carved up by class. From 15,000 feet up, you can stare down at subdivisions and tract houses, and America's class lines will stare right back up at you.
Manhattan, however, is not like most places. Its 1.6 million residents hide in a forest of tall buildings, and even the city's elite take the subway. Sure, there are obvious brand-name buildings and tony ZIP codes where the price of entry clearly demands a certain amount of wealth, but middle-class neighborhoods do not really exist in Manhattan -- probably the only place in the United States where a $5.5 million condo with a teak closet and mother-of-pearl wall tile shares a block with a public housing project.
In TriBeCa, Karen Azeez feels squeezed. A fund-raising consultant, Ms. Azeez has lived in the city for more than 20 years. Her husband, a retired police sergeant, bought their one-bedroom apartment in the low $200,000 range in 1997.
"When we got here, I didn't feel so out of place, I didn't have this awareness of being middle class," she said. But in the last 5 or 10 years an array of high-rises brought "uberwealthy" neighbors, she said, the kind of people who discuss winter trips to St. Barts at the dog run, and buy $700 Moncler ski jackets for their children.
Even the local restaurants give Ms. Azeez the sense that she is now living as an economic minority in her own neighborhood.
"There's McDonald's, Mexican and Nobu," she said, and nothing in between.
In a city like New York, where everything is superlative, who exactly is middle class? What kind of salary are we talking about? Where does a middle-class person live? And could the relentless rise in real estate prices push the middle class to extinction?
"A lot of people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth," said Cheryl King, an acting coach who lives and works in a combined apartment and performance space that she rents out for screenings, video shoots and workshops to help offset her own high rent.
"My niece just bought a home in Atlanta for $85,000," she said. "I almost spend that on rent and utilities in a year. To them, making $250,000 a year is wealthy. To us, it's maybe the upper edge of middle class."
"It's horrifying," she added.
Her horror, of course, is Manhattan's high cost of living, which has for decades shocked transplants from Kansas and elsewhere, and threatened natives with the specter of an economic apocalypse that will empty the city of all but a few hardy plutocrats.
And yet the middle class stubbornly hangs on, trading economic pain for the emotional gain of hot restaurants, the High Line and the feeling of being in the center of everything. The price tag for life's basic necessities -- everything from milk to haircuts to Lipitor to electricity, and especially housing -- is more than twice the national average.
"It's overwhelmingly housing -- that's the big distortion relative to other places," said Frank Braconi, the chief economist in the New York City comptroller's office. "Virtually everything costs more, but not to the degree that housing does."
The average Manhattan apartment, at $3,973 a month, costs almost $2,800 more than the average rental nationwide. The average sale price of a home in Manhattan last year was $1.46 million, according to a recent Douglas Elliman report, while the average sale price for a new home in the United States was just under $230,000. The middle class makes up a smaller proportion of the population in New York than elsewhere in the nation. New Yorkers also live in a notably unequal place. Household incomes in Manhattan are about as evenly distributed as they are in Bolivia or Sierra Leone -- the wealthiest fifth of Manhattanites make 40 times more than the lowest fifth, according to 2010 census data.
Ask people around the country, "Are you middle class?" and the answer is likely to be yes. But ask the same question in Manhattan, and people often pause in confusion, unsure exactly what you mean.
There is no single, formal definition of class status in this country. Statisticians and demographers all use slightly different methods to divvy up the great American whole into quintiles and median ranges. Complicating things, most people like to think of themselves as middle class. It feels good, after all, and more egalitarian than proclaiming yourself to be rich or poor. A $70,000 annual income is middle class for a family of four, according to the median response in a recent Pew Research Center survey, and yet people at a wide range of income levels, including those making less than $30,000 and more than $100,000 a year, said they, too, belonged to the middle.
"You could still go into a bar in Manhattan and virtually everyone will tell you they're middle class," said Daniel J. Walkowitz, an urban historian at New York University. "Housing has always been one of the ways the middle class has defined itself, by the ability to own your own home. But in New York, you didn't have to own."
There is no stigma, he said, to renting a place you can afford only because it is rent-regulated; such a situation is even considered enviable.
Without the clear badge of middle-class membership -- a home mortgage -- it is hard to say where a person fits on the class continuum. So let's consider the definition of "middle class" through five different lenses.
The Money You Make
We'll start with an obvious marker: If the money you live on is coming from any kind of investment or dividend, you are probably not middle class, according to Mr. Braconi.
If you live in Manhattan and you are making more than $790,000 a year, then congratulations, you are the 1 percent.
Most researchers define the middle class by calculating the median income for a place, and grouping people into certain percentages above or below the absolute middle.
By one measure, in cities like Houston or Phoenix -- places considered by statisticians to be more typical of average United States incomes than New York -- a solidly middle-class life can be had for wages that fall between $33,000 and $100,000 a year.
By the same formula -- measuring by who sits in the middle of the income spectrum -- Manhattan's middle class exists somewhere between $45,000 and $134,000.
But if you are defining middle class by lifestyle, to accommodate the cost of living in Manhattan, that salary would have to fall between $80,000 and $235,000. This means someone making $70,000 a year in other parts of the country would need to make $166,000 in Manhattan to enjoy the same purchasing power.
Using the rule of thumb that buyers should expect to spend two and a half times their annual salary on a home purchase, the properties in Manhattan that could be said to be middle class would run between $200,000 and $588,000.
On the low end, the pickings are slim. The least expensive properties are mostly uptown, in neighborhoods like Yorkville, Washington Heights and Inwood. The most pleasing options in this range, however, are one-bedroom apartments not designed for children or families.
It is not surprising, then, that a family of four with an annual income of $68,700 or less qualifies to apply for the New York City Housing Authority's public housing.
What You Do
"There's no room for the earlier version of the middle class," Mr. Walkowitz said. Firefighter, police officer, teacher and manufacturing worker all used to be professions that could lift a family into its ranks. But those kinds of jobs have long left people unable to keep up with soaring real estate prices.
A police officer with five years' experience in New York makes about $69,000 a year. A teacher with the same number of years in the city's public school system makes between $50,812 and $63,534.
The shift toward a knowledge-based and service economy has created a new set of middle-class jobs, like graphic designer, publishing professional and health care administrator. Positions that would nudge a family into the upper class elsewhere -- say, vice president or director of strategy -- and professions like psychologist are solidly middle class in Manhattan.
The same holds true for jobs in higher education, a growth sector for the city.
The average tenured university professor at New York University or Columbia makes more than $180,000 a year, according to a 2012 survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Sweetening the deal for those looking to buy, N.Y.U. has offered mortgage assistance and discounted loans, while qualified Columbia faculty are eligible for a subsidy of up to $40,000 a year. Some faculty members benefit from university housing that rents well below the market rate, in prime locations on the Upper West Side and in Greenwich Village.
Maya Tolstoy, an associate professor at Columbia and a marine geophysicist who studies seafloor earthquakes, lives with her 9-year-old son in a small two-bedroom apartment in a doorman building on Riverside Drive. Because her building is owned by Columbia, her rent, about $1,800 a month, is manageable on an associate professor's salary, which averages about $125,000. A similar market-rate apartment on the Upper West Side costs about $6,000 a month, according to a monthly report compiled by MNS, a brokerage firm.
"I think it's much tougher for people with my income to survive in Manhattan without subsidized housing," she said. "I am very lucky to have it."
Are Children the Last Straw?
One way to stay in Manhattan as a member of the middle class is to be in a relationship. Couples can split the cost of a one-bedroom apartment, along with utilities and takeout meals. But adding small roommates, especially the kind that do not contribute to rent, creates perhaps the single greatest obstacle to staying in the city.
Only 17 percent of Manhattan households have children, according to census data. That is almost half the national average, making little ones the ultimate deal-breaker for otherwise die-hard middle-class Manhattanites.
Not only do children strain the wallet as that one-bedroom becomes infeasible, but many middle-class families have little confidence in public education. Tuition fees at private schools can reach $40,000 a year. So families decamp to the suburbs or hope that their offspring will test well enough to get into the public school system's gifted-and-talented program, which offers a more challenging education free of charge.
"The trauma of kindergarten I still have not forgotten," said Ms. Tolstoy, who beyond hitting a jackpot of sorts with subsidized Columbia housing, struck gold again when her son was accepted into a gifted-and-talented program.
But to get her son that far, she found it necessary to hire a consultant, costing about $800 for two sessions.
When Did You Get Here?
More than 280,000 units -- nearly half of Manhattan's apartment stock -- is rent-regulated in some fashion. These apartments are either godsends to those who occupy them, or daggers that twist in the hearts of everyone else, left to pay market rate or compete for the borough's remaining vacancies -- 2.8 percent of the housing stock, as measured in 2011. But 30 percent of the residents of rent-stabilized apartments moved in more than 20 years ago.
An intriguing definition of what helps a person gain entry to the Manhattan middle class was ventured by Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, who issued an in-depth report in 2009 that examined the city's changing class dynamics. "Understanding who is middle class, in New York, but especially Manhattan, is all about when you got into the real estate market," he said. "If you bought an apartment prior to 2000, or have long been in a rent-stabilized apartment, you could probably be a teacher in Manhattan and be solidly middle class. But if you bought or started renting in a market-rate apartment over the last 5 or 10 years, you could probably be a management consultant and barely have any savings."
Sabrina Dent was born and raised in Manhattan thinking she was middle class. Ms. Dent grew up attending a private school on the Upper East Side. She did not realize what normal life was until she left Manhattan to attend a public university in Rhode Island, where she paid less in rent than her father had been paying for a 12-by-6-foot parking space in the city.
"That radically readjusted my barometer," she said. Now Ms. Dent is a Web designer in Cork, Ireland, living a regular middle-class life, and unable to imagine why anyone would want to stick it out in Manhattan on a moderate income.
"The only artists I know now who are still in Manhattan," she said, "either made it big and bought, or are still in the rent-controlled studios they landed in 1976, and will leave in a coffin."
Values That Define You
People define class as much by association and culture as they do by raw numbers -- a sense, more than anything, of baseline financial security garnished by an occasional luxury like a vacation, and a belief that things can get better through hard work and determination.
"Middle class, to me, is having a pretty good job, enough money to pay bills and rent, and then a little extra," said Desiree Gaitan, 29, a manager of social media for Shairporter, a tech start-up that arranges shared taxi rides to New York airports. She says she feels middle class even though she makes about $40,000 a year (equivalent to about $17,900 a year in a more typical part of the country).
Ms. Gaitan stays afloat by shopping at thrift stores, picking up baby-sitting gigs when she can, and hanging onto a great deal: she pays $600 a month to share a rent-regulated two-bedroom apartment near Columbus Circle -- a place her roommate's parents found years ago.
"It's tough," she said. "I have a good work ethic, and I think I would like to stay as long as possible, as long as I'm enjoying my career. All of that is worth it at the end of the day, for some psychotic reason."
Are They Dying Out?
"Manhattan has serious affordability problems," said Mr. Braconi, the economist. In the last decade, the percentage of people who are paying "unaffordable rents" (defined as more than 30 percent of their income) has increased significantly, according to a report issued in September by the city's comptroller.
If that trend continues, it will feed the perennial panic that Manhattan's middle class is on the brink of extinction, no longer able to cope with the city's prices and fast retreating to its natural habitat, the suburbs.
It is true that the middle class here is smaller than anywhere else in the country. It is true that price pressures from both real estate and the cost of living are not slowing down anytime soon. But it is also true that calamity has been forecast for over a century now.
"Soon, there will be no New Yorkers," proclaimed the Sunday magazine of The New York Times in 1907, in an article that detailed how families making $1,000 to $3,000 a year -- $24,000 to $72,000 a year in today's dollars -- were being pushed out because of increasing rents, and servants' wages, as well as the crushing cost of ice and coal. Adjusted for inflation, laundry alone for a family cost $115 a week. A pound of chicken? $8.08. Rent, on the other hand, for a "small, middle-class flat in a decent, but unfashionable locality," would seem to be a bargain in today's market, at the price of $272 per room per month.
In 1968, New York magazine documented the mad scramble for affordable apartments in a cover article detailing the extreme lengths to which average people went to secure one. "Surgeons have postponed operations, housewives have gone back to work, hippies have cut their hair and families have destroyed their pets," the magazine reported. "Little hope is held out for the middle-income ($15-20,000 a year) people, career girls who do not want roommates and couples with more than one drawer-sized infant." Brownstones that had sold for $125,000 in 1958, according to the article, were selling 10 years later for twice that much (in today's dollars, a jump from $827,000 to $1.65 million).
Reports of the middle class's demise also appeared in 1978, 1998, 2006 and 2009, when The New York Observer chimed in with "City to Middle Class: Just Not That Into You."
But members of the middle class remain, scattered among the elite and the growing numbers of the working poor, in that place where lucky deals and tiny kitchens converge, wondering, just as they did in 1910 and 1968, how long they'll be able to stay put.
Ms. Azeez in TriBeCa is pondering the question. The only young people she sees moving in around her are often buoyed by parental support, given an apartment at graduation the way she was given a Seiko watch. As her own friends and neighbors age or die out, she wonders, "who is going to take our place?"
Correction: January 27, 2013, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover article on Jan. 20, about what level income is considered middle-class in New York, misstated the amount that a public school teacher in the city with five years' experience can earn. It is between $50,812 and $63,534, not between $64,000 and $75,000.

Full text:   The re-election of President Obama was like a Rorschach test, subject to many interpretations. In this election, each side debated issues that deeply worry me: the long malaise into which the economy seems to be settling, and the growing divide between the 1 percent and the rest - an inequality not only of outcomes but also of opportunity. To me, these problems are two sides of the same coin: with inequality at its highest level since before the Depression, a robust recovery will be difficult in the short term, and the American dream - a good life in exchange for hard work - is slowly dying.
Politicians typically talk about rising inequality and the sluggish recovery as separate phenomena, when they are in fact intertwined. Inequality stifles, restrains and holds back our growth. When even the free-market-oriented magazine The Economist argues - as it did in a special feature in October - that the magnitude and nature of the country's inequality represent a serious threat to America, we should know that something has gone horribly wrong. And yet, after four decades of widening inequality and the greatest economic downturn since the Depression, we haven't done anything about it.
There are four major reasons inequality is squelching our recovery. The most immediate is that our middle class is too weak to support the consumer spending that has historically driven our economic growth. While the top 1 percent of income earners took home 93 percent of the growth in incomes in 2010, the households in the middle - who are most likely to spend their incomes rather than save them and who are, in a sense, the true job creators - have lower household incomes, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 1996. The growth in the decade before the crisis was unsustainable - it was reliant on the bottom 80 percent consuming about 110 percent of their income.
Second, the hollowing out of the middle class since the 1970s, a phenomenon interrupted only briefly in the 1990s, means that they are unable to invest in their future, by educating themselves and their children and by starting or improving businesses.
Third, the weakness of the middle class is holding back tax receipts, especially because those at the top are so adroit in avoiding taxes and in getting Washington to give them tax breaks. The recent modest agreement to restore Clinton-level marginal income-tax rates for individuals making more than $400,000 and households making more than $450,000 did nothing to change this. Returns from Wall Street speculation are taxed at a far lower rate than other forms of income. Low tax receipts mean that the government cannot make the vital investments in infrastructure, education, research and health that are crucial for restoring long-term economic strength.
Fourth, inequality is associated with more frequent and more severe boom-and-bust cycles that make our economy more volatile and vulnerable. Though inequality did not directly cause the crisis, it is no coincidence that the 1920s - the last time inequality of income and wealth in the United States was so high - ended with the Great Crash and the Depression. The International Monetary Fund has noted the systematic relationship between economic instability and economic inequality, but American leaders haven't absorbed the lesson.
Our skyrocketing inequality - so contrary to our meritocratic ideal of America as a place where anyone with hard work and talent can "make it" - means that those who are born to parents of limited means are likely never to live up to their potential. Children in other rich countries like Canada, France, Germany and Sweden have a better chance of doing better than their parents did than American kids have. More than a fifth of our children live in poverty - the second worst of all the advanced economies, putting us behind countries like Bulgaria, Latvia and Greece.
Our society is squandering its most valuable resource: our young. The dream of a better life that attracted immigrants to our shores is being crushed by an ever-widening chasm of income and wealth. Tocqueville, who in the 1830s found the egalitarian impulse to be the essence of the American character, is rolling in his grave.
Even were we able to ignore the economic imperative of fixing our inequality problem, the damage it is doing to our social fabric and political life should prompt us to worry. Economic inequality leads to political inequality and a broken decision-making process.
Despite Mr. Obama's stated commitment to helping all Americans, the recession and the lingering effects of the way it was handled have made matters much, much worse. While bailout money poured into the banks in 2009, unemployment soared to 10 percent that October. The rate today (7.8 percent) appears better partly because so many people have dropped out of the labor force, or never entered it, or accepted part-time jobs because there was no full-time job for them.
High unemployment, of course, depresses wages. Adjusted for inflation, real wages have stagnated or fallen; a typical male worker's income in 2011 ($32,986) was lower than it was in 1968 ($33,880). Lower tax receipts, in turn, have forced state and local cutbacks in services vital to those at the bottom and middle.
Most Americans' most important asset is their home, and as home prices have plummeted, so has household wealth - especially since so many had borrowed so much on their homes. Large numbers are left with negative net worth, and median household wealth fell nearly 40 percent, to $77,300 in 2010 from $126,400 in 2007, and has rebounded only slightly. Since the Great Recession, most of the increase in the nation's wealth has gone to the very top.
Meanwhile, as incomes have stagnated or fallen, tuition has soared. In the United States now, the principal way to get education - the only sure way to move up - is to borrow. In 2010, student debt, now $1 trillion, exceeded credit-card debt for the first time.
Student debt can almost never be wiped out, even in bankruptcy. A parent who co-signs a loan can't necessarily have the debt discharged even if his child dies. The debt can't be discharged even if the school - operated for profit and owned by exploitative financiers - provided an inadequate education, enticed the student with misleading promises, and failed to get her a decent job.
Instead of pouring money into the banks, we could have tried rebuilding the economy from the bottom up. We could have enabled homeowners who were "underwater" - those who owe more money on their homes than the homes are worth - to get a fresh start, by writing down principal, in exchange for giving banks a share of the gains if and when home prices recovered.
We could have recognized that when young people are jobless, their skills atrophy. We could have made sure that every young person was either in school, in a training program or on a job. Instead, we let youth unemployment rise to twice the national average. The children of the rich can stay in college or attend graduate school, without accumulating enormous debt, or take unpaid internships to beef up their résumés. Not so for those in the middle and bottom. We are sowing the seeds of ever more inequality in the coming years.
The Obama administration does not, of course, bear the sole blame. President George W. Bush's steep tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 and his multitrillion-dollar wars in Iraq and Afghanistan emptied the piggy bank while exacerbating the great divide. His party's newfound commitment to fiscal discipline - in the form of insisting on low taxes for the rich while slashing services for the poor - is the height of hypocrisy.
There are all kinds of excuses for inequality. Some say it's beyond our control, pointing to market forces like globalization, trade liberalization, the technological revolution, the "rise of the rest." Others assert that doing anything about it would make us all worse off, by stifling our already sputtering economic engine. These are self-serving, ignorant falsehoods.
Market forces don't exist in a vacuum - we shape them. Other countries, like fast-growing Brazil, have shaped them in ways that have lowered inequality while creating more opportunity and higher growth. Countries far poorer than ours have decided that all young people should have access to food, education and health care so they can fulfill their aspirations.
Our legal framework and the way we enforce it has provided more scope here for abuses by the financial sector; for perverse compensation for chief executives; for monopolies' ability to take unjust advantage of their concentrated power.
Yes, the market values some skills more highly than others, and those who have those skills will do well. Yes, globalization and technological advances have led to the loss of good manufacturing jobs, which are not likely ever to come back. Global manufacturing employment is shrinking, simply because of enormous increases in productivity, and America is likely to get a shrinking share of the shrinking number of new jobs. If we do succeed in "saving" these jobs, it may be only by converting higher-paid jobs to lower-paid ones - hardly a long-term strategy.
Globalization, and the unbalanced way it has been pursued, has shifted bargaining power away from workers: firms can threaten to move elsewhere, especially when tax laws treat such overseas investments so favorably. This in turn has weakened unions, and though unions have sometimes been a source of rigidity, the countries that responded most effectively to the global financial crisis, like Germany and Sweden, have strong unions and strong systems of social protection.
As Mr. Obama's second term begins, we must all face the fact that our country cannot quickly, meaningfully recover without policies that directly address inequality. What's needed is a comprehensive response that should include, at least, significant investments in education, a more progressive tax system and a tax on financial speculation.
The good news is that our thinking has been reframed: it used to be that we asked how much growth we would be willing to sacrifice for a little more equality and opportunity. Now we realize that we are paying a high price for our inequality and that alleviating it and promoting growth are intertwined, complementary goals. It will be up to all of us - our leaders included - to muster the courage and foresight to finally treat this beleaguering malady.

Full text:   THE re-election of President Obama was like a Rorschach test, subject to many interpretations. In this election, each side debated issues that deeply worry me: the long malaise into which the economy seems to be settling, and the growing divide between the 1 percent and the rest -- an inequality not only of outcomes but also of opportunity. To me, these problems are two sides of the same coin: with inequality at its highest level since before the Depression, a robust recovery will be difficult in the short term, and the American dream -- a good life in exchange for hard work -- is slowly dying.
Politicians typically talk about rising inequality and the sluggish recovery as separate phenomena, when they are in fact intertwined. Inequality stifles, restrains and holds back our growth. When even the free-market-oriented magazine The Economist argues -- as it did in a special feature in October -- that the magnitude and nature of the country's inequality represent a serious threat to America, we should know that something has gone horribly wrong. And yet, after four decades of widening inequality and the greatest economic downturn since the Depression, we haven't done anything about it.
There are four major reasons inequality is squelching our recovery. The most immediate is that our middle class is too weak to support the consumer spending that has historically driven our economic growth. While the top 1 percent of income earners took home 93 percent of the growth in incomes in 2010, the households in the middle -- who are most likely to spend their incomes rather than save them and who are, in a sense, the true job creators -- have lower household incomes, adjusted for inflation, than they did in 1996. The growth in the decade before the crisis was unsustainable -- it was reliant on the bottom 80 percent consuming about 110 percent of their income.
Second, the hollowing out of the middle class since the 1970s, a phenomenon interrupted only briefly in the 1990s, means that they are unable to invest in their future, by educating themselves and their children and by starting or improving businesses.
Third, the weakness of the middle class is holding back tax receipts, especially because those at the top are so adroit in avoiding taxes and in getting Washington to give them tax breaks. The recent modest agreement to restore Clinton-level marginal income-tax rates for individuals making more than $400,000 and households making more than $450,000 did nothing to change this. Returns from Wall Street speculation are taxed at a far lower rate than other forms of income. Low tax receipts mean that the government cannot make the vital investments in infrastructure, education, research and health that are crucial for restoring long-term economic strength.
Fourth, inequality is associated with more frequent and more severe boom-and-bust cycles that make our economy more volatile and vulnerable. Though inequality did not directly cause the crisis, it is no coincidence that the 1920s -- the last time inequality of income and wealth in the United States was so high -- ended with the Great Crash and the Depression. The International Monetary Fund has noted the systematic relationship between economic instability and economic inequality, but American leaders haven't absorbed the lesson.
Our skyrocketing inequality -- so contrary to our meritocratic ideal of America as a place where anyone with hard work and talent can "make it" -- means that those who are born to parents of limited means are likely never to live up to their potential. Children in other rich countries like Canada, France, Germany and Sweden have a better chance of doing better than their parents did than American kids have. More than a fifth of our children live in poverty -- the second worst of all the advanced economies, putting us behind countries like Bulgaria, Latvia and Greece.
Our society is squandering its most valuable resource: our young. The dream of a better life that attracted immigrants to our shores is being crushed by an ever-widening chasm of income and wealth. Tocqueville, who in the 1830s found the egalitarian impulse to be the essence of the American character, is rolling in his grave.
Even were we able to ignore the economic imperative of fixing our inequality problem, the damage it is doing to our social fabric and political life should prompt us to worry. Economic inequality leads to political inequality and a broken decision-making process.
Despite Mr. Obama's stated commitment to helping all Americans, the recession and the lingering effects of the way it was handled have made matters much, much worse. While bailout money poured into the banks in 2009, unemployment soared to 10 percent that October. The rate today (7.8 percent) appears better partly because so many people have dropped out of the labor force, or never entered it, or accepted part-time jobs because there was no full-time job for them.
High unemployment, of course, depresses wages. Adjusted for inflation, real wages have stagnated or fallen; a typical male worker's income in 2011 ($32,986) was lower than it was in 1968 ($33,880). Lower tax receipts, in turn, have forced state and local cutbacks in services vital to those at the bottom and middle.
Most Americans' most important asset is their home, and as home prices have plummeted, so has household wealth -- especially since so many had borrowed so much on their homes. Large numbers are left with negative net worth, and median household wealth fell nearly 40 percent, to $77,300 in 2010 from $126,400 in 2007, and has rebounded only slightly. Since the Great Recession, most of the increase in the nation's wealth has gone to the very top.
Meanwhile, as incomes have stagnated or fallen, tuition has soared. In the United States now, the principal way to get education -- the only sure way to move up -- is to borrow. In 2010, student debt, now $1 trillion, exceeded credit-card debt for the first time.

The debt can't be discharged even if the school -- operated for profit and owned by exploitative financiers -- provided an inadequate education, enticed the student with misleading promises, and failed to get her a decent job.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- When Federal Reserve policy makers convened in August 2007, one of the nation's largest subprime mortgage lenders had just filed for bankruptcy, and another was struggling to find the money it needed to survive.
Officials decided not to cut interest rates. The Fed did not even mention housing in a statement announcing its decision. The economy was growing, and a transcript of the meeting that the Fed published on Friday shows officials were deeply skeptical that problems rooted in housing foreclosures could cause a broader crisis.
"My own bet is the financial market upset is not going to change fundamentally what's going on in the real economy," William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told his colleagues at the meeting.
That was on a Tuesday. By Thursday, the European Central Bank was offering emergency loans to continental banks, the Fed was following suit, and an alarmed Mr. Poole had persuaded the board of the St. Louis Fed to support a reduction in the interest rate on such loans. The somnolent Fed was lurching into action.
"The market is not operating in a normal way," the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told colleagues on a hastily convened conference call the next morning. Mr. Bernanke, a former college professor and a student of financial crises, was typically understated as he explained that the Fed was pumping money into the financial system because private investors were fleeing. "It's a question of market functioning, not a question of bailing anybody out," he said. "That's really where we are right now."
More than five years later, the Fed continues to prop up the financial system, and the transcripts of the 2007 meetings, released after a standard five-year delay, provide fresh insight into the decisions made at the outset of its great intervention.
They show that Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues continued to wrestle with misgivings about the need for action, because at the time there was little evidence of a broader economic downturn. Several officials worried that the economy would instead overheat, causing inflation to rise. By December, as the Fed began to act with consistent force, the economy was already in recession.
Officials lacked clear information, relying on anecdotes like a reported conversation with a Wal-Mart executive who said Mexican immigrants were sending less money home. They were also limited by economic models that could not simulate the problems that seemed to be unfolding.
"This may be a situation in which you will have to resolve your ambivalence quickly," Timothy F. Geithner, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, warned in September. "You may not be able to resolve it."
They questioned, too, the Fed's ability to stimulate the economy, an issue that is still at the center of the debate about its policies.
"There's no guarantee whatsoever that this thing will do what we're trying to do," Donald Kohn, then the Fed's vice chairman, said at a meeting later in August. As the Fed debated a strategy to encourage bank lending, he said, "I just think it's worth giving it a try under the circumstances."
But eventually, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues concluded that they could see the future, that they did not like what they saw and that it was time to act.
"At the time of our last meeting, I held out hope that the financial turmoil would gradually ebb and the economy might escape without serious damage," Janet L. Yellen, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in December. "Subsequent developments have severely shaken that belief. The possibilities of a credit crunch developing and of the economy slipping into a recession seem all too real."
The Fed's eventual response, which it expanded significantly in 2008 and 2009, is now widely credited with preventing an even more catastrophic financial crisis and a deeper recession. It is not clear that quicker or stronger action in the fall of 2007 would have made a big difference. Critics focus instead on the Fed's earlier failure to keep banks healthy and to prevent abusive mortgage lending, and on its later role in allowing the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers.
"The outcome would have been different only if the Fed and others had reacted back in 2004, 2005, 2006" to curtail subprime mortgage lending, Mr. Poole, now a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said on Friday in an interview on CNBC.
The transcripts show that the Fed entered 2007 still deeply complacent about the housing market. Officials knew that people were losing their homes. They knew that subprime lenders were blinking out of business with each passing week. But they did not understand the implications for the rest of the nation.
"The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained," Mr. Bernanke said in March.
Officials said at the time that they took particular comfort in the health of the largest banks. Even as the housing market deteriorated, the Fed approved acquisitions by some of the banks with the largest exposure to subprime mortgages, like Citigroup, Bank of America and the Cleveland-based National City.
By the early August meeting, Fed officials had moved from denial to puzzlement. American Home Mortgage, a leading subprime lender, had filed for bankruptcy the previous day. Countrywide Financial, another lender, was looking for a lifeline. The investment bank Bear Stearns had liquidated a pair of mortgage-focused hedge funds.
"It is an interesting question why what looks like $100 billion or so of credit losses in the subprime market has been reflected in multiple trillions of dollars of losses in paper wealth," Mr. Bernanke said at the meeting, referring to the decline of global financial markets.
Three days later, the Fed moved from puzzlement to action.
It acted again the next week. There was, Mr. Bernanke said on a conference call on Thursday, "a certain amount of panic, a certain amount of markets seizing up, with good credits not being able to be financed, and a good deal of concern that there is a potential for some downward spiral in the markets that could threaten or harm the economy."
The Fed's response was relatively modest. It cut the interest rate on loans from its discount window, at which banks borrow from the central bank, by half a percentage point to 5.75 percent, and let banks borrow for up to 30 days rather than reapply daily. Then it arranged for four large banks -- Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wachovia -- to take what it called symbolic loans of $500 million.
Mr. Bernanke wanted to avoid cutting an interest rate that banks paid each other, according to the transcripts, because he did not want to give the impression that the Fed was engaged in the rescue of investors, banks or borrowers that made bad decisions.
"My own feeling is that we should try to resist a rate cut until it is really very clear from economic data and other information that it is needed," he said. "I'd really prefer to avoid giving any impression of a bailout."
But private sources of financing were drying up. The premium banks paid to borrow from other banks, without pledging collateral, widened to 0.85 percentage points in mid-September from 0.1 percentage points in mid-August.
In September, after the government announced that employment had declined in August, the first monthly fall in seven years, the Fed announced that it would reduce its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2003. To punctuate the decision, it cut rates by half a percentage point rather than the more typical quarter-point cut. This time, it mentioned the housing crisis.
But the Fed's biggest steps did not begin until December, when it created the Term Auction Facility, the first of several programs intended to pump money into the financial system, and arranged to put dollars into the European financial system in partnership with the European Central Bank.
By then the Fed had cut rates at three meetings in a row, but the disruption of financial markets was only getting worse, and the economy was showing strain.
The Fed's own staff still forecast that the economy would avoid a recession.
"We came up with this projection unimpaired and on nothing stronger than many late nights of Diet Pepsi and vending-machine Twinkies," David Stockton, a Fed economist, said as he presented the forecast in December.
Mr. Geithner said it was time to prepare for a crisis. "I don't think the past four to six months have been kind to those who have argued that this was just a mild and transitory bump," he said.
The economy might still grow, but it seemed increasingly likely "that we have a deep and protracted recession driven as much by financial headwinds as by other fundamentals," Mr. Geithner said. "There are good arguments for the former, the more benign scenario, but we need to set policy in a way that reduces the probability of the latter."

Full text:   The credit reporting agency Moody's said on Wednesday that it had revised its financial outlook for colleges and universities, giving a negative grade to the entire field.
For the last two years, Moody's Investors Service gave the nation's most elite public and private colleges a stable forecast while assigning a negative outlook to the rest of higher education. (Moody's assigned a negative outlook for the sector in 2009, but it upgraded the most elite ones to stable in 2011-2012.)
On Wednesday, Moody's explained the change by saying that even the best colleges and universities faced diminished prospects for revenue growth, given mounting public pressure to keep tuition down, a weak economy and the prospect that a penny-pinching Congress could cut financing for research grants and student aid.
The report advocates "bolder actions by university leaders to reduce costs and increase operational efficiency."
"The sector will need to adjust to the prospect of muted revenue growth," the report says. "Strong governance and management leadership will be needed by most universities as they navigate through this period of intensified change and challenge."
While Moody's gave a negative outlook for the overall industry, most of the nation's top colleges and universities still carry the top credit rankings.
Nonetheless, the Moody's report reflects a time of rapid and disruptive change in higher education. Before the financial crisis, colleges and universities routinely raised tuition and fees as administrators sought to burnish their reputations -- and the school's rankings -- with new buildings and more student services.
That golden era was upended by the financial crisis. As household income dropped and jobs became scarce for college graduates, families became increasingly vulnerable to college costs and the prospect of students taking on onerous debt. At the same time, institutions could no longer count on an annual windfall from endowment returns, alumni gifts and state financing. All shriveled as the economy soured, and they have not fully recovered.
In the 2011-2012 academic year, for instance, American families spent, on average, 5 percent less on higher education than in the previous year, Moody's said. As a result, 25 percent of the private colleges that Moody's rated did not raise tuition in fiscal 2011 at or beyond the rate of inflation; 21 percent of rated public universities did not do so.
Students have become more dependent on federal grants and loans since the financial crisis. Any curtailment of federal aid could put further budget pressures on schools. Pell Grants for low-income students provided $36.5 billion to colleges and universities in fiscal 2011. That represented a median 21 percent of net tuition revenue for regional public universities.
The rapid emergence of online learning provides both opportunities and challenges for higher education, Moody's said. While online classes could threaten to undermine the residential college model, they could also provide new ways to make money and provide schools with broader audiences.
Moody's said the average debt burden for full-time students grew 55 percent in the 10 years that ended in 2012. But it maintained that the average debt load was manageable for most students, since 72 percent of student loans were held by borrowers with less than $25,000 in debt. Nonetheless, the report noted that the increasing focus on student debt and college affordability by the media and politicians puts additional pressure on college administrators to rein in costs.
"Until universities demonstrate better ability to lower their cost of operations, perhaps through more intensive use of online classes and elimination or reduction of tenure, we expect government officials to produce bolder solutions in response to the public outcry against the cost of higher education," the report said.

Abstract: [...]federal spending on these categories has declined somewhat as a share of the gross domestic product over the past 40 years.

Full text:   It's one of the most fundamental political questions of our time: What's driving the growth in government spending? And it has a relatively straightforward answer: first and foremost, spending on health care through Medicare and Medicaid, and other major social insurance and entitlement programs.
But I thought it was worth reviewing the evidence in a bit more detail. There are a few surprises along the way, some of which liberal readers might like and others of which will please conservative readers.
The Web site usgovernmentspending.com has an abundance of data on federal, state and local spending at different points in time. My focus will be on how government has been spending its money in the present and the past, rather than evaluating any future budgets or projections.
I'll be looking principally at government spending as a share of the overall economy, specifically as compared to the gross domestic product. In the long run, the overall economic health of the country is the most important constraint on fiscal policy. A growing economy gives us a lot of good choices: maintaining or expanding government programs, cutting taxes or holding them at a moderate level, reducing or managing the national debt. A stagnant economy means that everything gets squeezed.
The first chart, below, documents the growth in federal government spending over the past hundred years as a share of gross domestic product spending is broken down into four major categories:1. Entitlement programs, under which I classify government expenditures on health care programs; pensions and retirement programs like Social Security; and welfare or social insurance programs like food stamps and unemployment compensation.2. Military spending3. Interest on the national debt4. Infrastructure and services, under which I include everything else -- the pot that is often referred to as discretionary spending: education spending; fire services, police and the criminal justice system; spending on physical infrastructure including transportation; spending on science, technology, and research and development; and the category called "general government," which largely refers to the cost of maintaining the political system (like salaries for public officials).
The most striking feature of the chart is the extraordinary amount of military spending during World War II (and to a lesser extent, during World War I). Even after World War II, however, military spending constituted the outright majority of federal government spending until 1969.
Military spending makes up closer to 24 percent of federal expenditures today. That's up from the near-term low from 1998 to 2001, when it made up about 20 percent of federal spending. (One contributor to the budget surpluses achieved briefly during the Clinton administration was a peace dividend in the interim between the cold war and the Sept. 11 attacks.) And military spending in the United States has generally been rising relative to inflation and remains very high relative to most other nations. But over the longer term, it has fallen slightly relative to the gross domestic product, and substantially relative to other types of government spending.
Another surprise is how little we are paying in interest on the federal debt, even though the debt is growing larger and larger. Right now, interest payments make up only about 6 percent of the federal budget. In addition, they have been decreasing as a share of the gross domestic product: the federal government spent about 1.5 percent of gross domestic product in paying interest on its debt on 2011, down from a peak of 3.3 percent in 1991.
How is this possible? The reason is that although the government is borrowing a lot of money, it is doing so very cheaply because interest rates are low both over all and on government debt specifically. We're now spending less than 2 percent of the principal annually to service our debt, down from a peak of close to 7 percent in the early 1980s. Borrowing costs aren't expected to remain this low forever, so this ratio is bound to increase some. Fortunately, much of the debt we have issued has relatively long maturities, meaning that we have locked in low rates. (This won't necessarily apply to future deficit spending: one of the consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling would be a significant rise in borrowing costs, which would compound our debt problems later on.)
The growth in federal spending on physical infrastructure and on services provided directly by the government like policing and education, has been modest. In fact, federal spending on these categories has declined somewhat as a share of the gross domestic product over the past 40 years.
It might also be surprising that spending in this category is relatively quite small -- federal expenditures in these areas totaled only about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 -- considering that they make up some of the most traditional functions of government (along with defense).
But part of this is because many of these services are financed and provided for by state and local governments, which spend most of their money in these areas.
That means most of the growth in federal government spending relative to inflation -- and essentially all the growth as a share of the gross domestic product -- has been because of the increased expense of entitlement programs.
We'll return to this theme in a moment, but let's first consider the role played by state and local governments.
While most discussions of government spending focus on what the federal government spends, state and local governments are a bigger part of the picture than you might think. Their collective spending is now the equivalent of about 15 percent of the gross domestic product, not counting money which is granted to them by the federal government for programs administered by states and localities. (By comparison, federal government spending, including grants to the states and interest on the national debt, has recently been about 24 percent of the gross domestic product.)
The states also spend their money much differently than the federal government: principally, as I mentioned, on infrastructure and on services like policing and education. States and localities do spend some on entitlement programs, and their expenditures in this area have been increasing, but federal expenditures have accounted for most of the growth.
However, states and localities pay for essentially nothing that would be classified as military spending. They also accumulate relatively little debt, so they don't pay much in the way of interest; many states are required by law to balance their budgets, or routinely do so as a matter of custom.
The flip side is that states and localities have very limited ability to engage in stimulative spending during economic downturns. Instead just the opposite is true: recessions reduce their tax base, so they either have to increase tax rates or cut services to keep their budgets balanced. The federal government provided various grants to the states in the stimulus package it passed in 2009, offsetting some of the states' expenses, but these programs have since largely expired, and many states and municipalities have had to cut their budgets or raise taxes since then. Partly as a result, about 500,000 local and state government jobs have been lost since 2009, even as private-sector employment has (somewhat) recovered.
Although accounting for state and municipal expenditures alongside federal ones increases the share of government expenditures that are spent on infrastructure programs, it does not change our conclusionabout what is driving the increase in spending relative to gross domestic product entitlement programs, which account for the vast bulk of it.
The usgovernmentspending.com data classifies three subcategories of entitlement programs. Spending on welfare programs like food stamps and unemployment insurance is the most cyclical - or technically the most countercyclical, since much of it kicks in automatically during an economic downturn. Spending on retirement programs, principally Social Security, is the steadiest, but it has been increasing faster than the rate of gross domestic product growth and considerably faster than inflation. And health care spending has been increasing at the fastest rate.
Specifically, overall government spending on entitlement programs increased at a 4.8 annual rate in the 40 years between 1972 and 2011, net of inflation. Health care spending increased at 5.7 percent per year (and federal government spending on health care increased at a 6.7 percent pace). In contrast, the gross domestic product grew at a rate of 2.7 percent over this period, with tax revenues increasing at about the same rate as the G.D.P.
Spending on infrastructure and government services, excluding defense, has kept pace with gross domestic product growth. (Spending on infrastructure and services by the federal government specifically has lagged gross domestic product growth somewhat, growing at 1.8 percent per year.) Also, most of the subcategories of infrastructure and services spending that usgovernmentspending.com tracks have decreased slightly as a share of the gross domestic product, including spending on transportation, education, science and technology. The major exception is spending on the category they describe as "protection," reflecting the increase in the criminal justice apparatus, which has grown at 4.8 percent per year.
Another way to view these data is to allocate the increase in spending-to-G.D.P. between the different categories of expenditures. Total government spending - including federal, state and local spending - rose to about 39 percent of the gross domestic product in 2011 from about 30 percent in 1972. So we have a 9 percent increase to account for, which is equal to about $1.3 trillion per year in current dollars.
Spending on entitlement programs was about $500 billion per year in 1972 in today's dollars. If it had increased at the same rate as the gross domestic product, it would now be about $1.4 trillion. Instead, it is now about $2.9 trillion per year. What this means is that there has been about a $1.5 trillion increase in entitlement spending above and beyond gross domestic product growth. This is actually slightly larger than the overall increase in government spending relative to gross domestic product. This results from the fact that spending on the other categories has been essentially flat relative to the gross domestic product (infrastructure and services), or constitutes a negligible part of the budget for the time being (interest), or actually decreased relative to gross domestic product over the 40-year period (defense).
To clarify: all of the major categories of government spending have been increasing relative to inflation. But essentially all of the increase in spending relative to economic growth, and the potential tax base, has come from entitlement programs, and about half of that has come from health care entitlements specifically.
The growth in health care expenditures, for better or worse, is not just a government problem: private spending on health care is increasing at broadly the same rates and is eating up a larger and larger share of economic activity. It's an immensely complicated problem, but the arithmetic is simple: if we can't slow the rate of growth in health care expenditures, we'll either have to raise taxes, cut other government spending or continue to run huge deficits. Or we could hope to grow our way out of the problem, but health care expenditures may be impeding private-sector growth as well.
And soon, we may cross an important symbolic threshold: when the overall majority of government expenditures are spent on, essentially, insurance programs. (Another way to conceive of the major categories of entitlement programs are as health insurance, retirement insurance, unemployment insurance and so forth). Already, this is true of federal government spending (and it has been true since the early-to-mid-1990s). It is very close to being true even if one also accounts for state and local spending, and may well become true as soon as this year.
Slowing the growth of entitlement spending will not be easy. Particularly in the case of health care, it has become substantially more expensive for individuals with both public and private insurance to purchase the same level of care.
And on a political level, cuts to entitlement programs are liable to be more noticeable to individual voters than cuts to things like infrastructure spending. A 10 percent cut to Social Security or Medicare benefits will surely draw the ire of voters. A 10 percent reduction in the amount allocated to bridge repair, or in the amount of government-sponsored energy research, will affect individual citizens less directly (even if they are perhaps ultimately more economically damaging: most of the academic literature is supportive of high long-run returns to infrastructure and research and development spending on private-sector productivity and economic growth).
Nevertheless, the declining level of trust in government since the 1970s is a fairly close mirror for the growth in spending on social insurance as a share of the gross domestic product and of overall government expenditures. We may have gone from conceiving of government as an entity that builds roads, dams and airports, provides shared services like schooling, policing and national parks, and wages wars, into the world's largest insurance broker.
Most of us don't much care for our insurance broker.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   The United States economy ended 2012 on a surprisingly sound note as factory output increased and low inflation lifted the buying power of consumers, signaling that the economy may weather this year's higher taxes.
Manufacturing output rose 0.8 percent in December, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday, a day after retail sales figures pointed to robust consumer spending last month.
"There is every indication that the improvement may be a reflection of a broader pickup in overall economic activity," said Millan Mulraine, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
The increase in demand for goods appears unlikely to derail the Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy soon, given the lack of inflation. The Labor Department said consumer prices were flat in December, restrained by a decline in gasoline prices.
That is good news for consumers still smarting from the 2007-9 recession. Weekly earnings rose 0.6 percent last month when adjusted for inflation, the department said.
The earnings increase means family budgets started this month on slightly better footing as payroll taxes rose for all workers and the wealthiest Americans faced higher income taxes.
The tax increases, enacted to reduce the federal budget deficit, are expected to restrain consumer spending through June. Some economists predict higher taxes will subtract a percentage point from economic growth this year.
American financial markets were little moved by the data, although the increases in factory output and real earnings beat the forecasts of analysts polled by Reuters.
Gains in manufacturing appeared broad, tempering the view that some of the growth resulted from a temporary rebound after Hurricane Sandy upset many lives on the East Coast in late October and early November.
The output of motor vehicles and parts jumped 2.6 percent, while production of machinery gained 0.6 percent. Factories made 1.5 percent more computers and electronics. Industrial production rose 0.3 percent.
Still, the data offered a reminder that the trend in factory output, like the broader economy, remains lackluster. Output of consumer goods fell 0.1 percent from November, and overall manufacturing gained by only 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter when measured at an annual rate.
"The manufacturing sector is just about keeping its head above water," said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Wednesday's consumer price data reinforced the view that inflation will not reach the Fed's 2 percent threshold soon.
"This leaves Ben Bernanke and the Fed with a free hand to continue with ultra-accommodative monetary policy," said Michael Woolfolk, a currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since late 2008 and has bought about $2.5 trillion in assets to stimulate economic growth and get Americans back to work after the recession.The Fed uses a separate index of inflation that tends to run cooler than the Consumer Price Index. By either measure, annual inflation remains below the Fed's threshold..
In the 12 months to December the price index increased 1.7 percent, the smallest increase since August. A measure of core prices, which strips out volatile food and energy prices to give a better sense of inflation trends, was up 1.9 percent.
The Fed's latest beige book, a collection of anecdotal information on regional economic conditions, showed mild growth across the United States in recent weeks but it indicated no likelihood that economic expansion would accelerate.

Full text:   GUANGZHOU, China -- After a sharp economic slowdown through much of last year, China's economy is growing again -- but not at its previous double-digit pace, and with signs that inflation might become a problem again.
Shops were crowded this past weekend, construction sites show renewed activity and factories are hiring as exports and domestic demand recover -- trends all underlined by government data released over the last several days.
Further data to be released Friday and Saturday -- including monthly, quarterly and annual figures for industrial production, fixed-asset investment, retail sales and overall economic output -- are also expected to show that the Chinese economy, the world's second largest after that of the United States, is expanding once again.
Many shopkeepers are noticing a rebound in retail sales. Among them was Liu Licai, a merchant in southern China who sells curtains and other household goods. Although some industries, like auto manufacturing, still suffer from bloated inventories, retailers like Ms. Liu are finding their shelves too empty and are starting to place more orders with suppliers, keeping factories busy.
"Business has gone up by more than 10 percent in the last several months," Ms. Liu said during a brief lull on an otherwise busy day.
Yet the pace of China's expansion may not be fast enough to do much for the rest of the world. China's imports are growing less than half as fast as its exports, making it hard for China to become the locomotive to pull the global economy out of its half-decade funk. And overall growth is not rebounding to previous levels.
Until last year, the Chinese government set 8 percent annual growth as a goal, and the economy frequently delivered several percentage points more than that.
Then last March, the government pared the goal to 7.5 percent, and actual growth seems likely to be little higher.
"The potential growth rate of the economy has come down," Stephen Green, a China economist in the Hong Kong offices of Standard Chartered, said Sunday. "You don't have to be in the double digits to get inflation."
Prices rose faster in December, according to government data released Friday. Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from the level of a year earlier, their fastest pace since May.
Economists inside and outside China say the true rate of inflation is as much as double the official rate because of methodological problems in the way China calculates inflation.
Mr. Green and other Western economists warned Friday and over the weekend that officially measured inflation at the consumer level could reach 5 percent by the fourth quarter and lead to an increase in interest rates by China's central bank.
Producer prices are still declining, but at a slower pace. They were down 1.9 percent in December from a year earlier, the smallest drop since last May.
Early in an economic recovery, rising prices tend to be a sign that an economy may not have much unused capacity that can be brought into production quickly. Yet Wen Senrong, the sales manager of the Flying Gift Bag store in Guangzhou, said that she was already seeing costs rise, with increases for rent, materials and labor.
"Our lease was renewed recently and our rent went up by a double-digit percentage -- I feel like I am working for the landlord," she said.
Tang Chun, the owner of a factory that makes picture frames in Guangzhou, complained of rising costs for the full range of supplies that she buys, including aluminum, acrylic and glass. But store buyers lack the confidence to accept higher prices, fearing that they will not be able to pass them on to retail customers, she said.
"Every possible cost is going up, including raw material costs and my rent, but I can't raise prices. It's all coming out of my profit margins," Ms. Tang said.
Part of the increase in inflation reflects rising prices for fruits and vegetables, as extremely cold weather in China over the past couple of weeks has damaged winter crops. At the fruit stand where Zeng Xiandan, 25, was stacking tangerines Saturday, prices had just jumped 10 percent to 20 percent for a wide range of produce, including tangerines, which were up 15 percent. Mr. Zeng said the increases had drawn surprisingly little criticism.
"They understand it's because of the cold weather. Customers have not complained," he said.
But economists say the overall rising prices reflect broad shifts in the Chinese economy.
China is awash in cash, since the government has expanded the broadly measured money supply over the past five years much more rapidly than the United States, even though the Federal Reserve's moves have attracted considerably more international attention. China's money supply is now larger than that of the United States, even though China's economy is half as large.
Strong overall growth in credit is powering a recovery in China's construction sector this winter, as businesses and households are starting to find it easier to borrow.
Total credit jumped 28 percent in December from a year ago, led by more corporate bonds and more loans from semi-regulated trusts set up by banks.
Until the last several years, China seemed to be expanding its factories so fast and workers were moving into cities so quickly that China could sustain rapid growth just by fully using those factories and workers.
But an emerging labor shortage, particularly of young workers, has changed that picture. The country's "one child" policy and more years spent in school have meant fewer young people entering the labor force. The Chinese economy remains dominated by manufacturing, and factory overcapacity still exists in some sectors.
At the same time, the labor-intensive service sector is growing rapidly and has far less overcapacity that can be used without causing inflation.
As the Chinese eat out more frequently and as its fast-growing population of elderly increasingly enters nursing homes, expansion is taking place in the catering and health care sectors. These sectors, along with education, have had trouble filling numerous but often low-paying positions.
Rebounding exports and construction have also increased demand for low-wage workers.
Exports leapt 14.1 percent in December from a year earlier, nearly three times as fast as expected, and were led by surging shipments to the United States, data released Thursday showed. Imports rose 6 percent in December, partly because of an 11 percent jump in iron ore imports as steel production rebounded.

Full text:   For three years economic policy throughout the advanced world has been paralyzed, despite high unemployment, by a dismal orthodoxy. Every suggestion of action to create jobs has been shot down with warnings of dire consequences. If we spend more, the Very Serious People say, the bond markets will punish us. If we print more money, inflation will soar. Nothing should be done because nothing can be done, except ever harsher austerity, which will someday, somehow, be rewarded.
But now it seems that one major nation is breaking ranks -- and that nation is, of all places, Japan.
This isn't the maverick we were looking for. In Japan governments come and governments go, but nothing ever seems to change -- indeed, Shinzo Abe, the new prime minister, has had the job before, and his party's victory was widely seen as the return of the "dinosaurs" who misruled the country for decades. Furthermore, Japan, with its huge government debt and aging population, was supposed to have even less room for maneuver than other advanced countries.
But Mr. Abe returned to office pledging to end Japan's long economic stagnation, and he has already taken steps orthodoxy says we mustn't take. And the early indications are that it's going pretty well.
Some background: Long before the 2008 financial crisis plunged America and Europe into a deep and prolonged economic slump, Japan held a dress rehearsal in the economics of stagnation. When a burst stock and real estate bubble pushed Japan into recession, the policy response was too little, too late and too inconsistent.
To be sure, there was a lot of spending on public works, but the government, worried about debt, always pulled back before a solid recovery could get established, and by the late 1990s persistent deflation was already entrenched. In the early 2000s the Bank of Japan, the counterpart of the Federal Reserve, tried to fight deflation by printing a lot of money. But it, too, pulled back at the first hint of improvement, and the deflation never went away.
That said, Japan never had the kind of employment and human disaster we've experienced since 2008. Indeed, our policy response has been so inadequate that I've suggested that American economists who used to be very harsh in their condemnations of Japanese policy, a group that includes Ben Bernanke and, well, me, visit Tokyo to apologize to the emperor. We have, after all, done even worse.
And there's another lesson in Japan's experience: While getting out of a prolonged slump turns out to be very difficult, that's mainly because it's hard getting policy makers to accept the need for bold action. That is, the problem is mainly political and intellectual, rather than strictly economic. For the risks of action are much smaller than the Very Serious People want you to believe.
Consider, in particular, the alleged dangers of debt and deficits. Here in America, we are constantly warned that we must slash spending now now now or we'll turn into Greece, Greece I tell you. But Greece, a country without a currency, doesn't look much like the United States; surely Japan offers a more relevant model. And while doomsayers keep predicting a fiscal crisis in Japan, hyping each uptick in interest rates as a sign of the imminent apocalypse, it keeps not happening: Japan's government can still borrow long term at a rate of less than 1 percent.
Enter Mr. Abe, who has been pressuring the Bank of Japan into seeking higher inflation -- in effect, helping to inflate away part of the government's debt -- and has also just announced a large new program of fiscal stimulus. How have the market gods responded?
The answer is, it's all good. Market measures of expected inflation, which were negative not long ago -- the market was expecting deflation to continue -- have now moved well into positive territory. But government borrowing costs have hardly changed at all; given the prospect of moderate inflation, this means that Japan's fiscal outlook has actually improved sharply. True, the foreign-exchange value of the yen has fallen considerably -- but that's actually very good news, and Japanese exporters are cheering.
In short, Mr. Abe has thumbed his nose at orthodoxy, with excellent results.
Now, people who know something about Japanese politics warn me not to think of Mr. Abe as a good guy. His foreign policy, they tell me, is very bad, and his support for stimulus may have more to do with old-fashioned pork-barrel (tofu barrel?) politics than with a sophisticated rejection of conventional wisdom.
But none of that may matter. Whatever his motives, Mr. Abe is breaking with a bad orthodoxy. And if he succeeds, something remarkable may be about to happen: Japan, which pioneered the economics of stagnation, may also end up showing the rest of us the way out.

Full text:   At the end of last year, just shy of the 11th hour in the fiscal cliff negotiations, President Obama made an offer that included a Republican-backed idea to cut spending by lowering the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits. The move shocked Congressional Democrats and dismayed Mr. Obama's liberal base.
The offer, however, was rejected by House Republicans who could not stomach the tax increases and other concessions that Mr. Obama demanded as part of the deal. The talks moved on, and when all was said and done, Republicans did not get the lower cost-of-living adjustments (known as COLAs) and Mr. Obama did not get the concessions he had sought.
But that is not the end of the story. As the next round of deficit reduction talks gets under way, the administration seems determined to include the COLA cut in any new package of spending reductions. Rather than using the issue as a bargaining ploy, the administration appears to have embraced it as a worthy end in itself.
Is it? In a word, no.
That is not to say that Social Security should be off the table. There are reforms that are eminently sensible, if only the political will could be found to enact them. But reducing the COLA is not a sound idea now and may never be.
At issue is the way inflation is calculated. The administration's offer in the fiscal cliff talks -- and the approach long advocated by Republicans -- calls for using a new measure of inflation, called the "chained" Consumer Price Index, to calculate the COLA.
Unlike the gauge of inflation currently in use, the chained index captures the ability of consumers to adjust their spending across categories as relative prices change -- for instance, spending less on fuel as gas prices go up and more on groceries as food prices go down. Such substitution causes the chained C.P.I. to rise more slowly than the current measure, which would result in a lower annual COLA and huge budget savings. The move to a chained C.P.I. would reduce benefits by some $135 billion over 10 years, and far more in later decades because of compounding.
The administration and other proponents of switching to a chained C.P.I. contend that it is a technical fix in the interest of greater accuracy, not a benefit cut per se.
But that claim does not stand up to scrutiny. The chained index is in many ways a better method of tracking price changes for the broad working population, but there is no compelling evidence that it is better for computing the Social Security COLA.
What is known is that elderly households tend to have lower incomes and lower expenditures than younger households, and that more of their purchases are for needs that cannot be met by switching to products and services in unrelated categories. That indicates that they do not have the same flexibility as younger households to respond to price changes while still maintaining their standards of living. And because of the way it is calculated, the chained C.P.I. would also result in delayed upward adjustments in the COLA in times of accelerating inflation. Such delays would translate into real benefit cuts, leaving retirees worse off.
If, as the administration says, the aim is to set the COLA in the most accurate way possible, then the obvious approach is to have the Bureau of Labor Statistics develop a statistically rigorous index to track inflation as experienced by retirees. A more informal index from the bureau that looks at the effects of inflation on the elderly shows that the COLA is too low, not too high, in part because of medical costs. But the number of households sampled is too small to be sure.
A rigorous index would settle the issue of whether the current COLA adjustments are high, low or about right. The fact that some policy makers are willing, even eager, to move ahead with changing the COLA without having developed a more reliable gauge only feeds the impression that they are trying to get away with an unjustified benefit cut.
In the meantime, there are other, well-researched reforms to Social Security that the administration and other policy makers could pursue. For instance, it is well understood that upper-income people live longer than the less affluent. The formula for determining Social Security benefits could be gradually and modestly adjusted to reflect those longer lives, while making the system more progressive and cutting spending. Another sensible reform would be to raise the level of wages currently subject to the Social Security payroll tax, so that it better reflects the income gains of top earners over the past several decades.
But prematurely forcing through a COLA cut would be unnecessary and unwise.

Full text:   THE odds are good that you haven't yet given up on your New Year's resolutions and that one of them is to swear off those expensive cappuccinos and save money for your old age. That's a typical suggestion from finance gurus, who say we can add thousands of dollars annually to our nest eggs by eliminating such wasteful spending.
But deciding to take your lunch to work or to cancel your cable television won't help nearly as much as you'd think. For all the attention we pay to overspending, we struggle with our personal finances not because we spend too much money on small luxuries but because salaries have stagnated at the same time as the costs of nonluxuries have gone up.
Even as the average household net worth plunged by almost 40 percent between 2007 and 2010, the cost of everything from health care to housing has risen for decades at rates well beyond that of inflation. Almost half of us are living paycheck to paycheck, barely able to save a penny.
In fact, it's long been known that the majority of bankruptcies result from health issues, job losses and fractured families, something no amount of cutting back can protect against.
One of the main reasons we need to borrow money is college loans. Our collective student loan debt is more than $1 trillion, a sum greater than both our credit card debt and our auto loans.
The student loan debt problem is basic: college tuitions have increased at more than quadruple the rate of inflation since the 1980s. If you're a parent, good luck saving for that expense. It's a primary reason students who borrow money (some two-thirds of all undergraduates) now graduate with an average of $26,600 of debt. That, in turn, will make it harder for the next generation to save.
Those who do manage to save still cannot save as much as they need. According to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, the average baby boomer had $42,000 in his retirement account in 2010. That won't go far toward meeting an average couple's future health care costs: $240,000.
And while financial planners often advise older people to work longer, how can they when many leave their jobs because of health problems, or are laid off and, as a consequence of their advanced age, are unable to find new employment?
We seem to want to believe we can budget-cut our way to financial success, maybe because we view monetary setbacks as shameful, nobody's fault but our own. The personal finance establishment endorses our self-blaming tendencies. David Bach became famous promulgating the idea that by cutting out the daily Starbucks run, people could retire as millionaires. Dave Ramsey has lauded men and women who "refused to participate in the recession," as if a bad economy is a problem of attitude. Suze Orman told investors who lost money in Bernie Madoff's infamous scheme that they had "walked right into that financial concentration camp," suggesting they should have heeded complaints the Securities and Exchange Commission all but ignored.
So let me suggest another financial resolution, one that will do more for our future financial outlook than simply forgoing a few consumer goods: talk about money. It's not shameful. Pick a cause, and resolve to fight for change.

Full text:   MUTUAL fund managers tend to be held on a short investing leash, but a small subset of funds lets managers run free and place bets on just about any asset class from any part of the world. As liberating as this go-anywhere mandate is, however, managers of some of the largest of these world allocation funds say that no amount of freedom is helping them today -- because they aren't finding many great opportunities.
Dennis Stattman, who has been a manager at the BlackRock Global Allocation fund for more than 20 years, describes the current environment as "a particularly tough time."
It's not just that many asset classes have already rebounded sharply from their financial-crisis lows and are no longer great values. What concerns Mr. Stattman is that those asset prices have risen partly because of a protracted central-bank easing policy that is increasingly viewed as being closer to the end than the beginning.
"We've already had the beneficial effects of fiscal and monetary easing, so the question now is what happens when normal returns," he says. "Never before in my investing experience has uncertainty been greater, or more important to the markets."
In such unpredictable times, the standard response is to favor bonds over stocks. That's clearly been the move of choice for individual investors, who poured a net $346 billion into bond mutual and exchange-traded funds in the first 11 months of 2012, compared with net inflows of $11 billion into stock mutual funds and E.T.F.'s.
But bonds hold little appeal to the go-anywhere managers.
"Fixed income is not a place for real returns," Mr. Stattman says. BlackRock currently keeps just 25 percent of assets in bonds, well below its neutral benchmark weighting of 40 percent.
Charles de Vaulx, co-manager of the IVA Worldwide fund, also is uninterested in most pockets of the bond market, given yields that often lag inflation. The fund is just 16 percent invested in bonds, and none of that is in United States government issues. "Buy a 10-year Treasury today," Mr. de Vaulx said, "and you are saying you are willing to grow poor slowly, losing 0.9 percent to inflation."
The fund has cut its high-yield, or junk bond allocation from 35 percent in 2009 to less than 8 percent, as yields have fallen from more than 11 percent to less than 6 percent, on average. "We want equity-like returns from high yield," Mr. de Vaulx said. Falling yields make that possible. Today's already-fallen yields, not so much.
Rob Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, who makes the investment decisions for the Pimco All Asset fund, says he finds no asset class truly appealing. "Nothing is strongly attractive," he says, though he adds that at least a few pockets are moderately or mildly attractive. "That's better than being neutral," he says.
Pimco All Asset is abstaining from many of the bonds that are now the favorites of individual investors; the fund's stake in domestic bonds has shrunk to less than 10 percent from 27 percent in 2007.
Instead, Mr. Arnott is looking abroad. Global bonds account for 30 percent of Pimco All Asset, up from 21 percent a year ago. And emerging markets account for a big chunk of the foreign bond stake. Mr. Arnott says he likes the higher relative yields and expects the "illusion of reckless risk" often attached to emerging-market debt to abate.
And as more investors realize that emerging markets account for 40 percent of global gross domestic product, yet are saddled with just 10 percent of global debt, he says, there should be an opportunity for capital gains from emerging-market bonds as increased demand pushes yields lower. (Bond prices rise as yields fall.)
STOCKS and bonds aren't the only destinations for go-anywhere funds. Cash and gold -- valuable balms for uncertainty -- play a significant role in some portfolios.
The First Eagle Global fund began 2012 with about 14 percent in cash, but that has edged up close to 18 percent after a year of strong global stock performance. The fund's portfolio managers have been trimming or selling positions that have appreciated beyond their comfort zone and are finding it harder to come up with solid replacements.
"As value investors, we're in a no man's land where we can't find enough stocks that are cheap enough," says Abhay Deshpande, one of the three managers. "While I can't speak for growth investors, I imagine they are in a no man's land as well where growth is hard to come by." The managers have 10 percent invested in gold as a hedge against "external shocks."
BlackRock Global Allocation has 16 percent in cash and 4 percent in gold. IVA Worldwide has about 18 percent in cash or short-term bonds and 5 percent in gold.
For the stock portions of their portfolios, there is less consensus. Pimco All Asset is nearly 20 percent invested in stocks, all but one percentage point of it in foreign holdings. First Eagle Global is 35 percent invested in domestic stocks, while international stocks account for an additional 37.5 percent.
First Eagle considers Japan and emerging markets to be the best pockets of opportunity abroad, trumping Europe. For all the sturm und drang over monetary and fiscal policy, stock prices of high-quality, European-based global companies like Nestlé "never really got that cheap," says Kimball Brooker Jr., a First Eagle Global co-manager.
The situation is different in Japan, where First Eagle has invested 17 percent of its money and IVA has 11 percent. While stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index traded at an average of 2.2 times book value at year-end, those in the Tokyo Stock Index sell for just about book value, on average, according to Bloomberg.
Granted, Japanese stocks generally have been cheaper than those in the S.& P. 500 for more than 20 years. But managers say that there may be a new catalyst for a rally in Japan. The Liberal Democratic Party was voted back into power there in December with an economic stimulus platform that will include an effort to push down the value of the yen. That could help bolster the global competitiveness of Japanese manufacturers.
ONE very stock-heavy global allocation fund is Ivy Asset Strategy, with 80 percent in equities. And about one-fifth of its stock portfolio is directly invested in emerging markets, especially China. Michael Avery, a co-manager, says that many of the fund's other stock holdings should benefit from rising discretionary incomes in developing markets.
For example, Volkswagen is the fund's third-largest stock investment, and "middle-class Asians want to drive the VW Bug, the upper middle class wants to drive Audis and the upper class wants Bentleys," Mr. Avery says. All three brands are owned by the company.
He says the fund's seemingly high stock allocation isn't abject bullishness. The fund is responding to what the central banks are giving: market-bolstering liquidity for stocks and awful yields on bonds.
"We're mindful central bank monetary policy won't work forever," Mr. Avery says. "The question we are asking ourselves right now is, where do we go next?"

Abstract: [...]1975, wages nearly always accounted for more than 50 percent of the nation's G.D.P., but last year wages fell to a record low of 43.5 percent. Since 2001, when the wage share was 49 percent, there has been a steep slide.

Full text:   FEDERAL income tax rates will rise for the wealthiest Americans, and certain tax loopholes might get closed this year. But these developments, and whatever else happens in Washington in the coming debt-ceiling debate, are unlikely to do much to alter one major factor contributing to income inequality: stagnant wages. For millions of workers, wages have flatlined. Take Caterpillar, long a symbol of American industry: while it reported record profits last year, it insisted on a six-year wage freeze for many of its blue-collar workers.
Wages have fallen to a record low as a share of America's gross domestic product. Until 1975, wages nearly always accounted for more than 50 percent of the nation's G.D.P., but last year wages fell to a record low of 43.5 percent. Since 2001, when the wage share was 49 percent, there has been a steep slide.
"We went almost a century where the labor share was pretty stable and we shared prosperity," says Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard. "What we're seeing now is very disquieting." For the great bulk of workers, labor's shrinking share is even worse than the statistics show, when one considers that a sizable -- and growing -- chunk of overall wages goes to the top 1 percent: senior corporate executives, Wall Street professionals, Hollywood stars, pop singers and professional athletes. The share of wages going to the top 1 percent climbed to 12.9 percent in 2010, from 7.3 percent in 1979.
Some economists say it is wrong to look at just wages because other aspects of employee compensation, notably health costs, have risen. But overall employee compensation -- including health and retirement benefits -- has also slipped badly, falling to its lowest share of national income in more than 50 years while corporate profits have climbed to their highest share over that time.
Conservative and liberal economists agree on many of the forces that have driven the wage share down. Corporate America's push to outsource jobs -- whether call-center jobs to India or factory jobs to China -- has fattened corporate earnings, while holding down wages at home. New technologies have raised productivity and profits, while enabling companies to shed workers and slice payroll. Computers have replaced workers who tabulated numbers; robots have pushed aside many factory workers.
"Some people think it's a law that when productivity goes up, everybody benefits," says Erik Brynjolfsson, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "There is no economic law that says technological progress has to benefit everybody or even most people. It's possible that productivity can go up and the economic pie gets bigger, but the majority of people don't share in that gain."
From 1973 to 2011, worker productivity grew 80 percent, while median hourly compensation, after inflation, grew by just one-eighth that amount, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group. And since 2000, productivity has risen 23 percent while real hourly pay has essentially stagnated.
Meanwhile, it's been a lost economic decade for many households. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, median income for working-age households (headed by someone under age 65) slid 12.4 percent from 2000 to 2011, to $55,640. During that time the American economy grew more than 18 percent.
Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, found that the top 1 percent of households garnered 65 percent of all the nation's income growth from 2002 to 2007, when the recession hit. Another study found that one-third of the overall increase in income going to the richest 1 percent has resulted from the surge in corporate profits.
MANY economists say the stubbornly high jobless rate and the declining power of labor unions are also important factors behind the declining wage share, reducing the leverage of workers to demand higher wages. Unions represent just 7 percent of workers in corporate America, one-quarter the level in the 1960s.
"There are very few occupations or industries where unions are strong enough where they can set standards," says Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute. "There are no standards being set, so companies can push down on wages for all workers, union and nonunion alike." When the Detroit automakers secure two-tier contracts, that enables them to pay new hires $16 an hour, far less than the $28 an hour earned by longtime workers. This also pushes down labor's share.
Pamela Waldron, a cashier at a KFC restaurant in Manhattan, earns $7.75 an hour after eight years on the job and says she last received a raise in 2007. "Being here eight years, I think I should be getting more," she said. "You can fight for a raise, but I don't think you're going to get it."
It is often thought that college graduates can escape these unfortunate wage trends. But college graduates -- hit by the bursting of the tech bubble in the late 1990s and then by the deep recession -- have been hit hard, too. Seventy percent of the nation's college grads have had their after-inflation hourly wages decline since 2000, according to the Economic Policy Institute, with the typical graduate experiencing a 3.1 percent decline.
Jared Bernstein, who served in the Obama administration as executive director of the White House Task Force on the Middle Class, said many steps should be taken to increase labor's income share, including raising the minimum wage, pushing down the jobless rate, enacting laws that make it easier for workers to unionize and increasing wage subsidies for those on the bottom. He also said the federal government, in spending hundreds of billions on health care, might insist that providers pay home-care aides or lab technicians $20 an hour rather than $10. "There's no reason why a lab technician with a few years of community college shouldn't be able to find her way into some segment of the middle class," he said.
Professor Katz of Harvard said it would make sense to create a more progressive tax system when corporations and the top 1 percent are commanding more of the economic pie. He said those on top should agree to some redistribution and to invest in the next generation.
"We'll end up with a larger pie, and they'll be better off -- even though they may think it clashes with their own self-interest," he said.

Full text:   WE typically blame Washington for not doing more to help the economy grow. But what if we have it backward: What if it is the weak economy that is driving the failures in Washington?
That is what Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard economist who has studied the way slow growth frays societies and strains politics, thinks. "We could be stuck in a trap," he told me last week. "We could be stuck in a perverse equilibrium in which our absence of growth is delivering political paralysis, and the political paralysis preserves the absence of growth."
Consider how different our politics might be today if the economy had not collapsed in 2008 and not been mired in sluggish growth ever since. A ballpark estimate suggests that if the economy were to grow one percentage point more than expected in each year over the next 10, the deficit would shrink by more than $3 trillion. That would be more than enough to set the ratio of our debt to our annual economic output on a comforting downward trajectory. Moreover, it would happen without making cuts to a single program, like Medicare or food stamps, or without raising a single dollar of additional tax revenue. Even a much smaller boost to growth -- say one-tenth of a percentage point per year, or even half that -- would make Congress and the White House's burden hundreds of billions of dollars lighter.
And consider how much better deficit reduction might feel to families in a growing economy, compared with a limping one. The recovery in the past year has delivered only sluggish wage growth, with much erased by inflation as more of a worker's paycheck goes to paying for more expensive groceries, tuition bills and gas. The end of a payroll tax holiday was only one small portion of the fiscal deal the White House and Republican leaders brokered at the turn of the year. Yet it was enough to wipe out a full year's worth of wage gains entirely.
Indeed, even before the economic crisis, middle-class incomes had stagnated, with the economy's gains primarily going to a thin sliver of wealthy families. Then, of course, the crisis hit, forcing millions into unemployment and millions more into poverty. Given that reality, Democrats have fought for making the George W. Bush-era tax cuts permanent for 98 percent of households. Republicans have argued that nobody should have to shoulder the burden of tax increases at all.
"Everything is easier to do if the economy is growing," says William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution. "If you want to cut spending, it is easier to do in an environment where people think they are going to have robust income growth and aren't as dependent on government. In terms of taxes, growth gets you not just more income to tax, but taxpayers moving into higher rates."
Yet growth has broadly disappeared from the fiscal discussion that continues to occupy Congress and the White House, a discussion that has focused obsessively on deficits and debts, spending and taxes and fairness. But growth will be one of the most crucial determinants of whether the country can find its way back to fiscal health in the long run.
Indeed, the United States is currently facing a burden of debt so large that, hypothetically, it would take more than half of the country's economic output over a whole year to pay it off. It is also recovering from a recession so deep and a recovery so sluggish that there has been no net job growth since 2005.
That makes deficit reduction vastly harder, as it means asking voters who are already struggling to sacrifice more now in order to avert the abstract threat of a future debt crisis. "I do think that part of what we're seeing -- the nasty tone of our politics, the anti-immigrant sentiment -- has a lot to do with the fact that the average American family has now seen no increase in its real income for 15 years," said Mr. Friedman, the Harvard economist.
The problem is that it is not easy to increase growth, and it is particularly difficult if you are also trying to reduce deficits. The deal just struck by Congress to remove the worst of the blow from the so-called fiscal cliff will nevertheless give the economy a cold chill of austerity this year, with forecasters estimating that the expiration of that payroll tax holiday, new tax hikes and previously legislated spending cuts might cut 2013 economic growth from 3 percent to 2 percent or even lower.
AT the same time that the fiscal cliff deal did little for growth, it did little to reduce deficits either. Indeed, the deal, as a whole, increased the debt by almost $4 trillion over 10 years as compared with simply going over the cliff.
That comes with its own growth implications. "We've put ourselves in the box that we have an economy so heavily laden with debt that anyone thinking about growing-expanding-hiring here is facing a fundamental roll of the dice," said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a top Republican economist. At some point, Mr. Eakin says, the country would need to increase taxes, slash social spending or face significantly higher borrowing costs -- none of which would help businesses or individuals. "We're giving people a terrible deal over any sensible horizon," he told me.
That is why the original White House proposal and many bipartisan deficit proposals -- like those put forward by the Simpson-Bowles commission or Alice Rivlin of Brookings and former Senator Pete Domenici -- included a jolt of stimulus to help ensure growth as the country continues to recover from the recession.
The idea is that we do not have to choose between aiding growth now and cutting deficits later. We can simply put in place an integrated policy that does both. This is particularly true given that borrowing costs for the federal government rest at record lows, making growth-boosting investments now and deficit reduction later a particularly good deal by historical standards.
It has frustrated many economists that Congress has thus far been unable to agree on such a package. But this is where the chicken-and-egg problem of bad policy in a bad economy comes into play: It is perhaps the case that a side effect of bad economies is bad policy, which then makes the economy worse, which makes politics worse, and so on.
A potential example of how that might manifest in an extreme fashion is the debt ceiling. The unusually bad economic and budgetary conditions the country has faced in recent years have led Republicans to make the unprecedented decision to threaten national default unless the White House accedes to their preferred economic policies -- namely finally making significant cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.
If the two sides are unable to come to an agreement by the deadline, the United States government could fail to pay its obligations for the first time in history, triggering global financial chaos and doing terrific damage to the United States economy. Thus would a bad economy have led to bad political decisions that ended in a much worse economy.
At this point, even the optimists do not sound that optimistic. Their argument is not that fast growth will return quickly, but that it will, eventually, return. "I don't think the long-term growth picture has changed at all," says Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. "What we have been going through is wrenching, and it's hard to say it is temporary because it has been going on for a while. It's a deep hole, and it's taking a long time to get out. But we'll get on the other side of this."

Abstract: When I reached him this week, he offered these predictions: "The great bond bear market has begun, starting with Treasuries, which should see years of losses as interest rates gradually normalize. Equities, which outperformed bonds in 2012, will continue to do well, driven by rising earnings, strong free cash flow, solid profit margins, low inflation and attractive valuation relative to bonds.

Full text:   To many politicians, the deal that raised taxes on the wealthy and averted the fiscal cliff was a sellout, a cop-out, a Band-Aid -- in short, nothing good. And now the debt ceiling showdown is looming. So why have stock investors cheered, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to five-year highs?
My annual survey suggests that investment experts are cautiously upbeat about the economy and the stock market (but not bonds) for 2013, even though they acknowledge that political dysfunction in Washington poses risks. The tax deal may have upset Tea Party Republicans looking for big cuts in entitlement spending and liberals demanding even bigger tax increases on the wealthy. But investors seem to be taking the long view that the warring factions did in the end reach a deal, and it amounts to a $4 trillion stimulus compared with what would have happened if Congress had done nothing. Stimulus may be a bad word in Washington, but many investors seem to believe that continued deficit spending and only a modest tax increase will be good for the economy and corporate profits, at least this year.
The experts I consulted a year ago -- Bill Miller for stocks, Bill Gross for bonds and Karl E. Case for real estate -- proved accurate in their predictions for 2012. So I asked them for a return engagement. I also spoke to Byron Wien, vice chairman and a senior adviser at Blackstone. Last year, Mr. Wien was one of the few pundits who was exactly right about the stock market, predicting that the S.& P. 500 would close the year "over 1,400." The index ended the year at 1,426, a gain of 13.4 percent for the year.
Bill Miller:
'The great bond bear market has begun'
Perhaps the biggest comeback of 2012 belongs to Mr. Miller of Legg Mason, who became a mutual fund legend by beating the S.& P. 500 for 15 consecutive years, from 1991 to 2005. Then, during 2008 and the financial panic, he seemingly lost his magic touch. His fund plunged 55 percent. The Wall Street Journal, in its headline about the fund's dismal returns, spoke of his "defeat." And after another disappointing year in 2011, he retired as head of the Legg Mason Value Trust, the firm's flagship fund.
But Mr. Miller kept his hand in the market, managing the much smaller Legg Mason Capital Management Opportunity Trust. When I sought him out a year ago, reasoning that even the most brilliant investors can be expected to have a few bad years, he was bullish on stocks. That proved good advice. Mr. Miller's fund gained over 40 percent in 2012, and was the top-performing mutual fund in Morningstar's database. How did he do it?
Mr. Miller made big bets on the battered and out-of-favor homebuilding and financial sectors, the kind of contrarian strategy that served him well for so many years. Major holdings like Pulte Homes (which gained 160 percent over the past year) and Bank of America (which nearly doubled) were some his best-performing stocks.
Mr. Miller remains optimistic about stocks for 2013, with an asterisk. When I reached him this week, he offered these predictions: "The great bond bear market has begun, starting with Treasuries, which should see years of losses as interest rates gradually normalize. Equities, which outperformed bonds in 2012, will continue to do well, driven by rising earnings, strong free cash flow, solid profit margins, low inflation and attractive valuation relative to bonds. The path of least resistance for stocks and the economy is higher. The chief risk is the dysfunctional political environment, which could derail what otherwise is a very promising outlook."
Mr. Wien, whose long career on Wall Street included stints at Morgan Stanley and Pequot Capital, told me he's "gloomy" about prospects in Washington. "We can't solve our problems simply by getting the rich to pay more. We have to broaden the tax base, revise the tax code and tackle the structural problems we aren't facing. We need to deal with entitlements. The latest deal did absolutely nothing to address that. I don't know if democracy can solve these problems."
Despite his success at predicting the market last year, Mr. Wien isn't putting a number on the S.& P. 500 this year, but his expectations are modest. He expects the S.& P. 500 to test 1,300 at some point, which would be about a 10 percent decline from current levels, before ending the year about where it is now. "I don't expect the stock market to do much this year," he said. "Most analysts are forecasting returns of 10 percent or more, but I think earnings could be down for the year, which would make it hard for the market to gain that much."
But he's optimistic about stock markets in some other countries, especially China, where stocks lagged last year, and Japan, which has been in the doldrums for years. He's forecasting a 20 percent gain this year for Chinese shares.
Bill Gross: 'Ashes in our stocking'
After a rough 2011, Mr. Gross, the highly regarded bond expert and a founder of the investment firm Pimco, bounced back last year. Pimco's Total Return Fund, which Mr. Gross manages, returned over 10 percent in 2012, a year when short-term Treasury bonds were yielding close to zero. A year ago, he told me that tax-free municipal bonds, which he termed a "deserted" asset class because of widespread fears of municipal bankruptcies, would provide healthy returns. He was right: municipal bond returns averaged over 7 percent last year, and some bonds earned double-digit returns
But Mr. Gross is far more muted now. "I'm afraid there are going to be ashes in our stocking this year," he said, "and that applies to almost all asset classes. Bonds are priced not just for perfection, but with close to 0 percent yields. The juice has been squeezed out of the orange. You just can't get to 10 percent returns."
Will 2013 be the year that interest rates in the United States finally start to rise, which could devastate returns for fixed-income investors? (Bond prices move inversely to interest rates.) A growing number of experts (including Mr. Miller) think so, but not Mr. Gross. "I don't see a lot of risk in bonds," Mr. Gross said. "The Federal Reserve is buying, and there's no real risk until the Fed declares the war is over. It's looking for 6.5 percent unemployment. By any reasonable standard, that's going to be a long time coming -- certainly not in 2013, and probably not for at least two to three more years."
Mr. Gross likes bonds from emerging market countries as well as from Italy and Spain. And for conservative investors who prize safety, he recommends Treasury Inflation Protected Bonds, or TIPs, even though their nominal yields are minuscule. "I like countries like Brazil and Mexico especially," he said. "They have half the debt the United States does relative to G.D.P. They have much better growth prospects. Mexican bonds yield about 6 percent and Brazil is at 8.5 percent. And an emerging market bond fund that holds countries like this would be attractive."
Karl Case: 'A lot of reasons to be optimistic'
Last year will probably go down as the year that residential real estate prices hit bottom and began to rise after the collapse that began in 2007. This came as no surprise to Mr. Case, an emeritus professor of economics at Wellesley College. Mr. Case's name is practically synonymous with real estate values, since he helped create the widely cited S.& P. Case-Shiller Index of housing prices (along with the Yale economics professor Robert Shiller). A year ago, he told me it was a "terrific" time to buy a house.
He was right, at least for most cities. Last month, Standard & Poor's reported that its Case-Shiller 20-city composite index showed a 4.5 percent gain. Prices in hard-hit Phoenix have now gained for 13 consecutive months. And even in New York City, which along with Chicago was one of just two markets where average prices dropped in 2012, prices of high-end properties hit records, a trend Mr. Case expects to continue.
"Phoenix is amazing," Mr. Case said last week. "California is strong, and it's doing what it's done in every other cycle, which is important, because California makes up one-fourth of the housing value in the United States. But residential real estate is not going to go up like a rocket ship."
That's because the slump was so severe that expectations for homeownership have been sharply lowered. Talk in Washington of eliminating or curbing the mortgage deduction in the name of tax reform is weighing on prices. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both taxpayer-supported, are still guaranteeing most mortgages, which isn't sustainable, he said.
As a result, "the recovery won't be anything like we've seen in the past," Mr. Case predicted. "We're cheering because we got to 800,000 housing starts. That's still weak. It only looks good because we dug ourselves into such a deep hole." But real estate tends to move in longer cycles, and Mr. Case is still saying now is a good time to buy. "There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic, but cautiously so," he said.

Abstract: "The cumulative effects of years of depressed family income and net worth, as well as uncertain job prospects for many recent graduates, are combining to soften student market demand at current tuition prices," Emily Schwarz, a Moody's analyst and lead author of the report, said in a statement.

Full text:   An annual survey of colleges and universities found that a growing number of schools face declining enrollment and less revenue from tuition.
The survey, released by the credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service on Thursday, found that nearly half of colleges and universities that responded expected enrollment declines for full-time students, and a third of the schools expected tuition revenue to decline or to grow at less than the rate of inflation.
"The cumulative effects of years of depressed family income and net worth, as well as uncertain job prospects for many recent graduates, are combining to soften student market demand at current tuition prices," Emily Schwarz, a Moody's analyst and lead author of the report, said in a statement.
The growing financial challenges for colleges and universities come as students and graduates have amassed more than $1 trillion in student debt, and many are struggling to pay their bills. Nearly one in six people with an outstanding federal student loan balance is in default, the federal government says.
Before the financial crisis of 2008, colleges and universities routinely raised tuition with little effect on the number of prospective students who applied. Some private colleges said that applications actually rose when they increased prices, apparently because families equated higher prices with quality.
But that attitude has changed, in part because family incomes have declined. Ms. Schwarz also noted, "Tougher governmental scrutiny of higher education costs and disclosure practices is adding regulatory and political pressure to tuition and revenue from rising at past rates."
In addition, she noted that budget negotiations in Congress could lead to cuts in student aid programs while the share of students that depend on government help continued to rise. At public universities, federal loans finance a median of 40 percent of student charges; at private schools, the median is 21 percent.
While nearly half the schools that responded to the survey expected enrollment declines, the changes are expected to be minimal and overall enrollment should remain relatively flat. The enrollment declines are more pronounced among graduate programs; small, lower-rated universities; and public schools in the Northeast and Midwest, where the number of high school seniors is declining.
By comparison, about 15 percent of the schools that responded to the survey in the fall of 2010 reported enrollment declines.
Daniel J. Hurley, director of state relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, said he was not surprised by the findings. He said that after years of cuts, he expected an uptick in state financing for public colleges and universities in the coming year.
In addition, he said states had become more strategic in how they finance higher education, offering incentives for schools that provide more graduates in critical fields, like engineering.
Tony Pals, spokesman for the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, which represents nonprofit private schools, said the report confirmed the tough realities of higher education. "Economic, demographic, marketplace and technological trends are converging to cause an unprecedented time of change for higher education. The new reality is that colleges are expecting to have to do more with less for years to come," he said in an e-mail.
But Mr. Pals noted that his members had a history of resiliency and innovation. "We are seeing a jump in three-year bachelor's degree programs, so-called no-frills satellite campuses and academic partnerships between four-year private colleges and local community colleges."
Over all, 18 percent of private universities and 15 percent of public schools in the survey projected a decline in net tuition revenue for fiscal 2013. A much larger share, one-third, said net tuition revenue would decline or grow by less than 2 percent.
"Such weak revenue growth often means a college cannot afford salary increases or new program investments unless it cuts spending on staff and existing programs," the Moody's report said. By comparison, in fiscal 2008, only 11 percent of private schools and 9 percent of public schools did not increase tuition revenue by 2 percent or more.
Since the financial crisis, tuition at public schools has grown more rapidly than private ones, largely to offset sharp costs in state financing. Public universities have responded by recruiting more out-of-state and international students, who can pay more than in-state students.
Private schools have provided more and more financial aid to students to offset their higher price, a trend that many view as unsustainable.
Moody's has a more upbeat view of the most elite private schools and flagship public universities, which continue to have strong student demand and, in many instances, many other sources of revenue.
The Moody's survey included 165 nonprofit private universities and 127 four-year public universities.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said on Thursday that it sent $88.9 billion in profit to the Treasury Department in 2012, a record that reflected the vast expansion of the central bank's investment portfolio.
The Fed is required by law to hand over a large majority of its profits, a long-standing provision that has become a lot more lucrative in recent years. Because the money is transferred at regular intervals throughout the year, Thursday's report does not affect the imminent arrival of the debt ceiling.
As part of its campaign to stimulate the economy, the Fed over the last five years has amassed $2.7 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. And the central bank is still expanding its holdings by $85 billion a month.
The interest payments on those securities are the primary source of the Fed's profits. The Fed has transferred a total of $335 billion to the Treasury since 2009, compared with $147 billion in the previous five years, adjusted for inflation. The Fed has transferred at least some profit to the Treasury every year since 1934.
Because the Fed mostly holds debt issued by the federal government, its profits -- which totaled $91 billion in 2012 -- are largely payments from the government. By returning that money to the government, the central bank in effect is letting the government borrow at no cost.
Some conservative politicians say this back-and-forth -- and the Fed's broader efforts to reduce interest rates -- are worsening the government's fiscal problems by making debt seem less onerous and spending cuts seem less necessary.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has acknowledged the benefit, jokingly describing the savings as "interest that the Treasury doesn't have to pay to the Chinese." But Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials note that the purchases have their own purpose, to stimulate the economy, and will not continue indefinitely. They also note that Congress is responsible for its own behavior.
The Fed buys Treasuries and mortgage bonds to make them less profitable, which makes borrowing cheaper and encourages investors to take larger risks on potentially more lucrative, alternative investments. Returns on Treasuries are so low that many investors are losing money after adjusting for inflation. The Fed's ability to profit nonetheless is a result of its unique business model: it pays for securities by creating money.
But there are risks. Higher interest rates would reduce the value of the Fed's securities. And the central bank has incurred a new cost in recent years, paying interest on the reserves that private banks keep with the central bank. That has allowed the Fed to buy assets without increasing the amount of money in circulation, but keeping the money in its vaults could require it to pay higher rates as the economy improves.
The Fed spent about $4.9 billion on its own operations last year. It provided another $387 million to finance the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency created by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 to take over the work of protecting consumers after lawmakers decided that the Fed and other federal banking regulators had failed to do so.

Full text:   RICHMOND, Va. -- Jeffrey M. Lacker, the Federal Reserve's most persistent internal critic, does not much resemble a firebrand. He is personally cheerful, professionally inclined to see both sides of an issue and quick to acknowledge he may not be right. He says he would rather be wrong.
But for the last several years, Mr. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, has warned repeatedly that the central bank's extraordinary efforts to stimulate growth are ineffective and inappropriate and, worst of all, that the Fed is undermining its hard-won ability to control inflation.
Last year, Mr. Lacker cast the sole dissenting vote at each of the eight meetings of the Fed's policy-making committee, only the third time in history a Fed official dissented so regularly.
"We're at the limits of our understanding of how monetary policy affects the economy," Mr. Lacker said in a recent interview in his office atop the bank's skyscraper here. "Sometimes when you test the limits you find out where the limits are by breaking through and going too far."
As the Fed enters the sixth year of its campaign to revitalize the economy, the debate between the Fed's majority and Mr. Lacker -- whose views are shared by others inside the central bank, as well as some outside observers -- highlights the extent to which the Fed is operating in uncharted territory, making choices that have few precedents, unclear benefits and uncertain consequences.
The economy continues to muddle along, shadowed by the threat of another government breakdown, and the crisis of high unemployment is only slowly receding. But in trying to address those problems by suppressing interest rates, the Fed risks the unleashing of speculation and inflation.
It is basically a matter of disposition: is it better to risk doing too much, or not enough?
Mr. Lacker, 57, often uses the word "humility" in describing his views. He means that the Fed should recognize that its power to stimulate the economy is limited, both for technical reasons and because it should not encroach on the domain of elected officials by picking winners and losers.
As he sees it, the Fed's current effort to reduce unemployment by purchasing mortgage-backed securities crossed both lines. He sees little evidence that it will help to create jobs. And he says that buying mortgage bonds is a form of fiscal policy, because it lowers interest rates for a particular kind of borrower.
But Mr. Lacker is at pains to emphasize that his disagreement with the other 11 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, who supported the purchases, is not about the need for help.
"It's very unfair to think of me as not caring about the unemployed," he said. "It just seems to me that there are real impediments, that just throwing money at the economy is unlikely to solve the problems that are keeping a 55-year-old furniture worker from finding a good competitive job."
That sense of caution is deeply frustrating to proponents of the Fed's recent efforts. The economists Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer wrote in a paper published last month that such pessimism about the power of monetary policy is "the most dangerous idea in Federal Reserve history."
"The view that hubris can cause central bankers to do great harm clearly has an important element of truth," wrote the Romers, both professors at the University of California, Berkeley. "But the hundred years of Federal Reserve history show that humility can also cause large harms."
It also makes an interesting contrast with Mr. Lacker's personality. His favorite escape is driving a Porsche Boxster racecar; a model sits on a shelf at his office. He jokes that the track is the only place that people don't ask him about interest rates -- although, he adds, they do care about fuel prices.
And at the Fed, an institution that likes consensus, dissenting also requires a certain amount of boldness. Mr. Lacker has now said no at 13 of the 24 regular policy meetings he has attended as a voting member, one-third of all dissents since Ben S. Bernanke became the Fed's chairman in 2006. He voted in 2006, 2009 and 2012 as part of the regular rotation of reserve bank presidents.
Even some who sympathize with his concerns doubt the efficacy of such public stands.
"The Fed is a club and dissenting puts you outside the club," said Allen H. Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University who is a leading historian of the central bank. "You send the message to the public and that's a good thing, but you also send a message inside the Fed and that's not a good thing. You are isolating yourself."
But Gary H. Stern, who served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1985 until 2009, said that the dissents were valuable.
"If you have a forceful and compelling rationale, I think that is constructive internally and externally," Mr. Stern said. "I think the Fed obviously has been in my opinion dealt a difficult hand. To some extent the waters are uncharted. It would be in a way remarkable if you had unanimity under these circumstances and I think Jeff's concerns about what the Fed can accomplish in this environment and what the risks on the inflation side may be, I think that those points need to be taken seriously."
Mr. Lacker joined the Richmond Fed as an economist in 1989 after working as a professor at Purdue University. The regional reserve banks tend to gather like-minded economists, and Richmond has a long tradition of skepticism about monetary policy.
He became president in 2004, in an era of complacent satisfaction for central bankers, who took credit for a period of extraordinary economic stability that Mr. Bernanke and others called "The Great Moderation." Mr. Lacker recalled that he regarded the major questions of monetary policy as settled.
"I thought we'd converged around a good healthy framework where the range of debate was going to be limited," he said. "I was wrong about that."
He continued to agree with Mr. Bernanke and the majority of the committee about some things. He dissented only once during 2009, otherwise voting with the majority in support of the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy by suppressing interest rates and buying Treasury securities. He also supports Mr. Bernanke's efforts to increase transparency; he sees his own efforts to explain his dissents as part of the broader work of demystifying monetary policy.
Given the consequences if he's right, does he ever worry that he's not shouting loudly enough?
"I haven't been running around like my hair's on fire," he said. "And I think for me that reflects some humility. I'm not absolutely certain that the risks I worry about are going to show up. The majority of the committee, and the course they're on, they could be right."
"And," he said, "I sincerely hope that they are right."

Iranian Oil Minister Concedes Sanctions Have Hurt Exports

Abstract: Both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Iran is a major member, and the International Energy Agency, a group of mostly Western oil-importing countries, have reported that Iran's crude exports fell to roughly a million barrels a day by the end of 2012, compared with 2.4 million a year earlier.

Full text:   Iran's oil minister acknowledged for the first time on Monday that petroleum exports and sales had fallen by at least 40 percent over the past year, contradicting his previous denials and providing an unusual public admission that the cumulative impact of Western economic sanctions has grown more severe.
The acknowledgment by the oil minister, Rostam Qasemi, came as new restrictions from the sanctions are threatening to further choke Iran's ability to sell oil, its most important export. Under provisions of an American law that take effect in February, importers of Iranian oil that have been exempted from the sanctions cannot send the money used to buy it to Iran without risking penalties in the United States. The result could impound billions of dollars' worth of Iran's expected oil revenue in the banks of those importing countries.
Additional punitive measures, which President Obama signed into law last week, broaden the roster of blacklisted Iranian industries to include all energy, shipping and shipbuilding enterprises and seek to restrict barter transactions that Iran has been using to circumvent earlier sanctions. Some critics of the new steps say they nearly amount to a trade embargo.
In another consequence of the sanctions' impact, the Oil Ministry on Monday stopped the sale of jet fuel to Iran's heavily indebted domestic airlines unless they pay cash. The semiofficial Mehr news agency reported that most commercial airline flights inside the country had been canceled as a result.
Mr. Qasemi, a former Revolutionary Guards commander who was appointed oil minister more than a year ago, had consistently asserted that Iran had no problem selling its oil. In September, in an address to the Parliament, he said that oil exports were rising, despite outside data that showed a sharp drop. At other times, he has threatened to halt all oil exports in retaliation for the sanctions, apparently in a vain effort to raise oil prices by frightening global oil traders.
Both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Iran is a major member, and the International Energy Agency, a group of mostly Western oil-importing countries, have reported that Iran's crude exports fell to roughly a million barrels a day by the end of 2012, compared with 2.4 million a year earlier.
Other Iranian officials have said it is clear that the country's oil exports have suffered.
Economists knowledgeable about Iran's sanctions problems said Mr. Qasemi's acknowledgment of the export decline, made at a parliamentary meeting on finances, was inevitable because the government must find a way to fill a large gap in the budget -- a gap that revenue from oil exports had been expected to fill.
The Iranian Students' News Agency quoted the minister as telling lawmakers that "there has been a 40 percent decrease in oil sales and a 45 percent decrease in repatriating oil money." The agency also quoted him as forecasting further decreases without specifying how much.
"It's common knowledge in Iran that oil exports have fallen," said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, who visited his native Iran last month. "I don't know if the oil minister had been in denial."
Dr. Salehi-Isfahani suggested that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government might have to resolve the budget deficit problem with an accounting maneuver that would recalculate the value of Iran's oil sales at half the official foreign-exchange rate -- 25,000 rials per dollar instead of the central bank's artificial rate of 12,260 rials per dollar.
That change would be much closer to the rial's actual value and essentially double the amount -- in rials -- gained from Iranian oil exports. But such a move would also concede the sanctions' severe inflationary impact, which has caused a steep fall in the value of the Iranian currency this past year.
Many Iranians have suffered from the rial's decline, which has essentially made them poorer by raising the price of imported goods. Iran's inflation also has left many Iranian businesses unable to pay wages or bills. The problem surfaced in a new way on Monday with the abrupt cancellation of domestic flights by Iranian airlines, which had been buying fuel on credit.
The head of the Airlines Association, Seyyed Abdol Reza Musavi, told Mehr that flights in Tehran, Kish, Mashhad and other airports had been halted because the carriers failed to repay their debts, and that fuel would now be provided "on a cash-only basis." It was unclear how long the flight suspensions would last.
The sanctions on Iran have been intensifying for the past few years because of its disputed nuclear program, which Iran says is for peaceful use but which Western countries and Israel suspect is meant to develop the ability to make nuclear weapons.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- National health spending climbed to $2.7 trillion in 2011, or an average of $8,700 for every person in the country, but as a share of the economy, it remained stable for the third consecutive year, the Obama administration said Monday.
The rate of increase in health spending, 3.9 percent in 2011, was the same as in 2009 and 2010 -- the lowest annual rates recorded in the 52 years the government has been collecting such data.
Federal officials could not say for sure whether the low growth in health spending represented the start of a trend or reflected the continuing effects of the recession, which crimped the economy from December 2007 to June 2009.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said that "the statistics show how the Affordable Care Act is already making a difference," saving money for consumers. But a report issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in her department, said that the law had so far had "no discernible impact" on overall health spending.
Although some provisions of the law have taken effect, the report said, "their influence on overall health spending through 2011 was minimal."
The recession increased unemployment, reduced the number of people with private health insurance, lowered household income and assets and therefore tended to slow health spending, said Micah B. Hartman, a statistician at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
In the report, federal officials said that total national spending on prescription drugs and doctors' services grew faster in 2011 than in the year before, but that spending on hospital care grew more slowly.
Medicaid spending likewise grew less quickly in 2011 than in the prior year, as states struggled with budget problems. But Medicare spending grew more rapidly, because of an increase in "the volume and intensity" of doctors' services and a one-time increase in Medicare payments to skilled nursing homes, said the report, published in the journal Health Affairs.
National health spending grew at roughly the same pace as the overall economy, without adjusting for inflation, so its share of the economy stayed the same, at 17.9 percent in 2011, where it has been since 2009. By contrast, health spending accounted for just 13.8 percent of the economy in 2000.
Health spending grew more than 5 percent each year from 1961 to 2007. It rose at double-digit rates in some years, including every year from 1966 to 1984 and from 1988 to 1990.
The report did not forecast the effects of the new health care law on future spending. Some provisions of the law, including subsidized insurance for millions of Americans, could increase spending, officials said. But the law also trims Medicare payments to many health care providers and authorizes experiments to slow the growth of health spending.
"The jury is still out whether all the innovations we're testing will have much impact," said Richard S. Foster, who supervised the preparation of the report as chief actuary of the Medicare agency. "I am optimistic. There's a lot of potential. More and more health care providers understand that the future cannot be like the past, in which health spending almost always grew faster than the gross domestic product."
Evidence of the new emphasis can be seen in a series of articles published in The Archives of Internal Medicine, now known as JAMA Internal Medicine, under the title "Less Is More." The series highlights cases in which "the overuse of medical care may result in harm and in which less care is likely to result in better health."
Total spending for doctors' services rose 3.6 percent in 2011, to $436 billion, while spending for hospital care increased 4.3 percent, to $850.6 billion.
Spending on prescription drugs at retail stores reached $263 billion in 2011, up 2.9 percent from 2010, when growth was just four-tenths of 1 percent. The latest increase was still well below the average increase of 7.8 percent a year from 2000 to 2010.
Federal officials said the increase in 2011 resulted partly from rapid growth in prices for brand-name drugs.
Prices for specialty drugs, typically prescribed by medical specialists for chronic conditions, have increased at double-digit rates in recent years, the government said. In addition, spending on new brand-name drugs -- those brought to market in the previous two years -- more than doubled from 2010 to 2011, driven by an increase in the number of new medicines.
"In 2011," the report said, "spending for private health insurance premiums increased 3.8 percent, as did spending for benefits. Out-of-pocket spending by consumers increased 2.8 percent in 2011, accelerating from 2.1 percent in 2010 but still slower than the average annual growth rate of 4.7 percent" from 2002 to 2008.

Abstract: Inner-city Catholic schools, which began by serving poor European immigrants, severed the connection between poverty and low academic performance for generations of low-income (and often non-Catholic) minority kids. [...]the 1960s, religious orders were united in responding to Christ's mandate to "go teach." Much of the money has gone to paying for a growing staff: about 170,000 laypeople, priests and members of religious orders, including some unpaid volunteers, responsible for more than 17,000 parishes. Since 2000, there has been more than a 25 percent increase in lay ecclesial ministers, who serve alongside priests and deacons in ministering to colleges, hospitals and prisons and caring for bereaved or homebound parishioners.

Full text:   CATHOLIC parochial education is in crisis. More than a third of parochial schools in the United States closed between 1965 and 1990, and enrollment fell by more than half. After stabilizing in the 1990s, enrollment has plunged despite strong demand from students and families.
Closings of elementary and middle schools have become a yearly ritual in the Northeast and Midwest, home to two-thirds of the nation's Catholic schools. Last year, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia closed one-fifth of its elementary schools. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, is expected to decide soon whether to shut 26 elementary schools and one high school, less than three years after the latest closings. Catholic high schools have held on, but their long-term future is in question.
This isn't for want of students. Almost 30 percent of Catholic schools have waiting lists, even after sharp tuition increases over the past decade. The American Catholic population has grown by 45 percent since 1965. Hispanics, who are often underserved by public schools, account for about 45 percent of American Catholics and an even higher proportion of Catholic children, but many cannot afford rising fees.
Since the early 19th century, parochial schools have given free or affordable educations to needy and affluent students alike. Inner-city Catholic schools, which began by serving poor European immigrants, severed the connection between poverty and low academic performance for generations of low-income (and often non-Catholic) minority kids.
Until the 1960s, religious orders were united in responding to Christ's mandate to "go teach." But religious vocations have become less attractive, and parochial schools have faced increasing competition from charter schools. Without a turnaround, many dioceses will soon have only scatterings of elite Catholic academies for middle-class and affluent families and a token number of inner-city schools, propped up by wealthy donors.
As in other areas, the church has lost its way, by failing to prioritize parochial education. Despite the sex-abuse scandals and two recessions, church revenue -- which flows from parishes via Sunday donations, bequests and so on -- grew to $11.9 billion in 2010, an inflation-adjusted increase of $2.2 billion from a decade earlier. Yet educational subsidies have fallen; the church now pays at least 12.6 percent of parochial elementary school costs, down from 63 percent in 1965.
Much of the money has gone to paying for a growing staff: about 170,000 laypeople, priests and members of religious orders, including some unpaid volunteers, responsible for more than 17,000 parishes. Since 2000, there has been more than a 25 percent increase in lay ecclesial ministers, who serve alongside priests and deacons in ministering to colleges, hospitals and prisons and caring for bereaved or homebound parishioners.
The church should shift its spending and also hold ambitious fund-raising drives. Instead of approaching donors with the least effective pitch -- filling deficits -- educators, pastors and prelates should propose new initiatives (with help from Web sites like DonorsChoose.org and Kickstarter) and new schools.
Bishops preach social justice but fail to practice it within the church. Thirty percent of American parishes report operating deficits, but there is no systemic means for wealthier dioceses and parishes to help poorer ones -- and to stave off self-defeating tuition increases.
After finances, personnel is the biggest challenge. Once upon a time, a pastor and two assistant priests took care of religious duties, while nuns ran the parish schools. Now, typically, there is just a beleaguered pastor (increasingly born and trained in Asia, Africa or Latin America) without any experience in running the business side of a parish and a school. Priests' collars and nuns' habits have become rare sights in parochial schools.
One solution is at hand. In the late 1960s, the Vatican allowed men to be ordained as deacons, who are clergy with many but not all the powers of a priest. Today there are almost 17,000 in the United States, about the same number as active diocesan priests. Over the next decade, the diaconate will continue to grow, while the number of ordained priests is projected to decline to 12,500 by 2035.
Many deacons have valuable professional, managerial and entrepreneurial expertise that could revitalize parochial education. If they were given additional powers to perform sacraments and run parishes, a married priesthood would become a fait accompli. Celibacy should be a sacrifice offered freely, not an excuse for institutional suicide.
Without an overhaul of money and personnel, the future of Catholic education is grim. Since 1990, the church has closed almost 1,500 parishes. Most were small, but just as big-city parochial schools are being closed, thriving urban parishes may be next on the chopping block.
"The school is more necessary than the church," said John J. Hughes, the first archbishop of New York. Unless the Vatican and the American bishops heed those words, the decline in parochial education may forewarn the fate of the church itself.

Full text:   As Venezuela looks to the prospect of a future without Hugo Chávez, is it likely to pursue his legacy without him or take another course?
MOST WANT TO STAY THE PATH
Since Hugo Chávez first took office, he and his party have won 13 of 14 national elections, mainly because they have greatly improved the living standards of most Venezuelans. Since 2004, after the economy recovered from the devastating opposition oil strike, poverty has been cut by half and extreme poverty by more than 70 percent.
Millions of people have gotten access to health care for the first time. Access to education has increased sharply, with college enrollment doubling. Eligibility for public pensions tripled, and in the past two years the government has built hundreds of thousands of houses. Most of the poverty reduction came from increased employment, not "government handouts," and during most of Chávez's tenure, the private sector has grown faster than the public. These numbers are not really in dispute among economists or international statistical agencies.
The 20 years before Chávez were an economic disaster, with per capita income falling between 1980 and 1998.
Is this progress sustainable? The press focuses on Venezuela's inflation, which, at just under 18 percent, is about the highest in the region. But it has come down from 28.2 percent in 2010, even as the economy has recovered and growth has accelerated. This shows that the government can bring inflation down with the right policies.
All of the left-leaning governments in South America -- Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia and Uruguay -- have been re-elected because they have brought real economic and social change and significant improvements in living standards for the majority of their people. This indicates that Chávez's chosen successor would likely win if he should step down. MARK WEISBROT
THE NATION MUST REVERSE COURSE
President Chávez has bequeathed the nation an economic crisis of historic proportions. The crisis includes a fiscal deficit approaching 20 percent of the economy, one of the world's highest inflation rates, a swollen number of public sector jobs, a fragile banking system and the free fall of the state-controlled oil industry, the main source of revenue.
Mismanagement and lack of investment have decreased oil production. Oil revenue is compromised partly because Venezuelans can buy this most valuable resource at heavily subsidized prices. (It costs 25 cents to fill up a midsize car).
Oil is also shipped to Cuba and other Chávez allies, and to China, which paid in advance at deeply discounted prices. Most of the crude exported at market prices is sold to Chávez's main foe: the United States. Yet, as a result of America's own oil boom, United States imports of Venezuelan oil are at a 30-year low. Moreover, due to an explosion in its main refinery, Venezuela now must import gasoline. The Financial Times reckons that for each 10 barrels of crude Venezuela sells to the United States, it has to import two barrels refined abroad.
The nation's total imports have jumped from $13 billion in 2003 to over $50 billion currently. Paying for those imports and servicing its huge debt requires more hard currency than Venezuela's weakened economy can generate. Huge headaches are looming. MOISÉS NAÍM

Abstract: [...]they wanted what the rest of us want. ACCORDING to Mr. Kane, "the root of all evil in this ecosystem" is the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act, enacted by Congress in 1980 to standardize military personnel policies.

Full text:   IT was once a wry joke that the military was designed by geniuses to be run by idiots. Not anymore, Tim Kane writes. As an all-volunteer force, the young men and women who serve these days are top drawer; it is the institution that is idiotic, he argues. And he has a drastic remedy in mind: a dose of classic economics.
In "Bleeding Talent" (Palgrave Macmillan, $30), Mr. Kane gives us a veteran's proud, though acutely critical, perspective on the American military. He offers an illuminating view of the other "1 percent" -- not the privileged upper crust, but the sliver of Americans who have accepted the burden of waging two of the longest wars in our history.
The military is perhaps as selfless an institution as our society has produced. But in its current form, Mr. Kane says, it stifles the aspirations of the best who seek to serve it and pushes them out. "In terms of attracting and training innovative leaders, the U.S. military is unparalleled," he writes. "In terms of managing talent, the U.S. military is doing everything wrong."
The core problem, he argues, is that while the military may be "all volunteer" on the first day, it is thoroughly coercive every day thereafter. In particular, it dictates the jobs, promotions and careers of the millions in its ranks through a centralized, top-down, one-size-fits-almost-all system that drives many talented officers to resign in frustration. They leave, he says, because they believe that "the military personnel system -- every aspect of it -- is nearly blind to merit."
Mr. Kane knows whereof he speaks. An Air Force Academy graduate, he worked in military intelligence for five years before resigning, in the mid-1990s, after the Air Force declined to send him for graduate studies in economics. He is now chief economist at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group. In the years between, he helped start a couple of small companies and picked up a taste for entrepreneurship.
He finds a natural hero in Milton Friedman, the libertarian economist and intellectual father of the all-voluntary military. And Mr. Kane suggests that today's Pentagon is ignorant of Adam Smith, whose "Wealth of Nations" taught that society's interests might best be served by every individual's seeking his or her own self-interest.
In 2005, Mr. Kane made a mark with empirical studies demonstrating that the "myth of the stupid soldier" is indeed a myth. His data showed that the enlisted ranks were brighter and better educated than their civilian counterparts.
He looks at today's military and sees suppressed entrepreneurs among officers and enlisted ranks alike. "America's armed forces are a leadership factory," he writes, saying that former military officers are three times as likely to become corporate C.E.O.'s as their raw numbers would suggest.
In surveying recent West Point graduates, he found that only 7 percent believed that most of the best officers remained in the military. It is not the combat, the low pay or the pull of family life that is the top reason they quit in surprising numbers, Mr. Kane writes, but rather the "frustration with military bureaucracy." One study found that young officers left because they wanted a sense of control over their careers. In short, they wanted what the rest of us want.
The exodus of young officers means that promotion to lieutenant colonel is taken for granted in a career trajectory. Yet the step beyond colonel, to general, is subject to a rigid and stultifying screen. A thousand colonels a year are considered; only 35 or 40 make the cut, he says. The mavericks, the innovators who rock the boat, usually do not.
ACCORDING to Mr. Kane, "the root of all evil in this ecosystem" is the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act, enacted by Congress in 1980 to standardize military personnel policies. But the system has defied efforts by successive defense secretaries to bring about change.
That act binds the military into a system that honors seniority over individual merit. It judges officers, hundreds at a time, in an up-or-out promotion process that relies on evaluations that have been almost laughably eroded by grade inflation. A zero-defect mentality punishes errors severely. The system discourages specialization -- you can't expect to stay a fighter jock or a cybersecurity expert -- and pushes the career-minded up a tried-and-true ladder that, not surprisingly, produces lookalikes.
In the subtitle of his book, Mr. Kane declares a radical intent: "How the U.S. Military Mismanages Great Leaders and Why It's Time for a Revolution." The revolution he has in mind would turn the military inside out by creating an internal labor market for job assignments and promotions.
Need an assistant commander of an airborne regiment? If an officer has the training and the credentials, why shouldn't he or she be allowed to apply for the job? Let the commander, not the Pentagon, choose a sidekick from a stack of résumés, Mr. Kane says. Sounds a lot like civilian life, doesn't it?
By the same token, a talented 33-year-old colonel could command a 40-year-old major, an age reversal that is commonplace in the civilian economy. The ranks would also be open to lateral entry. Why not readmit a former officer who wants to re-enlist after a stint in logistics for Walmart?
Mr. Kane is taking on an institution whose sheer size boggles the mind. There are 1.1 million men and women in the United States Army, including the National Guard and Army Reserve. The regular Army alone has some 82,000 officers, 15,000 above the rank of major (but only 300 generals). Can it rely on a military Monster.com of the kind the author is proposing to put all those people in the right jobs?
There are skeptics, even among Mr. Kane's supporters in the military, who say his quest is quixotic, an attempt to dent a stone wall that has defied all efforts to change it. But it might not be hopeless. Our military is part of our society. It has bent before to provide greater opportunities, first for blacks, then for women, and most recently for gays and lesbians. If the demand now is for greater personal autonomy, how long can the military resist?

Abstract: [...]there are just as many who prospered without the imprimatur of one of the hyper-exclusive schools near the top of the annual U.S. News & World Report list. According to U.S. News & World Report, of the 41 schools that claim to have sent more than 50 percent of their students to a study-abroad program, only one, Dartmouth, is in the Ivy League.

Full text:   MY niece Leslie is still more than nine months away from sending in a college application and more than 18 from stepping into her first college class, but already she's swimming in numbers: the average SAT scores for one university's student body; the percentage of applicants another school admits; how much money, on average, the graduates of yet another school tend to make once they've been in the work force awhile. This is the kind of information spotlighted in the articles and books that are supposed to guide her and her peers. These are the types of factoids that the adults around them often focus on.
Which school will bequeath the best network? Which diploma has the most cachet? Various relatives pitch Leslie on the virtues of their alma maters, and as surely as my niece swims in numbers, she drowns in advice. But much of it strikes me as shortsighted and incomplete, and I worry that she'll be coaxed to make her choice in a way that disregards the inimitable opportunity that college presents, the full bounty and splendor of those potentially transformative years. I have the same worry about other secondary-school students who, like her, possess the economic and intellectual good fortune -- and the hard-won transcripts -- to entertain a wealth of alternatives, because I think we let them get too distracted by rankings, ratings, brands. We don't point them toward assessments and dynamics that are arguably more meaningful.
Last week was the deadline to apply to many colleges and universities, though the admissions dance -- the dreaming, scheming, waiting and worrying -- has really become a year-round, nonstop phenomenon, starting well before the final stretch of high school. Leslie's a junior and has already visited half a dozen campuses, to see how they feel.
And if she's like most of my peers when I was her age, she'll wind up picking one that gives her a sense of comfort, of safety. That's what too many kids do. They perpetuate what they're familiar with, gravitating to the same schools that their friends are or duplicating their parents' paths. And there's so much lost in that reflex, so much surrendered by that timidity.
If you're among the lucky who can factor more than cost and proximity into where you decide to go, college is a ticket to an adventure beyond the parameters of what you've experienced so far. It's a passport to the far side of what you already know. It's a chance to be challenged, not coddled. To be provoked, not pacified.
Does brand matter? To a point. There are indeed future employers who see certain diplomas as seals of approval, as pre-screening of a sort, and there are many successful people who got that way by milking contacts made at storied universities. But there are just as many who prospered without the imprimatur of one of the hyper-exclusive schools near the top of the annual U.S. News & World Report list. And even if you're confining yourself to those schools, you can and should ask questions about them that prospective freshmen frequently don't.
How many of a college's or university's students are coming from other countries? Favor schools with higher percentages of foreigners, because as much of your education will happen outside as inside any lecture hall, and globalism is here and real. The dexterity with which you can navigate other cultures -- your awareness of, and openness to, them -- could be more valuable and happy-making than any knowledge gleaned from a book.
When it comes to the internationalism of a school, don't assume the loftiest ones win the race. In one measure of this, Carnegie Mellon, Boston University and Brandeis came out ahead of Harvard, Stanford, Williams or Duke.
You might also take into account what percentage of a school's students travel in the opposite direction and do some study abroad. That could be an indication of your future classmates' daring or curiosity, and those classmates will presumably bring the fruits of their experiences back to campus. According to U.S. News & World Report, of the 41 schools that claim to have sent more than 50 percent of their students to a study-abroad program, only one, Dartmouth, is in the Ivy League.
I use the word "claim" deliberately and urge skepticism with rankings. They depend on honest reporting from schools, and in recent years both Claremont McKenna College and Emory University were forced to admit inflation in what they'd trumpeted about the test scores or other achievements of their students. Also, what does "study abroad" mean? A semester or a week, and in Mumbai or just Montreal? As it happens, more than half of the American college students who take an academic detour from the United States still head to Europe, and the most popular destination is Britain, according to the Institute of International Education. They're not exactly honing new language skills there.
SO dig as deeply as you can into what the statistics that colleges showcase do and don't assure. And treat your undergraduate education as a rare license, before you're confined by the burdens of full-fledged adulthood and before the costs of experimentation rise, to be tugged outside your comfort zone. To be yanked, preferably. If you've spent little time in the thick of a busy city, contemplate a school in precisely such a place. If you know only the North, think about the South. Seek diversity, not just in terms of nationality, ethnicity and race, but also in terms of financial background, especially if your bearings have been resolutely and narrowly upper middle class. You'll most likely encounter a different economic cross-section of classmates at one of the top state universities than you will at a small private college. Doesn't that have merit, and shouldn't that be weighed?
And if your interests and circumstances don't demand an immediate concentration on one field of study, go somewhere that'll force you to stretch in multiple directions. (A core curriculum isn't a bad thing at all.) The world is in constant flux, life is a sequence of surprises, and I can think of no better talents to pick up in college than fearlessness, nimbleness and the ability to roll with change, adapt to newness and improvise.
I have 11 nieces and nephews in all. There are 10 younger than Leslie. I hope all of them have the options that she seems to, and I hope they ask themselves not which school is the surest route to riches but which will give them the richest experiences to draw from, which will broaden their frames of reference. College can shrink your universe, or college can expand it. I vote for the latter.
