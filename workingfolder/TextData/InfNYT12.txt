Full text:   In other transition news:
A high-priced auction for coffee with the future first daughter Ivanka Trump appears to have been canceled, as criticism mounted that the Trumps were selling access.
President-elect Donald J. Trump's son-in-law told business leaders in New York that Mr. Trump will be pushing a $1 trillion infrastructure plan closer to the ideal of Democrats than Republicans. At the same event, Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming minority leader, sounded similarly conciliatory.
Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Friday to again play down Russian interference in the elections -- this time, seemingly praising one of the cyberattacks for the revelations it contained.
Coffee with Ivanka appears to be canceled.
The Trump family on Friday appears to have canceled a charity auction that featured the president-elect's daughter Ivanka, as criticism mounted that the future first family's charitable solicitation risked opening the White House to special interests seeking to pay for access.
The auction for a chance to spend up to 45 minutes with Ms. Trump over coffee at either Trump Tower in New York or the recently opened Trump International Hotel in Washington was to continue for another three days. As of Friday morning, the high bid was $72,888.
But then the auction disappeared from the Charitybuzz website that had been hosting it, along with details on all the bids that had been offered since it opened on Dec. 5.
"The loser is St. Jude, and the winner I'm not exactly sure," one of the bidders, the Tex-Mex restaurateur Russell Ybarra, wrote in an email, referring to the Tennessee children's hospital, which stood to reap the proceeds.
Eric Trump, in an interview Thursday, had said he was considering terminating the auction, after The New York Times raised questions about it. The Trump Organization and Charitybuzz did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment.
The Obama family has not directly participated in any fund-raising solicitation efforts since President Obama took office to avoid the impression that donations would allow the donor to get special access, said Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer.
An infrastructure plan Democrats can love?
The president-elect's son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, told New York business leaders on Friday that Mr. Trump's vision for a large-scale federal infrastructure program was "closer" to Senator Chuck Schumer's, the incoming minority leader, than to the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell's.
Mr. Kushner made the remarks at an event hosted by the Partnership for New York City, just after an appearance by Mr. Schumer, the New York senator.
This week at a news conference in Washington, Mr. McConnell said he was not interested in "trillion-dollar stimulus" to finance any infrastructure plan, setting up what could be the first of many clashes with a Trump White House that will not always hew to Republican orthodoxy.
The Trump campaign floated a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that would depend on private investors raising money and building the projects with the aid of some form of tax credit. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's chief strategist, said shortly after the election that a huge infrastructure plan would be in the offing, but the form was not clear. Democrats have long said they want an infrastructure plan that has plentiful direct federal funding, something Mr. Schumer has said repeatedly, not tax credits for rich developers.
This does not excite Mr. McConnell who, like most Republicans, recalls President Obama's early stimulus plan unfavorably. That plan came in the middle of the worst recession since the Depression.
Mr. Trump inherits an economy that is healthy enough that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates Wednesday to head off overheating. The Fed has made it clear that if Mr. Trump insists on pumping money into the economy, it will hasten rate increases to stave off inflation.
"We need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly," Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky senator, said this week.
And speaking of cross-party conciliation.
Senate watchers used to the obstructionist stance that the Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, took with President Obama for eight years have been waiting for signs of the kind of minority leader that Mr. Schumer will be when he takes over as Democratic leader.
The Democratic senator sent a big flashing of conciliation on Friday.
Mr. Schumer praised Mr. Trump's call with the president of Taiwan, which drew objections from both sides of the aisle, as a shrewd move that sent a signal to China of a change in direction.
Mr. Schumer made the remarks at the same annual meeting of the Partnership for New York City that Mr. Kushner spoke at, according to two people in attendance.
Those attendees interpreted the comments as aligning Mr. Schumer with Mr. Trump on a diplomatic issue that has been met with consternation by the Obama White House.
Mr. Schumer described the call that Mr. Trump took roughly two weeks ago as shrewd, and not necessarily indicating that it was a reflection of his view of the "One China" policy, the two attendees said.
An aide to Mr. Schumer did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
Mr. Schumer has been a critic of China as a currency manipulator over the years. At the breakfast, where he was followed by Mr. Kushner, Mr. Schumer suggested that Democrats lost in part because the election was about a change in course, and Hillary Clinton ran as a continuation of the Obama administration's direction.
Trump dismisses Russian hacking -- again.
The president-elect took to Twitter on Friday to again dismiss the significance of Russia's meddling in the election -- but with a new twist. This time, he seemed to praise the revelations of one of the cyberattacks.
Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate? -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2016
The post seems to refer to an email stolen from the Democratic National Committee and given to WikiLeaks that came from a Democratic strategist, Donna Brazile, before a CNN Democratic primary debate in Flint, Mich.
Ms. Brazile's subject line: "One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash."
"Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint," Ms. Brazile wrote to John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, and Jennifer Palmieri, the candidate's communications director.
That might seem like a pretty obvious question, given that the debate was in Flint to address the crisis over the city's lead-contaminated water. But it cost Ms. Brazile her commentator's job at CNN, and it helped to fuel Mr. Trump's accusation during the campaign that the election was "rigged" in Hillary Clinton's favor.
Many are excited, but more are worried as Trump presidency nears.
A new CBS News poll found that 46 percent of Americans are excited or optimistic about Donald J. Trump's presidency, about the percentage who voted for him. But 53 percent say they are concerned or scared.
With the inauguration about a month away, a solid majority -- 62 percent -- say the president-elect will bring real change to the way Washington works. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing probably depends on your party. Some 58 percent say they believe he will divide rather than unite people.
The Jewish community confronts a divisive ambassador to Israel.
The announcement on Thursday that David M. Friedman, Mr. Trump's bankruptcy lawyer, would be nominated to be the United States ambassador to Israel, is likely to roil an American Jewish community that sided overwhelmingly with Hillary Clinton and is already at sea in the wake of the 2016 election.
David Friedman named US Ambassador to Israel, will maintain the special relationship between our two countries. https://t.co/yd4DqYInzw -- Transition 2017 (@transition2017) December 16, 2016
Divisions remain among Jewish people over President Obama's policies, especially his nuclear deal with Iran. And Mr. Friedman is not likely to unify the community. Confronting the liberal Jewish group J Street, which largely opposes the policies of Israel's conservative prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Friedman once leveled one of the worst insults possible to a Jew. He compared the group to kapos, the Jewish collaborators who enforced Nazi edict in the World War II concentration camps.
"Are J Street supporters really as bad as kapos? The answer, actually, is no. They are far worse than kapos -- Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps," Mr. Friedman said.
J Street reacted almost immediately to news of Mr. Friedman's nomination, calling on the Senate to reject him.
"As someone who has been a leading American friend of the settlement movement, who lacks any diplomatic or policy credentials and who has attacked liberal Jews who support two states as 'worse than kapos', Friedman should be beyond the pale for senators considering who should represent the United States in Israel," the group said in a statement.
The Republican Jewish Coalition was all praise:
"The selection of Mr. David Friedman to serve as United States ambassador to Israel sends a powerful signal to the Jewish community and the State of Israel that President-elect Trump's administration will strengthen the bond between our two countries and advance the cause of peace within the region.
"We look forward to working with David and the entire Trump administration to cripple Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons through new and strengthened sanctions, move the U.S. Embassy to the eternal capital of Israel, Jerusalem, and repair relations with our greatest ally in the Middle East that have eroded over the last eight years."
It doesn't pay to jump the gun.
A Trump economic adviser, Stephen Moore, caused quite a kerfuffle in Detroit on Thursday when in a fit of excitement, he announced that the economic commentator Larry Kudlow would be named chairman of Mr. Trump's White House Council of Economic Advisers.
Mr. Kudlow, while certainly versed in economics, is not an economist. He has an undergraduate degree in history. The council chairman has traditionally been pulled from the highest echelons of academia to advise the president, not to lobby or persuade.
Moreover, Mr. Kudlow is an ardent free trader and was openly critical of Mr. Trump's position on trade during the campaign, even as he enthusiastically backed the candidate.
The announcement would have also come as a surprise to Peter Navarro, a Harvard-trained professor of economics at the Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Navarro is widely considered the front-runner for the post, and his views on trade are more in line with the president-elect's.
After the Democrats sent out their reactions, and the news media came alive, Mr. Moore sheepishly admitted that, while he is pulling for his friend Mr. Kudlow, the deal is not done.
"Larry is the obvious choice, because he has all the connections with the key players on Capitol Hill, and there's nobody that can articulate the free-market, conservative economic message better than Larry can," he said. But he admitted he had jumped the gun.
UPDATE: @StephenMoore backtracks, says @Larry_Kudlow as chair of CEA "isn't a done deal and I jumped the gun."https://t.co/zfmo4o4pi7 -- Chad Livengood (@ChadLivengood) December 15, 2016

Full text:   During the campaign, Donald Trump railed against powerful corporations and promised to prevent blockbuster mergers like the proposed $85.4 billion deal between AT&T and Time Warner. That was then. Since the election, Mr. Trump has been decidedly less interested in constraining the power of big companies, especially those in the telecommunications industry.
It now appears that the AT&T acquisition of Time Warner might be approved after all, according to The Financial Times. One antitrust adviser to Mr. Trump, Joshua Wright, argued last month in The New York Times that "a high level of concentration in an industry simply does not mean the industry lacks competition."
Investors and financial analysts are already betting that the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission under Mr. Trump will be more likely to approve mergers in this industry, including perhaps a deal between Sprint and T-Mobile that was discussed in 2014. Such a merger would almost certainly lead to higher prices for cellphone service by cutting the number of national wireless companies to three, from four.
In addition to being more open to big deals, Mr. Trump appears ready to do away with regulations on this oligopolistic industry. As it is, a lack of competition for some services is driving up prices. The cost of expanded basic cable TV service, for example, increased at twice the rate of inflation from 1995 to 2005, according to the F.C.C. Another commission report found that 51 percent of Americans live in areas served by only one broadband landline provider (10 percent live in places where there is no such service).
On the chopping block are net neutrality rules adopted by the F.C.C. in 2015 to prohibit companies like Comcast and Verizon from giving preference to some content over others. For example, Comcast is not allowed to engineer its broadband network to download movies and TV shows from its NBC Universal subsidiary faster than movies from Netflix. These rules were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in June. But the F.C.C. under Mr. Trump is likely to repeal them. Once Mr. Trump appoints a new F.C.C. chairman, probably early next year, Republicans, who have been inveterate opponents of telecom regulation in recent years, will have a 3-to-2 majority on the commission; Democrats have a majority now.
One Republican commission member, Ajit Pai, for instance, said last week that net neutrality's "days are numbered." And a member of Mr. Trump's transition team, Mark Jamison, suggested in October that most of the F.C.C. could be eliminated, with the much smaller agency focused on licensing wireless frequencies.
Public interest groups, Democratic lawmakers and sensible Republicans in Congress ought to vigorously oppose Mr. Trump's deregulatory agenda. This won't be easy, but they could, for example, try to challenge policy changes by filing lawsuits against the F.C.C., a tactic the telecom industry has used countless times over the years to stymie or delay regulations they opposed.
Early next year, Senate Democrats will get to choose a new commissioner for the F.C.C. after the departure of Chairman Tom Wheeler, who announced his resignation on Thursday, and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is also leaving.
The Senate would have to confirm the Democratic appointee as it would Mr. Trump's choices. Democrats ought to pick a strong consumer advocate who will use the position to speak out forcefully for more competition in the industry and common-sense approaches like net neutrality rules. Susan Crawford, of Harvard Law School, and Tim Wu, of Columbia Law School, are two experts who specialize in telecommunication issues and fit that bill. Proper oversight, equitable access to services and fair pricing in telecommunications ought to be bipartisan concerns.

Abstract: The ICE U.S. Dollar index, which tracks the value of the dollar against the euro, Japanese yen and four other currencies, rose to its highest level since 2002.

Full text:   A surge in banks and other financial stocks that stand to benefit from higher interest rates pushed Wall Street indexes to the edge of record highs Thursday.
The dollar rose sharply against other currencies, and the price of gold sank on expectations that the Federal Reserve would follow up Wednesday's rate increase with several more next year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.75 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,262.03. It made up about half its loss from the previous day, which was its worst in two months.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.71 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,852.24. The Nasdaq composite rose 20.18 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,456.85. All three indexes were within half a percent of their record highs.
"I think the market is just going through a period of rational exuberance," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. "The prospect for faster economic growth and the normalization of interest rates -- these aren't bad things for the stock market."
The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point on the back of a strengthening economy. It was the second rate increase in a decade, and the Fed indicated three more could be on the way in 2017.
That helped spur the dollar, which has been climbing against other currencies for the last couple of years. The ICE U.S. Dollar index, which tracks the value of the dollar against the euro, Japanese yen and four other currencies, rose to its highest level since 2002.
Higher rates can also help banks reap bigger profits from making loans. Bank of America rose 49 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $23.16, and Zions Bancorporation gained 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $43.04.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.60 percent from 2.57 percent late Wednesday and reached its highest level in more than two years. The two-year Treasury yield held steady at 1.27 percent.
Eli Lilly was one of the top-performing stocks in the S.&P. 500 after rising $3.70, or 5.5 percent, to $71.37. The drugmaker issued a stronger-than-expected profit forecast for next year.
Pier 1 Imports surged $2.09, or 32.3 percent, to $8.57 after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings for the latest quarter. It raised its forecast for full-year results.
The worst-performing stock in the S.&P. 500 was Yahoo, which fell $2.50, or 6.1 percent, to $38.41 after disclosing a breach that affected more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history.
Gold dropped to its lowest price in 10 months. Higher interest rates often hurt the price of gold, which investors tend to flock to when they're worried about higher inflation and too-low interest rates. Gold fell $33.50, or 2.9 percent, to settle at $1,127.80 per ounce.
Silver fell $1.26 to settle at $15.96 an ounce, and copper dipped by less than a penny to $2.60 a pound.
Benchmark United States crude slipped 14 cents to settle at $50.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 12 cents to $54.02 a barrel in London.
In European stock markets, Germany's DAX rose 1.1 percent, France's CAC 40 gained 1 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.7 percent. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.1 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.8 percent and South Korea's Kospi was virtually flat.
The dollar rose to 118.14 Japanese yen from 117.09 late Wednesday, following up on a 1 percent jump. The euro fell to $1.0412 from $1.0532, and the British pound fell to $1.2427 from $1.255.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for just the second time since the financial crisis of 2008, saying the American economy is expanding at a healthy pace and setting itself up as a counterweight to President-elect Donald J. Trump's push for considerably faster growth.
The Fed cited the steady growth of employment and other economic measures, and signaled that it expects to raise rates more quickly next year to prevent the economy from growing too quickly.
"My colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made," Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said at a news conference after the announcement. "We expect the economy will continue to perform well."
The widely expected decision moves the Fed's benchmark rate to a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, still very low by historical standards. Low rates support economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking.
The American economy has expanded by about 2 percent a year over the last six years, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6 percent. The Fed's assessment that the economy is growing at a healthy pace -- not too hot, not too cold -- is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump, who has promised 4 percent growth and has described job creation as "terrible" and economic growth as anemic.
Already on Wednesday, one Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Roger Williams of Texas, criticized the Fed's move.
"Today's decision by the Fed to raise the interest rate is entirely premature and will be burdensome to a nation already struggling to pull itself out of this slow-growth Obama economy," Mr. Williams said in a statement. "By making rates even higher, the Fed is effectively making our hardships even harder."
Mr. Williams did not object when the Fed raised rates last December.
In announcing the decision after a two-day meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, the central bank gave little indication that Mr. Trump's election had altered its economic outlook. The Fed said it still expected a slow economic expansion and a steady march toward higher rates. In separate forecasts also published Wednesday, Fed officials predicted three rate increases in 2017.
For the first time in recent years, however, there is a real possibility of significant changes in fiscal policy. Republicans will control the White House and both chambers of Congress, and Mr. Trump has promised to increase economic growth and job creation through tax cuts and infrastructure spending.
Those measures could spur faster growth after a presidential campaign in which Mr. Trump regularly disparaged the economy's performance under President Obama. But the Fed reiterated Wednesday that the economy is already expanding at roughly the maximum sustainable pace.
Fed officials also see evidence that the labor market is tightening. Several Fed districts reported labor shortages in the central bank's most recent compilation of economic reports. In the Philadelphia district, construction workers are hard to find. Atlanta reported a shortage of nurses; Kansas City, truck drivers; Dallas, tech workers.
Faster growth, in the Fed's judgment, would probably lead to higher inflation. As a result, if Republicans succeed in invigorating growth, the Fed is likely to raise rates more quickly. The greater the stimulus, the faster interest rates are likely to rise.
"Your expectation should depend very little on what you think that the F.O.M.C. is thinking and very much on your view of Trump policies and their macro effects," said Jon Faust, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. "Don't focus on the Fed. As James Carville regularly reminded the other Clinton on the campaign trail: It's the economy, stupid."
Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed was not prejudging the likely course of events. She declined several times to comment on the merits of Mr. Trump's plans or to predict their consequences for the economy.
"We're operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment," Ms. Yellen said.
Fed officials predicted that they would raise the Fed's benchmark rate a little more quickly in the coming years, reaching 2.1 percent by the end of 2018. In September, they had predicted that it would reach 1.9 percent by the end of 2018. The new projections, however, reflect a significantly slower pace of increase than last December, when they expected the rate to reach 3.3 percent by 2018.
The combination of steady growth and faster rate increases indicates that some Fed officials expect the central bank to end up offsetting a modest increase in fiscal stimulus. But Ms. Yellen said most Fed officials were reserving judgment.
"Changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could affect the economic outlook," she said. "Of course, it is far too early to know how those changes will unfold."
The tensions between monetary and fiscal policy will develop slowly. Legislation takes time to write, and any economic impact would generally be felt in coming years. Political pressures, however, may build more quickly.
Mr. Trump has made clear in the past that he likes low interest rates -- and some of his plans, like infrastructure investment, will be much easier to fund if rates remain low.
"The Fed is in a tricky place," said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. "They're trying not to prejudge how Congress and the administration duke it out, but once they see that, I think they will respond."
There is also uncertainty about the Fed's leadership. Ms. Yellen's term as chairwoman ends in February 2018, and Mr. Trump has said he would prefer a Republican.
Ms. Yellen could remain on the board, a possibility she said Wednesday she had not ruled out. But the Fed, under different leadership, might well choose a different path forward. Some conservative economists, notably John Taylor of Stanford University, argue that the bank should already have raised rates above 1 percent.
The economy, for now, keeps plodding along. Steady job growth has reduced the unemployment rate to a level the Fed considers healthy. A little unemployment is natural as people change jobs and businesses close. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have said they see some signs of stronger wage growth. Inflation, too, has picked up a little in recent months, although both wages and inflation continue to rise more slowly than the Fed would like to see.
Ms. Yellen described the rate increase as "a vote of confidence in the economy."
The decision was made by a unanimous vote of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the first time in recent months the Fed has acted by consensus.
Some economists argue that the Fed should wait until inflation strengthens before raising rates, to test whether a stronger economy would persuade some people sidelined during the downturn to start looking for jobs. That would expand the labor force. Unemployment remains particularly high among minorities.
That view, however, has found little support among Fed officials, who worry that interest rates will have to be raised more quickly if they wait too long, increasing the chances of pushing the economy into recession.
"Apparently, Fed officials think the economy is growing too quickly," said Ady Barkan, the director of Fed Up, a coalition of liberal groups that has pressed the Fed to continue its stimulus campaign. "I doubt you can find many other Americans who share that opinion. And it's a strange conclusion to draw in the wake of an election that was so heavily impacted by voters' economic discontent."

Full text:   Higher interest rates are on the way. That, anyway, is the prediction increasingly baked into financial markets. Donald J. Trump's policy agenda -- big tax cuts and new infrastructure spending -- seems to point in that direction. And the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, with plans for more increases next year.
But what if that's wrong?
There's no doubt that the stated goals of President-elect Trump imply that rates will be higher in a couple of years than they are today. As my colleague Binyamin Appelbaum writes, any stimulative fiscal policy from the Trump administration could well face an equal and opposite tightening of monetary policy by a Fed that raises interest rates.
The central bank will seek to prevent too much inflation from breaking out in an economy it believes is getting close to operating at its full potential, which means Mr. Trump's stimulus might run up against the Fed chair Janet Yellen's (and perhaps her successor's) counter-stimulus.
But it's worth looking at the two big ways that these forecasts could be wrong, and worth considering that the era of low rates might stick around a bit longer than some of the postelection discussion might have suggested.
First, the Trump agenda might pack less of a growth punch than some have imagined. If so, you would expect the same cautious approach to rate increases from the Fed.
Second, even if the economy does start growing faster, future Trump administration appointees could change their tune on the desirability of higher interest rates. That has been the pattern with other populist politicians of the Trump mold around the world. Politicians, once in office, tend to learn that they like low interest rates. It's easy to envision a Trump administration pushing for cheaper money and the Fed attempting to hold the line to prevent inflation.
If Trump-Era Growth Is Less Than Advertised
On the first point, it's worth diving into the details of the Trump policies that led to the postelection-day market rally in stocks and the sell-off in bonds.
He wants to enact major tax cuts, for one, which all else being equal, would tend to create a short-term boost in economic growth and higher interest rates. But there are some early signals that the Republican lawmakers who actually have to pass any changes to tax law, especially those in the Senate, are wary of tax cuts that would increase the budget deficit as much as Mr. Trump's campaign plan would.
"My preference on tax reform is that it be revenue neutral," the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters this week.
Another big plank underneath the idea that Mr. Trump's economic policy will be stimulative is an expectation that he will embrace a large-scale infrastructure spending package.
But while the president-elect mentioned that idea in his election victory speech, he hasn't put much meat on the bones of the plan since. The details matter a great deal for how much an infrastructure plan could lift growth. For example, tax credits that make the finances of building toll roads more favorable are less likely to create a huge boost in activity than spending on upgrading physical infrastructure outright.
So on both tax cuts and infrastructure, there's no guarantee that the actual scale of stimulus will match some of the early postelection talk. Economists at JPMorgan Chase, for example, are forecasting economic growth of just under 2 percent for both 2017 and 2018 -- about the same as the pace of the last six years.
And that's before you factor in the risk that some elements of Trump economic policy could end up being a drag on growth. Think of a trade war with China or Mexico, immigration restrictions that limit the supply of labor or geopolitical disputes.
All that gives the Fed every reason to take a wait-and-see approach to shaping its policy. If the Trump economy really starts to take off, the Fed could move more aggressively to raise rates. But it will do that based on actual evidence and data rather than the president-elect's rhetoric.
If Trump's Fed Governors Choose to Keep Rates Low
Which leads to the other scenario, in which the economy accelerates at the risk of overheating. History is littered with examples of politicians in that circumstance pressuring their central banks to keep rates low to encourage growth.
In 1972, that was Richard Nixon, pressuring the Fed chairman Arthur Burns to keep money flowing freely in the economy to help his re-election chances. In modern times, populist right-wing politicians in Hungary and Turkey have undermined their central banks' independence, pushing for lower interest rates.
There are two vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board of governors already, and Ms. Yellen's term as chairwoman expires in February 2018; the vice-chairman Stanley Fischer's term is up in June of that year. Add it up, and within 18 months of taking office, Mr. Trump could have appointed a majority of the Fed's board, including its chair and vice chair.
That doesn't mean that Trump nominees for those jobs would necessarily refrain from rate hikes if they believed they were warranted. Many potential Republican Fed nominees have opposed the low interest rate tendency of the Fed under Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke.
For the past few administrations, the accepted practice has been that presidents should refrain from weighing in on monetary policy and let the Fed act independently. But Mr. Trump has described himself as a "low interest rate person" and was willing to scrap that precedent by attacking Ms. Yellen by name during the campaign.
Also, to be technical about it, even if the Fed kept its short-term interest rate targets low despite rising inflation, long-term interest rates, which are determined by the bond market, would probably rise.
If there's one thing we know about Mr. Trump, it's that he doesn't feel bound by the traditions that have governed how recent presidents have acted. And that means that the future of United States interest rate policy, like so much else, is up for grabs.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Investors in financial markets, and those predicting faster economic growth in 2017, would do well to remember the famous words that William McChesney Martin Jr., the former Federal Reserve chairman, uttered way back in 1955: The Fed's job is to remove the punch bowl just as the party gets going.
President-elect Donald J. Trump's promises to cut taxes and regulation and to increase spending on infrastructure and defense have convinced many that a sugar high in the near term will goose the economy. But Fed officials say the economy is already expanding at something close to its maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth would drive inflation toward unwelcome levels.
To avoid overheating, the Fed could respond by raising interest rates more quickly. The more Mr. Trump stimulates growth, the faster the Fed is likely to increase rates.
"I guess I would argue that I think people have gotten a bit ahead of themselves about what a Trump presidency would mean," said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura. "If we have a big stimulus, the logical thing for the Fed to do is to raise rates faster. There isn't a whole heck of a lot of scope to just let the economy run under those circumstances. There's a big question about whether fiscal stimulus under Trump just leads to higher interest rates."
Underscoring that question, the Fed is expected to raise its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December in light of new economic data. The rate sits in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent, a low level intended to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. Analysts predict the Fed will shift the range upward by a quarter of a percentage point, modestly reducing those incentives.
The rate increase is widely regarded as a foregone conclusion. The odds, derived from asset prices, topped 95 percent Monday, according to the CME Group. The looming question is how quickly the Fed will continue to raise rates in 2017.
Economic forecasts always require large assumptions, but that is particularly true in the present case because Mr. Trump has provided relatively few details about his plans. Perhaps the most accurate thing that can be said about Mr. Trump's victory is that it has increased the uncertainty of the economic outlook.
"At this juncture, it is premature to reach firm conclusions about what will likely occur," William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in a recent speech.
During his campaign, Mr. Trump predicted 4 percent annual growth, and his actions since Election Day point to a single-minded goal of short-term job creation.
"Our No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth," Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump's pick to serve as Treasury secretary, said last month.
Many economists regard such growth predictions as fanciful; the economy has been mired in an extended period of slow growth and the reasons, including an aging population and a dearth of innovation, are unlikely to change quickly. Some think Mr. Trump is more likely to push the economy into recession than to catalyze a new boom.
Even if Mr. Trump is right, however, the Fed does not want 4 percent growth.
The central bank's outlook has become increasingly gloomy. Officials estimated in September that annual growth of 1.8 percent was the maximum sustainable pace, and they predicted growth would not exceed 2 percent in the next three years. They will update those forecasts Wednesday, but large shifts are unlikely.
Fed officials also are increasingly convinced that steady job growth has substantially eliminated the post-recession backlog of people seeking work. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, a level the Fed regards as healthy.
For years, Fed officials urged Congress to increase fiscal spending. Now, Mr. Trump is promising to do just that -- and the Fed has concluded that it is too late.
Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, said last month the Fed might still benefit from fiscal stimulus because it could raise rates more quickly. That would increase the Fed's ability to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates.
But such gains would come at real cost: A fiscal stimulus would increase the federal government's debt burden, which already is at a high level by historical standards, reducing the room for a fiscal response to a future downturn. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, urged Congress last month to be mindful that the government is already on the hook for more spending as baby boomers age into retirement.
"With the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio at around 77 percent, there's not a lot of fiscal space, should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock, that did require fiscal stimulus," she said.
The tension between fiscal and monetary policy is likely to unfold in slow motion.
Mr. Trump has promised to press for rapid changes in government policy, but Congress is not built for speed. A similar effort to cut taxes at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, for example, was signed into law on June 7, 2001. The impact of new cuts, and any increase in infrastructure spending that Mr. Trump can persuade dubious Republicans to embrace, would be felt mostly in future years.
Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicted that tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and deficit-financed spending would fuel faster growth in the first half of Mr. Trump's four-year term. But he said that the Fed's rate increases, and restrictions on trade and immigration, would gradually begin to take a larger toll. By the end, Mr. Zandi predicted, the American economy would be "unnervingly close" to recession.
"The Fed and markets in general will ultimately wash out any benefit," Mr. Zandi said Monday. "The economy under President Trump ultimately will be diminished."
Other economists are more optimistic, predicting that the stimulus will not be fully offset by Fed policy. Mr. Dudley appeared to endorse this view in his recent speech, suggesting that the rise in financial markets was "broadly appropriate."
Some of Mr. Trump's proposals also could increase the economy's potential growth rate, for example by improving infrastructure or encouraging corporate investment.
On the other hand, the Fed's march toward higher rates may be amplified by the bond market. Rates are already rising, and investors concerned about inflation and larger federal deficits are likely to generate persistent upward pressure.
Those effects are already visible. Stock prices have climbed since Mr. Trump's surprising victory, increasing the wealth of shareholders. But borrowing costs also climbed. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage loan was 4.13 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, up from 3.54 percent just before the election.

Full text:   President-elect Donald J. Trump has made it clear that he views the central basis for diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing -- known as the "One China" policy -- as ripe for review.
Under that decades-old policy, the United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan as part of its recognition of the People's Republic of China. But in early December, Mr. Trump stunned officials across the globe by becoming the first president or president-elect to speak to a Taiwanese leader since at least 1979.
Then on Sunday, he suggested that adhering to the One China policy could be used as a bargaining chip on contentious issues like China's currency and its activity in the South China Sea. "I don't know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade," he said in an interview.
In trying to use Taiwan that way, Mr. Trump hit the most sensitive of what the Chinese Communist Party calls its "core interests." If Washington formally recognizes Taiwan, the Chinese are expected to break off diplomatic relations.
Though the United States officially ended relations with Taiwan in 1979, it maintains an unofficial embassy there called the American Institute in Taiwan. It has also sold Taiwan advanced military equipment and has worked to promote its democracy.
Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, rejected Mr. Trump's suggestion that American support for Taiwan was negotiable. "Taiwan is not a source of leverage," Mr. Earnest said Monday. "It's a close partner of the United States."
The Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, put the matter more bluntly, saying Mr. Trump was "like a child in his ignorance of foreign policy." It added: "The One China policy cannot be bought and sold. Trump, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price."
Here are five ways the Chinese could make life difficult for a Trump administration:
Trade and Investment
Chinese analysts say China has plenty of leverage to retaliate against Mr. Trump. One prominent target is Boeing, whose Seattle plant Xi Jinping, China's president, visited in September 2015.
In 2016, Boeing is expected to complete plane deliveries to China worth $11 billion, mostly 737s that have become the workhorse of China's rapidly expanding airlines. The Global Times warned that it would be easy for China to switch orders to Boeing's European competitor, Airbus.
"On economic issues, China has more and more leverage," said Wu Xinbo, the director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. "If we feel he is still pushing the Taiwan issue, we will take action. If he wants to keep it up on Taiwan, it will only backfire."
American trade officials worry that China could intensify its discrimination against American technology firms by using the country's antimonopoly laws. Last year, the Chinese government slapped a $975 million fine on Qualcomm, a San Diego-based chip maker, for what it said were licensing infractions.
A few years ago, there were worries that China might suddenly dump a large portion of its holdings of Treasuries, pushing up interest rates in the United States. Those fears ebbed as China pared its holdings gradually. Its holdings of Treasuries peaked at $1.65 trillion in March 2014, declining to about $1.3 trillion, said Brad Setser at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Experts say that even if the country sold more, it may not have much effect because interest rates are already low, global demand for Treasuries has been strong, and the Federal Reserve could buy more bonds if needed to offset action by China.
China could also weaken its currency, something Mr. Trump has argued it already does to make its products cheaper. But that could also result in more Chinese taking their money out of the country, as well as inflation for a nation that increasingly buys what it needs from abroad, like oil, because a weak currency means China must pay more for imported goods.
Finally, China could order its state-owned companies and private enterprises to slow their investments in the United States. A recent study by the Rhodium Group, a New York-based economic policy outfit, showed that since 2015, the amount of Chinese direct investment in the United States has outweighed the amount of American investment in China.
North Korea
Mr. Trump said on Sunday, "And frankly, they're not helping us at all with North Korea."
China has in fact cooperated with some American initiatives on curbing North Korea's nuclear program, specifically backing United Nations economic sanctions last month aimed at checking the North's foreign exchange earnings from coal, its biggest export earner.
China could switch from being a reluctant ally of North Korea to a friendly neighbor. China is already angry at Washington for the recent decision to deploy a defense shield in South Korea, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, which China argues is aimed at limiting its military capabilities.
Among the tools China could use would be improved trade, aid and investment to strengthen the North's rudimentary economy, said John Delury, an American analyst in Seoul, South Korea. As a longstanding ally, China could conduct joint military exercises with the North, he said.
In return for promises by North Korea not to proliferate, Mr. Delury said, China could go beyond improved trade, and provide substantial economic backing in a Marshall Plan-style initiative.
Climate Change
President Obama spent much of his political capital with China ensuring that Beijing would agree to the international climate change agreement that committed the world's two biggest carbon emitters to lower greenhouse gases.
Critics of Mr. Obama say he failed to force China to open up its markets, stood by while China fortified islands in the South China Sea and remained largely silent while Mr. Xi carried out repressive human rights policies in order to save the climate change accord.
Moreover, China's agreement to the international deal was less a concession to American pressure than a restatement of its own goals.
It was relatively easy for Mr. Xi to agree to a reduction in emissions given the outcry among the Chinese public about air pollution and contaminated food. The accord calls for China's carbon emissions to reach a plateau or decline "around 2030" but without any specific target for reductions like those Mr. Obama pledged for the United States.
Mr. Xi would be unlikely to touch the climate accord because of the popularity of the prospect of cleaner air among the Chinese public.
But if he did decide to ignore it, Mr. Trump would probably not care. At one point, Mr. Trump said climate change was a "hoax" invented by China to hurt American trade. Later, he said he was joking.
Taiwan
If Mr. Trump supports Taiwan, China's first response may be to punish Taiwan rather than the United States, in an attempt to diminish its value to Washington.
It could begin by intensifying efforts to persuade the 22 small sovereignties around the world, including the Vatican, that still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan to sever them and recognize China instead.
China might then take aim at Taiwan's economy by restricting Chinese investments and limiting the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.
Taiwan already has de facto independence, but China has warned that it will go to war to prevent it a formal separation from the mainland.
From Beijing's perspective, the fear is that Mr. Trump's moves could encourage Taiwan to declare independence or that other nations might follow the United States in recognizing Taiwan.
If President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan declared independence, "and the whole world says Taiwan is independent," then China "will take military action," said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. "But I don't believe that is Tsai's intention," he added.
Iran
China was a signatory to the nuclear accord reached with Iran in 2015 that lifted sanctions in return for Iran's getting rid of 98 percent of its nuclear material. China now has unfettered access to its longtime friend's economy. Through Iran, Beijing will seek to enhance its influence in the Middle East, with the goal of weakening American prestige in the region.
But if the deal is scrapped and renegotiated, as Mr. Trump has called for, China would keep trading with Iran, isolating the United States, said Edward C. Chow, senior fellow for energy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
About one-third of Iran's oil exports go to China, and China is Iran's top importer of goods. Thus China is Iran's top trading partner, a position that would not change in the event of Mr. Trump's renouncing Washington's participation in the nuclear deal.
"If anything, China would redouble trading and investment in Iran now that Trump has started on the Taiwan front," Mr. Chow said.

Full text:   Here's a look at what's coming up the week.
MONETARY POLICY
Accused of Negligence While Finance Minister
Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, faces a criminal trial starting on Monday in Paris on charges of negligence that date to her time as France's finance minister, from 2007 to 2011. Her lawyer plans to ask the special, rarely used court that will try her to postpone the hearing, which threatens to overshadow her role at the fund. If the court declines, the trial will run until Dec. 20, and a verdict could be announced at the close. Ms. Lagarde is accused of allowing a French tycoon to receive an outsize settlement in a 2007 arbitration case over a dispute with a state-owned bank. Liz Alderman

GUN INDUSTRY
A Name Change for Smith & Wesson?
Shareholders of Smith & Wesson Holding Company, one of the United States' most iconic firearms producers, are expected to vote Tuesday on whether to change the company's name to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. Executives of the Springfield, Mass.-based company, whose roots can be traced to the mid-1850s, are seeking the change to emphasize "shooting, hunting and rugged outdoor" products. "We believe the name American Outdoor Brands Corporation will better reflect our family of brands," its chief executive, James Debney, has said. Smith & Wesson's best-known firearms include a .38-caliber gun once widely used by police officers and the .357 Magnum. Barry Meier

AGRICULTURE
Monsanto Shareholders to Vote on Merger
Monsanto shareholders have been invited to converge in St. Louis on Tuesday to vote on Bayer AG's $56 billion acquisition of Monsanto. The deal is the second-largest signed this year, after AT&T's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. It has received ample criticism in Washington as the agriculture industry continues to consolidate, putting pressure on farmers who are already struggling to sell an abundance of crops. Bayer needs a majority of Monsanto's shareholders to vote in favor of the deal, as well as regulatory approvals, for the transaction to close. Leslie Picker

ECONOMY
A Rise in the Fed Rate, and Predictions for Next Year
The Federal Reserve has all but announced it will raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December. The more interesting question is what comes next. The Fed on Wednesday will also publish a 2017 forecast, including its predictions for economic growth and the path of monetary policy.
The Fed entered 2016 predicting that it would raise rates four times, which would have amounted to a significant retreat from its stimulus campaign. Instead, the central bank has held steady because growth remained slow and there was little sign of inflation. But the unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, about as low as most Fed officials would like to see.
President-elect Donald J. Trump and congressional leaders, in the meantime, are talking about a round of tax cuts that could increase economic growth. That could mean the Fed starts moving a little more quickly in 2017. Binyamin Appelbaum
Commerce Dept. to Report on November Retail Sales
On Wednesday, the Commerce Department will release retail sales data for November, one of the busiest shopping months of the year. Retail sales are expected to have risen 0.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rachel Abrams

TECH INDUSTRY
Trump to Greet Silicon Valley Executives in New York
Mr. Trump will meet with a dozen or so members of Silicon Valley's elite on Wednesday afternoon in New York. During the campaign, Mr. Trump was critical of high-tech. He'll want to come out of this with a few Twitter-ready announcements, but it's up in the air whether the executives will play along. David Streitfeld

ECONOMY
Bank of England Is Expected to Hold Rates Steady
The Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates steady when it announces its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. In August, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain's economy over fears that Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union could hamper growth. The rate had remained steady at 0.5 percent since March 2009. The British economy, however, has performed better than expected since the "Brexit" referendum, causing the central bank to change its view on the need for another rate cut in the near future.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
E.U. Plans to End Roaming Charges for Europeans
European officials are expected to approve new rules on Thursday giving Europeans the right to use their cellphones and other mobile devices across the 28-member bloc without incurring hefty roaming charges. The plans, which come into effect in June, have been praised by consumer advocates, who say people should be able to surf the internet freely beyond their national borders. But cellphone operators say the changes may force them to increase consumers' monthly bills to offset the potential loss of revenue when people travel outside their home markets. Mark Scott

Full text:   In the four weeks since Donald J. Trump was elected president, many stocks have soared and the market's winners have been clustered around a specific theme: an inflating economy.
Investors have concluded that at least in the short run, many of Mr. Trump's policies, including increased spending on infrastructure projects, could lead to faster economic growth than was expected.
"If you have big tax cuts and more infrastructure and defense spending, that adds to demand, which is likely to spell inflation," said David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds.
That is partly why shares of big banks like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase and blue-chip industrial companies like Caterpillar and General Dynamics have surged since election night.
But after more than a month of this rally, value-minded investors think it may be time to start looking for bargains in areas of the market that have been left behind.
"The biggest opportunity is in the international markets," said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. "Those stocks are getting pounded by one big factor -- the dollar."
A strong dollar not only reduces the value of gains that Americans enjoy on their overseas investments, but it also serves as a headwind to domestic companies as a strengthening currency makes their goods more expensive to foreign buyers.
In the immediate aftermath of the election, the dollar surged as much as 4 percent against a basket of foreign currencies, on the belief that market interest rates in the United States would keep rising and the Federal Reserve would start lifting short-term rates, too. Both moves would provide greater incentives for global investors to park their cash in dollar-denominated assets.
But Mr. Paulsen looked at the start of the last five periods in which the Federal Reserve began a sustained campaign to raise short-term rates. "Every one of those times was associated with a decline in the dollar," he said, not a rise.
While it's true that rising bond yields can strengthen the dollar, rates are often raised to stave off inflation, and that can hurt a currency. If the Federal Reserve starts hiking rates this month because it sees a need to quell inflation, that could weaken the dollar, Mr. Paulsen said.
"If the dollar comes down," he said, "that definitely brings the foreign markets, particularly the emerging markets, into play."
Lewis J. Altfest, chief investment officer for Altfest Personal Wealth Management, concurs with this logic and is adding to his investments in emerging market equities, he said, especially after they've taken another hit. Since the Nov. 8 election, emerging market shares such as the Chinese internet giant Tencent have fallen, while a broad range of shares in the American market have gained.
Historically, emerging market stocks have traded at roughly a 15 percent discount to United States shares based on price/earnings ratios that rely on five years of averaged profits, according to figures compiled by the Leuthold Group.
Today, that has widened to a near 50 percent discount.
Emerging market stocks weren't the only investments that had taken a hit because of rising interest rates lately.
In the aftermath of the election, the yield on 10-year Treasuries jumped to 2.4 percent, while 30-year Treasury yields rose to 3.1 percent. Both are up a full percentage point from their levels this summer, which helps to explain why the average long-term government bond mutual fund fell more than 7 percent in the month after the election.
Part of this slump in bonds stems from inflation fears, but some of it was also an outgrowth of comments by Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary, that to lock in today's low rates, he would be open to the government issuing ultralong bonds, with maturities of 50 and even 100 years. That could signal a big rise in government debt levels, which would tend to raise bond yields and lower prices, which move in the opposite direction.
In any case, bond investors may have overreacted in selling.
"It comes down to the question of timing," said Kathy A. Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. While $1 trillion of infrastructure would be inflationary, "every policy analyst I've talked to emphasizes how long it takes to implement these types of infrastructure projects."
The same goes for Mr. Mnuchin's speculation about new longer-dated bonds. It could take years for the Treasury to actually issue such bonds, Ms. Jones said, and as that realization takes hold and selling slows down, there may be some short-term opportunities in Treasuries, she added.
Investors may want to consider sectors that have underperformed during this postelection surge, even if they haven't declined.
Take technology. American tech stocks haven't moved much since election night.
Why? Conventional wisdom said that the new president's views on immigration and trade would hurt tech companies the most, in part because these firms generate a greater portion of their sales overseas -- 58 percent -- than any other sector of the market, according to FactSet, a financial research firm.
But Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer for BMO Private Bank, said the Trump administration's incipient economic goals appear to be threefold. "The first is to grow the economic pie, and then to widen the slices of both wages for workers and profits for companies," he said.
To accomplish that, the economy would need to increase productivity. "Ultimately, business investment has to be part of the solution, and because of that, tech will be critical," Mr. Ablin added.
This may not directly help consumer-focused companies like Apple, "but this should be good news to tech companies that sell to other businesses, like Salesforce.com," Mr. Ablin said.
Health care is another fertile area to consider, market strategists say. While big pharmaceutical companies rallied immediately after the election -- on the assumption that a Trump administration will relax regulations -- other parts of the sector have been largely flat on uncertainties surrounding the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Medical equipment stocks, for instance, have slumped on fears that if Obamacare is eliminated and fewer Americans are insured, hospitals will purchase less new equipment.
"Health care is an interesting area postelection because there is still so much uncertainty about Obamacare," said Mary L. Pierson, co-manager of Fairpointe Capital's mid-cap stock strategy.
Yet Ms. Pierson noted that some equipment makers are likely to grow with or without Obamacare, citing Varian Medical Systems, an equipment manufacturer based in Palo Alto, Calif., that makes devices for radiotherapy used in treating various forms of cancer. The company generates more than 50 percent of its revenues overseas. What's more, nearly 95 percent of all radiotherapy equipment installations over the next decade are expected to be handled by just two firms -- Varian and its rival, Elekta.
Ms. Pierson sees Varian's mediocre postelection performance as "an opportunity for us to add to our position."

Abstract: By buying enormous amounts of bonds in recent months, the European Central Bank has kept market interest rates low, part of efforts to encourage lending and bolster economic growth in the 19-country eurozone. Resistance to overhauls in Italy, as well as in France, has strengthened the arguments of those who say that European Central Bank support for the eurozone economy has allowed national leaders to procrastinate rather than deal with the region's problems, such as high government debt or laws that stifle entrepreneurship.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would buy large quantities of bonds and other assets for longer than planned but would cut the size of the purchases, a decision it insisted did not a signal that a much anticipated "tapering" of stimulus measures had begun.
"Tapering" is a loaded word in financial circles. By buying enormous amounts of bonds in recent months, the European Central Bank has kept market interest rates low, part of efforts to encourage lending and bolster economic growth in the 19-country eurozone. But by reducing its purchases over time, it could limit or reverse this effect.
It recalls the so-called taper tantrum in the United States in 2013 after Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that the American central bank would begin reducing its asset purchases. Market turmoil followed as investors sold Treasury bonds in anticipation of higher interest rates.
"There is no question about tapering," Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference. "Tapering has not been discussed today."
The response on financial markets showed that investors did not believe Mr. Draghi's rejection of the word, at least initially.
Although the central bank extended the time frame for asset purchases to the end of 2017 from March, investors focused on plans to reduce the asset purchases beginning in April to 60 billion euros, or about $64 billion, from [euro]80 billion.
Markets settled down after Mr. Draghi said that he defined tapering as "a process where purchases would go to zero."
"That has not been discussed," he said, adding: "There is no tapering in sight. The E.C.B. is going to stay in the markets."
European stocks rose and the yields on eurozone government bonds receded after Mr. Draghi offered those reassurances. Analysts who had initially declared the beginning of tapering modified their views.
"At first glance, today's decisions looked, walked and quacked like tapering," Carsten Brzeski, chief German economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients. "Draghi gave his best to convince everyone that it is not tapering. We tend to believe him."
Below are other issues that have raised concerns among some economists, investors and central bankers.
The Rise of Inflation
"Uncertainty prevails everywhere."
-- Mario Draghi, warning that despite inflation rising, the eurozone economy is still fragile.
The reasoning behind the European Central Bank's asset purchases is that they are one of the most effective ways to bring inflation in the eurozone closer to the official target of just under 2 percent. (In November, the annual inflation rate was 0.6 percent, a level considered unhealthy for the economy.)
Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that inflation would rise next year along with the price of oil. That is allowing the central bank to reduce the size of its asset purchases, which are a form of money printing.
But he also suggested the eurozone economy still was a long way from being in good health.
Signs of higher inflation have already prompted some economists to press for cuts to the bond buying, which critics say has distorted prices. When the European Central Bank ends the so-called quantitative easing program, they say, the shock to bond prices could destabilize the fragile eurozone economy.
The central bank's "argument in favor of bond purchases no longer holds for 2017," Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, an economic research group in Munich, said in a statement. "The negative side effects of the E.C.B.'s bond purchases will come to the fore."
Pushback Against Overhauls
"Our view is that easing monetary conditions should help undertaking structural reform."
-- Mr. Draghi, arguing that central bank policies have given political leaders more space to push through changes.
As he has for years, Mr. Draghi beseeched leaders of eurozone countries to take steps to help their economies grow faster, warning that the European Central Bank cannot guarantee the health of the common currency area on its own.
But when Italian voters rejected constitutional overhauls on Sunday, they also demonstrated how difficult it was for leaders to effect change.
Resistance to overhauls in Italy, as well as in France, has strengthened the arguments of those who say that European Central Bank support for the eurozone economy has allowed national leaders to procrastinate rather than deal with the region's problems, such as high government debt or laws that stifle entrepreneurship.
Mr. Draghi rejected those arguments on Thursday.
Rescuing Italy's Banks
"Vulnerabilities in the Italian banking system have been there a long time. They will be dealt with."
-- Mr. Draghi, offering restrained assurances that problems facing Italian banks can be solved.
Investors are showing nervousness about economic and political stability in the eurozone after the Italian referendum, as anti-European Union sentiment rises in much of the bloc.
If investors demand higher premiums to buy government bonds, the increase in borrowing costs are likely to ripple through credit markets and make it more difficult for businesses in the eurozone to grow.
One of the biggest fears in the wake of the Italian vote, and the resignation on Wednesday of the country's prime minister, Matteo Renzi, was that political uncertainty would upset plans to pump fresh capital into struggling Italian banks.
Mr. Draghi said those banks could be fixed -- the European Central Bank functions as the eurozone's supreme bank overseer, and it is ultimately responsible for the health of the area's banking system.
But Mr. Draghi also listed all the risks threatening global stability, including Britain's vote to exit the European Union and the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States. Mr. Draghi described the president-elect as having a "radical" new view of the world.
"I think what central banks can do," he said, "is keep a steady hand."
Correction: December 10, 2016, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the European Central Bank's bond-buying program misstated the actions taken by investors in 2013 after the chairman of the Federal Reserve suggested that the American central bank would begin reducing asset purchases. Investors sold Treasury bonds; they did not buy them.

Full text:   Working in fast-food is no picnic. The industry is infamous for grindingly low pay and labor law violations. Yet Andrew Puzder, the chief executive of the company that operates Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, has been chosen by President-elect Donald Trump as labor secretary.
Here is the record at those restaurants. When the Obama Labor Department looked at thousands of complaints involving fast-food workers, it found labor law violations in 60 percent of the investigations at Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, usually for failure to pay the minimum wage or time and a half for overtime.
The central problem for workers today is persistently low pay, even at profitable companies with highly paid executives. Mr. Puzder, however, has been adamantly opposed to a meaningful increase in the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour. Mr. Trump has said he could stomach an increase to $10, which is still abysmal. Ideally, a labor secretary, who is supposed to have a deeper understanding of this issue, would push for much more. But Mr. Puzder has said that a big raise would mean fewer jobs for workers starting out. Even if that was true, and the evidence suggests otherwise, there are millions more who would benefit from raising the minimum wage.
Mr. Puzder has also been a scathing critic of efforts by the Obama administration to update the rules for overtime-pay eligibility, which have not been fully adjusted for inflation since the mid-1970s. His argument boils down to an assertion that employees prefer a low salary and the "prestige" of a managerial title -- even though they would be entitled to overtime if they remained hourly employees. His opposition to the new overtime rules is especially troubling given that it would be his task as labor secretary to defend the rules, which have been challenged in court.
Mr. Puzder has also blamed the Affordable Care Act for causing a "restaurant recession." There is no evidence that health care reform has harmed job growth, and there is certainly no evidence of a restaurant recession.
Mandatory sick leave has been criticized by Mr. Puzder as well. He says it would be an undue burden on businesses. Yet in all other advanced economies, paid sick days, paid parental leave and similar policies are rightly seen as investments in human capital, as necessary as investments in plants and equipment.
For Mr. Puzder, being pro-business seems to mean being anti-worker. That makes him the wrong choice for labor secretary.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. The election of Donald J. Trump has set off a monthlong run of investor ebullience, whose highlight has been a sustained increase in the value of the dollar against the world's currencies.
It is a surge that has been embraced on Wall Street as a powerful emblem for a United States economy potentially poised to hit a higher gear thanks to tax cuts, government spending and regulatory relief -- policy measures that the president-elect has promised to enact immediately.
But around the globe, the surge in the dollar is provoking financial jitters.
Emerging market countries and corporations that have been binging on cheap dollar debt for more than a decade now face a spike in servicing costs and elevated debt burdens.
And the global financial giants -- banks, insurance companies and mutual, pension and sovereign wealth funds -- that have financed this $10 trillion borrowing bonanza must confront a period of higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions that will make them less willing to extend credit to companies and investors alike.
"It is the ubiquitous nature of the dollar and its role in the global banking system," said Hyun Song Shin, the head of research at the Bank of International Settlements, a forum for global central banks. "When the dollar goes up, it directly impairs the risk-taking capacities of banks and investors alike."
Last month, shortly after Mr. Trump's victory, Mr. Shin released a paper, circulated widely since, arguing that the new "fear gauge" on Wall Street is the direction of the dollar.
A sharp move up in the currency should be seen as a blinking red warning light for investors, he wrote. When it moves in the other direction, then it is "risk on," to use trader parlance for when it is time to lay down speculative bets.
Since the election last month, a broad index for the dollar has risen 4 percent. This move, however, masks even sharper increases against a number of currencies.
The dollar has gained 10 percent against the Mexican peso and 8 percent against the Japanese yen.
Against the Chinese yuan, the move has been less pronounced -- just 1.5 percent. But Mr. Trump's combative language toward China has ignited concerns in Beijing that local savers will try to send more of their deposits abroad, putting more downward pressure on the yuan.
The rockiest reaction so far to the dollar's tear has been in Turkey.
When the Turkish lira fell to its lowest level in decades against the dollar last week, the country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, took the unusual step of urging Turks to sell the dollars that they had been hoarding and buy their local currency.
With its high levels of debt in dollars and reliance on volatile capital flows for its financing needs, Turkey, more than most of its peers, has been vulnerable to the episodic fits of the emerging markets contagion that have plagued the global economy in recent decades.
Boldly new, as well as contentious, Mr. Shin's thesis has not been wholly embraced by economists and policy makers.
For example, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the regulator that keeps the closest eye on incipient financial risks, has made it clear on numerous occasions that the dollar's recent rise should be seen as a positive sign.
It is not just what a strong dollar says about a growing United States economy, but it is the further prospect that, as a result, Japan and Europe may also emerge from their years of deflationary slough.
"The dollar is firm because people view the U.S. economy as having a better outlook -- that is certainly a good thing," Mr. Dudley said in a recent interview with CNBC. "So that is not something I would be particularly concerned about."
But as Mr. Shin and his team of economists at the Bank of International Settlements see it, it is not just the threat of the dollar's rise precipitating a crisis in a dollar-sensitive market like Turkey, South Africa or Brazil that is cause for worry.
His concerns also center on the global banking system and the possibility that the dollar's rise will accentuate what he refers to as an emerging dearth of dollars, which could bring back memories of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, when a global rush into dollars created a liquidity panic.
Short-term borrowing rates skyrocketed, forcing hedge funds to shut down and banks to fail.
"The lessons of the dollar is that everything is connected," he said. "Spillovers and spill backs can loom large.
One way to observe this phenomenon is to track how much it costs to borrow in dollars for banks that use the yen, euro and Swiss franc.
Since the election, the cost of borrowing dollars short term in all these currencies has risen markedly, with Japan being the outlier.
And in countries like Malaysia, where exporters are hoarding dollars in fear of the currency weakening further, central banks are imposing rules requiring companies to exchange as much as 75 percent of their export earnings into the local currency, the ringgit.
Connections between sustained periods of dollar strength and bouts of financial instability have been drawn by other analysts, like Julian Brigden at Macro 2 Intelligence Partners. In particular, he points to two such periods.
The first is 1979 to 1985, when the dollar rose over 80 percent after Paul A. Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, increased interest rates and President Ronald Reagan came to power pushing tax cuts.
During this period, the Latin American debt crisis peaked and the United States' trade deficit with Japan grew to politically unacceptable levels, prompting what has come to be known as the Plaza Accord -- an agreement between the United States, Japan and Europe, the likes of which has not been seen since, to force a weakening of the dollar.
Then there were the years between 1995 to 2002, when currency crises rippled through Southeast Asia and the implosion of the dot-com boom in the United States rocked stock markets.
During such eras of dollar strength, global central banks were forced to dip into their reserves to defend their weakening currencies, leading to what some economists are now calling quantitative tightening.
That would be the flip side of quantitative easing, the policy of the past decade where central banks have flooded the world with cash in a bid to spur growth and combat deflation.
"This is a concern for Fed Chair Yellen," said Paul Christopher, an investment strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. "In the type of global economy we live in, she has to be careful about the dollar increasing too much, creating dollar shortages and liquidity problems as a result."
Correction: December 9, 2016, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the surge in the dollar and its effects on emerging markets misstated a goal of quantitative easing. It is to combat deflation, not inflation.

Full text:   The United States should not turn away from Latin America as many populist contingents, both Republican and Democratic, have suggested. Instead, we would be well served to model our economic policy off the experiences of an unlikely economic role model: Argentina.
For the last decade, the populist policies of the Kirchner regimes in Argentina led to inflation of over 40 percent, a painful recession, high unemployment and social unrest.
Worryingly, the four main economic policies that defined Argentina's lost decade of populism have been adopted or are actively being considered in some form or other in Washington: protectionist trade policies, aggressively loose central bank policy, oppressive government regulations and a government spending spree.
First, protectionist policies in Argentina destroyed the very agricultural and manufacturing heartland they were intended to help. The aim was to become self-reliant on domestic production and penalize those who exported or imported goods. Soy export tariffs, for example, eventually reached 50 percent, terminally crippling the crown jewel of Argentina's once thriving agricultural sector.
By the same token, import restrictions started small-scale trade wars, and by 2015 trade conflicts erupted with more than 40 different countries. This left the domestic agricultural and manufacturing sectors in disarray. As recently as 2002, Argentina had a trade surplus of 16 percent of gross domestic product, but after more than a decade of protectionism, the entire surplus was erased, and 2015 ended in a deficit.
Second, looking for easy sources of growth and debt financing, the government turned to the central bank. Destroying its supposed independence, the government influenced it to aggressively loosen policy. The result: Inflation exceeded 40 percent, hurting growth instead of helping it.
Third, oppressive regulations strangled the private sector. The government began controlling things like the price of gas, the value of the exchange rate and nationalization of the private pension system. Artificially distorted prices at first led industry to stop new investment and, later, to stop production altogether. Huge shortages developed. For example, although Argentina has significant natural energy resources, government regulation created huge energy deficits because artificially set prices and burdensome regulation made private investment completely infeasible.
An adversarial position toward the financial services industry caused problems like prolonged disputes with creditors and the nationalization of private companies -- all of which shut Argentina off from international capital markets.
Finally, with the private sector economy in shambles, the government embarked on a spending spree in an attempt to bolster growth. In 2003, when its populist fiscal policies first came into force, the government spent 93 billion pesos annually. By 2015, this soared to about 2.4 trillion pesos annually, mostly in the form of income transfers.
While this initially bought popular support, the government eventually ran out of money with little to show for its largess, as average annual G.D.P. growth was a meager 0.3 percent between 2011 and 2015.
With economic activity at a standstill, unemployment surging and inflation spiraling out of control, the populist regime finally lost the support it had mortgaged the future to maintain. In 2015, the country endorsed the end of populism, electing President Mauricio Macri to put into effect orthodox economic policy and bring the lost decade to a close.
Export tariffs and price controls have begun to be lifted, and the adversarial approach to private sector investors has been reversed. Exports can now bring in much-needed foreign currency, help stabilize the value of the peso over the long term and lower food prices.
Once ostracized, Argentina just this year has attracted over $20 billion in foreign investment into the government bond market alone. Investments in the private sector are also underway.
A highly credible central bank governor and board have been put in place and allowed to exercise independent monetary policy. Raising the central bank reference rate to 38 percent demonstrates technical understanding of what is required to fight inflation, and highlights the central bank's newfound ability to pursue policies that may be politically unpopular but are wholly necessary to ensure long-term macro stability. The government has also adopted prudently tight fiscal policies; an overhaul package recently passed the lower house with a two-thirds majority.
Credible fiscal and monetary policy has, for the first time, begun to anchor and bring down inflation expectations, thus lowering domestic interest rates. This has allowed the domestic financial market to re-emerge and begin to both raise and deploy capital to an economy starved of investment.
While Argentina's future looks bright, arriving at this new regime required a long, painful economic and social crisis.
The United States can choose to follow the path of Argentina's failed populist experiment to varying degrees. Or, we can use the experience of Argentina as a crystal ball and avoid the damaging consequences of populist economic policies.
We can choose instead to adopt the remedies Argentina found necessary to begin to create jobs and raise living standards: Eliminate heavy-handed government intervention, ensure we have an outward-looking trade policy, follow fiscally and monetarily prudent policies and promote, rather than stymie, private sector investment.

Full text:   Even with all the setbacks from recessions, burst bubbles and vanishing industries, the United States has still pumped out breathtaking riches over the last three and half decades.
The real economy more than doubled in size; the government now uses a substantial share of that bounty to hand over as much as $5 trillion to help working families, older people, disabled and unemployed people pay for a home, visit a doctor and put their children through school.
Yet for half of all Americans, their share of the total economic pie has shrunk significantly, new research has found.
This group -- the approximately 117 million adults stuck on the lower half of the income ladder -- "has been completely shut off from economic growth since the 1970s," the team of economists found. "Even after taxes and transfers, there has been close to zero growth for working-age adults in the bottom 50 percent."
The new findings, by the economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, provide the most thoroughgoing analysis to date of how the income kitty -- like paychecks, profit-sharing, fringe benefits and food stamps -- is divided among the American population.
Stagnant wages have sliced the share of income collected by the bottom half of the population to 12.5 percent in 2014, from 20 percent of the total in 1980. Where did that money go? Essentially, to the top 1 percent, whose share of the nation's income nearly doubled to more than 20 percent during that same 34-year period.
Inequality has been a defining national issue for nearly a decade, thanks in part to groundbreaking research done by Mr. Piketty at the Paris School of Economics and Mr. Saez at the University of California, Berkeley.
But now a new administration in Washington is promising to reshape the government's role in curbing the intense concentration of wealth at the top and improving the fortunes of those left behind.
During his tenure in the White House, President Obama pushed to address income stagnation by shifting more of the tax burden from the middle class to the rich and expanding public programs like universal health insurance.
Both strategies are now targeted by President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress, led by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Like many conservatives, Mr. Ryan argues that aid to the poor is ultimately counterproductive because it undermines the incentive to work. Proposals put forward by Republican leaders, though short on details, make clear that they want to roll back benefits like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which primarily help the poor, and direct the largest tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.
About 30 percent of the country's income is channeled to federal, state and local taxes. Apart from military spending and performing basic public services, much of that is distributed back to individuals through various programs and tax benefits in the form of Social Security checks, Medicare benefits and veterans' benefits. But until now, no one has truly measured the full impact that tax payments, government spending, noncash benefits and nontaxable income together have on inequality.
Abundant documentation of income inequality already exists, but it has been challenged as incomplete. Studies have excluded the impact of taxes and value of public benefits, skeptics complained, or failed to account for the smaller size of households over time.
This latest project tries to address those earlier criticisms. What the trio of economists found is that the spectacular growth in incomes at the peak has so outpaced the small increase at the bottom from public programs intended to ameliorate poverty and inequality that the gap between the wealthiest and everyone else has continued to widen.
Average incomes, adjusted for inflation, grew by 61 percent from 1980 to 2014. But nearly $7 out of every additional $10 went to those in the top tenth of the income scale.
Inequality has soared over that period. In 1980, the researchers found, someone in the top 1 percent earned on average the equivalent of $428,200 a year in 2014 dollars -- about 27 times more than the typical person in the bottom half, whose annual income equaled $16,000.
By 2014, the average income of half of American adults had barely budged, remaining around $16,000, while members of the top 1 percent brought home, on average, $1,304,800 or 81 times as much.
That ratio, the authors point out, "is similar to the gap between the average income in the United States and the average income in the world's poorest countries, the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Burundi."
The growth of incomes has probably increased a bit since 2014, the latest year for which full data exists, said Mr. Zucman, who, like Mr. Saez, also teaches at the University of California, Berkeley. But it is "not enough to make any significant difference to our long-run finding, and in particular, to affect the long-run stagnation of bottom-50-percent incomes."
He was to present the findings at a close-door workshop at the City University of New York on Tuesday.
Tax credits and programs like Medicare and disability payments have helped families at the lower half of the income scale. But they have just nipped at the heels of the underlying trend.
"It confirms the surge in income at the top," said Raj Chetty, an economist at Stanford unaffiliated with the project, who called the work "terrific and very important. And it shows government redistribution doesn't really change the picture."
Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard who also independently reviewed the research, agreed that the data underscored the inadequacies of programs that try to redress inequities after the fact. "It suggests that if you don't do something earlier in the market, before distribution, through better education or greater bargaining power, it's really tough to offset completely," Mr. Katz said. "Countries with less inequality do some of both."
Mr. Katz and Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist, have argued that advances in technology, while crucial to improving productivity and generating economic growth, also have exacerbated inequality by driving down wages of low-skilled workers. The rewards of education are greater than they have ever been, but advancement nationwide has slowed and the system confers many of its favors on the children of the affluent.
If there is a bright spot in the new comprehensive research, it is that after taxes and government spending, the middle class is in better shape than previous studies had shown. That earlier research had missed growth in nontaxable income like employee benefits. "The real income of the middle class is a bit better than we thought," Mr. Katz said.
As troubling as some may find inequality, it is not necessarily the fault of a rigged system, said N. Gregory Mankiw, an economist at Harvard who is familiar with the new research. He argues that large disparities in income more often than not accurately reflect widely varying economic contributions.
"Inequality is a symptom of a variety of things," Mr. Mankiw said. Technological progress may be a cause, but it benefits society over all, whereas the weakness of the educational system is clearly negative.
Edward Conard, the author of "The Upside of Inequality" and a former business partner of Mitt Romney, agreed. "People say this is zero-sum game, and you're taking money that would have gone to the other 50 percent," he said. "That's not what happened."
Instead, Mr. Conard said, entrepreneurs in the United States have been willing to take big risks that have helped foster an infrastructure that promotes innovation, not just in Silicon Valley but in many other growing places around the country. "When rewards go up, people are more inclined to take risks," he said. Some of those risks pay off and create wealth for everyone.
The new research challenges that contention, at least in part.
Mr. Piketty, Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman concluded that the main driver of wealth in recent years has been investment income at the top. That is a switch from the 1980s and 1990s, when gains in income were primarily generated by working.
That divergence can slow innovation and further entrench inequities, said Heather Boushey, an economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. When labor income provides the primary route to riches, it creates incentives for people to improve their education and work harder, Ms. Boushey explained. But if getting ahead requires already having a stockpile of cash or inheriting a windfall from your parents, then it is much harder to work your way up.
"If you're closing off entryways, then you are basically shutting off avenues to competitiveness, innovation and growth," Ms. Boushey said, "even if you don't care about fairness."

Abstract: Gold, oil and even cocoa bean prices have all dropped, leaving Ghana with a currency crisis, an electricity shortage and a fed-up population that is having trouble seeing the benefits of any incremental progress Mr. Mahama has achieved. Mr. Mahama, a former vice president who ascended in 2012 after the death of his predecessor, John Atta Mills, faces a tough race against Nana Akufo-Addo, a perennial presidential candidate who has emerged as the front-runner of several other opposition candidates on Wednesday's ballot.

Full text:   ACCRA, Ghana -- In the four years that Ghana's president, John Mahama, has been in office, the nation's economy has plunged along with oil and commodities prices. The West African country is on track this year to grow at its slowest rate in more than two decades.
As voters go to the polls on Wednesday, Mr. Mahama is seeking to convince them that he has helped steady and has somewhat improved a situation created by global forces beyond his control.
Gold, oil and even cocoa bean prices have all dropped, leaving Ghana with a currency crisis, an electricity shortage and a fed-up population that is having trouble seeing the benefits of any incremental progress Mr. Mahama has achieved.
"We have done much work, but more needs to be done and we can only advance faster if we press on and stay the course," Mr. Mahama told a rally of his supporters on Monday, according to Reuters.
While Mr. Mahama has sought to revamp Ghana's infrastructure, soaring debt and high inflation have hampered the economy. To cope with the mounting debt, Mr. Mahama's government took a $918 million bailout last year from the International Monetary Fund, which says uncertainty over oil and gas outputs jeopardize the country's chances for faster growth in the near future.
Mr. Mahama, a former vice president who ascended in 2012 after the death of his predecessor, John Atta Mills, faces a tough race against Nana Akufo-Addo, a perennial presidential candidate who has emerged as the front-runner of several other opposition candidates on Wednesday's ballot.
On the streets of Accra, the two main candidates' faces are everywhere on billboards and T-shirts, while supporters drape party flags out of car windows.
Mr. Akufo-Addo, 72, a lawyer, has hinged his campaign on the economy, pledging to create jobs for young people and stabilize the currency, which has sunk in past months.
"The atmosphere is ripe for change," said Perry Okudzeto, a spokesman for Mr. Akufo-Addo's campaign, citing a weak economy. "The people of Ghana are tired."
It's unclear whether Mr. Akufo-Addo's New Patriotic Party can mobilize urban voters who felt the pinch of electricity cuts and the economic slowdown in recent years, according to Franklin Cudjoe, president of the Imani Center for Policy and Education, a Ghanaian research organization.
In the past, Mr. Akufo-Addo's strategy has relied on traveling the world trying to gain the support of leaders in the United States and elsewhere. In recent months, his campaign has focused more on rallying grass-roots support.
For many Ghanaians, the economic slowdown has been palpable.
Alfred Bossman, a 42-year-old electrical engineer, said the cost of doing business was too high and that economic development had been hamstrung by corruption.
"A lot of money has gone into the wrong hands," said Mr. Bossman, who said he planned to vote for Mr. Akufo-Addo because he had faith in the candidate's ability to turn the economy around.
Emelia Larbi, 38, plans to vote for him, too. She lost her vending stand in floods that devastated Accra last year. Mr. Akufo-Addo might give her and other Ghanaians a fresh start, she said.
Mr. Mahama has tried to draw more attention to his infrastructure projects. Last week he unveiled the Greater Accra Regional Hospital, a sprawling facility funded by a $155 million loan from the United States Export-Import Bank. The president has also emphasized his spending on roads, railways and ports, and says future projects will be financed mostly through public-private partnerships and the private sector.
An economy supporting so many infrastructure projects "cannot be said to be an economy that is dying," said Kofi Adams, Mr. Mahama's campaign coordinator.
"Our president and government have performed," Mr. Adams said. "This is a government that has brought a lot of things that did not exist into this country."
The president has centered his campaigning in areas that have benefited from his infrastructure improvements. In some areas the strategy has paid off.
Nana Asare, 37, who sells auto parts, said he would vote for Mr. Mahama because he was optimistic the president's modernization efforts could deliver more jobs.
"I have trust in him," Mr. Asare said.
Despite scattered claims of voter intimidation in an extremely close race, election observers in Ghana said they expected another peaceful vote. For the last two decades the nation has handed off power from leader to leader with calm, even as neighboring countries endured violent presidential transitions.
Both chief candidates in Wednesday's election have signed agreements calling on supporters to uphold the peace, no matter the result.
"Ghana has set the gold standard for democracy in West Africa," said Johnnie Carson, a board member of the National Democratic Institute, which is helping monitor the vote. "Elections have been close, but they have always been largely peaceful, fair and transparent."

Full text:   Departing occupants of the White House rarely hand off an improving economy to a successor from the opposing party.
When Barack Obama was waiting in the wings after the 2008 presidential election, for example, the economy was in a severe downward spiral: Employers reported cutting 533,000 jobs that November, the biggest monthly loss in a generation.
But according to the government's report on Friday, Donald J. Trump can expect to inherit an economy that has added private sector jobs for 80 months, put another 178,000 people on payrolls last month and pushed the unemployment rate down to 4.6 percent today from 4.9 percent the previous month. Wage growth, though slower, is still running ahead of inflation, and consumers are expressing the highest levels of confidence in nearly a decade.
The Federal Reserve is confident enough about the economy's underlying strength that it is now set to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets later this month.
The jobless rate for November, the lowest since August 2007, "is a testimony to how strong employment growth has been," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
Jason Furman, now chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, remembers the transition eight years ago, when he was crammed into his office with a circle of key officials as the latest jobs numbers from the Labor Department landed.
"It was an utterly terrifying time, the likes of which none of us had ever seen in our lifetimes," Mr. Furman recalled. Fearing that "the economy was following the same trajectory that it did at the beginning of the Great Depression," everyone was focused on how to "rapidly slow the bleeding and figure out how to get the economy growing again."
By contrast, Mr. Furman said, "the economy today is healthy and it's improving."
For all the improvements, tens of millions of Americans understandably feel that the recovery has passed them by. Those without skills are relegated to low-paying positions without steady schedules, security and benefits. Breadwinners who once held well-compensated manufacturing jobs are angry about being forced to settle for lower-wage service jobs -- or no jobs at all.
Profound anxiety, particularly among the white working class, about the ability to reach or comfortably remain in the middle class is one of the factors that helped propel Mr. Trump to the White House.
Pockets of weakness also surfaced in the latest jobs report, which showed that more people dropped out of the labor force last month than joined it. Manufacturing jobs declined further, and there are still plenty of part-time workers who would rather be full time. And while the official jobless rate for high school graduates fell to 4.9 percent, it is more than twice the rate for college graduates.
"There is a bifurcation of the work force," Jonas Prising, chairman and chief executive of the ManpowerGroup, one of the largest recruiters in the United States. People who are able to take advantage of advances in technology, globalization and other shifts that favor those with the right skills for the nation's advanced services are thriving.
For others, the prospects do not look good. "There used to be part of the work force that had well-paying jobs that were low or unskilled," Mr. Prising said. "Those kinds of jobs are very difficult to find today."
The deal that Mr. Trump made with the heating and cooling company Carrier this week to keep 1,000 manufacturing jobs from moving to Mexico from Indiana is emblematic of the kind of actions he said he would take as president to help blue-collar workers.
But there are limits to the power of persuasion.
Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan and a former economic adviser to Mr. Obama, said that manufacturing, while still a driving force in the economy, employed fewer and fewer people. More than 80 percent of jobs are now in the service industry, Ms. Stevenson said, and Mr. Trump should be thinking more about how to match workers with those jobs.
"The economy is in a great place, and his biggest challenge is continuing that," she said.
Some economists worry that the Federal Reserve is too focused on fears of future inflation and that it should hold off on any increase in rates until conditions have improved further. "There's no reason to pre-emptively slow the economy down, given that we're starting from less than full employment," said Elise Gould, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington. "Right now, the priority should be keeping the economy on track and moving it forward."
Such pleas are unlikely to win the day. At last month's meeting of the Federal Reserve, members concluded that the case for an increase in the benchmark rate had been "strengthened," and that they would be ready to move "so long as incoming data provided some further evidence of continued progress."
Many employers are having a harder time finding and retaining workers.
"Recruiting is a tough issue right now in skilled and semiskilled industries," said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City. He mentioned a particular need for workers in accounting, information technology, call centers, warehousing and office and professional services.
Mr. Funk said employers often complained about being unable to find employees with a strong work ethic who met the minimum requirements. "Drug screening is a real challenge in many parts of the country," he said. "Only 30 percent can pass a drug screen in the state of Washington," where marijuana is legal.
At the same time, employers have been reluctant to raise wages to a level that might lure back sidelined workers. The result has been that the country has 5.5 million job openings, a near-record level, but still relatively anemic labor force participation rates.
"The challenge out there now is finding workers and keeping the workers you have," said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group. Those shortages, whatever the cause, are likely to push wages higher next year, he said.
"People are feeling good not only about their current income but their future income," Mr. Rick said.
Whatever the economy's current failings, Mark J. Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University in Virginia, said it was nonetheless better than the ones most incoming presidents have faced in the last half-century.
"Trump can be thankful that his predecessor is handing him a fairly strong situation," Mr. Rozell said, "especially when compared to many past party transfers of power."

Full text:   Investors on Wall Street made a small move back to safer assets Friday afternoon after the November employment report showed continued hiring but weak wages.
Indexes finished little changed as real estate and household goods companies rose, but banks, which have soared since the presidential election, took losses.
The Dow lost 21.51 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,170.42. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.87 point to 2,191.95. The Nasdaq composite added 4.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,255.65.
Most stocks finished higher, and the biggest gains went to companies that pay big dividends, similar to bonds. Investors also bought bonds, sending their yields down.
The dollar also weakened as investors expected less inflation.
The jobs report called into question some investors' hopes about the state of the United States economy, and they reversed some of the moves they have made since the presidential election three weeks ago.
The Labor Department said employers added 178,000 jobs in November as hiring continued at a steady pace. Investors have long expected that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates later this month, and the jobs report did nothing to dispel that notion. Behind the positive headline numbers, however, fewer people looked for work and hourly wages slipped.
The weak finish on Wall Street appeared to mark an end, at least for now, of the postelection rally for United States stocks. The S.&P. 500 and Nasdaq fell this week after a three-week rally took them to record highs. The Dow finished slightly higher.
Bond prices, which have been falling sharply since the presidential election, rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.39 percent from 2.45 percent.
Lower bond yields pushed investors to buy utility and real estate companies and consumer goods makers, which are often compared to bonds because of their big dividend payments. General Growth Properties rose 62 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $25.46 and Exelon rose 84 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $33.01. PepsiCo climbed $1.57, or 1.6 percent, to $100.60.
The drop in bond yields also affected banks because yields are linked to long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates mean banks cannot make as much money from lending. Goldman Sachs fell $3.27, or 1.4 percent, to $223.36, while Citigroup gave up $1.25, or 2.2 percent, to $56.02.
Benchmark United States crude added 62 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $51.68 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for pricing international oils, picked up 52 cents, or 1 percent, to $54.46 a barrel in London.
The dollar fell to 113.57 yen from 114. The euro rose to $1.0662 from $1.0660.
Starbucks shares slid $1.30, or 2.2 percent, to $57.21 after the coffee chain said that Howard Schultz would step down as chief in April. He will remain chairman, and Starbucks said he will focus on new ideas like high-end shops. Kevin Johnson, the president and chief operating officer, will take over as chief executive. Mr. Schultz gave up the chief executive title in 2000, and investors feel Starbucks struggled until he returned to that post again in 2008.
The human resources software company Workday gave a weak forecast. Aneel Bhusri, the chief executive, said some customers have recently delayed completing large deals, partly because of "global uncertainties," including Britain's planned exit from the European Union, the rise of Donald J. Trump to the presidency in the United States and elections elsewhere. Workday's stock tumbled $10.20, or 12.5 percent, to $71.40.
Gold rose $8.20 to $1,175.10 an ounce.
Major indexes around the world retreated. In Europe, the CAC-40 in France fell 0.7 percent, the FTSE 100 index in Britain finished 0.3 percent lower, and Germany's DAX fell 0.2 percent. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Japan shed 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng retreated 1.4 percent.

Full text:   Donald J. Trump spent much of his campaign peddling hope to beleaguered working-class Americans that, on his watch, those old-fashioned, good-paying manufacturing jobs would come back to America.
On Thursday, the president-elect was in Indiana to celebrate the news that the Carrier Corporation will move only 1,300 jobs to Mexico, not 2,100 as planned. That's not bringing jobs back to the United States; they are just leaving more slowly.
Manufacturing employment in the United States peaked at 19.6 million in June 1979; today, 12.3 million Americans work in factories. Even during the economic recovery, amid proclamations of a renaissance in American manufacturing, production jobs barely grew. So far in 2016, they have fallen by 62,000, even as 1.8 million new jobs were created.
The lesson: You can't fight a vast tide with a Twitter account.
To some degree, trade liberalization -- including those deals that Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders railed against -- has encouraged countries like China to engage in anti-competitive practices. But the vast preponderance of American job losses has come simply because emerging-market countries have gotten much better at making stuff with workers earning far less.
In 2015, a typical factory employee in the United States earned $37.71 an hour, including benefits; his Mexican counterpart received $5.90 an hour. And American executives say that the productivity that they get in Mexico is at least as good as what they get in the United States.
No wonder then that Mexico currently has a booming auto sector. Between 2007 and 2015, employment in the Mexican auto sector grew to 675,000 from 174,000, while auto jobs in the United States increased to only 900,000 from 828,000.
Mr. Trump's recent proclamation that he kept a Ford plant in Kentucky from closing was a mirage -- Ford never planned to shutter the plant or eliminate any positions. More significantly, Ford is still going forward with the construction of a $1.6 billion facility in Mexico to assemble small cars, which cannot be done profitably using expensive American labor.
All told, the Detroit car companies plan to invest $30 billion in Mexican facilities and hire 30,000 more workers over the next four years. By 2020, analysts project that about 40 percent of small cars sold by the Detroit automakers will be made in Mexico, more than double current levels.
Against that backdrop, I don't see how the Carrier experience -- even in its imperfect state -- can be replicated.
For one thing, Carrier was apparently promised $700,000 a year in state tax incentives. It's simply not realistic for Mr. Trump (or anyone) to run around the country subsidizing manufacturing jobs at high costs.
For another, Carrier's parent corporation, United Technologies, garners about 10 percent of its revenues from Pentagon contracts, making the company particularly receptive to a president-elect.
And, of course, Mr. Trump's mouth-to-mouth combat can do little to address the equally important problem of wages. Thanks to pressure from low-wage countries, average hourly earnings for manufacturing workers in Indiana have dropped to $19.20 from $23.70 in 2003, after adjusting for inflation.
Beyond using political tactics, Mr. Trump wants to pursue his campaign agenda of renegotiating trade deals and imposing high tariffs once he has his hands on the levers of power. Higher import duties would hurt the very people Mr. Trump is trying to help. Thanks to trade, prices of many goods have fallen. In the decade between 2002 and 2012, the prices of toys dropped by 43 percent and those of furniture and bedding fell by 7 percent.
All told, one study of 40 countries found that if international trade ended, the wealthiest consumers would lose 28 percent of their purchasing power while those in the bottom tenth, who typically rely on more imported goods, would lose 63 percent. Sure, a small number of manufacturing jobs would return, but at an extraordinary price.
Let's instead focus on a sensible economic plan to help those Trump voters who are hurting.
For starters, the president-elect is correct that more logical tax policies need to be pursued; our loophole-ridden corporate tax code encourages American companies to move abroad. And yes, some regulations hurt our competitiveness.
But his solutions (like huge tax cuts for the rich) smack of giveaways to capitalists rather than effective ways to help blue-collar workers in Michigan. More useful measures would be to raise the just 0.1 percent of our gross domestic product we spend on retraining workers, one-sixth of the average of other wealthy countries.
Mr. Trump's priorities seem to be elsewhere; Republican plans to slash federal spending would reduce the help Washington gives struggling workers.
That highlights the conundrum of Trumponomics: He is offering an economic plan devoid of policies that would help the voters who elected him.

Full text:   The United States economy in the third quarter grew at the fastest pace in two years, according to a revised report that showed stronger consumer spending than first estimated.
The gross domestic product, the country's total output of goods and services, expanded at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the July-September period, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday. That is up from a previous estimate of 2.9 percent.
The revision was significantly better than the meager gains of 0.8 percent in the first quarter and 1.4 percent in the second, when the economy was being held back by a strong dollar and weak business investment.
The 3.2 percent increase was expected to be the best showing for the year. Economists say they believe growth has slowed to around 2 percent in the current quarter. At the moment, they are forecasting growth of 2 to 2.5 percent for 2017.
But analysts caution that the outlook for next year could shift significantly based on policy changes -- like tax cuts and higher trade tariffs -- that President-elect Donald J. Trump has promised.
"Uncertainty regarding our forecasts is higher than usual, given expected fiscal and trade policy changes under the new administration," said Blerina Uruci, a Barclays economist.
The latest look at G.D.P., the second of three estimates from the government, showed that consumer spending grew at a rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, better than the 2.1 percent first estimated. The newfound strength reflected more spending than initially thought in such areas as auto purchases and utility bills. Still, consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, slowed from a gain of 4.3 percent in the second quarter.
Other areas of strength were in export sales, which grew at a 10.1 percent rate. Although the figure partly reflected a temporary surge in exports of soybeans, economists are hopeful that exports will show further gains in the coming months. Earlier in the year, American manufacturers were battered by a strong dollar, which made their goods more expensive on overseas markets.
For the year, the economy was expected to grow a modest 1.5 percent, down from 2.6 percent in 2015, which was the best performance in the seven years since the recession ended in mid-2009.
While G.D.P. growth is expected to slow, analysts still expect the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate at its meeting in December. It would be the first rate increase since the Fed raised its benchmark rate by a quarter-point a year ago.
During the recent campaign, Mr. Trump deplored what he saw as a sluggish economic recovery under President Obama; economic growth has averaged around 2 percent since the end of the recession. Mr. Trump said he wanted to set a national goal of reaching 4 percent growth during his administration.
Most economists think that may be overly optimistic, given tepid productivity growth and the mass retirement of baby boomers, which they say would weaken growth in the labor market.
Some economists have said they will increase their economic growth forecasts if Mr. Trump is successful in getting Congress to pass his package of tax cuts and increased spending in such areas as military
and infrastructure projects. But their current estimates put growth at around 2.5 percent over the next two years, an improvement from their current forecast of growth next year of around 2 percent, but well below Mr. Trump's 4 percent target.

Full text:   JERUSALEM -- Within days of Donald J. Trump's election to the presidency, Jerusalem's city planning chief declared an end to the era of holding up new housing for Jewish residents in contentious neighborhoods out of deference to American objections.
Last week, he followed through, advancing a long-delayed plan to build 500 homes, a down payment on thousands more to come. The mayor's office insisted that the timing was coincidental and the decision not political. But the planning chief made clear that he saw a green light to proceed "now that Trump" had won.
Call it the Trump Effect. Around the world, his election is already shaping events -- or at least perceived to be shaping them -- even though he will not take office for seven more weeks. Companies hoping to profit from Mr. Trump's economic policies have seen shares soar. Countries fearing his anti-trade stance have seen the value of their currencies plunge against the dollar. Governments are recalibrating policies on trade, defense and immigration.
The behavior of the global markets toward Mr. Trump has been uneven. On Monday, stocks and the dollar slipped slightly and bond prices rose, perhaps indicating a bit of caution after the postelection stock market surge.
Much of the markets' mixed reaction reflects uncertainty about a new president who has never held public office, leaving political leaders, business executives and international institutions to make bets on how a Trump administration may rewrite rules that have governed global affairs under American presidents of both parties.
"For allies and adversaries alike, the election of Donald Trump represents the likely abandonment of a decades-old U.S. commitment to uphold the global order," said Ivo Daalder, a former United States ambassador to NATO who is now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.
For some, there was initially a promising forecast. American and foreign stock markets climbed in what some analysts called "the Trump bump." The Dow Jones industrial average has broken several records since the election, and last week topped 19,000 for the first time amid expectations of more business-friendly regulatory policies. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have fared particularly well.
European firms have seen stock prices rise, too. Deutsche Bank, whose shares shot up as high as 17 percent after the election, has reasons for optimism beyond its longtime ties to Mr. Trump's businesses. With the Justice Department proposing a $14 billion fine as it begins negotiations with the bank over its handling of mortgage-backed securities in the 2008 financial crisis, some in Germany hope a new administration will ease up and loosen regulations.
Another company that has seen its share value increase since the election is Magal Security Systems, an Israeli firm that helped develop high-tech security barriers around Gaza and the West Bank. With Mr. Trump's promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico, investors expect that firms like Magal could get some of the business. Magal's shares rose as high as 24 percent above their pre-election level, with trading volume as much as 150 times higher.
For the same reason, Mexico has taken an economic hit since the election. Besides the wall, Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico's peso has fallen sharply, and its central bank last week slashed its growth projection for next year, citing "the electoral process in the United States."
Other economies have reacted with trepidation amid fears that Mr. Trump's policies may drive up interest rates and inflation, an expectation that some traders call Trumpflation.
Some countries are trying to figure out how to respond in other ways. Leaders of NATO allies are looking at increasing military spending in response to Mr. Trump's insistence that they pay a greater share of their defense. Lithuania last week chose a new prime minister, who renewed the nation's promise to raise security spending.
In the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte has feuded with President Obama, the government has tried to gain favor in Mr. Trump's Washington. Mr. Duterte named as his new trade envoy to the United States Jose E. B. Antonio, a real estate tycoon who is helping build Trump Tower Manila. After Britain rebuffed Mr. Trump's suggestion to name Nigel Farage, a leader of the "Brexit" campaign to leave the European Union, as ambassador to the United States, The Times of London reported that Mr. Farage may move to America anyway.
In many places, there is still much head scratching over Mr. Trump. The mass-circulation Bild Zeitung in Germany secured exclusive rights to translating into German the whole interview Mr. Trump gave to The New York Times last week. Bungeishunju, the Japanese publisher of "Trump Revealed," by the Washington Post journalists Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, reprinted an additional 10,000 copies.
In China, initial optimism about Mr. Trump is giving way to skepticism. "We should stop imagining what benefits Trump's election could bring to China," Zhu Chenghu, a retired major general, said at a seminar at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing on Friday. "He will return to the traditional policies that rely on the role of the U.S. dollar and seek expansion overseas."
Mr. Trump's election is getting credit, or blame, for all sorts of events, no matter how tangential. In Russia, a newspaper interviewed an analyst who suggested that the arrest of a cabinet minister on bribery charges may have resulted from Mr. Trump's success because Moscow no longer had to fear going after protégés of reformers who were once close to Washington.
Nowhere has the Trump Effect been more visible than in Jerusalem, where the political right has openly rejoiced at the election. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had a prickly relationship with Mr. Obama, has made clear to associates that he is overjoyed at Mr. Trump's ascension.
Members of Mr. Netanyahu's coalition expect Mr. Trump to abandon the practice of Mr. Obama and presidents of both parties who tried to restrain Israel from building housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Shortly after the election, a Trump adviser said settlements were not an obstacle to peace, appearing to have adopted the argument Mr. Netanyahu makes.
"The next few weeks present a unique window of opportunity for Israel," Naftali Bennett, who leads a pro-settler party in Mr. Netanyahu's cabinet, told a conference sponsored by The Jerusalem Post last week. After years of American pressure, he added, "it's ours to decide."
Betty Herschman, the director of international relations for Ir Amim, a group that opposes settlement construction, said it was too early to know what Mr. Trump's policy would actually be. But she said one thing was clear: "The Israeli right is already celebrating."
A case in point was last week's decision on 500 new housing units in Ramat Shlomo, an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of annexed East Jerusalem across the "green line" delineating the border that existed until Israel won the 1967 war. The development had been in the works for years without being built. An announcement that it would proceed in 2010 while Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was visiting Israel infuriated Mr. Obama and his team.
Brachie Sprung, a spokeswoman for Mayor Nir Barkat, said last week's action by the municipal planning committee was a result of the developer's coming back to the city with revisions to his plan that required new approval.
"There has been no political statement here with this piece of land," she said.
But it was easy to see the move in the context of the emerging Trump era. Meir Turgeman, the deputy mayor who leads the planning committee, had just days earlier promised to advance 7,000 housing units that were delayed under American pressure, and he named Ramat Shlomo as an example.
"I intend to exploit the change of the guard in the U.S.A. and bring them to approval," Mr. Turgeman told Israel's Channel 2. Until now, he said, there had been pressure from Mr. Netanyahu's office not to proceed to avoid angering Washington. "That's over. From now, we intend to take the plans out of deep freeze."

Full text:   Stocks on Wall Street pulled back slightly on Monday, retreating from the records set last week.
Consumer companies and banks took some of the largest losses. Small-company stocks, which have been outperforming the rest of the market for weeks, gave back some of their recent gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 54.24 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,097.90. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 11.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,201.72 and the Nasdaq composite lost 30.11 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,368.81.
Consumer discretionary stocks were among the hardest hit after the closely watched post-Thanksgiving sales push.
Amazon, the online retail giant, fell $13.60, or 1.7 percent, to $766.77 after Citigroup analysts cut their price target on the stock, citing deep discounting by the retailer to compete during the holiday shopping season. Barnes & Noble fell 30 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $12.65 on reports the bookseller was also doing deep discounting to attract customers.
The declines on Monday follow what has been a remarkable rally in November since Donald J. Trump won the United States presidential election. Investors have made big bets that Mr. Trump, with a Republican-led Congress, will push to deregulate energy and banking and cut taxes, which could lead to stronger economic growth.
"The economic and equity market backdrop was already improving before the election," Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, wrote in a note to investors. "Trump's victory and the Republican sweep provided a catalyst for investors to ratchet up their optimism."
The Russell 2000, an index of smaller companies lost, 1.3 percent on Monday, ending a 15-day winning streak. That was the longest winning streak for the index in 20 years, which rose roughly 11.6 percent this month alone.
Banks also fell more than the rest of the market, with the financial sector of the S.&P. 500-stock index falling 1.4 percent. Banks have surged since the election on speculation that the Trump administration would roll back some regulations put into place after the financial crisis.
Investors have also pulled out of the bond market, betting that higher economic growth will also lead to higher inflation, something the United States economy has had little of since the financial crisis.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.31 percent from 2.36 percent. Bond prices have been falling sharply since the election as investors anticipated that Mr. Trump's policies could lead to higher economic growth and higher inflation. The yield on the 10-year note was 1.83 percent the day before the election.
The price of benchmark oil jumped $1.02, or 2.2 percent, to $47.08 a barrel in New York ahead of the Wednesday meeting of OPEC, where oil-producing countries may consider a broad cut in production. Brent crude oil, the international standard, rose $1, or 2 percent, to $48.24 a barrel in London.
In other energy trading, heating oil rose 4 cents to $1.51 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline rose 4 cents, to $1.41 a gallon, and natural gas rose 15 cents, to $3.23 per thousand cubic feet.
The euro edged higher against the dollar, to $1.0597 from $1.0592 on Friday. The dollar fell to 112.26 Japanese yen from 113.04 yen.
The price of gold rose $12.40, to $1,190.60 an ounce. Silver rose 11 cents, to $16.58 an ounce, and copper fell 1 cent, to $2.657 a pound.

Full text:   In the wake of the election, it's clear American society is fractured. Negative emotions are running amok, and countless words of anger and frustration have been spilled. If you were to analyze this news outlet for the ratio of positive emotional words to negative ones, would you find a dip linked to the events of the past few weeks?
It's possible, suggests a study published last week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Analyzing Google Books and The New York Times's archives from the last 200 years, the researchers examined a curious phenomenon known as "positive linguistic bias," which refers to people's tendency to use more positive words than negative words. Though the bias is robust -- and found consistently across cultures and languages -- social scientists are at odds about what causes it.
In this study, the authors shed light on some possible new patterns behind the effect. Across two centuries' of texts, they found that people's preference for positive words varied with national mood, and declined during times of war and economic hardship.
"It's been shown that linguistic positivity bias exists, over and over again. What people haven't actually looked at is how this phenomenon fluctuates over time, and whether there are certain predictors for it," said Morteza Dehghani, a professor of psychology and computer science at the University of Southern California and an author of the paper.
To measure linguistic positivity, Dr. Dehghani's team looked at catalogs of words associated with positive and negative emotions, from a collection called the linguistic inquiry and word count, or LIWC, database. The positive category included about 400 words, including "awesome," "pretty" and "grace." The negative one included about 500 words, including "suffer," "grief" and "hatred."
Then the researchers looked at how many times these positive and negative words appeared each year, across 1.3 million texts in Google Books and 14.9 million New York Times articles. They also analyzed word usage relative to unemployment and inflation rates, wartime casualty estimates and national happiness surveys.
Looking for changes over time can provide clues about the mechanism behind the linguistic positivity bias, said William Hamilton, a doctoral candidate at Stanford University who focuses on linguistic trends and was not involved in the study.
Many theories have been proposed: Maybe it's because we're social creatures, and affirmative language promotes group bonding and cooperation. Maybe we inherently privilege positive information. Maybe, optimistically, more good things than bad things happen overall, and the words we use reflect that.
"When you're looking at a static snapshot of time, it's hard to disentangle all these competing hypotheses," Mr. Hamilton said.
The new study provides evidence that positive language use may change depending on objective circumstances, such as war and poverty, as well as subjective happiness. What may be less compelling is the researchers' finding that there is an overall decrease in positive language use over the last 200 years.
Tools like the LIWC database were developed around "the way people write and talk today," said Mark Liberman, a linguistics professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was not part of the study. As a result, the database doesn't capture changes in word meanings and frequency of use. Over time the word "awesome," for instance, changed from meaning "daunting" to being synonymous with "good."
Additionally, experts in linguistics and textual analysis say that the composition of text collections like Google Books change over time, confounding attempts to extract chronological patterns.
"It's a compelling trend they find," Mr. Hamilton said, "but there needs to be more follow-ups for me to be totally confident this is something that's happening."
Rumen Iliev, a psychology researcher at Stanford University and a co-author of the paper, said these concerns are legitimate, but that this study is just the beginning.
"We hope that our research will generate novel research which will use both different dictionaries and different databases," he said.

Full text:   Stocks hit fresh records in a shortened trading session on Friday as investors continued to bet on a pickup in economic growth and rising corporate profits.
The gains were modest but broad; nearly every sector in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose. Utilities rose the most, up 1.4 percent.
Indexes have been rising since the presidential election, and Friday's close capped the third consecutive week of S.&P. 500 gains.
Investors anticipate that plans by President-elect Donald J. Trump to cut taxes, reduce regulations and spend on infrastructure will speed economic growth. Investors are also reacting to recent signs of a pickup in growth in other major economies around the world, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.
"We haven't had a synchronized bounce in growth across the globe ever in this recovery," Mr. Paulsen said. "This is the first time you're getting all the economic boats going north at the same time, and I think stock markets are reflecting that."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 19,152.14. The S.&P. 500 advanced 8.63 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,213.35. The Nasdaq composite added 18.24 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,398.92.
The market closed at 1 p.m. Eastern time. Trading was relatively quiet as investors returned from the Thanksgiving holiday.
Investors sold bonds again on fear that inflation in the future could eat into their fixed payments. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 2.36 percent.
Ten of the 11 sectors in the S.&P. 500 rose. Energy companies fell with the price of oil. ConocoPhillips lost 55 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $45.75.
The electricity supplier Entergy rose $1.41, or 2.1 percent, to $69.53. The climb in utilities reflects investor desire for steady dividends. Telephone companies, which also pay big dividends, rose, too. AT&T was up 48 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $39.21.
Among other stocks moving on Friday, Johnson & Johnson rose $1.06, or 0.9 percent, to $114.13 after the company said it was in early talks to buy the Swiss drug maker Actelion.
Stocks closed higher overseas, too.
The FTSE 100 in Britain and CAC 40 in France each rose 0.2 percent. In Germany, the DAX inched up 0.1 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index finished 0.3 percent higher and the South Korean Kospi edged up 0.2 percent. Stocks in Hong Kong, Australia, Taiwan and Singapore also advanced.
Oil prices fell sharply. Benchmark United States crude fell $1.90, or 4 percent, to $46.06 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost $1.71, or 3.5 percent, to $47.24 in London.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 5 cents, to $1.37 a gallon. Heating oil lost 5 cents, to $1.47 a gallon, and natural gas rose 6 cents, to $3.09 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Full text:   If all had gone according to plan, as many as 4.2 million additional workers in the United States would have started earning time and a half for overtime, effective Dec. 1. But that plan, developed by the Obama administration's Labor Department in an exemplary rule-making process over the past two years, was blocked on Tuesday by a federal judge in Texas.
The judge's ruling is a triumph for economic injustice and income inequality. Though temporary, it leaves little doubt that he will strike the rule down permanently. The Labor Department is considering an appeal. But a Labor Department under Donald Trump could simply drop out of any case inherited from the Obama administration.
The employees who will be hurt by the ruling typically earn low-to-modest salaries in jobs at retail stores, hotels, call centers and other service-sector businesses. Unless their bosses decide otherwise, they will continue to work without overtime pay for anything beyond 40 hours a week.
Federal overtime law, which dates back to 1938, never intended that result. The law has always been clear that an employer does not have to pay salaried workers time and a half for overtime if those workers earn enough to qualify as executives, professionals or administrators. The problem is that the $455-a-week threshold at which workers qualify for white-collar status has not been fully updated for inflation since 1975. As a result, the share of the work force eligible for overtime has dropped, from about 60 percent in 1975 to 7 percent today.
The updated rules the judge blocked would have raised the threshold to $913 a week, about where it would have been if it had kept pace with inflation. In all, about one-third of salaried employees would have been eligible for overtime under the new threshold.
In blocking the rule, Judge Amos Mazzant III agreed with a coalition of states and businesses that the Labor Department had overstepped its authority. He said the law does not allow the Labor Department to decide which employees are eligible for overtime based on salary level alone.
This was a twisted reading of the law and history. There are various tests that can be applied to determine whether a salaried employee is eligible for overtime. But salary alone can determine the answer. If an employer does not pay an employee a salary equal or above the threshold, the employee is entitled to time and a half for overtime, period.
President-elect Donald Trump indicated during the campaign that new rules on overtime should include exemptions for small businesses, a stance that leaves him room to maneuver. He could defend updated overtime standards and still support legislation with the limited carve-out he suggested. Doing so would mean defying congressional Republicans who opposed the new overtime rule, as well as opposing every other pro-worker labor reform of the Obama era. But it would also mean he is paying attention to the needs of the working people who elected him.
For millions of Americans, there will be no extra pay for extra work anytime soon -- unless Mr. Trump makes it happen.

Abstract: Over the last two years, Federal District Court judges in the state have chipped away at Mr. Obama's legacy by striking down or suspending no fewer than five regulations, executive orders or actions, and guidelines, including an action that would have allowed illegal immigrants who are parents of United States citizens to remain in the country, and guidance that would have expanded restroom access for transgender students.

Full text:   President-elect Donald J. Trump promised to undo many of the Obama administration's most ambitious regulations. But even before he takes office, federal courts in Texas are doing some of the work for him.
A federal judge's injunction this week halted a Labor Department rule that would have made millions more Americans eligible for overtime pay.
Over the last two years, Federal District Court judges in the state have chipped away at Mr. Obama's legacy by striking down or suspending no fewer than five regulations, executive orders or actions, and guidelines, including an action that would have allowed illegal immigrants who are parents of United States citizens to remain in the country, and guidance that would have expanded restroom access for transgender students.
The injunction in the overtime case, issued on Tuesday by a judge nominated by Mr. Obama, has many advocates and legal experts concerned.
"It's a troubling trend because it's essentially delegating policy oversight to a set of handpicked judges in the South, who can pick and choose which regulations move forward and which do not," said Matthew Wessler, a principal at the firm Gupta Wessler who has argued multiple cases involving workers before the Supreme Court.
The case over the overtime rule, which would have made an estimated 4.2 million people newly eligible for time-and-a-half overtime pay, provides some insight into why opponents of regulation conclude that descending on Texas increases their odds of success.
In an interview, the Nevada attorney general, Adam Paul Laxalt, whose state was the lead plaintiff in the case against the overtime rule, said that the coalition of states it led had elected to file in the Eastern District of Texas because the district had a reputation for handing down rulings quickly.
"That was what is known as a fast docket," Mr. Laxalt said. "The decision was made based on a bunch of variables, but we thought we may be able to get the quickest answer." Citing the Dec. 1 effective date for the new regulation, he said, "We were really fighting the clock."
Mr. Laxalt added that Nevada had been part of multistate litigation that was filed in other states, including a case over a rule regulating waterways, which was filed in North Dakota.
Texas has a rich culture of antigovernment litigation. In 2013, Greg Abbott, now the state's governor and then its attorney general, jokingly described a typical workday as, "I go into the office, I sue the federal government and I go home." He bragged that he had sued the Obama administration 25 times in the previous four years.
While federal judges in Texas are officially appointed by the president, not state officials, Senate custom gives the state's two United States senators considerable influence over the nominations.
"The judges that do manage to get nominated have to somehow pass through the gauntlet of Ted Cruz and John Cornyn," said Richard Levy, the secretary-treasurer of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. who served as its legal director for more than 20 years. "It has skewed the bench here in a way I don't think is probably likely in other places."
Even though the federal judge who ruled on the overtime regulation, Amos L. Mazzant III, was formally nominated by Mr. Obama in 2014, the influence of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Cornyn made it unlikely that he would be overly sympathetic to federal regulations, Mr. Levy said.
Still, the sweep of Judge Mazzant's decision appears to have surprised even skeptics of the regulation.
The Obama regulation raised the annual salary limit below which workers are automatically eligible for overtime pay -- something that previous administrations, including George W. Bush's, had done several times since 1938 -- to $47,476, from $23,660.
In his ruling, however, Judge Mazzant suggested not simply that the administration lacked the authority to raise the salary limit so high, but that no administration had the authority to establish and raise a salary limit of any kind.
Nothing in the law, he wrote, "indicates that Congress intended the department to define and delimit with respect to a minimum salary level."
(Judge Mazzant retreated from the implications of this statement in a footnote asserting that he was determining the legality only of the Obama regulation.)
Asked if he agreed with the judge that the Labor Department lacked the authority to create a salary limit of any kind, not just the new level developed by the administration, Mr. Laxalt, the Nevada attorney general, said, "We do think the judge got it right when he said it's unclear whether or not they can do an arbitrary salary test," but confessed that he wouldn't necessarily follow the ruling to its logical conclusion.
"I'm not prepared to say categorically we're opposed to the 23,000," the limit established by George W. Bush, he said.
For his part, Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, argued in an interview that it simply was not possible to single out the Obama salary limit as extreme or arbitrary while accepting the previous increases, since the new limit was in line with some of them.
"If we had simply indexed the 1975 threshold to inflation, that number would be well in excess of what our current threshold is," he said -- about $57,000 annually.
The administration is widely expected to appeal the ruling, given the extensive history of such increases, and many management-side lawyers believed that Judge Mazzant was out on a limb.
"The Labor Department has been setting these minimums since 1940," said Allan Bloom of the law firm Proskauer Rose. "This is the first time that a district court judge is essentially saying you don't have the authority to do that."
Considered alongside the recent pattern of decisions by Texas judges, however, the ruling might have been foreseen.
Last month, Judge Marcia A. Crone of the Eastern District of Texas ruled against most of an Obama administration directive that required companies to disclose labor violations before they could receive a federal contract worth more than $500,000, a policy that had inflamed the business community.
Last week, Judge Sam R. Cummings of the Northern District of Texas, permanently blocked an administration rule that would have required employers to disclose relationships with consultants they hire to dissuade workers from unionizing.
In perhaps the biggest judicial setback to the president's executive actions and regulations before the overtime decision, a split Supreme Court decision in June left in place a 2015 ruling by Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the Southern District of Texas that shut down the administration program intended to grant leniency to immigrants in the country illegally with children who are citizens or lawful permanent residents.
President Obama had pointed to the program, which was meant to protect millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, as one of his major achievements.
Mr. Wessler, the Supreme Court lawyer, marveled at how unprecedented the recent developments have been.
"Using nationwide injunctions coupled with the kind of blatant forum shopping here is not something that we've really seen before in the modern age," he said.

Abstract: The surge, for example, has more than restored all the value in Wells Fargo's share price that was eroded after the scandal over the rampant creation of unauthorized bank accounts erupted in September. Freeing up community banks from the qualified mortgage rule and rigorous anti-money laundering guidelines, for example, would allow them to spend less time and resources complying with regulation and more on making loans and lifting the fortunes of the rural America Mr. Trump championed in his campaign.

Full text:   Washington lobbyists, financial and policy analysts and Wall Street insiders are all trying to figure out what the Trump administration will mean for the banking industry.
But Rusty Cloutier never doubted that Mr. Trump would be good for the small bank he runs in Lafayette, La.
Mr. Cloutier sees in the new administration a chance not just for regulatory relief, but for a reordering of priorities away from the wealthy interests of the big cities and toward the rural and blue-collar communities where he operates.
"My customers are very hard-working people," said Mr. Cloutier, the president of MidSouth Bank. "They work in the oil fields and they hear they are racist, and they just got tired of it being slammed in their face."
He added, "Tell your editors that they need to run a headline that says 'Main Street Won."'
And yet, in the weeks since Mr. Trump's surprise election, Wall Street has been winning, too.
The stocks of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have been soaring to their highest levels in years -- a rally of such force that it has caught many bank executives and analysts by surprise.
The surge, for example, has more than restored all the value in Wells Fargo's share price that was eroded after the scandal over the rampant creation of unauthorized bank accounts erupted in September.
For now, banks both large and small are benefiting from expectations that the president-elect will roll back regulations on just about every aspect of the industry, including the fees banks can charge, whom they can lend to and how much capital they have to hold.
Banks would also benefit from the higher interest rates that are expected if a Trump administration's fiscal stimulus program revives inflation. Higher rates would increase the value of some of the banks' holdings and would widen banks' margins on loans.
But like nearly all of Mr. Trump's policy positions, his plan for banking regulation has not been explained in any great detail. Mr. Trump's feelings on banks, perhaps more so than other industries, are difficult to sort out.
On one hand, he has called for dismantling the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that is credited with reining in risk taking but blamed for crimping profits. On the other, he has railed against Wall Street elites for keeping down small-town America.
How, then, will Mr. Trump justify policies that bolster bank profits, while also delivering on his promises of economic populism?
Community bankers see themselves in the sweet spot. They say Mr. Trump can limit regulations -- particularly on banks with less than $10 billion in assets -- while still being tough on the Wall Street banks that were the driver of the financial crisis and so much anger among the general public.
Freeing up community banks from the qualified mortgage rule and rigorous anti-money laundering guidelines, for example, would allow them to spend less time and resources complying with regulation and more on making loans and lifting the fortunes of the rural America Mr. Trump championed in his campaign.
Several community bankers said they also wanted the Trump administration to rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by installing a five-person bipartisan oversight board, rather than a single director.
Among community bankers, support for Mr. Trump has been pervasive and consistent.
Roughly 84 percent of community bankers supported Mr. Trump, according to a poll that the industry's trade group conducted after the political conventions this summer.
"I didn't have any Trump signs in my yard," said Tim Zimmerman, president of Standard Bank, which operates in communities outside Pittsburgh. "But I want the bank to do well and to be able to help people in the community. And I can't do that if things go the way they are going."
In reality, the nation's roughly 5,800 community banks represent a relatively small part of America's banking activity. About half of the nation's deposits are held by just a handful of mega-banks, where there was deep support for Hillary Clinton.
Many on Wall Street helped bankroll Mrs. Clinton's campaign in the hope that she would protect the forces that drive their global profits, like free trade. Many executives at large banks feared that Mr. Trump was a loose cannon who could destabilize the economy.
The chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, went so far as to publicly voice support for Mrs. Clinton. He made a cameo in a pro-Trump ad -- along with Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and the investor George Soros -- that painted the Democrats as puppets of the global financial elite. Critics called the ad anti-Semitic because it focused on Jewish figures.
But as the stock market soared, the big banks began talking about the upside of a Trump presidency. Two days after the election, Mr. Blankfein said at the DealBook conference sponsored by The New York Times that he believed Mr. Trump's policies would be "market supportive."
Unprepared for a Trump victory, executives inside the big banks began drawing up lists of regulations or rules that the new administration and the Republican-controlled Congress might change for their benefit.
They are not arguing for the repeal of Dodd-Frank, which large banks have spent hundreds of millions of dollars complying with.
Nor do they want a less powerful consumer protection agency, which some credit with helping big banks by cracking down on players on the industry's margins, like payday lenders.
At the top of their wish list: rolling back the so-called Durbin Amendment, which limits the fees banks can charge on debit cards, and tweaking the Volcker Rule so that large banks can engage in more types of trading activity to help their clients.
As banking lobbyists seek inroads with the new administration over regulation, Democrats are trying to pressure the industry to denounce other actions by Mr. Trump, including his selection of Stephen K. Bannon as his chief strategist. The former executive chairman of the Breitbart News Network, Mr. Bannon has been criticized for inflaming racist and xenophobic views.
In a letter last week, Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking member of House Financial Services Committee, and other Democrats said the banking industry had a "moral obligation to speak out against this appointment as contrary to the values of this country and to the values of your industry."
The banking groups are declining to weigh in. Some say their input is not relevant because Mr. Bannon is not likely to have a direct role in regulating the financial industry.
"Personally, I don't think he is a racist," Scott McComb, chief executive of Heartland Bank, which operates across Central Ohio, said of the president-elect. "I think it is propaganda that is made to make him look bad."
Mr. McComb said while Mr. Trump said things during the campaign "that are not becoming of a president," he expected that Mr. Trump would act with more decorum in the White House.
"He conducted himself like a New York City developer," during the campaign, Mr. McComb said. "That is how a New York City developer acts."
Mr. Cloutier, the Louisiana banker, said even if Mr. Trump appointed someone like Steven Mnuchin, the former Goldman executive, to a top economic post, the president-elect would not forget his promises to working-class America -- and by extension small banks.
"He's not going to be taking care of the sugar daddies who look down on the hardworking people of America," Mr. Cloutier said. "But if he don't deliver on that, he won't be around four years from now."

Full text:   There is always a rush of tension and excitement driving into Damascus, a city inhabited for thousands of years, where cultures and influences have mixed and accumulated like coral on a reef.
More than five years into Syria's chaotic civil war, the capital is relatively undamaged and functioning, bustling with commuters, markets and restaurants -- especially compared with Aleppo, where government airstrikes this week are pummeling rebel-held districts and rebels are shelling government-held ones. But my stay in Damascus early this month, even under the restrictions of government minders, revealed new ways that war has wounded and warped the city, which I have visited nine times since 2001.
When we drive from Beirut, Lebanon, into Damascus, we take the highway past President Bashar al-Assad's hilltop palace. Rebel-held suburbs are visible, sometimes smoking from government airstrikes or shelling. Also nearby is an air base where detained opponents of the government sometimes disappear without a trace. Then we enter the capital on the Mezze Highway, a broad avenue of apartment buildings, government offices, cafes and cellphone shops.
Suddenly, we are in the heart of the city.
At the base of the Umayyad Mosque, one of the most beautiful sites in the Old City, couples and families hang out, feed pigeons and pose for a man who's been using the same Polaroid camera for decades. The Roman-era walls of the mosque once housed a pagan temple, then a cathedral, and its courtyard remains one of the most peaceful spaces I've seen.
Inside, children play on a polished marble floor that reflects the sky; women sit, murmuring their news; gilded murals and stained glass catch the sunset. But sometimes the crescendo of unseen warplanes bores into the quiet.
At the Sheraton Damascus Hotel, lavish weddings and, in warm weather, afternoons lounging by the pool have continued throughout the war, but fewer and fewer can partake.
Government employees, their salaries gutted by inflation and currency crashes, have slipped from the middle class into poverty, forcing many young people to postpone weddings they can't afford. And with men ensconced in the army and militias -- or in exile to avoid the draft -- there is a shortage of grooms.
Downtown Damascus feels busy and alive, with people boarding vans and buses to get to work as in any other city. But the heavy traffic is partly a result of the security checkpoints that have proliferated.
We were forbidden to photograph checkpoints during our 12-day stay in Syria, but they are ubiquitous. Our government-required minder alternately castigated, teased and charmed the soldiers and militiamen to speed our passage. But the checkpoints are more than a nuisance for many Syrians, who can be forced to pay bribes, or they can be detained or seized and sent off to army service.
Mount Qasioun towers above the city as always. But the cafes near the top, once a popular date spot, are closed. Artillery guns atop the mountain have been the backbeat of the war, the strange spectacle of a capital shelling its own suburbs, and sometimes being shelled back.
The simple act of changing money underscores how the economy has crashed with the costs of war, the destruction of manufacturing and the flight of capital as wealthy Syrians flee or send assets abroad.
For $600, we got a four-inch brick of Syrian pounds at the Lebanese border.
The value of the pound against the dollar is a tenth of prewar levels. So restaurant tabs are paid in sheafs of bills but seem ridiculously cheap compared with past visits. At Naranj, the fanciest restaurant in the Old City, a lavish spread of traditional Syrian food around the marble fountains and mosaics came to the equivalent of about $10 per person.
Sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe, meant to punish the government for human rights abuses, leave most Syrians unable to use credit cards or open international bank accounts. Even industries intended to be exempt, like pharmaceuticals, are sometimes hampered by international banks' caution against running afoul of the sanctions.
Taxi and bus drivers have always seen themselves as impresarios in Damascus: playing Arabic classics and Western pop music, making coffee in little electric pots while weaving through traffic, setting up romantic lights they flick on at night for an instant party atmosphere.
But one cabby I met was a moonlighting soldier, trying to supplement a salary whose shrinking value could not support his family. He was still stuck in the army several years past the normal two-year requirement.
At a central roundabout, two contrasting ads side by side show the dual nature of life in the capital.
On the right, a recruitment poster sponsored by a women's group declares: "Our army means all of us. Join the armed forces." On the left, a clinic offers a weight-loss treatment that promises "losing one kilogram after each session," as well as "hair removal and bleaching without pain."
A short drive away is Moadhamiyeh, a suburb where, during a government siege earlier in the war, some of the most vulnerable starved to death.
The Old City of Damascus is its most beautiful, famous section, with pedestrian streets, alleys overhung with vines and centuries-old houses built around courtyards.
No tourist museum, it is a thriving set of interlocking neighborhoods reflecting the city's cultural and religious diversity, where a shop selling classic Syrian crafts and antiques might be next door to ones selling toothpaste and detergents, or lingerie and sweatsuits.
But many of those shops have closed, or remain open only for their owners to keep company drinking coffee and playing backgammon with neighboring merchants. Militiamen from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, or Syrians they have helped train, keep watch on the streets.
Some shop owners whisper that they feel as if they are under occupation or grumble that they were forced to paint the Syrian flag on their doors. Others want to leave Syria but can't afford it because all their wealth is tied up in inventory -- silver, tiles, brass, silk brocade, mosaic woodwork -- they cannot sell. Rebel shells still occasionally crash down, killing people at random.
Some owners are coping by transforming antique shops into bars for the locals, especially on the thoroughfare known as the Street Called Straight, the destination of the Apostle Paul's biblical journey to Damascus.
The Tiki Bar, on the Saturday before Halloween, had a bartender using his laptop to act as a D.J., as costumed patrons drank and smoked.
I noticed only later, watching a video taken at the bar, that the man next to me was, startlingly, dressed as a Nazi. There was a swastika on his armband.
The stunning shrine of Sayeda Rokaya, a figure revered by Shiites, is encrusted with layers of decoration: Why choose between blue ceramic tiles, Iranian-style cut-glass sparkle and voluminous chandeliers when you can have them all?
There is a sense of community at the shrine among women who bring ailing children to try to absorb its blessing, and wipe dolls and garments against its grille. They beat their chests in lamentation. Many are pilgrims from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon, countries with militias supporting the Syrian Army, an intervention that has deeply divided Syrians.
The privations of war intrude here, as everywhere. The electricity goes off, a result of the daily power cuts imposed across Damascus because of fuel shortages. The chants continue even when the loudspeaker cuts off. Then the lights come back on, along with the amplified prayers.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Two weeks after Donald J. Trump swept to victory, investors from around the world are betting that his promises of tax cuts, fewer regulations and a spendthrift federal government can recharge the American economy.
This burst of exuberance sent the major markets to record highs on Monday, as investors continued to pull out of government bond funds whose yields are miserly. The momentum has shown few signs of slowing and has resulted in significant flows of money being poured into United States stocks.
The rush of money has also pushed up the value of the dollar against the currencies of developed nations, such as the euro, and those of developing nations like Brazil, Turkey and Mexico. A strong dollar that is underpinned by rising interest rates tends to spell trouble for emerging markets, as investors move money from these countries, creating havoc and making it harder for governments and corporations to pay off their dollar-denominated debts.
For that reason, many economists have warned that the downside to a Trump-inspired revival of the United States economy is a spate of calamities in emerging markets, as investors head quickly for the exit.
The recent euphoria stands in sharp contrast to Wall Street's prediction, before the election, of market mayhem if Mr. Trump were to win. The view had been that his unpredictable ways would spook the financial world, not least his threat to rip up trade agreements with Mexico and fight China on its exports to the United States.
After a sharp but very brief slide in Asian trading on election night, when it became clear that Mr. Trump would win, markets rallied quickly as the Trump economic agenda was quickly assessed.
Two weeks is a short period of time in investment cycles, but the current wave of enthusiasm recalls the days after Ronald Reagan's election in 1980, when investors around the world embraced his sunny view of American business potential.
"Once this thing starts, you will see people piling on and the prosperity will blow you away," said Arthur Laffer, a lower-tax evangelist who advised Mr. Reagan on economic policy and is doing the same with Mr. Trump.
Mr. Laffer said little about the budget deficits and the surge in debt that resulted from Reagan-era policies. But his ebullience mirrors the mood in the markets as investors choose to set aside gloomier notions and bet instead on a jamboree in stocks that will -- they hope -- be supported by a Trump-style economic boom.
At the root of the postelection reappraisal, economists and investors contend, is the view that Republican control of the Senate and House, as well as the White House, will put an end to the divisive politics of the Obama years that prevented his administration from taking more direct steps to stimulate the economy.
Moreover, political analysts point to the fact that while Democrats have been criticizing the president-elect on many fronts, on the one subject investors have rallied around the most -- infrastructure spending -- there has been broad agreement with the president-elect.
When it comes to market rallies, this one does not match the record set during President Obama's first term, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 84.5 percent. If the markets were to duplicate that gain during a Trump administration, the S.&.P. 500 would have to be over 4,000 by late January 2021, according to Standard & Poor's Global Market Intelligence.
The Obama stock market boom was fueled by an unprecedented period of central bank activism in the years after the 2008 financial crisis. Central bankers around the world flooded markets with easy liquidity that flowed into every type of financial asset.
With interest rates on the rise and inflation picking up, central banks are now in retreat. That means that the Trump administration will need fiscal policy -- government spending and tax cuts -- rather than relying on the Federal Reserve.
Still, on Monday, four major measures of the stock market reached record highs.
The benchmark S.&P. 500 closed up 16.3 points, or 0.75 percent, to 2,198.18. The S.&P. is now up about 3 percent since Mr. Trump's victory.
The narrower Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.47 percent on Monday, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended up 0.89 percent. The Russell 2000, a benchmark of companies with smaller market values, ended the day up 0.50 percent.
It was the first time since Dec. 31, 1999, when stocks were still enjoying the dot-com boom, that the Dow, the S.&P. 500, the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 reached highs on the same day, according to Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist with LPL Financial. All but the Russell, however, had previously reached record highs together on the same day just last August.
Shares of energy companies led the stock market rally on Monday as oil prices climbed nearly 4 percent to a three-week high. Marathon Petroleum surged nearly 9 percent, Chesapeake Energy rose 7 percent, ConocoPhillips ended up 3.6 percent, and Exxon Mobil closed up 1.42 percent.
In recent years, a low oil price has signaled fears of global stagnation and deflation and the worry that hamstrung governments were not in a position to stimulate growth.
Now, in contrast to past decades when a high oil price would spark worries about inflation, its trend upward is being seen as a positive, perhaps heralding a move by governments around the world to spend more to lift their economies.
Like all stock market upticks, this one has been driven by sharp inflows of money. Not least from investors who had been seeking safety from uncertainty, political and otherwise, in government bonds. In the last 10 years, $1.5 trillion has moved into bond mutual funds, according to Merrill Lynch, while little has been able to stick in the stock market.
Now, as optimism spreads about Mr. Trump's economic agenda, investors are pulling out of their bond funds and buying stocks that benefit when the economy turns around, like commercial banks.
"Investors are experiencing what I call FOMO -- fear of missing out," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at the research firm CFRA. "They are playing catch-up."
While he describes the recent run as impressive, he also points out that potential disappointments are lurking.
"This will be more of a challenge than people are now thinking," Mr. Stovall said, referring to the high hopes for infrastructure spending. "The Republican Congress is still relatively conservative, so for every dollar of spending they will be asking for cutbacks, because our debt is already approaching 100 percent of G.D.P."
Correction: November 23, 2016, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about investors' exuberance over potential economic growth under the incoming administration misidentified whom Democrats broadly agree with on infrastructure spending. It is the president-elect, not the president.

Full text:   Howard Ruff, an idiosyncratic economist, best-selling author and political conservative best known for being bullish on gold and silver and gloomy about the economy, died on Nov. 12 in Lehi, Utah. He was 85.
The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his assistant, Joann Allen, said.
Mr. Ruff, a college dropout, had a roller-coaster career, starting out as a stockbroker. For a time he also supported himself as a singer. (One gig was at a synagogue, as what he described as the only practicing Mormon cantor in San Francisco.)
He went on to run an Evelyn Wood speed-reading business for a while -- which helped make him a millionaire -- until it foundered and his franchise was revoked, forcing him to declare bankruptcy.
Rather than defeating him, however, the setback led to an epiphany, he said: It inspired him to plunge into business-cycle research and forge a career as a faddish investment adviser, which made him a millionaire for a second time. But that enterprise, too, went belly up.
"Some people say that I couldn't succeed at anything, so I became a prophet of doom," he told Time magazine in 1979.
That turned out to be another successful calling. In 1975 he started publishing a newsletter called Ruff Times, which mixed financial counsel (predicting inflation and recommending investment in gold) with conservative commentary. It drew more than 175,000 subscribers.
He began a syndicated weekly television program called "Ruff House"; organized forums that offered, for a fee, more or less conventional investment advice; and established companies that distributed natural vitamins and coins, as well as other for-profit and self-promotional ventures.
Again he prospered, as reflected by a 20,000-square-foot home in Utah with an indoor pool.
(He also said he had a hand in geopolitics, claiming some credit for the collapse of the Soviet Union. He and his White House contacts, he said, persuaded President Ronald Reagan to sell Stinger missiles to Afghan rebels, whose guerrilla war with the Soviet invaders had all but bankrupted Moscow by the late 1980s.)
Mr. Ruff drew his widest attention in 1979 with his book "How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years." It recommended survivalist strategies, like stocking a year's supply of food, and directed readers to other books including "Safe Places East of the Mississippi" and "Eating Weeds for Fun and Freedom." The book sold millions of copies and was a New York Times best seller for more than a year.
Until about 1981, his followers reaped large capital gains by investing in precious metals. But by several measures his portfolios later underperformed market indexes and even Treasury bills, and some of his apocalyptic predictions did not come to pass, as inflation subsided and interest rates declined during the Reagan administration, and when the economy rebounded after the 2008 financial crisis.
"Howard was a pioneer in the financial world when brokers encouraged investors to buy blue-chip stocks and bonds and charged high fixed commissions," Mark Skousen, the editor of Forecasts & Strategies, an investment newsletter, said in an email on Tuesday. "Ruff argued that Wall Street was hazardous to your wealth, especially investing in bonds that were big losers during the inflationary '70s."
Mr. Ruff became bullish on the bond and stock markets in the early 1980s, changing the name of his newsletter to Howard Ruff's Financial Success Report. But it reverted to Ruff Times in the mid-80s, and in 2008 he updated his book on the coming bad years, warning that whoever won the presidency in 2008 would be doomed by rising oil and gas prices and spiraling monetary inflation to become "the Hoover of the 2000s."
Among his other books were "Famine and Survival in America" (1974) and "How to Prosper in the Age of Obamanomics: A Ruff Plan for Hard Times Ahead" (2009).
Unlike some of his doomsaying colleagues, though, Mr. Ruff maintained a following through an engaging wit and a general willingness to admit mistakes.
Urging investors to be mavericks, he compared the breed to "a bovine that's left the herd," adding, "And I feel the majority of the herd is going to be turned into hamburger."
In recommending readiness for economic collapse, he reminded his disciples, "It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark."
He co-founded a conservative lobbying group called Free the Eagle, and in 2000 he fought, unsuccessfully, to prevent Hillary Clinton, who had transplanted herself from Arkansas and Washington, from winning a Senate seat from New York.
His Ruffpac political action committee prepared a television commercial that benignly featured babies and puppies playing in Central Park. It asked rhetorically what they had in common, responding: "They have all lived in New York longer than Hillary Rodham Clinton."
Howard Joseph Ruff was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Berkeley, Calif., the son of the former Rena Maxberry, a seamstress, and Wilson Ruff, who killed himself when Howard was 6 months old.
"I grew up broke," he recalled. "We were too poor to afford a father."
He had wanted to be a singer since the age of 9, but, at his mother's insistence, instead of accepting a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, he served a two-year mission in the eastern United States for the Mormon Church. He later majored in music education at Brigham Young University in Utah with a minor in economics.
But by his senior year, he told The New York Times in 1979, "I ran out of money and got out of college before it did me any personal harm, like ending up teaching high school music courses."
Instead, after joining the Air Force, he toured with its symphony as a baritone soloist and also performed with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Mr. Ruff released an album, "Howard Ruff Sings," in 1982 on his own label, Target Records, featuring songs like "I Walked Today Where Jesus Walked," "If I Were a Rich Man," "Climb Every Mountain" and "My Way."
"I did it for the shock value," Mr. Ruff said. "I also did it to change my image. I have always been painted as a cardboard figure of doom."
Mr. Ruff is survived by his wife, the former Kay Felt; 13 of their 14 children (some of whom were adopted) -- Larry, Eric, David, Megan and Timothy Ruff, Anthony Ramon, David Steinberg, Pamela Patterson, Sharon Slater, Patty Simpson, Liza Spencer, Debbie Rasmussen and Terri Lynn Bond -- 79 grandchildren; and 48 great-grandchildren.
By 2002, Mr. Ruff's fortunes had slipped again. The circulation of Ruff Times had plummeted to 3,000, according to Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and he had long sold his 10-acre Utah estate and moved to smaller quarters.
"He was a self-made millionaire. Twice. He lost it all. Twice," his family said in a statement. "He often said he learned more from his failures than from his successes."
But he retained admirers. The journalist and financial analyst Mark Hulbert wrote on MarketWatch.com in 2013, "It would be easy to miss the lasting contribution Howard Ruff made to the investment advisory business."
Mr. Ruff, he wrote, had brought "into the mainstream the notion that we don't need to rely on a Wall Street broker or analyst for advice on what to do with our money."
He added, "Ruff gave voice to the millions of middle-class investors who felt that the country's financial system was rigged against them."

Abstract: [...]of thumb, said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a 10 percent rise in the dollar would be expected to increase the current account deficit (a broader concept than trade deficit, but closely related) by 1 to 1.5 percent of G.D.P. in the ensuing two to three years.

Full text:   Campaign promises are easy. Governing is hard.
It is a truism that Donald J. Trump and his team will soon learn. And a fascinating example has emerged since the election, courtesy of global currency markets. It is a study in the kind of complex trade-offs that Mr. Trump rarely grappled with during his campaign but will face many times a day in the Oval Office.
A centerpiece of Mr. Trump's campaign was the United States' trade deficits. He pledged to eliminate them and create a resurgence in American manufacturing.
He has also pledged tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. That set of policies has led markets to expect speedier economic growth and thus higher interest rates in coming years. That, in turn, is driving the value of the dollar higher. Since Election Day, the dollar is up 3.6 percent against an index of six other major currencies. The value of the Mexican peso has fallen 11 percent against the dollar, a remarkable swing for the United States' third-largest trading partner.
You don't need to be an economist to see what that means: A pricier dollar makes it harder for American manufacturers to compete overseas; it gives an advantage to companies that locate operations elsewhere; and it will, all else being equal, tend to make the trade deficit higher rather than lower.
This is not to suggest that the shift in the currency so far is a major disaster for American manufacturers and other exporters (though those that ship their goods to Mexico will feel the brunt of it). There was a bigger rise in the dollar in 2014 and 2015 that damaged export sectors even more.
But let's imagine that Mr. Trump follows through on the policy mix he's hinted at so far: a combination of loose fiscal policy (think more spending on defense and infrastructure, and tax cuts) and tighter monetary policy (the Federal Reserve raising interest rates faster than had seemed likely before the election). At that point, the dollar could move decisively higher, creating a tension that the president and his advisers would have to resolve one way or the other.
As a rule of thumb, said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a 10 percent rise in the dollar would be expected to increase the current account deficit (a broader concept than trade deficit, but closely related) by 1 to 1.5 percent of G.D.P. in the ensuing two to three years.
In that case, Mr. Trump's pledge to eliminate the $500 billion United States trade deficit would have just become $180 billion to $270 billion harder.
This is the kind of dilemma presidents face all the time. The Oval Office debate might go something like this: The commerce secretary complains, "Mr. President, this strong dollar is just killing our manufacturers; they can't compete with this kind of appreciation." The Treasury secretary, who is in charge of the currency, responds, "It's a necessary evil, Mr. President; our economy is booming so much that global investors just can't get enough of United States assets."
When there are these kinds of disputes, the president has to decide. And when a president tries to find a solution that answers both concerns, there are always complex ripples. For example, "let's appoint Fed officials who will cut interest rates" might temporarily let you have both a booming domestic economy and a competitive export sector, but would mean an increase in inflation -- which will make both the bond market and many retired Americans living on fixed incomes unhappy.
The tension between currency policy and trade policy is just one example. Mr. Trump's promises to repeal Obamacare while keeping some of its most popular features would be hard to carry out in practice. Virtually every issue in tax policy, diplomacy and regulatory policy features similar complex trade-offs.
None of this is to say that these tensions are unsolvable, or that Mr. Trump won't overcome his lack of a policy background to arrive at good solutions. But he will almost certainly find out that "Make America Great Again" is a slogan, not an answer.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Thursday it was too soon to predict the economic impact of Donald J. Trump's election as the next president of the United States.
Markets have rallied on optimism that Mr. Trump, in concert with Republicans in Congress, would cut taxes and increase federal spending on road-building and the military, measures that might stimulate economic growth.
Ms. Yellen, who has repeatedly called for Congress to join the Fed in its efforts to lift the economy from prolonged doldrums, suggested the celebrations were premature.
"We don't know what's going to happen," Ms. Yellen said in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, her first public comments since the election. "There's a great deal of uncertainty."
She added, "We will be watching the decisions that Congress makes and updating our economic outlook as the policy outlook becomes clearer."
Mr. Trump's election has not altered the Fed's short-term plans. Ms. Yellen made clear in her testimony that the central bank remained likely to raise its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting, in mid-December.
"The evidence we've seen since we met in November is consistent with our expectation of strengthening growth and an improving labor market," Ms. Yellen said. "I do think the economy is making very good progress toward our goals."
A rate increase, she said, "could well become appropriate relatively soon."
Ms. Yellen also set to rest questions about her own plans. Her term as chairwoman ends in February 2018. "It is fully my intention to serve out my term," she said.
The Fed has prepared markets in recent months for the likelihood of an increase in its benchmark interest rate in December. At a meeting two weeks ago, the Fed's policy-making body, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, found the case for a rate increase had strengthened but said officials were awaiting "some further evidence."
Investors put that chance above 90 percent Thursday, according to a measure derived from asset prices by CME Group.
"Chair Yellen struck a reasonably -- but still somewhat subdued -- positive tone on the economy, and her words will be seen as signaling a high likelihood that the F.O.M.C. will be tightening policy at next month's meeting," wrote Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
The Fed has not raised its benchmark interest rate since December, leaving it in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent. The low level is intended to encourage borrowing and risk-taking, driving faster economic growth. Several times this year, the Fed has suggested it might raise rates, only to pull back over concerns about the fragility of the economy.
But the Fed's outlook has brightened in recent months as evidence has rolled in that the economy, on most measures, is in its best shape in years.
"U.S. economic growth appears to have picked up from its subdued pace earlier this year," Ms. Yellen said, adding that job growth had also continued at a healthy clip. She noted, among other things, that soybean exports had surged in recent months.
The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in October, and inflation has increased modestly.
And Republicans could provide a fresh jolt to economic growth. Senator Dan Coats, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, cited a "growing consensus" that there is a need for fiscal stimulus, like tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and regulatory reforms. "The past seven years have clearly taught us that low interest rates alone cannot cure an ailing economy," Mr. Coats said.
He added, however, that Congress needed to remain "mindful" of the relatively high level of the federal debt. And, in a preview of the role reversal that is likely to occur in the next Congress, Democrats on the committee chided Republicans for their spending plans.
"I am interested to see how President Trump's infrastructure plan can be reconciled with past Republican opposition to fiscal stimulus," said Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat and the ranking party member of the committee.
Interestingly, Republicans made little mention of their various proposals to rewrite the Fed's operating instructions to limit future economic stimulus campaigns. The only mentions of such plans, a staple of Fed hearings in recent years, came from Democrats.
Ms. Maloney warned that Republican proposals would "lead to disaster." She also noted such a push might not play well in the Midwestern states where voters turned to Mr. Trump in part because of his promises to revive their economic fortunes.
"I'm not sure that people in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states would respond well to that suggestion," she said dryly.
Democrats also asked Ms. Yellen to address Republican proposals to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 legislation that overhauled financial regulation after the 2008 financial crisis.
"I certainly would not want to see all the improvements we've put in place, I would not want to see the clock turned back," she said.
Ms. Yellen offered a now-familiar assessment of the choice facing the Fed in December.
On one hand, Ms. Yellen said, there was room for improvement. "While above-trend growth of the labor force and employment cannot continue indefinitely," Ms. Yellen said, "there nonetheless appears to be scope for some further improvement in the labor market."
She noted that stronger growth was pulling some Americans back into the labor force.
She cautioned, however, that the Fed did not want to wait "too long." Monetary policy exerts gradual influence on economic conditions; the full effect of an interest-rate increase plays out over several years. And some Fed officials are increasingly concerned that the central bank needs to start moving now, or else it will need to raise rates more quickly in coming years.
Ms. Yellen also acknowledged a related concern that low interest rates were encouraging imprudent speculation. "Holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long," she said, "could also encourage excessive risk-taking and ultimately undermine financial stability."

Abstract: The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, emphasized that the Fed planned to raise interest rates, which would help banks make more money from lending. Greater sales of mobile phones and increased online sales helped the electronics retailer Best Buy post a strong third quarter, and the company forecast a larger fourth-quarter profit than analysts had expected.

Full text:   Stocks on Wall Street rose on Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, emphasized that the Fed planned to raise interest rates, which would help banks make more money from lending.
Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher after Ms. Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates would rise from their ultralow levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Walmart and J. M. Smucker.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,333.97. The Dow has set several records since the election, while the S.&P. 500 and Nasdaq are close to records they set a few months ago.
Almost all of the S.&P. 500's gains since the presidential election have gone to financial stocks. They lagged the market for much of this year, but they are now trading at their highest levels since May 2008, months before the financial crisis peaked.
Investors hope banks will benefit from higher interest rates, faster economic growth and lighter regulation under President-elect Donald J. Trump.
Ms. Yellen told Congress that the economy was improving and added that if the Fed kept waiting and raised rates too quickly later, that would increase the risk of a recession.
Investors already expected the Fed to raise interest rates when it meets in mid-December.
Bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.30 percent from 2.21 percent. Bond yields rise when investors expect higher interest rates and inflation.
Bank of America gained 33 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $20.08 and PNC Financial Services climbed $3.09, or 2.9 percent, to $110.60.
Greater sales of mobile phones and increased online sales helped the electronics retailer Best Buy post a strong third quarter, and the company forecast a larger fourth-quarter profit than analysts had expected. Its stock climbed $5.54, or 13.7 percent, to $45.99 and hit a six-year high.
Other retailers also rose. Home Depot recovered some recent losses and added $3.60, or 2.9 percent, to $128.93. Amazon, which gained ground as Walmart struggled, picked up $9.91, or 1.3 percent, to $756.40.
Walmart announced disappointing sales in its third quarter. The stock lost $2.18, or 3 percent, to $69.19.
The jam and jellies maker J. M. Smucker disclosed weak sales and its stock shed $5.10, or 3.9 percent, to $124.85. Tyson Foods fell $2.32, or 3.4 percent, to $66.70.
Higher interest rates also mean a stronger dollar. The dollar climbed to 109.95 yen from 109.08 yen. The euro fell to $1.0623 from $1.0680. The ICE United States Dollar Index continued to rise. It is at its highest level in 13 years.
Oil prices gave up a small gain and turned lower. Benchmark crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London.
Gold fell $6.90 to $1,216.50 an ounce and silver lost 16 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.49 a pound.
The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares added 0.7 percent and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6 percent. Germany's DAX gained 0.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 barely moved and the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong eased 0.1 percent. The Kospi in South Korea inched higher.

Full text:   Howard Ruff, an idiosyncratic economist, best-selling author and political conservative best known for being bullish on gold and silver and gloomy about the economy, died on Saturday in Lehi, Utah. He was 85.
The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his assistant, Joann Allen, said.
Mr. Ruff, a college dropout, had a roller-coaster career, starting out as a stockbroker. For a time he also supported himself as a singer. (One gig was at a synagogue, as what he described as the only practicing Mormon cantor in San Francisco.)
He went on to run an Evelyn Wood speed-reading business for a while -- which helped make him a millionaire -- until it foundered and his franchise was revoked, forcing him to declare bankruptcy.
Rather than defeating him, however, the setback led to an epiphany, he said: It inspired him to plunge into business-cycle research and forge a career as a faddish investment adviser, which made him a millionaire for a second time. But that enterprise, too, went belly up.
"Some people say that I couldn't succeed at anything, so I became a prophet of doom," he told Time magazine in 1979.
That turned out to be another successful calling. In 1975 he started publishing a newsletter called Ruff Times, which mixed financial counsel (predicting inflation and recommending investment in gold) with conservative commentary. It drew more than 175,000 subscribers.
He began a syndicated weekly television program called "Ruff House"; organized forums that offered, for a fee, more or less conventional investment advice; and established companies that distributed natural vitamins and coins, as well as other for-profit and self-promotional ventures.
Again he prospered, as reflected by a 20,000-square-foot home in Utah with an indoor pool.
(He also said he had a hand in geopolitics, claiming some credit for the collapse of the Soviet Union. He and his White House contacts, he said, persuaded President Ronald Reagan to sell Stinger missiles to Afghan rebels, whose guerrilla war with the Soviet invaders had all but bankrupted Moscow by the late 1980s.)
Mr. Ruff drew his widest attention in 1979 with his book "How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years." It recommended survivalist strategies, like stocking a year's supply of food, and directed readers to other books including "Safe Places East of the Mississippi" and "Eating Weeds for Fun and Freedom." The book sold millions of copies and was a New York Times best seller for more than a year.
Until about 1981, his followers reaped large capital gains by investing in precious metals. But by several measures his portfolios later underperformed market indexes and even Treasury bills, and some of his apocalyptic predictions did not come to pass, as inflation subsided and interest rates declined during the Reagan administration, and when the economy rebounded after the 2008 financial crisis.
"Howard was a pioneer in the financial world when brokers encouraged investors to buy blue-chip stocks and bonds and charged high fixed commissions," Mark Skousen, the editor of Forecasts & Strategies, an investment newsletter, said in an email on Tuesday. "Ruff argued that Wall Street was hazardous to your wealth, especially investing in bonds that were big losers during the inflationary '70s."
Mr. Ruff became bullish on the bond and stock markets in the early 1980s, changing the name of his newsletter to Howard Ruff's Financial Success Report. But it reverted to Ruff Times in the mid-80s, and in 2008 he updated his book on the coming bad years, warning that whoever won the presidency in 2008 would be doomed by rising oil and gas prices and spiraling monetary inflation to become "the Hoover of the 2000s."
Among his other books were "Famine and Survival in America" (1974) and "How to Prosper in the Age of Obamanomics: A Ruff Plan for Hard Times Ahead" (2009).
Unlike some of his doomsaying colleagues, though, Mr. Ruff maintained a following through an engaging wit and a general willingness to admit mistakes.
Urging investors to be mavericks, he compared the breed to "a bovine that's left the herd," adding, "And I feel the majority of the herd is going to be turned into hamburger."
In recommending readiness for economic collapse, he reminded his disciples, "It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark."
He co-founded a conservative lobbying group called Free the Eagle, and in 2000 he fought, unsuccessfully, to prevent Hillary Clinton, who had transplanted herself from Arkansas and Washington, from winning a Senate seat from New York.
His Ruffpac political action committee prepared a television commercial that benignly featured babies and puppies playing in Central Park. It asked rhetorically what they had in common, responding: "They have all lived in New York longer than Hillary Rodham Clinton."
Howard Joseph Ruff was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Berkeley, Calif., the son of the former Rena Maxberry, a seamstress, and Wilson Ruff, who killed himself when Howard was 6 months old.
"I grew up broke," he recalled. "We were too poor to afford a father."
He had wanted to be a singer since the age of 9, but, at his mother's insistence, instead of accepting a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, he served a two-year mission in the eastern United States for the Mormon Church. He later majored in music education at Brigham Young University in Utah with a minor in economics.
But by his senior year, he told The New York Times in 1979, "I ran out of money and got out of college before it did me any personal harm, like ending up teaching high school music courses."
Instead, after joining the Air Force, he toured with its symphony as a baritone soloist and also performed with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Mr. Ruff released an album, "Howard Ruff Sings," in 1982 on his own label, Target Records, featuring songs like "I Walked Today Where Jesus Walked," "If I Were a Rich Man," "Climb Every Mountain" and "My Way."
"I did it for the shock value," Mr. Ruff said. "I also did it to change my image. I have always been painted as a cardboard figure of doom."
Mr. Ruff is survived by his wife, the former Kay Felt; 13 of their 14 children (some of whom were adopted) -- Larry, Eric, David, Megan and Timothy Ruff, Anthony Ramon, David Steinberg, Pamela Patterson, Sharon Slater, Patty Simpson, Liza Spencer, Debbie Rasmussen and Terri Lynn Bond -- 79 grandchildren; and 48 great-grandchildren.
By 2002, Mr. Ruff's fortunes had slipped again. The circulation of Ruff Times had plummeted to 3,000, according to Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and he had long sold his 10-acre Utah estate and moved to smaller quarters.
"He was a self-made millionaire. Twice. He lost it all. Twice," his family said in a statement. "He often said he learned more from his failures than from his successes."
But he retained admirers. The journalist and financial analyst Mark Hulbert wrote on MarketWatch.com in 2013, "It would be easy to miss the lasting contribution Howard Ruff made to the investment advisory business."
Mr. Ruff, he wrote, had brought "into the mainstream the notion that we don't need to rely on a Wall Street broker or analyst for advice on what to do with our money."
He added, "Ruff gave voice to the millions of middle-class investors who felt that the country's financial system was rigged against them."

Full text:   SHENZHEN, China -- In a one-man war room in his apartment, a laid-off Walmart employee named Wang Shishu was tapping out a message on his phone to a group of workers and plotting his next move.
Over the past few months, Mr. Wang, 56, has helped organize a national movement in China against Walmart. Labor strikes have hit stores in the south simultaneously. There have been boycotts in the northeast. And here in Shenzhen, where Walmart opened its first outlet in China two decades ago, employees have filed a lawsuit demanding back pay.
"We want a snowball effect," he said in the booming baritone of a street preacher. "We want everybody to know what to do next."
As the Chinese economy has slowed, strikes and labor protests have broken out across the country, mostly scattered episodes targeting a single factory or business. The government has responded aggressively, detaining activists and increasing censorship to keep unrest from spreading.
But activism against Walmart's more than 400 stores in China in recent months has followed a different pattern: workers in several cities agitating against the same company, bypassing official unions controlled by the Communist Party and using social media to coordinate their actions -- while the authorities largely stand aside.
Across China, Walmart employees have raised their fists at protests, chanting, "Workers, stand up!" They have appealed to local officials with patriotic fervor, invoking the struggles of Mao Zedong against foreign imperialists. They have posted screeds online against unkind bosses and "union puppets."
In doing so, the Chinese work force of the world's largest retail chain has put the ruling Communist Party in an uncomfortable position, publicly testing its Marxist commitment to defend the working class and pitting that against its fear of independent labor activism.
Ever since the Solidarity trade union helped topple Communist rule in Poland, Beijing has sought to prevent the emergence of a nationwide labor movement, suppressing efforts by workers to organize across industries or localities.
But the authorities appear to be hesitating in the case of Walmart, whose workers have complained of low wages and a new scheduling system they say has left them poorer and exhausted.
In recent months, as many as 20,000 people, about a fifth of the company's work force in China, have joined messaging groups set up by Mr. Wang and other activists on WeChat, a popular app. In these forums, they vent about company policies, share protest slogans and discuss plans to coordinate demonstrations for maximum effect.
Mr. Wang, a former customer service representative whom Walmart has fired twice, spends his days babysitting his granddaughter and trading messages with workers across the country, often as late as 2 a.m.
"What they're doing is inhumane," he said. "I want Walmart to return to the sympathetic company it used to be."
Eli Friedman, a labor scholar at Cornell University, said the Walmart movement was "probably the most substantive example of sustained, cross-workplace, independent worker organizing we've ever seen in China's private sector."
The government appears to be keeping a distance because it is worried about provoking a backlash, or about acting on behalf of a prominent American company against Chinese workers at a time when nationalism in China is rising.
But by doing little or nothing, it risks encouraging disaffected workers elsewhere, especially at the growing number of national chain businesses with operations across China. Already, workers at Neutrogena stores and China Unicom, a state-owned telecom operator, have used similar tactics, while avoiding serious punishment.
"We can only expect that online organizing will continue to break down local barriers," said Keegan Elmer, a researcher for China Labour Bulletin, an advocacy group based in Hong Kong.
The retail sector in particular has become a hotbed of worker activism. The government wants to shift growth from manufacturing to service industries, but many new jobs at restaurants, hotels and stores are low-paying or part-time.
From July through September, there were 124 strikes and protests at service-sector firms, about double the number last year, outpacing episodes in manufacturing for the first time since at least 2011, according to China Labour Bulletin.
Chinese law requires businesses to establish labor unions, but they are almost always controlled by management, and companies generally use the unions to contain worker activism. In the face of labor strife, some businesses have offered back pay, bonuses and other benefits to workers.
But others, concerned that labor activism could force costly concessions, have resorted to tougher tactics, retaliating against those who help organize protests. At Walmart, some of the most vocal workers have been deprived of raises, reassigned, or in some cases fired, according to interviews with more than a dozen employees.
At one store in Zhongshan, west of Shenzhen, a labor activist said a supervisor photographed her in the bathroom as retribution for speaking out. She asked not to be identified for fear of further antagonizing her bosses.
Much of the discontent stems from a new scheduling system that Walmart put in place this summer as a way, the company said, of giving workers more flexibility. Workers have argued that it has resulted in cuts to overtime pay and excessively long shifts, and some say they were coerced into signing new contracts agreeing to the system.
Walmart denied that it had treated its employees unfairly or had pressured them to accept the new schedules. Rebecca Lui, a spokeswoman, said that the vast majority of its work force supported the new system, and that employees were free to keep their old schedules.
"Our associates are our most valuable asset," she said in a statement.
Zhai Xiuhua, a former greeter at a Walmart store in Shenzhen, said she was fired in September after leading a fight against the new scheduling system.
"I told them, 'Even if you put a knife to my neck, I'll never agree,"' she recalled at her home, where her uniform and identification badge -- No. 14470 -- still hang on the wall. Ms. Zhai, worried about medical bills, says she now hopes to find work in her hometown in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Walmart, which has resisted unionization at its thousands of stores across the world, was forced by the government in 2006 to establish branches of the Communist Party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions for its roughly 100,000 Chinese employees, part of a broader push by the party to unionize foreign businesses.
But union branches at many Walmart stores are under the thumb of store managers, and higher-level union officials appear torn about how to respond to complaints from workers like Ms. Zhai.
While union officials here in Guangdong Province have criticized Walmart for not seeking governmental approval for the new scheduling system, they have not taken more forceful action or helped mobilize workers.
Labor activists at Walmart have cited the ideals of President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party's history of protecting workers, and experts said they appeared to be benefiting from a belief among some officials that the influence of foreign companies such as Walmart should be curtailed.
"If the Chinese authorities try to suppress the workers on behalf of Walmart," said Wang Jiangsong, a Chinese labor scholar, "it will hurt the country's image."
When Walmart opened its first store in China in 1996, workers rushed to snap up jobs that paid more than those at Chinese competitors.
Now, some employees say, a Walmart job does not pay enough to comfortably support a family, with wages hovering around minimum wage, or about $300 a month. While Walmart has led a high-profile campaign in the United States to raise pay, salaries in China have remained largely stagnant, workers said, barely keeping pace with inflation.
Walmart has struggled to keep up with the fast-changing tastes of Chinese consumers and tried to re-energize its business by making investments in online retailers.
But the continuing labor unrest poses a potential hurdle.
You Tianyu, 45, a customer service employee at a Walmart store in Shenzhen, caught the attention of her supervisors in August when she wrote a letter to the president of Walmart, Doug McMillon, to complain about the company's efforts to silence aggrieved workers.
Ms. You said her bosses now harassed her daily because she spoke out, and she has received a diagnosis of anxiety and depression.
She spends most of her nonworking hours rummaging through a mess of worker manifestoes, union laws and pay slips in her tiny apartment, hoping to find a new line of attack against Walmart.
"I'm on the verge of collapsing," she said. "I don't know how much longer I'll last."

Full text:   Stocks on Wall Street finished barely lower on Wednesday as banks returned some of the huge gains made since the presidential election last week, but technology and consumer stocks climbed. The dollar continued to appreciate against other currencies and reached its highest mark in 13 years.
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 54.92 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,868.14. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,176.94. The Nasdaq composite picked up 18.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,294.58.
Banks took the biggest losses as a seven-day rally in that sector fizzled. Industrial companies, also big gainers since the election, traded lower as well. Oil prices gave back some of the big gains from the day before. The graphics processor maker Nvidia and household names like Apple and Microsoft led technology companies higher. Rising stocks outnumbered decliners.
After a long losing streak before the election, the Dow had risen for seven days in a row through Tuesday and set several highs. The S.&P. 500 and Nasdaq have also made large gains and are near the records they set this fall.
JPMorgan Chase led banks lower as it fell $1.97, or 2.5 percent, to $77.40, and Morgan Stanley lost 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.19. Banks are coming off their best week since the financial crisis as investors hope for higher interest rates and more profits from lending, as well as cutbacks in regulations that could increase bank profits.
The ICE United States Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against six other currencies, rose to its highest level since April 2003. The dollar is rising in part because investors think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a faster pace in response to inflation stemming from the increased spending that the president-elect, Donald J. Trump, has proposed.
The dollar slipped to 109.08 Japanese yen from 109.16 yen late on Tuesday. The euro fell to $1.0680, from $1.0726.
Technology companies moved upward as they continued a rally from a day earlier. Nvidia rose $5.44, or 6.3 percent, to $91.63 after it announced a collaboration with Microsoft. Apple picked up $2.88, or 2.7 percent, to $109.99.
The retailer Target raised its profit forecast and its sales projections for the third quarter with the holiday season approaching. The stock gained $4.60, or 6.5 percent, to $76.03.
TJX, the parent of T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, reported a bigger profit and better sales than investors expected, and its stock gained $2.90, or 4 percent, to $76.39. That helped lead consumer stocks higher.
Benchmark crude lost 24 cents, to $45.57 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell 32 cents, to $46.63 a barrel in London.
Bond prices rose and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.21 percent from 2.23 percent.

Full text:   Stocks on Wall Street climbed on Tuesday as the price of oil made its biggest jump in seven months and energy companies rose with it.
Technology stocks like Microsoft and Alphabet, Google's parent, traded higher and bond yields slipped, a break with the pattern since last week's election.
The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 54.37 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,923.06, as those gains were partly held back by losses for the retailer Home Depot and the aerospace company Boeing. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,180.39. The Nasdaq composite index added 57.23 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,275.62.
Oil rose almost 6 percent as investors once again grew hopeful that the OPEC cartel will agree to cut fuel production in a few weeks. Companies such as utilities and telecom service providers climbed as bond yields fell slightly after a week of large gains. Airlines rose after Warren E. Buffett made a surprise investment in three carriers.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum made large gains as the price of oil rose by the largest amount since early April.
Benchmark United States crude gained $2.49, or 5.7 percent, to $45.81 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $2.52, or 5.7 percent, to $46.95 a barrel in London. Exxon rose $1.54, or 1.8 percent, to $86.82 and Apache added $4.46, or 7.6 percent, to $63.39.
Tuesday's trading was a partial reversal of the moves investors have made since the presidential election one week ago. Tech stocks have been losing ground recently, but Microsoft picked up $1.14, or 2 percent, to $58.87, and the graphics processor maker Nvidia rose $2.55, or 3 percent, to $86.19.
Bond prices edged higher, sending long-term interest rates slightly lower. Bond prices had fallen sharply since the election over worries that President-elect Donald J. Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation. That had sent yields to their highest levels this year. But the yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.23 percent from 2.27 percent. Companies that pay large dividends, like phone companies, also changed course and rose.
However, the dollar continued to get stronger and reached its highest level in almost a year. It rose to 109.16 yen from 108.37 yen. The euro slid to $1.0726 from $1.0732.
Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company of Mr. Buffett, the billionaire investor, bought stock in United Continental, American Airlines and Delta. United picked up $3.12, or 5 percent, to $66.06 and American gained $1.36, or 3.1 percent, to $44.76.
The aerospace giant Boeing fell after United said that it would postpone delivery of 61 new Boeing 737 jets that it planned to buy. Boeing stock lost $1.88, or 1.3 percent, to $148.11.
Equity One will combine with Regency Center in a deal that combines two real estate investment trusts that own shopping centers. The two companies have more than 400 properties, most of them anchored by grocery stores. Equity One climbed $1.90, or 6.8 percent, to $29.77, while Regency Center lost $2.95, or 4.2 percent, to $66.91.
The Chinese e-commerce company JD.com climbed after it reported strong quarterly results. The company also said it might reorganize its JD Finance unit, which runs its internet finance business. The stock climbed $2.70, or 11.4 percent, to $26.41.
Gold rose $2.70 to $1,223 an ounce. Silver picked up 15 cents, to $17.04 an ounce, while copper gave up 2 cents, to $2.51 a pound.
The FTSE 100 index in Britain rose 0.6 percent and the CAC-40 in France was also 0.6 percent higher. In Germany, the DAX gained 0.4 percent. The South Korean Kospi shed 0.3 percent and the Nikkei 225 in Japan finished little changed. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng gained 0.5 percent.

Wall St. Closes Mixed as Interest Rates Tick Up

Full text:   United States markets ended the session mixed on Monday as interest rates continued to rise. Bond yields climbed to their highest levels this year, which pointed to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Donald J. Trump to lead to higher inflation.
KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 0.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was unchanged. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.4 percent.
TECH TROUBLES Shares of technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple stock gave up 2.5 percent while Facebook stock declined 3.3 percent and shares of Microsoft slid 1.5 percent. Shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped 2.4 percent. Tech stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wondered if Mr. Trump's policies as president would hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas.
BANK BONANZA Bank stocks continued to surge, rising in part because of the big jump in bond yields since the election. Investors were also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Mr. Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank of America stock rose 5.6 percent and shares of JPMorgan Chase picked up 3.7 percent.
DOING DEALS The South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it would buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped 25.2 percent.
MENTORING The German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy the software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose 18.3 percent.
DIG IT Shares of the communication adapter maker Digi International rose 15 percent after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it was too low. Belden stock added 2.2 percent.
BONDS AND CURRENCIES However, the view in bond markets was somewhat different, with investors fretting over the inflation outlook and the more lax spending environment. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds was up 0.09 percentage points Monday at 2.2 percent. The rise in bond yields has helped support the dollar as traders price in the prospect of bigger returns on their holdings. The euro was down 0.9 percent at $1.0753 while the dollar rose 1.3 percent to 108.06 yen.
LAGGARDS Stocks that pay large dividends, like phone and utility companies and real estate investment trusts, all traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower shares fell 3 percent and shares of NextEra Energy edged down 0.8 percent.
TRUMP FACTOR Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hoped his presidency would mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to the financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, the machinery maker Caterpillar and the drug company Merck.
EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX rose 0.2 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 gained 0.4 percent. The FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent in Britain.
ASIA SCORECARD The Nikkei 225 stock average added 1.7 percent on Monday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. The Shanghai composite index added 0.5 percent in China. The Kospi lost 0.5 percent in South Korea. In Australia, the S.&P./ASX 200 slid 0.5 percent. Markets in Southeast Asia fell, with the benchmark in Indonesia down 2.2 percent.
ENERGY With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark United States crude oil fell 58 cents, to $42.83 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 70 cents, to $44.05 a barrel in London.

Full text:   Global investors have rendered their verdict on Donald J. Trump as president: Sell government bonds and pile into stocks that will benefit the most from a resurgent United States economy.
From Indonesia to the United States, government bonds are undergoing a sharp sell-off as investors -- large sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds, as well as the accounts of American retirees -- restructure investment portfolios to try to capture the fruits of what they expect will be a free-spending Trump presidency.
Across the board, the yields of these bonds, which move up as their prices decline, are pushing higher. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note -- a benchmark for mortgages and other lending rates -- has risen to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent in less than two months. For such a widely held and traded security, that is an unusually abrupt move.
Other safe-haven bonds have had similar reactions. The yield on Germany's 10-year notes has gone to positive. In just a week, it has gone to 0.35 percent from negative 0.15 percent.
And the Swiss 10-year is now on the cusp of paying investors to borrow money after close to two years of trading in negative interest rate territory.
If the trend continues, it will signify a jarring philosophical shift from the view put forward by many prominent economists, like the former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, that the global economy is destined to stagnate for some time under a regime of low growth, zero interest rates and deflation.
A series of earlier signals pointed to a move away from bonds in the weeks before the election, including higher wages in the United States and signs of increased inflation in Europe.
But what has resonated deeply with countless risk-averse investors who have been camping out in government bonds for years now is Mr. Trump's promise to have the federal government take responsibility for stimulating the economy -- in the form of infrastructure investments and tax cuts -- away from global central banks.
"It does not surprise me that the markets have reacted this way," said Luciano Siracusano, chief investment strategist for WisdomTree asset management in New York. "This is a very pro-growth agenda, and we have not had that in a while."
After the financial crisis unleashed an unprecedented wave of activism on the part of global central banks, investors the world over followed the lead of central bankers and loaded up on long-term government bonds.
Until recently, it has been a no-fault trade, with global growth stagnant, governments divided and political risk omnipresent.
The numbers tell the story.
According to J. P. Morgan, central banks and financial institutions in developed markets are sitting on $26 trillion in bonds, or 49 percent of the tradable market for these securities. That figure is up from 40 percent in 2002, and it highlights the extent to which worries about deflation and stagnation (political and economic) have resulted in a nonstop bull market for government bonds.
Most investors, and many policy makers as well, have become fed up with this so-called stagnation trade and they have been calling for lower taxes and more government spending not just in the United States but also in Europe and Japan.
"Investors have been frustrated with the limits of monetary policy," said Michael Zezas, a bond strategist with Morgan Stanley. "There has been a presumption of the necessity of fiscal stimulus. With a Trump presidency, the political rationale aligns with the economic rationale."
Soaring bond yields are not the only way that this new "reflation trade" is playing out. Investors are betting that a pickup in government spending will push up the price of basic building commodities like copper, the price of which was up 20 percent in the last month.
Bank stocks have also gotten a lift because investors believe they will face less regulatory pressures and cash in on higher interest rates, which help their lending margins.
Even the long-suffering stock price of Deutsche Bank, for example, has bounced back by nearly 20 percent in the last week.
More broadly, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.8 percent last week, while on Monday, the major market measures ended largely flat.
Of course, such an investment trend carries with it serious risks. If bond yields shoot up too starkly, investors in the stock market will get jittery and all the fast money that has recently piled into stocks could turn tail, leaving chaos in its wake.
For example, $22 billion has poured into exchange-traded funds that invest in the United States stock market in the last three days alone.
Moreover, a sharp increase in bond market rates will put pressure on emerging markets, which have enjoyed a renaissance in recent months. Stock markets ranging from Brazil, India and Taiwan have been down sharply over the last week. The exchange-traded fund that invests in these and similar countries and is the market's truest gauge of sentiment toward developing markets is off more than 7 percent since Mr. Trump was elected.
It is worth recalling that the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when panicky global investors escaped en masse from most of the major developing economies, was driven by an expectation of higher interest rates and a strong dollar -- which is exactly what the markets are factoring in right now.
A Trump-inspired inflationary surge could also force the Federal Reserve to be overly aggressive in raising rates, a dynamic that no investor wants to see.
The trick, of course, for a Trump administration will be to ensure that fiscal stimulus proponents do not get a totally free hand and, in addition to pushing for a building boom, cut taxes radically and increase military expenditures. That could result in a yawning budget deficit and inflation spiraling out of control.
For now, such a dire situation is far from the minds of investors who prefer to see in Mr. Trump an antidote to nearly a decade of low growth, low interest rates and intense regulatory scrutiny, all of which pushed them into the safety and security of low-yielding government bonds.
Some even suggest that a President Trump will not be unlike President Reagan in showing a devotion to bedrock laissez-faire principles, even if many of those philosophies were called into question when American investment banks nearly torpedoed the global economy.
"The global impact of this stuff is that once you start it, you can't stop it," said Arthur Laffer, a supply-side evangelist who advised Ronald Reagan and was among a core group of economists who cobbled together Mr. Trump's own tax-slashing program. "That is the way it was with Reagan."

Full text:   Let's be clear: Installing Donald Trump in the White House is an epic mistake. In the long run, its consequences may well be apocalyptic, if only because we have probably lost our last, best chance to rein in runaway climate change.
But will the extent of the disaster become apparent right away? It's natural and, one must admit, tempting to predict a quick comeuppance -- and I myself gave in to that temptation, briefly, on that horrible election night, suggesting that a global recession was imminent. But I quickly retracted that call. Trumpism will have dire effects, but they will take time to become manifest.
In fact, don't be surprised if economic growth actually accelerates for a couple of years.
Why am I, on reflection, relatively sanguine about the short-term effects of putting such a terrible man, with such a terrible team, in power? The answer is a mix of general principles and the specifics of our current economic situation.
First, the general principles: There is always a disconnect between what is good for society, or even the economy, in the long run, and what is good for economic performance over the next few quarters. Failure to take action on climate may doom civilization, but it's not clear why it should depress next year's consumer spending.
Or take the signature Trump issue of trade policy. A return to protectionism and trade wars would make the world economy poorer over time, and would in particular cripple poorer nations that desperately need open markets for their products. But predictions that Trumpist tariffs will cause a recession never made sense: Yes, we'll export less, but we'll also import less, and the overall effect on jobs will be more or less a wash.
We've already had a sort of dress rehearsal for this disconnect in the case of Brexit, Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Brexit will make Britain poorer in the long run; but widespread predictions that it would cause a recession were, as some of us pointed out at the time, not really based on careful economic thinking. And sure enough, the Brexit recession doesn't seem to be happening.
Beyond these general principles, the specifics of our economic situation mean that for a time, at least, a Trump administration might actually end up doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.
Eight years ago, as the world was plunging into financial crisis, I argued that we'd entered an economic realm in which "virtue is vice, caution is risky, and prudence is folly." Specifically, we'd stumbled into a situation in which bigger deficits and higher inflation were good things, not bad. And we're still in that situation -- not as strongly as we were, but we could still very much use more deficit spending.
Many economists have known this all along. But they have been ignored, partly because much of the political establishment has been obsessed with the evils of debt, partly because Republicans have been against anything the Obama administration proposes.
Now, however, power has fallen into the hands of a man who definitely doesn't suffer from an excess of either virtue or prudence. Donald Trump isn't proposing huge, budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations because he understands macroeconomics. But those tax cuts would add $4.5 trillion to U.S. debt over the next decade -- about five times as much as the stimulus of the early Obama years.
True, handing out windfalls to rich people and companies that will probably sit on a lot of the money is a bad, low-bang-for-the-buck way to boost the economy, and I have my doubts about whether the promised surge in infrastructure spending will really happen. But an accidental, badly designed stimulus would still, in the short run, be better than no stimulus at all.
In short, don't expect an immediate Trump slump.
Now, in the longer run Trumpism will be a very bad thing for the economy, in a couple of ways. For one thing, even if we don't face a recession right now, stuff happens, and a lot depends on the effectiveness of the policy response. Yet we're about to see a major degradation in both the quality and the independence of public servants. If we face a new economic crisis -- perhaps as a result of the dismantling of financial reform -- it's hard to think of people less prepared to deal with it.
And Trumpist policies will, in particular, hurt, not help, the American working class; eventually, promises to bring back the good old days -- yes, to make America great again -- will be revealed as the cruel joke they are. More on that in future columns.
But all of this will probably take time; the consequences of the new regime's awfulness won't be apparent right away. Opponents of that regime need to be prepared for the real possibility that good things will happen to bad people, at least for a while.

Abstract: The retreat that began in 1914 continued for three decades, weakening the world economy and feeding the resentments that erupted into World War II. The recent advance of globalization was driven by changing technology -- including container ships and the internet -- and new rules that opened the world's most populous country, China, to commerce.

Full text:   The age of globalization generated great prosperity. As the flow of goods, money and people across borders surged, millions benefited. But the elite gained the most. And as inequality rose, it stirred pockets of fierce resentment among those left behind. When the great shock came, the discontented turned to nationalist firebrands, who promised to impose controls on free trade, global banks and immigrants. Globalization stalled. A new age of deglobalization hit full stride.
That great shock came in 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, and it ended an extraordinary four-decade period of rising migration and trade. But that era provides clear parallels to the globalization boom that gained momentum in the 1980s and stalled during the financial crisis of 2008. Today globalization is once again in retreat. Populists are on the march, as evidenced by Donald J. Trump's stunning victory last week. They have already won control of the government in Britain and gained momentum in Italy, France and Germany.
It is not clear how Mr. Trump, who has called for protectionist measures and tighter borders, will govern. But it is clear that the open world order is breaking apart. The new age of deglobalization is on, and it is likely to last.
National economies move from boom to bust in cycles that last a few years, but globalization is different. At least since Genghis Khan secured travel along the Silk Road, the flow of goods, money and people across borders has advanced and retreated in decades-long waves. The retreat that began in 1914 continued for three decades, weakening the world economy and feeding the resentments that erupted into World War II. The retreat that began in 2008 is still gaining strength, and it is time to recognize the likely fallout, which is slower growth, higher inflation and rising conflict.
The parallels between the two booms are striking. The recent advance of globalization was driven by changing technology -- including container ships and the internet -- and new rules that opened the world's most populous country, China, to commerce. Before 1914, steamships and the "Victorian internet," the telegraph, as well as novel rules that opened the 19th century's largest economy, Britain, to imports, drove globalization. By the eve of World War I, the world was in some ways as connected as now. Measured as a share of the population, immigration to the United States was three times greater in 1914 than at any time since.
The social tensions generated by rapid globalization in the early 20th century also ring familiar. The share of income going to the richest 1 percent of Americans rose steadily from 1870 to a peak of nearly 20 percent in the late 1920s, as global commerce created a "gilded age" plutocracy. Popular resentment spread, and politicians began working to seal the borders, particularly after 1929, when the economy crashed into the Great Depression.
America turned inward. Congress passed the sweeping Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, prompting a global trade war. Measured as a share of the world economy, trade peaked at 30 percent in 1914, and fell to a low of 10 percent in 1933. That year, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, which barred big banks from the investment business. The movement of money from country to country slowed to a trickle in the 1930s and 1940s.
The United States also virtually shut down immigration in the early 1930s, when the influx of people declined to a few tens of thousands, down from more than a million annually before 1914. As many as one million Mexicans went home in this period, with 80,000 deported by the federal authorities and many more scared off.
Closing the borders reduced competition and commerce, prolonging the Depression. In the United States, populists were fringe figures promising to "share the wealth" and chanting, "America First." But in Europe and Asia, they took power as the militarist autocracies that started World War II.
After the Axis powers were defeated and the victorious democracies began rebuilding an open world order, it took decades for the flow of trade, money and people to regain momentum. Global trade did not recover to its 1914 peak until the 1970s, and capital mobility -- the scale and ease of money flows -- did not recover until the 1990s. Once these flows gained speed, however, they thundered along right up to the financial crisis.
Today, 2008 looks to be as clear a turning point as 1914. With global demand weak, and many nations erecting import barriers, trade is slumping. Measured as a share of global gross domestic product, trade doubled from 30 percent in 1973 to a high of 60 percent in 2008. But it faltered during the crisis and has since dropped to 55 percent.
The flow of capital -- mainly bank loans -- is retreating even faster. Frozen by the financial crisis and squeezed afterward by new regulations, capital flows have since slumped to just under 2 percent of G.D.P. from a peak of 16 percent in 2007.
The flow of people is slowing, too. Despite the flood of refugees into Europe, net migration from poor to rich countries decreased to 12 million between 2011 and 2015, down by four million from the previous five years. Between 2009 and 2014, the number of Mexicans leaving the United States outnumbered new arrivals by 140,000, and that was before Mr. Trump's first anti-Mexican tirades.
In an echo of the 1930s, the slowing of trade, global investment and migration are further weakening the global economy. There are many reasons to expect that this new age of deglobalization will last, as the postwar order is under assault from both popular autocrats in emerging powers like Russia and China, and populist candidates in Western democracies.
The recent trade boom was fueled by relatively simple deals that cut import tariffs. But trade deals have become more complex, and now take much longer to complete. At the same time, the world's major economies have imposed hundreds of protectionist measures since 2008, led by India, Russia, China and the United States. And once such protectionist walls spring up around one industry, they tend to grow and spread to other industries.
Changes in China's economy will further slow trade. When China opened up in the 1980s, its vast population turbocharged global trade almost overnight. Nations all over the world prospered by supplying raw materials and parts to plants in China, and later in countries like Poland and Mexico. Before 2008, much of the global trade boom involved intermediate goods traveling within these supply chains. But this trend has reversed. Supply chains are contracting, particularly as China moves to make its economy less dependent on trade, and its factories learn to make more parts at home.
Recently, the International Monetary Fund and other institutional bulwarks of the postwar order have mounted a defense of globalization. They point to research blaming automation and other forces unrelated to globalization for middle-class job losses. But the technocrats are missing the political reality: The tide has turned against immigrants and trade. It is time to recognize the implications of deglobalization.
During and between the two world wars, the anti-global agenda reduced competition and worsened weak economic growth with rising inflation. Today, populists are again calling for protecting domestic industry and sharing wealth, which could have the same impact.
>
Redistributing wealth within nations could have the salutary effect of narrowing the income gap between individuals. But more protection could widen the wealth gap between nations. Since World War II, few nations have escaped poverty without a huge lift from exports, and rising trade barriers will make it harder for developing countries to do that. The economic advantage is shifting from export-driven economies, such as South Korea and Taiwan, to those that rely on large domestic markets, such as India and Indonesia.
More worrisome is the geopolitical fallout from closing borders. As the open global order has faltered since 2008, the number of democracies has stagnated. More than 100 of the countries tracked by Freedom House have shown a decline in freedom since then (some 60 saw gains), as democracies have grown more xenophobic and autocracies more repressive. At a time when approval ratings are plunging for political leaders worldwide, a combative few are maintaining their popularity by playing the nationalism card, including in Russia and China.
These governments are increasingly willing to close borders and to project military power. Though hardly global threats on a par with the Axis powers before World War II, they pose challenges on three main fronts, with China pushing into the South China Sea, Russia testing Europe's borders and Iran's proxies spreading across the "Shiite crescent" in the Middle East. Regions facing these newly adventurous powers are racked with tension, made worse by perceptions that the United States has been in retreat since 2008. While global military spending was flat worldwide for much of the last decade, it is up 75 percent in East Asia, 90 percent in Eastern Europe and 97 percent in Saudi Arabia.
World War I shattered the hope that an increasingly interconnected world would render armed conflict between nations obsolete. Similar hopes surfaced in recent decades. But the connections are fraying, tensions are spreading and my-nation-first populism is gaining, including in the United States. During the campaign, Mr. Trump called for toughening border security, renegotiating or blocking major trade deals, and cutting support for allies the United States has backed since 1945.
Mr. Trump may not follow through on all these proposals, but his direction is clear. The global movement of goods, money and people is likely to continue slowing. The lesson of the past is that just as night follows day, deglobalization follows globalization -- and can last just as long.

Abstract: [...]wealthy families may find it much easier to amass dynastic levels of wealth. For some accountants, the proposal brought back memories of 2010, when the estate tax briefly expired and assets in a wealthy person's estate were subject to capital gains tax on the appreciated value.

Full text:   If Donald J. Trump follows through on his campaign promises, a host of taxes that affect only the very richest Americans may be eliminated, along with almost all tax incentives to be philanthropic. As a result, wealthy families may find it much easier to amass dynastic levels of wealth.
At the top of the list is the estate tax. Currently, the rules are straightforward: A married couple is exempt for the first $10.9 million in their estate, and they pay a 40 percent tax on the amount above that.
Mr. Trump's campaign proposal seems straightforward: Repeal the estate tax -- the death tax, in his words.
Back in 2012, most tax experts had considered the estate tax issue resolved when, on New Year's Eve, the Republican-majority Congress and President Obama reached a so-called grand bargain on taxes. As part of that deal, the current estate tax exemption was set, with annual increases indexed to inflation.
With that agreement, more than 99 percent of Americans were exempted from the estate tax.
Last year, for example, the Internal Revenue Service processed just 4,918 federal estate tax returns (though it collected about $17 billion in taxes).
Working on a policy to appease such a small number of people could be seen in two ways: a waste of political capital or an end to a tax that Republicans have historically decried as unfair and Democrats have held up as a guard against generational wealth.
But Mr. Trump's proposal is not as straightforward as simple repeal. His plan also said, "Capital gains held until death and valued over $10 million will be subject to tax to exempt small businesses and family farms." In other words, the tax on capital gains above $10 million would have to paid only when, or if, the assets were sold.
For some accountants, the proposal brought back memories of 2010, when the estate tax briefly expired and assets in a wealthy person's estate were subject to capital gains tax on the appreciated value. This proved to be a headache. Few people keep sufficiently detailed records to find the original purchase price on stocks or to account for improvements to properties over decades.
Yet the Trump plan, as some attorneys and accountants have read it, would allow the wealthiest heirs to never pay capital gains taxes if they did not sell what they inherited. This would be difficult for those with a modest inheritance because they generally sell and spend what they get. But it might not be for people with a large inheritance, like Mr. Trump's children, who would receive a portfolio of income-producing real estate and golf courses, which they could borrow against and never sell.
"Most people who have substantial wealth have that wealth in capital assets that tend to grow in value," said Marc J. Bloostein, partner in the private client group at Ropes & Gray. "It comes down to whether you're going to sell those assets. Someone who inherits the family compound, that's great. Someone who inherits a business on the auction block, you have to pay the taxes."
As for deductions for charitable contributions, Mr. Trump addressed that in two areas of his platform. As part of his proposal on the estate tax, he said, "To prevent abuse, contributions of appreciated assets into a private charity established by the decedent or the decedent's relatives will be disallowed." In the section on the income tax, he said all itemized deductions would be capped at $200,000 for a couple.
While most people use itemized deductions for state income taxes paid and mortgage interest, those deductions for wealthier people who live in states without income tax and have no mortgages on their homes come from charitable contributions. And those contributions are often in the millions, or tens of millions, of dollars.
Capping the deduction at $200,000, and disallowing a deduction, it seems, for putting appreciated assets into a private family foundation would greatly limit the financial incentive for the wealthy to be charitable, financial advisers said.
Of course, many advisers will say that tax incentives are not the only reason people give to charity. But tax incentives factor in at some level, and are generally credited with making Americans the most philanthropic people in the world.
"I'm upset by the possibly that I will be limited in my deductions to help more needy people," said Todd M. Morgan, chairman and chief executive of Bel Air Investment Advisors, who is in favor of repealing the estate tax. "I'll still do it, but it's unfortunate. If it doesn't get watered down, that part of the tax law will be negative for the needy people."
Two taxes that in recent years have been coupled with the estate tax could also go away: the gift tax and the generation-skipping tax. Mr. Trump's proposal does not address them explicitly. But tax advisers said they believe he could repeal them as well. If that happened, the economic impact could be greater than the end of the estate tax.
The gift and generation-skipping taxes have existed to keep wealthy individuals from avoiding an income tax. If, for example, a wealthy individual were to give assets to children or grandchildren who are in lower income tax brackets, they would pay a lower tax on them, reducing the amount of money the United States Treasury would bring in.
On the face of it, Mr. Trump's estate tax plan seems tailored for someone like himself: His wealth is tied up in real estate, which his heirs would not have to sell so would not be subject to the capital gains tax for assets above $10 million, and he has not been particularly charitable, so he would not benefit from a deduction for philanthropic gifts.
"The estate tax isn't going to affect people in rural areas who came out in droves to vote for him," said Sarah T. Connolly, a partner at the law firm Nixon Peabody. "On the other hand, he's promised all kinds of tax reform."
While the Republicans will have control of the Senate and the House of Representatives, Mr. Trump may still struggle to repeal the estate tax.
Richard Behrendt, director of estate planning at Annex Wealth Management and a former I.R.S. inspector, said, "It's not going to be as easy as it might appear on the surface."
But for the superwealthy, the election of Mr. Trump may already have rendered moot a hearing that was set to happen on Dec. 1 to consider huge tax benefits granted to family limited partnerships.
Such partnerships are typically used to hold family assets, like a private company. The I.R.S. has allowed discounts of around 30 percent for the shares in those entities since the pool of willing buyers is presumably small. (If the partners consist of relatives, the theory goes, an outsider would buy into a share only at a steep discount.)
But these entities have been under scrutiny for abuse, as some wealthy people have filled them with assets that can easily be valued, like marketable securities, but still take a large discount.
Now, advisers said this week that they believe the meeting scheduled to close this loophole will do nothing, if it even takes place.
All of these tax changes are on top of the broader ones aimed at reworking corporate taxes -- which would benefit some business owners, too -- lowering personal income tax rates and eliminating the 3.8 percent investment income tax that was used to pay for the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump said he wants to repeal.
From a candidate whose message has been described as populist, his tax proposals seem to run counter to that. They would allow for the creation of generational wealth to rival that of the last Gilded Age, after which the modern estate tax was enacted in 1916.
Not everyone sees Mr. Trump's tax proposals as contrary to his campaign message. Joe Duran, founder and chief executive of United Capital, a wealth management firm, said the president-elect's tax proposals are wholly consistent with his campaign.
"Usually, populist votes are about bigger government," Mr. Duran said. "This is about less taxes, less government, less regulation. That's what the overwhelming number of people were voting for."
Still, the tax proposals could mean giving up revenue that could help fund many of the projects, like infrastructure, that Mr. Trump has promised will create jobs.
And Mr. Duran said he is also convinced that Mr. Trump's tax proposals, if approved, will contribute to the further concentration of wealth. "Dynastic wealth is here to stay," he said, "and people don't want to admit it."

Abstract: In California, where the formula funding per student has increased modestly since 2008, voters approved two measures: a multibillion-dollar bond issue and an extension of a special income tax on high earners.

Full text:   Politicians and voters often say they want better schools, but that doesn't mean they're willing to pay for them. Voters this week largely rejected attempts to increase school spending through ballot initiatives.
In 23 states, so-called formula funding -- the main type of state aid for kindergarten through 12th grade -- is still lower this school year than in 2008, adjusted for inflation and growth in the number of students.
The chronic shortfalls often reflect deliberate policy choices, not economic pressures. For example, in seven of the 23 states -- Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Wisconsin -- legislators have cut income taxes in recent years by tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars, money that could have been used to strengthen schools. And yet, among the states with funding shortfalls, only Arizona, Maine and Oklahoma had major initiatives on their ballots on Tuesday to raise revenue for education. The only initiative that passed was in Maine, where voters backed a tax surcharge on annual income in excess of $200,000.
In the remaining 27 states, only two had major school revenue initiatives. In California, where the formula funding per student has increased modestly since 2008, voters approved two measures: a multibillion-dollar bond issue and an extension of a special income tax on high earners. In Oregon, where per-student formula funding has barely budged since 2008, a proposed business-tax increase to help pay for schools failed.
Inadequate school spending over prolonged periods will leave many students behind, especially low-income children. In a recent groundbreaking study of 15,000 children, poor children were much more likely to graduate from 12th grade if they were in schools that received a financial increase of 10 percent per student from the beginning of their education until the end of high school. As adults, they had higher earnings than others who had grown up in low-income families.
Another recent study analyzed math and reading tests taken over five years in 11,000 school districts. It found that average academic performance levels in the richest and poorest school districts were more than four grade levels apart.
When state governments ignore the needs of schoolchildren, Washington can and should step in to counter the harm. From Day 1, the Trump administration will have a chance to build on the work of Congress and the Obama administration on the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. The law, which revised the Bush-era No Child Left Behind effort, gives states considerable flexibility in how they spend federal money granted under the act. It is the duty of the executive branch to ensure, through regulation and supervision, that the states use that money to provide equal opportunity for poor and low-income children. In the longer term, firm presidential leadership will be needed to reverse Congress's penchant for cutting Title 1, the major source of federal money for schools.
Children who entered first grade in 2008, during the Great Recession, will graduate from high school in 2020. For many of them, these next few years are their last chance to get a good education.

Full text:   After shaking off the shock of Donald J. Trump's victory yesterday, markets have been recovering lost ground.
Investors bet on Mr. Trump's promises to increase government spending, cut taxes and ease financial regulations, and major markets ended Wednesday in the United States up more than 1 percent. That continued during Asian trading on Thursday, with the Nikkei 225 closing more than 6 percent higher.
The Mexican peso, however, did not fare so well. After plunging more than 12 percent against the dollar, it pared some losses, but has not fully recovered.
Many are still reeling from the result, from America's political establishment to the thousands who protested overnight at several cities across the United States.
What next? Let's take a look:
Business Regulations
Many expect Mr. Trump to seek significant cuts to regulation in the banking, health care and energy industries.
He has taken an old-school Republican stance toward reducing regulation, but it is unclear exactly how this would manifest itself. He has said he would roll back Dodd-Frank, but his platform also calls for breaking up the big banks.
Deals
Mr. Trump has said he would seek to block AT&T's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner because it was an example of "the power structure I'm fighting."
But antitrust specialists and Republican strategists are not convinced that his administration could actually fulfill promises of tougher antitrust regulation.
Mr. Trump could appoint officials who are more receptive to mergers than a Democratic administration, but the outlook is hazy.
Hedge Funds
Uncertainty still reigns because it is unclear how Mr. Trump will lead.
Sahm Adrangi, a hedge fund manager from Canada, said Mr. Trump did not win votes because of a specific policy position. "He got voted in on his personality," he said.
Silicon Valley
"I'm heartbroken," said Stewart Butterfield, who helped found Slack. Many others in the industry felt similarly devastated. And they could be in for a few tough years.
Mr. Trump had few kind words for tech giants during the campaign, promising to initiate antitrust actions against Amazon and vowing to force Apple to make its products in the United States.
Peter Thiel, however, is sitting pretty, having supported the Trump campaign. He says he is not moving to Washington, but he will "try to help the president in any way I can."
Trade
The United States economy depends on access to a global supply chain -- disruption could cost American householders -- and tariffs on China might provoke a trade war that could slow economic growth.
But Mr. Trump was helped on his way to the White House by people lamenting that they have been left behind by globalization.
He will have to find a way to make capitalism a more enriching proposition for these people, or risk another wave of anger.
Interest Rates and Inflation
If you read the signs in bond markets, these will be higher. The interest rate on 10-year Treasuries has soared and bond market data tells us that consumer prices are set to rise.
If Mr. Trump's proposals for tax cuts and huge amounts of infrastructure spending do create stronger growth, that will translate into higher prices, particularly if the country is near its economic potential.
Officials appointed by Mr. Trump are likely to urge the Federal Reserve to focus on fighting inflation, meaning they would probably favor raising rates more quickly.
Analysts already expect that the promises to stimulate growth will keep the Fed on track to raising its benchmark interest rate in December.
Justice
Mr. Trump did not say much about white-collar crime apart from hitting out at Wall Street greed.
It is likely to be business as usual in the short term, Peter J. Henning writes. If budget cuts hit the Justice Department, white-collar investigations might be starved of funds. Enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is likely to thrive though.
The Securities and Exchange Commission might find itself on the defensive with cuts to its enforcement program, and having to fend off efforts to rein in its authority.
Your Money
What about your personal investments? Should you move your retirement savings?
Stop and breath, Ron Lieber writes. People often regret making big financial decisions hastily. And, as we have noted, there are a number of things to consider.
Coming Up
Business, technology and policy leaders will discuss "Playing for the Long Term" at the DealBook Conference.
Disney faces a tricky earnings call. Analysts are expecting an unusually weak quarter and investors are concerned that the decline in ESPN subscribers could be accelerating, after a spat between ESPN and Nielsen over data showing 621,000 subscribers lost in a month.

Full text:   With a man who is co-author of "The Art of the Deal" as president-elect, deal making can be expected to increase.
This rise will be determined by whether a Trump administration can govern with stability. A conciliatory and seemingly normal victory speech combined with a turnaround in the markets on Wednesday make that seem like a real possibility and bode well for mergers and acquisitions.
Part of the momentum will come from a change in tax laws. Donald J. Trump's plan for individuals is to simplify and reduce. Instead of seven brackets, there would be three. Instead of a top rate of 39.6 percent, there would be a top rate of 33 percent on income over $225,000 for married joint filers.
But the biggest change could be in capital gains and carried interest. The 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge on capital gains would be repealed under his plan.
And carried interest would be taxed as personal income. This would mean a tax increase for the barons of private equity.
Under his plan, corporate taxes would be simplified and reduced. And there would be a one-time tax holiday for the repatriation of cash to the United States -- the repatriation tax reduced to 10 percent.
So what will this do for deal making?
The Republicans have argued for years that a reduction in taxes will spur economic growth. The evidence for that is shaky. Nor are increases like the carried interest likely to reduce deal making. Private equity firms will find workarounds or simply continue with business as normal.
Yet structural changes in taxes and policy do generally spur or reduce deal making as industries realign.
Here we are going to see lots of change that will drive deal making. The Dodd-Frank Act is likely to be revised -- some would say "watered down." The Affordable Care Act may be amended. Mr. Trump has said he would seek to repeal it, but some provisions, like the requirements that there be no pre-existing exclusions, are too popular to repeal.
The result is likely to be a fresh wave of transactions in the health and financial industries as banks and health care companies realign to the new laws. Coming deficit spending may also spur more deal making in industries including construction.
One consequence of the increased government deficit spending and decreased taxes could be the long-awaited rise in inflation and interest rates. This is likely to drive more short-term deal making to capture the cheap money, but in the long term, it may do more than anything else to drag down deal making.
In addition, the ability of companies to bring back cash to the United States and the passage of corporate tax reform may stop the slow bleed of companies abroad and provide powder to mergers and acquisitions here.
In part, this will also be driven by the economy. If the economy stays stable and growing (albeit not greatly these days), then deal making will continue apace as the forces pushing companies together -- industry consolidation and technological shift -- continue. A weaker economy will mean fewer deals.
And of course there is trade. The trade deals pending, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are now dead on arrival. Others may be renegotiated.
As a result, companies may use deals to readjust to a more domestic orientation or to prepare themselves for a decline in trade. But untangling existing trade deals will be quite hard, so tinkering is more likely.
If Mr. Trump does move aggressively against China, this may also stem the growing Chinese investment in the United States. The national security review process is likely to be even more intensive, limiting Chinese investment.
And then there is the biggest factor these days in deals -- antitrust. A Trump administration may not relax antitrust enforcement the way a normal Republican administration would. Instead, we may see tighter review of big mergers -- indeed, as a candidate, Mr. Trump already called for the tie-up between Time Warner and AT&T to be blocked.
Make no mistake, huge shifts are coming that could markedly change how the economy functions and runs. This has the potential to bring back instability and perhaps throw the economy into decline. It may also go the other way, of course, spurring economic growth.
Either way, companies will be working to reposition themselves in this economy and buy growth. It all means that the long-term forces now pushing companies toward making deals are likely to continue, but with some big caveats, namely whether Mr. Trump can govern from a position of stability and consistency.

Full text:   Donald J. Trump is positioned to achieve the most radical reshaping of economic policy since Ronald Reagan. Even under Reagan, Republicans never controlled both houses of Congress.
Since Mr. Trump has yet to provide many specifics, I can't thoroughly assess the overall impact of his plan. But at the least, if he follows through on his ideas, we could face higher prices on imported goods, rising interest rates, substantial inflation and a further shift of wealth to the upper classes.
For starters, Mr. Trump has promised an immediate attack on trade deals, at least with countries he views as manipulators. Presidents have significant authority to act unilaterally in this area, and Mr. Trump has insisted he would put 35 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and 45 percent on those from China.
Trade, which has been proved to stimulate economic growth both here and abroad, has already been slowing, and Mr. Trump is determined to slow it further in an effort to protect blue-collar manufacturing workers, many of them his supporters.
Mr. Trump's tariffs would raise the prices of imported goods sharply, cutting the purchasing power of every American. Lower-income Americans -- including Mr. Trump's core supporters -- would be hurt the most because they disproportionately buy less expensive imported items. For China, and particularly Mexico, the economic costs would be significant, which is why at one point on Wednesday the Mexican peso had plunged by more than 13 percent.
While some manufacturing jobs might come back as a result of the tariffs, a greater number of domestic jobs would most likely be lost because Americans would have less spending power. A recent study by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that, rather than bringing jobs back to the United States, Mr. Trump's tariffs could result in a trade war that would cost our economy five million jobs and possibly lead to a recession.
The centerpiece of Mr. Trump's plan is a huge $5.8 trillion tax cut unaccompanied by specificity around what expenses would be cut to pay for it. (Indeed, the president-elect has proposed more spending on defense and infrastructure.)
As soon as Mr. Trump's ascendancy became clear on Tuesday night, interest rates on Treasuries began to rise. Usually, an unexpected event causes a flight to the safety of government debt, pushing yields down. That the opposite occurred reflects fears that the deficit might balloon out of control.
Mr. Trump has promised to keep Medicare and Social Security benefits unchanged, a commitment at odds with Speaker Paul D. Ryan's own economic proposals. As a fiscal conservative, Mr. Ryan is unlikely to accept large tax cuts unaccompanied by major spending reductions. That could lead to the evisceration of many of the discretionary federal programs -- think education or research and development -- critical to putting our economy on a stronger footing.
To be sure, a tax cut on its own would give Americans more cash to spend. But according to the Tax Policy Center, by 2025, 51 percent of Mr. Trump's reductions would go to the top 1 percent, who both least need it and would be least likely to spend it.
Then there's the regulatory arena, where Mr. Trump also has a free hand to act unilaterally. And act he has promised to do, starting with a moratorium on new rules not required by Congress and a reversal of many executive orders.
If Mr. Trump sticks to his pledge, it will be open season on regulations, as businesses go after their most disliked provisions and agencies. Industrial companies will take aim at the Environmental Protection Agency. Financial institutions, including the big banks, will push to repeal Dodd-Frank. That's just for starters.
Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan are united in opposition to the Affordable Care Act, potentially ending the free or subsidized coverage that 20 million Americans are now receiving. Those Americans would be facing higher costs or loss of coverage.
Some of the efforts at dismantling government may face hurdles in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to break filibusters, more than the Republicans will have. But under a process known as "reconciliation," matters relating to taxes and spending -- and potentially the repeal of Obamacare -- can be passed by a simple majority of 51.
Last, Mr. Trump's signal issue was immigration, where he promised stricter standards, deportation of undocumented workers, a potential moratorium on the entry of new Muslim immigrants and a wall along the Mexican border.
Immigrants, including undocumented workers, play an important role in our economy, doing jobs that many native-born Americans won't and paying taxes. The conservative American Action Forum calculated that his deportation plan would cost $400 billion to $600 billion and, because there are not enough citizens and legal residents to fill the demand, the plan would shrink the labor force and reduce gross domestic product by $1.6 trillion.
It's hard to know whether the conflicting forces unleashed by Mr. Trump will create a recession. For the moment, at least, the stock market is betting no. But in addition to higher interest rates, financial markets are signaling higher inflation rates.
This much is certain: Mr. Trump's proposals would confer vast monetary gains on wealthy Americans while leaving middle- and working-class Americans -- his electoral base -- further behind. For his supporters, the irony of a Trump victory is that they may end up even less well off.

Full text:   To the long list of pundits who called the election all wrong -- as well as its likely consequences -- add Wall Street analysts.
As the presidential election approached, they were falling all over themselves to predict a Hillary Clinton victory and, afterward, a modest stock market rally. The prospect of a win by Donald J. Trump was so remote as to be deemed a "black swan," an event that was only distantly possible but would have potentially dire consequences for financial markets.
Among the many predicting a drop in equity markets in the unlikely event of a Trump victory were analysts at Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Keith Parker, head of cross-asset strategy research at Barclays, forecast a drop of 11 to 13 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The hedge fund Bridgewater Associates went even further, warning clients that the Dow Jones industrial average would fall 2,000 points.
But then, not only did Mr. Trump win, but American stocks rose. The S.&P. 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq all gained more than 1 percent on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Dow rose 1.2 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.2 percent, and the Nasdaq was down 0.8 percent.
With benefit of hindsight, what's extraordinary is how few professional investors saw it coming. Mr. Trump was derided as the candidate of "uncertainty," which markets typically abhor, and many of his stated policies are vague, incoherent or inconsistent. But there was nothing uncertain about his overall pro-growth, pro-business and America-first tendencies, now backed by the firepower of a Republican House and Senate.
He is, after all, a real estate developer.
"We see tremendous opportunity for economic growth," said John Engler, a former governor of Michigan who is now president of the Business Roundtable, an influential group of chief executives that was often at odds with Mr. Trump during the campaign, especially over trade and immigration. Now that the results are in, though, Mr. Engler sees a silver lining. "The Republicans understand," he said, "that they're on the spot to produce results."
Simon Lack, founder of SL Advisors, an investment advisory firm and operator of a mutual fund that focuses on energy, carried the theme further. "Trump's win is unambiguously positive" for many sectors of the economy, "especially energy infrastructure," he said.
The doomsayers also ignored a century of market reactions to presidential elections. "We've done extensive research that suggests presidential elections don't affect markets," said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. "The reality is that the market is influenced to the greatest extent by economic factors and monetary policy."
"In almost all technical and macro aspects, this is still a bull market," Mr. Stack said, and Mr. Trump's election does not change that.
Markets generally rally the day after a presidential election, said Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Traders Almanac, because elections, whatever their outcome, eliminate a measure of uncertainty. "It doesn't matter if it's a Republican or Democrat," he said. Returns tend to be higher when an incumbent president is replaced or the party in power changes, as happened this week. And previous instances of the election of both a Republican president and Republican Congress have been followed, on average, by a first-year performance of 14 percent.
There are more specific reasons as well that investors applauded Mr. Trump's victory:
INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he wanted to "build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports." If he can get his Republican Congress to go along, that could easily surpass the President Obama's stimulus plan in the depths of the recession. Mr. Trump has not put a price tag on his proposals, but suggested it could easily top $500 billion.
Economists generally agree that government spending can act as a broad economic stimulus as well as a boon for construction companies. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Mr. Obama's stimulus plan saved 2.1 million jobs in the last quarter of 2009, bolstering the economy by up to 3.5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by as much as 2.1 percent.
Construction company stocks rallied on Wednesday. Shares in Caterpillar, which makes the heavy equipment used in most infrastructure construction, jumped more than 8 percent.
TAX CUTS With Republicans in charge, the kind of sweeping tax overhaul and tax cuts long sought by investors seem likely. In many instances, Mr. Trump's proposed tax cuts go even further than those advanced by House Republicans. He wants to cut the top rate on individuals to 33 percent and cut the corporate rate and taxes on so-called pass-through entities like limited liability companies and partnerships to 15 percent.
Whatever their ultimate effect on deficits and interest rates -- not to mention worsening income inequality -- tax cuts are another form of economic stimulus.
"Tax modernization is our top priority," said Mr. Engler of the Business Roundtable, arguing that it would substantially lift the economy a full percentage point beyond the growth rate of roughly 2 percent a year that it has been stuck in. "We've said that if you want to grow gross domestic product by 1 percent, get tax legislation done. The House Republican plan is a great blueprint. One percent growth over 10 years would be $3 trillion."
DEREGULATION Investors and business leaders this week were cheering the likely rollback of a host of time-consuming and costly regulatory measures: crucial parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, environmental regulations and labor protections. "Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function," Mr. Trump said during the campaign.
Needless to say, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and Wall Street nemesis who Mr. Trump mocked as "Pocahontas," will not have a starring role in a Trump administration.
Some of the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation are likely to be banks, drug companies and oil and gas pipelines. On Wednesday, shares in JPMorgan Chase rose 4.6 percent, the biotech concern Biogen jumped more than 8 percent, and the pipeline operator Kinder Morgan rose 4.5 percent.
Whether the "Trump rally" persists is another question. In their rush to buy stocks this week, investors seemed all too willing to ignore Mr. Trump's hostile stands on immigration and free trade, as well as his seeming indifference to the federal deficit and the increased likelihood of higher interest rates. All of those have the capacity to damp growth or even tip the economy into recession.
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, was, like many others, surprised by the strong market rally. "If we get a large stimulus on top of a full-employment economy," he said, "it may give you some juice in the near term, but longer term, it's going to hurt" by driving up interest rates and squeezing out other investments.
"I was a strong advocate of deficit spending and tax cuts when unemployment was at 10 percent," he said. "It doesn't make sense at 5 percent."
Mr. Parker of Barclays said he expected a sell-off initially, but also called for a recovery by year-end once investors absorbed signals from key economic policy makers. "What we thought would play out over weeks played out over hours," he said, pointing to Mr. Trump's early-morning victory speech, which made no mention of trade or immigration, as one catalyst.
Like many, Mr. Parker now sees more gains for stocks if a Trump administration stays focused on a tax overhaul and fiscal policy, if real interest rates stay low and if inflation picks up. "The backdrop was and still is generally supportive of risk," he said.

Abstract: Mr. Trump's plan included cutting the rate on the highest earners from its current 39.6 percent to 33 percent and cutting the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. In the simplest math of fiscal policy, lower taxes plus more spending equal higher budget deficits.

Full text:   Here's a surprising conclusion you reach when you start to game out what economic policy will look like in Donald J. Trump's administration: While many details of his policy agenda are likely to be staunchly opposed by the left, Mr. Trump appears likely to enact a fun-house mirror version of what many liberal economists have advocated for years: Keynesian fiscal stimulus.
Mr. Trump did not run a campaign with many detailed proposals, but he promised to cut taxes significantly, rebuild and expand infrastructure and maybe increase military spending. Together those moves would most likely increase the budget deficit substantially. That risks increasing interest rates and inflation, which could dampen the pro-growth effects of any tax cut and government spending.
If that turns out to be the policy reality of the next few years, it would be a real-world test of an argument liberal economists have made for years: that higher deficits could help end an era of "secular stagnation" and spur faster growth. Somewhat higher inflation would actually be a feature, not a bug, of the policy approach.
The most detailed policy proposal the Trump campaign issued was on tax policy. It broadly tracks the priorities of a Republican Party that will control both houses of Congress.
So expect major tax cuts, which will especially benefit wealthy Americans and businesses. Mr. Trump's plan included cutting the rate on the highest earners from its current 39.6 percent to 33 percent and cutting the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Of course any actual changes to tax policy will depend on the results of laborious negotiations with Congress -- no campaign policy proposal is ever enacted exactly as written. But Mr. Trump's proposal is similar to a proposal by House Republicans, and it is quite clear this is the direction Congress will want to go.
Mr. Trump has often cited his experience as a real estate developer and promised he would radically increase spending on public infrastructure. He even said at one point in the campaign that he would double the $275 billion infrastructure plan that Hillary Clinton proposed. He specifically cited infrastructure spending again early Wednesday morning in his victory speech in New York.
Some version of this infrastructure policy has a good chance of being enacted. Republicans in Congress are generally on board with the idea of spending on roads, bridges airports and other projects; opposition to such a proposal during the Obama administration has been more tactical than ideological.
Even if the details of a Trump infrastructure plan take a different form than the one that left-of-center economists have advocated as a cure for persistently slow growth, the result in terms of the macroeconomic effects should be similarly positive.
But then there are the tax cuts. In the simplest math of fiscal policy, lower taxes plus more spending equal higher budget deficits. Mr. Trump resorted to vague hand-waving about any spending cuts to offset those changes, promising instead that faster growth would prevent the deficit from rising.
Most hardheaded analysis -- including from those sympathetic ideologically -- suggests this is wrong. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, for example, estimates that Mr. Trump's tax plan would reduce federal revenue by about $12 trillion over the next decade, and faster growth would offset only about $2 trillion of that.
Assuming that those forecasts are right and that Mr. Trump's tax and spending plans sharply increase the deficit, the open question is what it means for the economy. For the last few years, the world has suffered from a chronic shortage of demand, depressing inflation and interest rates worldwide.
If those conditions persist, a Trump administration may have some room to expand deficits without triggering a spike in interest rates that would undo any economic boost those deficits create.
But many economists don't see it working out that way. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, was skeptical in a much-discussed paper released earlier in the year estimating the economic impact of a Trump administration. He assumed that if Mr. Trump's policies were taken at face value, it would increase the deficit from 3.5 percent of G.D.P. this year to more than 10 percent by the end of Mr. Trump's term. He said this would cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates above 6 percent in 2018 to prevent inflation.
It's unwise to extrapolate from short-term moves in financial markets what will happen to the economy over years ahead. But shifts in the markets on Wednesday suggest that investors are pricing in some significant chance of this happening.
The yield on Treasury bonds fell initially Tuesday night as Mr. Trump's victory looked more probable and investors sought a safe-haven investment. But Wednesday, rates actually rose 0.11 percentage points, which suggests global investors think that higher rates are in the United States's future. Measures of expected inflation in the bond market rose as well.
"While things change fast, for now the market seems to think of a Trump presidency largely as inflationary," said Roberto Perli, an economist with Cornerstone Macro, in a research note Wednesday morning.
Even for people who don't like Mr. Trump's proposed tax cuts or the rest of his policy agenda, if he gets his way on taxes and infrastructure spending, it will be a test of whether deficits really matter in a world that has been locked in a slow-growth reality for years.

Abstract: The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader measure of the stock market, also eked out a gain, adding to a big rally the day before, after Donald J. Trump's presidential election victory. The sell-off in bonds continued on Thursday, sending bond prices lower and kicking the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.14 percent, the highest it has been since January, from 2.07 percent on Wednesday.

Full text:   Banks and other financial companies led stocks on Wall Street mostly higher on Thursday, propelling the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader measure of the stock market, also eked out a gain, adding to a big rally the day before, after Donald J. Trump's presidential election victory. The Nasdaq composite closed lower, weighed down by a slide in technology companies. Bond prices slumped again, sending yields higher.
"You are seeing a massive swing out of cash and fixed-income and into equities to take advantage of this pro-growth cycle that the market believes we're beginning," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J. P. Morgan Private Bank.
The Dow climbed 218.19 points, or 1.2 percent, to 18,807.88. That's a gain of about 1 percent from the average's previous record high, reached on Aug. 15. The S.&P. 500 added 4.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,167.48.
The Dow and the S.&P. 500 are on a four-day winning streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 42.28 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,208.80.
Investors continued to make moves based on the bevy of policy changes that the Trump administration could put into effect when it takes over in January. Those include cutting taxes, increasing infrastructure spending and slashing government regulation of businesses.
That has pushed financial, industrial and health care stocks higher, while prompting traders to sell consumer goods companies, utilities and phone companies. Investors have also continued to pull out of bonds in anticipation that Mr. Trump's policies could usher in a stronger economy and, possibly, higher inflation, both of which are bad for bonds.
The sell-off in bonds continued on Thursday, sending bond prices lower and kicking the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.14 percent, the highest it has been since January, from 2.07 percent on Wednesday. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans, including home mortgages.
JPMorgan Chase led the 30 companies in the Dow, climbing $3.40, or 4.6 percent, to $76.65. It was followed by Goldman Sachs, which rose $8.24, or 4.3 percent, to $200.87.
Traders also bid up shares in Macy's and Kohl's after the companies reported their latest quarterly results.
Macy's rose $2.15, or 5.6 percent, to $40.53. Kohl's was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500, adding $5.27, or 11.5 percent, to $50.97.
In European markets, Germany's DAX slid 0.2 percent, while the CAC-40 in France fell 0.3 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 lost 1.2 percent. Optimism that Mr. Trump's election will improve relations between the United States and Russia helped lift the Micex index in Moscow 1.6 percent.
Markets in Asia fared better. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rocketed 6.7 percent after sliding more than 5 percent the day before. South Korea's Kospi advanced 2.3 percent and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong added 1.9 percent. Australia's S.&P./ASX 200 surged 3.3 percent.
Crude oil prices declined. Benchmark United States crude fell 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $44.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 52 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $45.84 a barrel in London.
In metals trading, the price of gold fell $7.10 to $1,265.50 an ounce, while silver added 36 cents, or 2 percent, to $18.74 an ounce. Copper rose 9 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.55 a pound.
In currency trading, the dollar continued to strengthen on Thursday.
The United States currency rose to 106.88 yen from 105.87 yen on Wednesday, while the euro slid to $1.0884 from $1.0909. The Mexican peso continued to weaken against the dollar.
One dollar bought 20.61 pesos on Thursday, more than the 19.87 pesos it bought late Wednesday. Investors worry that Mr. Trump's anti-immigration stance and intention to repeal a trade pact with Mexico could hurt that country's economy.

Full text:   After a sharp sell-off overnight in Asia, markets staged a recovery on Wednesday as investors shook off the shock of a Donald J. Trump presidency and began to focus on whether his mix of policies could spur a still-fragile global economic recovery.
Futures for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index initially plunged 5 percent but recouped nearly all their losses when stocks started trading in the United States. The major market indicators ended the day up more than 1 percent.
By their nature, markets are wired to look beyond the moment and into the future. In that regard, the bounce-back in stocks reflects the bet being made by many investors that Mr. Trump's promises to increase government spending, cut taxes and ease financial regulations will outweigh his anti-trade rhetoric.
To that end, stocks that would benefit from more robust economic growth, like banks and companies tied to infrastructure and transportation, were in demand on Wednesday. Shares of Bank of America closed up 5.7 percent. The equipment rental company United Rentals ended up 17 percent.
More broadly, however, market experts said that Mr. Trump's victory should be viewed as a loud signal from Main Street that the time had come for fiscal policy in the form of increased government spending to replace central bank activism as a means to stimulate economic growth.
"This was a political uprising," said Jurrien Timmer, a market strategist at the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments in Boston. "Monetary policy has been part of the problem, in that the wealth effect has not accrued equally. If the baton is passed toward fiscal policy, that would mean higher inflation and lead to a rotation toward cyclical stocks such as financials."
For quite some time now, economists have been warning that the reliance of governments in the United States and elsewhere on central banks to energize economies via zero interest-rate policies and buying back securities was creating an uneven recovery by bolstering the housing markets in New York, London and San Francisco while real economies lagged.
"The economic recovery under President Obama never reached deep enough -- it did not bring working-class people up," said Justin Gest, a public policy expert who has just written a book analyzing how working-class men and women in the United States and Britain have become alienated. "And the nature of the economy that Wall Street and corporate America has promoted reflects the gaping inequality in this country."
Increased government spending on highways, bridges and roads may well provide a lift to the broader economy, and tax cuts and looser regulations will be cheered by the financial markets.
But there are downsides to these approaches, including increased deficits and levels of debt.
Moreover, market analysts wonder how Mr. Trump will balance these policies, which are mostly positive for financial markets, with his promises to increase trade barriers on goods from Mexico and China.
Mr. Trump's antitrade position has prompted fears that he would precipitate a trade war at a time when global trade is already suffering because of increased protectionist measures in countries around the world.
"This is not Brexit," said Jeffrey Kleintop, an investment specialist at Schwab Investments, referring to the rally in stocks and bonds that soon followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union. "That will be a long process of negotiated change. The worry is that Mr. Trump would follow through on his promise to raise tariffs on China and Mexico."
In that vein, emerging market currencies and stock markets bucked the market's buoyant mood. The Mexican peso was down about 8 percent against the dollar and the Chinese renminbi continued a recent trend of weakness, suggesting, some traders said, that China might be pushing the currency lower to give exports an extra lift before Mr. Trump takes office.
More than most days, investors flocked to exchange traded funds during the market's opening hours, with E.T.F.s at one point accounting for 45 percent of total stock market trades, according to officials at BlackRock. Among the more popular was iShares biotechnology fund, which soared 9 percent on the hope of fewer regulations for pharmaceutical companies under Mr. Trump.
On Wednesday, the benchmark S.&P. 500-stock index closed up 1.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index also ended up 1.1 percent, while the narrower Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.4 percent. Trading volume was the heaviest since the market turmoil of late June after Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
For now, the market's willingness to cast a positive eye on a Trump victory seems tied to the prospect of more government spending.
In the weeks leading up to the election, a noticeable trend has been the slow but persistent increase in the interest rates of government bonds, many of which have been in negative territory for some time as investors sought safety in these securities.
The sell-off in Treasury securities on Wednesday was drastic, pushing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, on the benchmark 10-year note past 2 percent for the first time since January. The yield, which touched a low of 1.37 percent in July, ended Wednesday at 2.07 percent.
And similar bonds issued by Japan and Germany, which this year began offering negative yields, are creeping toward positive territory.
Analysts have said that these moves reflect a growing willingness of politicians around the world to loosen their fiscal belts to fight long-term stagnation. Any move toward a meaningful pickup in infrastructure investing would require more government borrowing and thus put upward pressure on today's low interest rates.
Last week, the former United States Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers made the case, in a speech at the International Monetary Fund, that with rates at historically low levels and with the increasing chances of the economy entering a recession in the coming years, more government spending is desperately needed.
"The question of lack of demand should be our preoccupation in thinking about macroeconomic policy going forward," Mr. Summers said. "And it has a natural solution -- issuing debt to support whatever investments the government sees as best."
Governments around the world that are sitting on large piles of cash, like Germany, are facing similar pressures to take advantage of low rates to borrow and spend to stimulate a more vigorous level of growth.
While such policies would also increase debt levels, economists who support Mr. Summers's policy prescription argue that a trade-off of higher growth is worthwhile, given how low borrowing costs are right now.
No matter what comes next, the initial reaction Tuesday into Wednesday was shock. As the realization worked its way around the planet that Mr. Trump would become the next president of the United States, global investors tried to make sense of the financial and economic implications, putting markets on edge.
American stocks were higher, a respite from the wild ride in Europe and Asia. But confusion showed no signs of abating, with investors awaiting the articulation of Mr. Trump's agenda.
Global investors initially reacted as if the world had caught fire. They yanked their money from the marketplace in an unrestrained bout of selling reminiscent of the outbreak of war.
Investors sold stocks -- first in Asia, and then in Europe. They sold oil and the Mexican peso, pushing it to a record low.
They even sold the United States dollar, which nearly always functions as a refuge in times of chaos. Yet hours later, the dollar rallied, oil prices recovered and even the Mexican peso came off its lows.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve remains on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December as investors generally reacted with equanimity to the election of Donald J. Trump as the next president of the United States.
And some analysts said Mr. Trump's economic plans could prompt the Fed to keep increasing the rate.
The president-elect has promised to stimulate faster economic growth with measures that include a large tax cut and as much as $1 trillion in spending on infrastructure. He has also promised new barriers to imports, which could drive up inflation. Economists appear deeply divided on the impact of such policies.
"His market-positive agenda will begin to emerge and, with a Republican Congress behind him, the potential for many of these policies to become law is high," said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer for equities at Federated Investors.
Others, however, took a bleaker view of the likely consequences of Mr. Trump's election, arguing that he could push a fragile economy into recession.
"A blanket of uncertainty now hovers over the private sector of the economy," wrote Bernard Baumohl, chief economist at The Economic Outlook Group. "The cost of that uncertainty should be palpable. Growth will reverse course fairly significantly."
Markets fell sharply overnight Tuesday as it became clear that Mr. Trump would win, then bounced back Wednesday morning. By midday, the odds of a December increase as implied by asset prices had stabilized, down to 72 percent from 76 percent.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note topped 2 percent for the first time since the first quarter of the year, suggesting that investors are anticipating higher rates.
The quick rebound appeared to reflect a first impression among investors that Mr. Trump's partnership with congressional Republicans was likely to lift the economy. But analysts cautioned that the market's mood could change.
"The rates market is pricing in more of a fiscal stimulus rather than a growth shock," economists at TD Securities wrote in a note Wednesday. "But we should be sure not to extrapolate immediate reactions to long-term implications."
Looming over all such deliberations are the president-elect's trade policies. He has promised to impose more tariffs and to tax sharply goods imported from American companies that move operations overseas. That could increase inflation and depress productivity gains.
The Fed has signaled in recent months that it would like to raise rates for the second time since the financial crisis, barring any signs of fresh economic weakness. The Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, said after its most recent meeting last week that the case for higher rates "continued to strengthen."
Mr. Trump's election was viewed as one of the few developments that might throw a wrench into the works. The Fed, which started the year predicting that it would raise rates four times, has instead left rates untouched in a range between 0.25 percent and 0.5 percent. The low rates are intended to stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. If financial conditions tighten in the coming weeks, or volatility rises, the Fed might decide to delay a rate increase again.
"Faced with such a tightening in market-driven financial conditions, the Fed would be less likely to add a higher federal funds rate to the mix," wrote Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon Asset Management, a division of BNY Mellon.
But a growing number of Fed officials are publicly advocating a rate increase, and the Fed has carefully prepared markets for the likelihood that it would raise rates. Moreover, the Fed has several weeks to watch and wait before its next meeting on Dec. 13 and 14.
"While fiscal and economic policy uncertainty has increased, it would be a challenge for Fed rhetoric to maintain an aura of being above the political fray if that were the only rationale for not moving next month," said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. He said he still expected a rate increase in December.
Mr. Trump will also have the opportunity to quickly overhaul the Fed's leadership. Once in office, he can fill two vacancies on the Fed's seven-member board. And in 2018, when their terms end, he can replace the Fed's top officials, Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman, and Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman.
Mr. Trump sharply criticized Ms. Yellen during the campaign, claiming without evidence that the Fed was delaying increasing rates until after the election to improve the fortunes of Democrats. Raising rates, he said, would pop "a big, fat, ugly bubble."
Under Ms. Yellen, the Fed has embraced a responsibility to reduce unemployment by holding down interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Some conservative economists have sharply criticized this campaign, arguing that the Fed is trying to do too much, and that it is sowing the seeds of financial instability and higher inflation.
Officials appointed by Mr. Trump are likely to urge the Fed to focus on fighting inflation, meaning they probably would favor raising rates more quickly.
"A reasonable assumption is that these nominees will all be more hawkish than would have been the case under Clinton," Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said, referring to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. Mr. Guha noted that Mr. Trump's selections would be constrained by the need to win the support of congressional Republicans.

Full text:   Frustrated by a do-nothing Congress, voters took policy matters into their own hands on Tuesday by passing state ballot proposals to legalize marijuana, approve new transportation projects, raise state minimum wages and strengthen gun control laws. That these progressive measures won is an indication that voters are moving left on many issues, despite Donald Trump's victory.
Marijuana wins big. California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada voted to legalize recreational use of marijuana. Voters in Arkansas, Florida, North Dakota and Montana passed measures to make the drug available for medical use. With these new laws, more than 20 percent of the American population lives in a state or territory that has legalized the recreational use of marijuana. This should push President-elect Trump and the next Congress to remove the drug from the Controlled Substances Act and repeal federal criminal penalties for possessing small quantities of marijuana. This would give states that are moving ahead with legalization certainty that the federal government will not try to thwart their policies.
Support for mass transit. Residents of Los Angeles, Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere across the country voted to increase local taxes to expand and improve rail lines, bus service and roads and bridges. Los Angeles County's Measure M, which will invest $120 billion over 40 years in a fast-growing transit system, won the support of nearly 70 percent of voters. In the Seattle area, Sound Transit will invest $54 billion over 25 years in expanding its system, and the Bay Area Rapid Transit system will put $3.5 billion into rebuilding its network. These were all big victories for commuters and should encourage Congress to appropriate more federal matching funds to infrastructure projects.
Higher minimum wages in blue and red states. Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington voted to raise their state minimum wages to at least $12 an hour by 2020 and to automatically adjust them for inflation after that. Maine will also raise the subminimum tipped wage. The initiatives in Arizona and Washington also provided for minimum paid sick leave. And in South Dakota, a ballot proposition that would have established a lower state minimum for non-tipped workers under age 18 failed by a large margin. These measures, adding to the recent wave of state and local minimum wage increases around the country, show again that voters want to alleviate working-class poverty and that the $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage, which Congress last increased in 2009, is woefully inadequate.
Stronger gun control. Voters in California approved Proposition 63, mandating background checks for ammunition purchases, banning large-capacity magazines that can hold more than 10 cartridges and requiring law enforcement to confiscate the weapons of newly convicted felons. In Washington, a majority backed a proposal to give judges the power to seize the weapons of people deemed a threat to public safety or their families. And Nevada residents approved a proposal to expand background checks for private gun sales with a few exceptions, like sales to immediate family members. However, a similar proposal in Maine was defeated.
If Mr. Trump's election was a reflection of voter anger with the Washington establishment, these initiatives are a clear signal that many Americans are clamoring for solutions that will make their lives better.

Full text:   Higher education has been an easy target for budget cuts since the 2008 recession, forcing many public universities to lay off faculty and staff members, postpone investment in new facilities and raise tuition and fees (up an average 31 percent for in-state students). State support for public two- and four-year colleges -- funding is nearly $10 billion below what it was just before the recession -- has begun to recover, though officials at the nation's flagship universities say that doing more with less is the new norm. Some are even finding fresh ways to ease the financial burden on students.
Percentages indicate changes since 2008: in per-student state spending on higher education, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and in tuition/fees, adjusted for inflation.
State Spending in Illinois: -54%
Illinois universities are reeling after a political standoff that left them without any state money for nearly 10 months. That predicament put one campus, Chicago State University, on the brink of closing; its undergraduate enrollment has dropped by 32 percent over the last year. Western Illinois University is phasing out several majors: African-American studies, women's studies, religious studies and philosophy. For now, program cuts aren't planned at the University of Illinois's flagship campus, said Edward Feser, the interim provost. But many departments increased class sizes this fall, in some cases doubling or tripling them. Those adjustments come as demand goes up for courses in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. "In some cases we can't add faculty fast enough," Dr. Feser said. "It's creating a kind of perfect storm."

State Spending in Indiana: -6%
Purdue isn't counting on state investment to help reduce student debt. This fall, it's hedging its bets with an income-share program in which students are treated like, well, investments. About 150 juniors and seniors received an average of $14,000 in financial aid up front from Purdue's research foundation; after graduation, they'll pay back a share of their earnings for a set period, agreed upon in advance. Once that repayment period has passed, any remaining debt is forgiven. One catch: For investors to be willing to front tuition money, there has to be a payoff for them. Graduates with higher incomes will pay back more than they were given. Still, that might be less than those pesky interest payments on loans.
_____
State Spending in Louisiana: -39%
This state's high school students know the drill: Graduate with a 2.5 grade-point average, get a decent ACT score, keep up your grades in college, and you qualify for free tuition at Louisiana State University. But the state is facing a $1.1 billion shortfall and can't afford that level of financial aid. So some 16,000 L.S.U. students who receive a state-funded full-tuition scholarship through the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, or TOPS, may have to take out loans starting this spring, said F. King Alexander, the university's president. Lawmakers have cut the flagship's budget each year since 2008, so the university has raised tuition, causing the cost of each TOPS award to rise and the state to take more money away from L.S.U. "You're just in a spiraling cycle that you can't get out of," Dr. Alexander said.
_____
State Spending in Maine: -8%
When public universities recruit higher-paying out-of-state students, critics contend they're straying from their mission: to take care of their own residents first. Maine, however, isn't producing enough high school graduates to fill classrooms at its flagship university. Meanwhile, in-state tuition has been frozen for six years, while state funding hasn't budged much. So this fall, the university started giving qualified students from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and all the New England states a deal: Attend the university at Orono for whatever it costs to attend their own flagship. That led to 2,000 more applications for this fall, and about 250 more out-of-state freshmen. Plans are to add California and Illinois next year. "We don't see this as an escalator to endless growth," said Susan J. Hunter, the president. Officials want to maintain that small-college feel, said Jeffrey Hecker, the provost. But, he added, the program has already produced "a meaningful amount of revenue."
_____
State Spending in Missouri: -22%
Trash left by raucous football tailgaters after Saturday games isn't being picked up until the following Monday. Three dorms have been shuttered. A hiring freeze is in place, and 38 staff members have been laid off. These are among the changes Mizzou has made to close a $25 million shortfall, largely the result of a 2,200-student enrollment decline this fall. Racial tensions and protests last year -- events that led two top university officials to resign -- helped trigger the drop. Lawmakers who were embarrassed by the way the university handled the turmoil had threatened to pile on more cuts, particularly if the protesting professor Melissa Click was not fired. (She was, and is now at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash.) Instead, the University of Missouri got a much-needed $8 million boost in exchange for agreeing to freeze in-state tuition.
_____
State Spending in New Mexico: -30%
Falling oil prices and fewer students mean trouble for the University of New Mexico, which this year faces another round of state cuts that could top $30 million. But officials are cutting a deal for students who tone down the partying and hit the books. If you take a full load of courses each semester and stay on track to graduate in four years, you get a tuition discount and your last semester of classes is free. It's led to a revenue loss of $3 million to $4 million since 2013 (when students earn their diplomas more quickly, they pay for fewer semesters). "That's a catch-22 for us," the president, Robert G. Frank, said. But "it's the right thing to be doing for our state." While still grim, the university's four-year grad rate is up, from 15 percent in 2012 to just under 20 percent.
_____
State Spending in North Carolina: -20%
For decades, North Carolina's university system was the model: healthy state support and low tuition and fees. Today's students may see the current price tag and wonder, "Really?" But lawmakers are trying to reverse that trend. North Carolina students will soon be able to pay just $500 a semester at three campuses, while the state covers the rest. There are caveats: You still have to foot the bill for fees, housing and food. And no, you can't attend the crown jewel in Chapel Hill for $500. But the chancellor of a campus affected by the plan said the low-tuition program might be expanded to other universities if it can be financially sustained. Some call that a dream.

State Spending in North Dakota: +46%
The average November high temperature in Grand Forks might be just 35 degrees, but the University of North Dakota has been on a hot streak. Fueled by an oil boom, the state's higher education spending soared by 39 percent from 2008 through 2015. That's helped the campus spend big on sleek new buildings and renovations, including an upgrade to its medical school (from the Legislature, $124 million). But with the drop in oil prices, the state's coffers aren't so flush, and officials had to find $21.5 million in cuts this year. Among the victims have been the music-therapy major and American Sign Language minor. The men's golf team managed to escape the chopping block; the baseball team was not as lucky.

State Spending in Tennessee: -18%
You can't miss the construction cranes, steel skeletons and orange cones dotting the University of Tennessee's Knoxville campus. A new $182 million student center is expected to be completed by 2018, and refurbished dorms and science labs are in the works. So financially, things must be going pretty well, right? Not entirely, said Anthony Haynes, the U.T. system's vice president for government relations and advocacy. Most of those projects were not paid for with new state money, and he predicts a shortfall close to $400 million by 2025. Mr. Haynes doubts the university can rely on the state to fill that gap. For one, lawmakers are unlikely to raise taxes. Also, the Legislature wasn't happy with U.T. after the controversy last year over posts on the university's website encouraging gender-neutral pronoun use and inclusive holiday parties. Lawmakers spent months discussing ways to punish the university financially; eventually, they took away the diversity office's budget for one year.
_____
State Spending in Washington: -20%
What could you do with an extra $2,094 in your pocket? With the economy healthy, lawmakers reduced in-state tuition at the University of Washington both last year and this year -- by 15 percent total -- and increased state funding substantially. Tuition cuts look good when politicians are running for re-election, said Randy Hodgins, U.W.'s vice president for external affairs. "After 30 years in this business, it's really nice to see higher education at the top of the agenda."
_____
State Spending in Wisconsin: -28%
After lawmakers voted last year to water down faculty tenure protections and cut the Madison campus's budget, creating an $86 million deficit, some foresaw a faculty exodus that would force officials to fill the void with an army of underpaid adjuncts and grad students. Did that happen? During the 2016 fiscal year, 144 professors told university officials they were considering other positions and requested counteroffers, about 40 percent more than the previous year, according to Sarah C. Mangelsdorf, the provost. The university managed to keep most of them, but officials had to give out $23.6 million in raises and research support. At least 34 faculty members have left in the past year.
_____
State Spending in Wyoming: +21%
Thanks to state support, the University of Wyoming has $100 million to put toward a new science building and $2.3 million more annually to bolster research and transform the way science is taught (the idea is to get students out of lecture halls and into new, state-of-the-art labs to problem-solve in small teams). But Wyoming is a boom-or-bust state that relies on natural resources to foot its bills. That puts the flagship on a roller-coaster ride: Some years have brought fresh investments, others staff cuts and salary freezes. The next two years will fall into the latter category. Laurie Nichols, the university's president, has declared a financial crisis, and under her budget-reduction plan some professors will have to increase their teaching loads. Still, U.W. remains the cheapest flagship in the country for state residents, and it's a good deal for those coming from outside Wyoming.

Abstract: More broadly, to put Egypt on a path to revival, they must educate and provide jobs for millions of young Egyptians; attract foreign investment to help move many of the nearly seven million government workers to the private sector; reduce the army's role in the economy; and develop a political system in which ordinary Egyptians, not just the military, can have a voice.

Full text:   Egypt took an important step toward saving its economy from collapse when it decided on Thursday to allow its currency to float freely, thus paving the way for a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Yet much more remains to be done to bring the country back from the edge of economic disaster, where it has teetered since the 2011 Arab uprising, which pretty much destroyed tourism and ushered in years of political instability.
A result has been a lack of foreign currency, which has forced many Egyptians to buy dollars on the black market, reduced imports of everything from sugar to cars and led to layoffs in some companies. After President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seized power in 2013, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provided billions of dollars in aid. That saved Egypt, but it also allowed Mr. Sisi, who fears popular unrest, to ignore the I.M.F. and its demands for structural reforms as a condition of its lending.
Mr. Sisi, a former general who has become an authoritarian and repressive leader, is not known for his economic expertise or political courage. But several factors -- further economic deterioration, rising criticism of his government and pressure from the United States -- have combined to change his mind. Even so, he waited until now to accept a deal that was tentatively approved in August.
Ahead of the float, scheduled to begin on Sunday, the Egyptian central bank had devalued the currency by nearly 50 percent, an effort to guide the level at which it should eventually trade. The move was designed to wipe out the advantage of the black market, which siphoned money from the banking system. Fuel subsidies were also cut. Egypt had already been addressing the I.M.F. requirements that it pass a value added tax, reduce electric subsidies and raise $6 billion in external financing.
The I.M.F. welcomed the flexible exchange rate and said the new system means that people will be prepared to sell dollars as well as buy them, injecting more money into the economy by attracting foreign investment and encouraging tourism and exports. But as Tarek Amer, the head of Egypt's central bank, acknowledged on Thursday, "It's going to take around one and a half years to see changes" in the economy as a result of the decision.
Whether poor Egyptians can hang on that long is unclear. The price of many subsidized staples, including bread, sugar, rice and cooking oil, could rise. Inflation across the board is already at a seven-year high, about 15 percent, and food prices are even higher. More anger and deprivation could lead to popular unrest, further taxing a country that has experienced enormous upheavals, including the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and the ouster of his successor, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, two years later.
Mr. Sisi and other Egyptian leaders will have to convince the public that they have a plan that can rescue the economy without hurting the poor. More broadly, to put Egypt on a path to revival, they must educate and provide jobs for millions of young Egyptians; attract foreign investment to help move many of the nearly seven million government workers to the private sector; reduce the army's role in the economy; and develop a political system in which ordinary Egyptians, not just the military, can have a voice.

Abstract: The October numbers partly reversed progress that was evident in the September report on the number of Americans who were part of the labor force.

Full text:   The United States economy is basically healthy.
That is the simplest, most important thing to take away from new jobs numbers released Friday morning, four days before the presidential election. These numbers affirm that Americans were probably right to focus on other things during this election. The United States still has plenty of problems and economic challenges. But they are more of the long-building variety than the get-us-out-of-this-slump variety.
The unemployment rate edged down to 4.9 percent in October, continuing a remarkably stable run (it has been either 4.9 percent or 5 percent for 12 of the last 13 months). Employers added 161,000 jobs, broadly consistent with the pattern over the last year; job creation estimates for September were revised upward.
The biggest and most pleasant surprise in these numbers is evidence that workers' wages are rising faster than they have through seven years of expansion. Average hourly earnings for private sector workers rose 0.4 percent, and are up 2.8 percent over the last year. It suggests that the many anecdotal reports that employers were needing to increase pay to attract workers are more than just anecdotes.
It is also true that inflation is starting to edge up, which means that in terms of buying power wages aren't really rising any faster than they were a few months ago. But if you think of inflation trends lately as being driven mostly by swings in energy prices, you're left with the good news that American workers seem to have the leverage to demand higher pay from their employers. That's what you'd expect from more than a year at a 5 percent unemployment rate, but wage gains have been slow in coming.
There is less good news in the report as well. The October numbers partly reversed progress that was evident in the September report on the number of Americans who were part of the labor force. A whopping 444,000 more people said they were either working or looking for work in September than August, but that number fell by 195,000 in October. For the truth of the matter, it's probably best to average the two months and assume that higher wages are indeed coaxing people into the labor force, but at a more gradual pace than the September report suggested.
Where does that leave a proper understanding of the state of the United States economy on the eve of an election?
The current economic expansion may be the most maligned in history. Among the complaints: It has been too weak, too slow, too uneven; it has been accompanied by people dropping out of the labor force; it hasn't brought meaningful income gains; it is driven entirely by the sugar high of monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve.
And these statements aren't wrong. It really has been painfully slow, particularly given the depth of the 2008-9 recession from which the United States has been recovering these last seven years.
But it's worth pausing to look at what has been achieved. Some 95.1 percent of Americans who tell survey-takers that they want a job are working. And they are finally starting to get the bigger paychecks they have long hungered for. It took a long time getting here, but the problems in the economy don't have much to do with recessions and recoveries anymore. They're about deeper questions of how best to improve the nation's long-term economic potential.
In particular, the biggest lingering weakness in the employment picture is in the millions of people who have left the labor force -- not just in October, but over the last seven years. Only 59.7 percent of American adults were employed in October, down from 62.9 percent at the start of 2008. A big part of that decline is demographic: baby boomers hitting retirement age. But millions of people dropped out of the labor force entirely during and after the recession and have not returned to the work force.
One possibility is that rising wages will serve to pull those people into the labor force; somebody who is unwilling to look for a job when the best thing available pays $10 an hour might feel differently about $12. Another possibility is that the problem of labor force dropouts is more deep-seated and complex than mere higher wages can fix.
Either way, trying to get more Americans into the labor market will be a priority if the next president wants to build on the sound economy he or she will inherit. The decision voters face is which candidate's long-term vision they find most compelling for doing that.

Full text:   Steady as she goes.
The Federal Reserve (unsurprisingly) decided not to raise interest rates just days before an already contentious election. But it seemed eager to do so at its December meeting -- and eager to signal its intent.
It struck a more positive note than in September, highlighting that inflation had strengthened (but that it was still below its 2 percent target).
A December rate rise is not a foregone conclusion, though, and the Fed has backed away before.
You might ask, why all the indecision?
Well, Fed officials have been like sailors trying to make headway in a windless sea, resorting to different measures to revive growth.
Now, they have to raise rates without tipping over the boat.
The Fed does not want to derail growth by raising rates too soon. But if they wait too long, they might have to lift rates sharply, risking a recession. We explain in more detail here.
If you're keeping an eye on monetary policy in Britain, here's what is expected from the Bank of England, whose governor announced he would stay at the central bank until mid-2019, despite political pressure for him to quit.
The Rush to Merge
Another day, another deal between chip makers.
Broadcom has become the latest semiconductor manufacturer to join the rush to consolidate.
It has agreed to buy Brocade Communications Systems, which makes switches and networking equipment, for $5.5 billion. Broadcom, itself the product of a recent merger, said the deal would help it to provide better connections to data storage systems.
More companies look to be joining in.
Microsemi, another chip maker, has hired a bank to run an auction after Skyworks Solutions expressed an interest in taking over, according to a Bloomberg report that cited people familiar with the matter.
Microsemi makes chips for use in defense, communications and aerospace. These products command higher prices and would help Skyworks become less reliant on the market for phones.
And could we see a flurry of deals in the banking sector too?
Breakingviews considers whether it is time for European banks to team up. It would be messy -- just think about the regulatory issues and conflicts of interest -- but it could be the way take on the competition over in the United States.
And to Divest
While others are looking to merge, Valeant Pharmaceuticals seems to be turning away from its aggressive deal making in an effort to cut debt.
According to The Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter, the company is considering selling its eye-surgery equipment business, which could fetch as much as $2.5 billion. The Journal also reported that Valeant was in advanced talks to sell Salix Pharmaceuticals, its stomach drug unit, for $10 billion.
Valeant is one of a number of pharmaceutical companies that have been scrutinized over aggressive pricing policies.
Bloomberg took a look at how deal makers have turned to flipping pharmaceuticals. It involves buying licensing rights to a medicine, jacking up the price and putting the rights back on the market.
Quotation of the Day
"All-out legal war with Thiel would have cost too much, and hurt too many people, and there was no end in sight."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday continued its slow march toward higher interest rates, signaling that it remains on track to raise its benchmark interest in December for the first time this year but holding off on an increase this month.
After a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, the Fed delivered the expected news that it would not adjust rates during the final days of a contentious presidential election. But the Fed's post-meeting statement reinforced expectations that Fed officials do not plan to wait much longer.
"The committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives," the Fed's policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, said.
The language was carefully calibrated to go just a little further than the Fed's statement after its previous meeting in September.
The Fed's assessment of economic conditions was also just a little more upbeat than the September statement. The most significant change reflected evidence of stronger inflation. The November statement said inflation "has increased somewhat," rising closer to the Fed's preferred annual pace of 2 percent.
The health of the economy has continued to improve. The unemployment rate stood at 5 percent in September, close to a historically normal level. Inflation rose 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, up from 0.8 percent during the 12 months ending in July. And the economy expanded at an annual pace of 2.9 percent in the third quarter.
Two Fed officials dissented. Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, both voted to raise rates a quarter-point. But Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who voted to raise rates in September, this time voted with the majority.
Mr. Rosengren said before the meeting that he did not see much difference between raising rates in November and raising rates in December, suggesting he was willing to wait a few more weeks for the Fed to act.
The Fed signaled after its last meeting in September that it would raise rates "relatively soon," as long as economic growth continued. But it was widely anticipated that the Fed would not move at its November meeting, just days before a contentious presidential election.
Investors expect a December increase. The chances of a rate increase, derived from asset prices, stood at almost 75 percent Wednesday morning, according to the CME Group.
Three Fed presidents voted for a rate increase at the Fed's September meeting, an unusually large bloc of dissenting votes for an organization that prizes consensus. Since then, the internal pressure for higher rates has continued to build. The regional reserve banks can signal support for raising the Fed's benchmark rate by voting to raise a separate rate, called the discount rate. Nine of the 12 banks voted to raise the discount rate in the last round of voting, in September.
Higher rates slow economic growth. But proponents of a rate increase argue that raising rates slowly could extend the current economic expansion. If the Fed waits, they say, it may then need to raise rates more sharply, which has often pushed the economy into recession.
"If we wait too long to start raising rates, I don't think we will have the luxury of moving as gradually as I would like," Mr. Rosengren said in a recent interview.
But a December increase is not a foregone conclusion. The Fed has repeatedly backed away from planned increases when the economic data has taken a turn for the worse. Officials entered the year predicting four rate increases; if they do move in December, it would be the first.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Saudi Arabia is itself grappling with the global decline in oil prices, and many of its longstanding political practices have been upended by Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince, who is defense minister and leads a powerful new council that oversees the state oil company.

Full text:   CAIRO -- In the tumultuous two years since President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt came to power, one ally has kept the Arab world's most populous country from economic ruin: Saudi Arabia pumped more than $25 billion into the faltering Egyptian economy, dwarfing aid from the United States.
The Saudis may have thought they were buying loyalty. But Egypt's vote last month for a Russian United Nations resolution on Syria threatens to unravel Mr. Sisi's relationship with Egypt's most crucial benefactor.
Shortly after the vote, the Saudi ambassador to Egypt left Cairo for an unscheduled three-day visit to Riyadh. The state-owned Saudi oil company, Aramco, postponed a promised shipment of 700,000 tons of discounted oil in October, and the spokesman for Egypt's oil ministry said the fate of November's shipment remains unknown.
Then last week, the Saudi head of a major Islamic organization, who has since resigned, publicly mocked Mr. Sisi, exposing the rift in a new way.
Ahmed Moussa, a prominent Egyptian talk show host and staunch supporter of Mr. Sisi, was one of many Egyptian commentators who reacted angrily.
"They want to make Egypt kneel," Mr. Moussa said of the Saudis, then offered his own threats. "Don't you ever think you can pressure Egypt into backtracking," he said. "Its decisions are sovereign. We don't owe anyone anything. We are the ones who are owed."
The fraying of the alliance between the two most influential Sunni nations is unfolding amid increasing sectarianism across the region. And the potential loss of Saudi support could hardly come at a worse moment for Egypt, whose economy is crashing amid a devaluing of its local currency, reduction in imports, and tourism tailspin.
Inflation in Egypt is at 14.6 percent, almost double the figure a year ago, and the government is awaiting approval of a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, which is likely to be conditioned on rolling back energy subsidies that could create political instability.
Saudi Arabia is itself grappling with the global decline in oil prices, and many of its longstanding political practices have been upended by Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince, who is defense minister and leads a powerful new council that oversees the state oil company.
Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia is going through a period of muscular nationalism and is trying to assert its weight as a Sunni regional power, particularly in trying to counterbalance Shiite Iran.
That has created a sense of wounded pride among Egyptians, who have long thought of their nation as the leader of the Arab world. They tend to be uncomfortable with their economic dependence on Saudi Arabia and sometimes dismiss the Saudis as oil-rich upstarts.
Still, the dependence is significant: Compare the $25 billion over two years from Saudi Arabia to the $1.3 billion annual military aid from Washington that Cairo has collected for years, part of the assistance Egypt has received since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
Much of the recent hostility has been centered on the bloody conflict in Syria that is now in its sixth year. Saudi Arabia has long pressed for the ouster of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Iran, while Mr. Sisi's Egypt has been unofficially supportive of Mr. Assad.
Both the Russian draft and a rival French resolution offering various formulations aimed at halting hostilities in Syria failed to garner enough votes in the United Nations Security Council. Egypt's support for the Russians, however, managed to provoke a backlash by the Saudis.
And then there was that remark suggesting the extent of the kingdom's exasperation, made by Iyad Ameen Madani, a Saudi who until Monday was chief of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which works to foster unity among 57 Muslim nations.
After mistakenly garbling the name of the Tunisian president, Béji Caïd Essebsi, by calling him "Béji Caïd el-Sisi," Mr. Madani took a swipe at the Egyptian president that was instantly recognizable by all who follow politics here.
"I am sure your fridge has more than water," Mr. Madani said to Mr. Essebsi.
It was a sly, dismissive reference to a widely derided comment Mr. Sisi had made at a recent youth conference. Urging young Egyptians to be patient as the country endures economic difficulties, Mr. Sisi said that he had lived for a decade with only water in his refrigerator and had not complained.
This prompted howls of derision on Egyptian social media, because Mr. Sisi had served for years in a military known for generous salaries, rising to be head of intelligence and eventually the entire system.
So when Mr. Madani revived the controversy with his offhand rebuke, Egypt's Foreign Ministry blasted back, calling the statement "regrettable" and a "grave transgression," and vowing to review its relationship with Mr. Madani's organization.
Mr. Madani resigned Monday "for health reasons," the organization said in a statement after it issued an apology, saying he had been joking.
The broader rift between the two countries, on the other hand, is real, analysts say.
"How long can this all last?" asked Issandr El Amrani, the North Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, on the Arabist blog. "The relationship is based on a kind of asymmetric passive-aggressive perpetual renegotiation. What Egypt is saying, in effect, is: 'I am an unreliable, disrespectful client that openly takes you for granted and jibes against you at every possible turn, but I know you will eventually come back to me because you are more afraid of my weakness and nuisance capacity than of my potential strength. So when is that next check coming?"'
But Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid, a political science professor at Cairo University, said he did not expect the latest round of skirmishing to have major consequences.
Saudi Arabia will not stop bankrolling Mr. Sisi's government, he said, because it needs him to prevent Egypt from descending into chaos at the Saudis' border. He noted that the Saudis deposited $2 billion into Egypt's central bank just days after halting the oil shipment last month.
"They will continue to cooperate because they have to," Mr. Sayyid said.
"All of this is unlikely to cause a breakup," he added. "It just adds tension to the relationship."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Amid myriad battles over trade agreements, concerns about the impending negotiations for Britain's exit from the European Union, and political instability across the region, the eurozone continued to grow steadily but slowly in the third quarter.
Gross domestic product in the 19-nation currency union rose 0.3 percent in the three months through September, compared to the previous quarter, Eurostat, the office that compiles statistics for the European Union, announced on Monday. That was an unchanged growth rate from the previous quarter and corresponds to an annual rate of 1.4 percent.
Consumer prices in the 12 months through October rose 0.5 percent, up from 0.4 percent in the 12 months through September.
Economic growth and inflation were in line with analysts' forecasts.
The indicators were closely watched not only for what they might say about the health of the eurozone economy, but for how they might affect decisions by the European Central Bank that can have a profound effect on financial markets.
Here are the main takeaways:
Still sluggish
First, some good news: The eurozone economy has not shrunk since the beginning of 2013, and some countries are doing pretty well. Spain, which once had one of Europe's sickest economies, grew a healthy 0.7 percent in the third quarter.
But the currency bloc's economy only recently got back to where it was eight years ago, when the global financial crisis was gathering steam. In many ways, the eurozone is still in crisis. Unemployment is 10.1 percent, and many countries are struggling. France, which has the second-largest economy in the eurozone, grew only 0.2 percent in the third quarter after shrinking in the second quarter.
Based on recent surveys showing rising optimism among businesses and consumers, some analysts thought the numbers released on Monday would provide a positive surprise. But they were disappointed.
What will the E.C.B. do?
The European Central Bank orients its policy to the inflation rate, which remains well below the official target of close to, but below, 2 percent. The annualized inflation rate of 0.5 percent in October was slightly higher than the previous month, but the slight acceleration is not a game changer.
Analysts have begun speculating about whether the bank might begin scaling back its de facto money-printing program (which aims to reduce market interest rates and stimulate the economy). But the numbers released on Monday did not provide any ammunition for those who think that "tapering" could begin sooner than expected.
Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, has refused to stoke the tapering talk. He said on Oct. 20 that purchases of government bonds, corporate debt and other assets -- a way of pumping money into the economy -- would continue at least through March, and longer if necessary, to push up inflation.
If growth and inflation remain sluggish, the central bank could decide to keep buying assets for longer. Bert Colijn, an economist at ING Bank in London, predicted that the central bank would announce an extension of the stimulus program at its next meeting, on Dec. 8.
"It will become very difficult for the E.C.B. to wait longer than that," Mr. Colijn said in a note to clients on Monday.
What's next?
Some economists expect the eurozone to grow more quickly in the current quarter. The region's economy seems to have shrugged off the "Brexit" vote from the summer, and Europe is benefiting from the stronger economy in the United States, the biggest market for eurozone exports.
The austerity that has weighed on growth is also running its course. Strict limits on government spending, a reaction to excessive indebtedness in countries like Italy and Greece, are being relaxed.
"Worries about weak growth in the second half of the year can in our opinion now be tossed overboard," Katharina Utermöhl, an economist at the German insurer Allianz, said in a note to investors.

Full text:   Assume, for a moment, that Donald J. Trump wins the presidency.
Some readers of this column will shudder at the thought and might even stop reading now. Others in the business world will beam, like Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur.
But what exactly happens the day after? To markets? To the economy?
The conventional wisdom is that, right off the bat, the stock market would fall precipitously. Simon Johnson, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, posited that Mr. Trump's presidency would "likely cause the stock market to crash and plunge the world into recession." He predicted that Mr. Trump's "anti-trade policies would cause a sharp slowdown, much like the British are experiencing" after their vote to exit the European Union.
In explaining his prediction, Professor Johnson wrote that Europe's economy is so fragile that "Trump's trade-led recession would tip Europe back into full-blown recession, which would likely precipitate a serious banking crisis." After that, he continued: "If this risk were not contained -- and the probability of a European banking debacle is already disconcertingly high -- there would be a further negative spiral. Either way, the effects on emerging markets and all lower-income countries would be dramatic."
Professor Johnson's view may be a bit hyperbolic, but to one degree or another, his pessimism is shared by many economists across Wall Street, from Citigroup to Goldman Sachs. Each cites a different set of reasons the markets will fall if Mr. Trump wins.
But is the conventional wisdom right?
Naturally enough, investors and analysts hate uncertainty. Hillary Clinton largely represents the status quo. Mr. Trump is more like Forrest Gump's "box of chocolates," as Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, an economic advisory firm in Washington, put it. "You never know what you're going to get."
In all likelihood, a Trump victory would lead to a swift, knee-jerk sell-off. Many investors will choose to sell stocks and ask questions later.
But in the days and weeks after a Trump victory, among investors who cull their portfolios carefully, the decision about buying and selling will be company by company, industry by industry, currency by currency and so forth.
In truth, it's impossible to predict how the markets would settle into a Trump presidency, despite the speculation on all sides. In all likelihood, it will take time for investors to truly make sense and "math out" how his policies would affect the economy. Yes, the Mexican peso would most likely fall on fears of a trade fight -- Goldman Sachs says it could fall by as much as 25 percent -- and shares of some insurance companies could tumble on the uncertainty of what would happen if Obamacare were repealed.
But oil companies and other sectors of the traditional energy industry would be likely to rally given Mr. Trump's plan to repeal regulations. (Renewable energy companies would fall.) Health care and biotechnology stocks, which have been driven down over concerns that Mrs. Clinton will seek greater regulation and possibly even price controls, might also pop.
If Mr. Trump wins, two companies that seem poised for an immediate pummeling are AT&T and Time Warner, given how much Candidate Trump has objected to their recently announced merger plan. AT&T, by the way, also happens to have a huge business in Mexico.
The biggest test for the stock markets might be pegged to the future leadership of the Federal Reserve. "There is much more uncertainty regarding who Trump might nominate, though he has made it clear he would not renominate Chair Yellen," Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. "His criticisms of Fed policy are somewhat ambiguous; he has suggested rates have been left too low for too long, but also warns of negative consequences of rate hikes. We would expect that financial markets would view a Trump victory as having slightly hawkish implications, since it would make a change in what many view as a dovish-leaning Fed leadership much more likely."
A handful of economists have suggested that despite all of the promises made by the candidates, the outcome of the election might not actually decide what direction the markets will take.
"Putting aside their personalities and policy proposals, it will likely not matter who the next president is when it comes to where markets go," Mr. Boockvar wrote in a note to clients. "As we are in the second-longest bull market of all time, and as we approach the eighth year of this economic expansion," he wrote, "odds are high that whoever the next president is, they will preside over a recession, a bear market and rising debts and deficits."
That might be too bearish of a view, but given that we've had a financial crisis of some sort about every eight years or so for the last several decades, it is hard to believe that we will go through the next four years without a hiccup. If merger activity is a gauge of the market's cycle, the recent spate of deals suggests we're closer to the ninth inning than the first.
Lawrence G. McDonald of ACG Analytics, who has commented on the potential benefits of a Trump presidency, said, "Trump will create a colossal panic, but the relief rally will be outstanding."
Mr. McDonald, who publishes a newsletter on global political risk called the Bear Traps Report, said he believed that "Trump's bark found in his anti-globalization position in reality will be a lot worse than its bite in terms of actual implementation."
While Mrs. Clinton is clearly the favorite choice of Fortune 500 chief executives and investors, Wall Street, perhaps surprisingly, is less enthusiastic about the idea of a Clinton presidency combined with potential Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate. "The S.&P. 500 has tended to react poorly to increases in the implied probability of a Democratic sweep, after removing the estimated effects of changes in growth, inflation and policy expectations," Goldman Sachs wrote. "The upshot is that the equity market appears to favor Clinton to Trump, but also seems to prefer divided government over single-party control."
One thing is certain, though: While Mr. Trump's business brand may have cooled during the contentious campaign, surely under a President Trump, lobbyists and other favor-curriers would be lining up for tee times at The Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., and inauguration week reservations at the newly opened Trump International Hotel in Washington. Some behavior is not hard to predict.

Full text:   The Bracero Program, which drew hundreds of thousands of Mexican laborers to toil in American fields from 1942 to 1964, left a searing memory of injustice. The program has been blamed for depressing farm wages and abusing immigrant workers.
So I wasn't surprised that some critics took a dim view of the proposal I wrote about in last week's column, which suggests that an improved version of the Bracero Program might help manage immigration by low-skilled workers into the United States and curtail illegal immigration.
Critics argue that the Bracero Program did not stop illegal immigration. And they cite some evidence that farm wages rose after it ended. Other studies, however, suggest otherwise. There is no historical census of illegal immigrants, so the numbers will remain in dispute.
Today, undocumented immigrants make up about half the agricultural labor force; guest workers under the H-2A visa program make up a much smaller share. Wages are hardly great. As more Mexican immigrants leave the United States than arrive, wages for field laborers average less than $12 an hour. That's about one-third less than the average pay in the notoriously low-wage retail sector.
With Washington expected to return next year to the issue of illegal immigration, the debate deserves even greater attention. David Bacon, a journalist and author, and Philip Martin, an expert on immigration an the University of California, Davis, offer critical views of the proposal for a new guest worker program. Michael Clemens of the Center for Global Development -- the main author of the new blueprint to regulate migration from Mexico -- and Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations, another author, respond. Their letters were lightly edited.
"Spread California's laws giving farm workers a legal process for forming unions."
From David Bacon
The column by Eduardo Porter proposing a new Bracero Program contains significant misstatements of fact. They dramatize the reasons civil rights leaders of the 1960s, including Ernesto Galarza, Cesar Chavez, Bert Corona and Larry Itliong, opposed the old Bracero Program and persuaded Congress to end it in 1964.
Porter says apprehensions of people crossing the border dropped to zero during the 1950s. In fact, over a million people were deported in the notorious Operation Wetback operation in 1954. Anti-immigrant enforcement increases during periods of large guest worker programs, because those workers are needed to force migration into those channels.
Porter says farmworker wages hardly soared after the Bracero Program ended. In fact, the period in which farmworker wages rose the fastest was during the two decades afterward. Itliong and Filipino workers, whose strikes were broken by growers bringing in braceros, struck in 1965, the year after the program was abolished. When Mexican workers under Chavez joined that strike, the United Farm Workers union was born. The contracts achieved at the union's height in the 1970s and early '80s gave farmworkers the highest wages, taking inflation into account, that they have ever had.
Porter suggests that a bracero program could be made palatable if employers were "encouraged" to hire workers in the United States first and had to apply for certification, and if workers were protected by United States labor law. Those requirements already exist for current guest worker programs. They have failed completely to protect workers' rights, as documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center report "Close to Slavery."
Porter proposes that part of workers' wages be withheld and paid only after the harvest and their return to Mexico. Withholding wages like this is illegal for workers in this country. To this day, growers, banks in Mexico and the United States, and the Mexican government all blame each other for millions of dollars of withheld wages that have "disappeared," and braceros are still fighting to reclaim them.
If the purpose of Porter's proposal is not to provide labor at low wages, then I have a counterproposal. Spread California's laws giving farm workers a legal process for forming unions and requiring growers to negotiate union contracts when they do to every other state. When workers have unions, higher wages and more protections, growers will find it easier to attract people to fill those jobs.
David Bacon is the author of "Communities Without Borders: Images and Voices from the World of Migration" (Cornell University/ILR Press, 2006), "Illegal People: How Globalization Creates Migration and Criminalizes Immigrants" (Beacon Press, 2008), and "The Right to Stay Home: How U.S. Policy Drives Mexican Migration" (Beacon Press, 2013).

"The era of border enforcement has cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars."
From Edward Alden
In the summer of 2005, I visited then Representative, now Senator Jeff Flake on his parents' ranch in Snowflake, Ariz. When he was a kid, the ranch hired dozens of Mexicans each year to tend crops that would feed the cattle when the winter snows came. Nearly all were unauthorized migrants; they simply followed the work and better wages, as their fathers had done before them.
The Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico were long part of a single labor market, with a line drawn by their governments in between. If the governments wanted to regulate what Douglas Massey of Princeton called this "circular migration," there were only two choices -- legalize the flow or criminalize it and impose harsh consequences.
The United States has tried both. In the 1940s, it worked with Mexico to create the badly flawed Bracero Program, which nonetheless helped reduce illegal migration to a trickle. The data are clear -- as bracero quotas expanded, reaching 400,000 annually in 1954, illegal migration fell sharply. With the elimination of the program in 1964, accompanied by new quotas in 1965 that for the first time restricted legal Mexican migration to the United States, illegal migration soared.
For the last two decades, the United States has tried the opposite approach -- a fierce border clampdown. The number of Border Patrol agents grew from a few thousand in the early 1990s to more than 21,000 today, nearly 700 miles of fences were built, and drones and other sensors now drape the border. Illegal migration from Mexico has fallen to its lowest level since the early 1970s.
Each of these approaches, however, has been very costly. Under Bracero, poorly designed rules and lax enforcement led to abuses of workers' rights and unfair wage competition for United States workers. The era of illegal migration that followed was no better for Mexican or United States workers, and it led to the collapse of the American public's confidence in the immigration system. The era of border enforcement has cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, enriched coyote smugglers and led to hundreds of migrants dying each year in dangerous desert crossings.
Our report "Shared Border, Shared Future" argues that the two countries can do better. A well-designed bilateral labor agreement would require employers to pay a significant premium for Mexican workers; allow workers to switch employers freely; apply all United States labor laws to migrants and permit unions to organize; and give migrants the choice of returning home or seeking permanent residence.
These requirements go far beyond the current H-2 programs and would address head-on the legitimate criticisms of many past temporary worker plans. And sustained enforcement would be needed to ensure that illegal paths do not again become more attractive than the legal ones for migrants and for employers.
Much has been learned since the Bracero Program was ended more the 50 years ago. It is time to apply those lessons and regulate Mexico-United States migration to better serve the interests of Mexican workers, American workers and employers.

"The farm labor market today is responding to rising wages as economics predicts."
From Philip Martin
Rather than substituting for illegal migration, the Bracero Program set the stage for large scale illegal Mexico-United States migration via two major channels. First, the availability of braceros combined with water projects and the Interstate System of highways allowed labor-intensive agriculture to expand far away from consumers, so that California replaced New Jersey as the nation's garden state. Second, Mexican workers and United States farmers gained experience working with one another, a mutual dependence they were reluctant to end.
Nevertheless, there was not an immediate upsurge in illegal migration after the Bracero Program ended. Instead, farm wages jumped 40 percent, from $1.25 to $1.75 an hour in the United Farm Worker grape contracts of 1966. The lack of braceros prompted a wave of labor-saving mechanization, including forklifts in the fields to move 1,000-pound bins of produce, and the mechanization of the tomato harvest. Modern personnel management, such as scheduling work carefully and identifying and retaining the best workers, permitted fewer workers to do the work.
There are three important lessons from developments in the farm labor market after the Bracero Program. First, economic principles worked, as a reduced supply of labor led to higher wages that primarily reduced the demand for farm workers. Second, farm employers began to treat more expensive workers better, adding benefits such as health insurance and pensions to retain experienced workers. Third, farmers anticipating ever-higher wages sponsored research on labor-saving mechanization, so that one major study predicted there would soon be no hand-labor jobs on farms.
Rising unauthorized migration in the 1970s reversed these trends. One example tells the story. In the late 1960s, the citrus industry supported 70-odd projects aimed at harvesting oranges mechanically; by 1980, this industry support ended. Increases in unauthorized migration stabilized labor costs and reversed grower incentives to treat farm labor as an ever-rising cost.
Today we are at another farm labor inflection point, and farm employers are responding with the four strategies expected by rising labor costs: satisfy current workers to retain them on the farm work longer, stretch their productivity with mechanical aids that raise productivity, substitute machines for workers where possible and supplement the aging work force with younger H-2A guest workers. Just as in the mid-1960s, the farm labor market today is responding to rising wages as economics predicts, making it hard to understand the call for new and untested guest worker programs.

"It is time to move past the failed policies and fossilized positions of the previous generation."
From Michael Clemens
I write to correct several statements by David Bacon and Phil Martin regarding Eduardo Porter's discussion of a proposed United States-Mexico labor migration agreement by the "Shared Border, Shared Future" working group.
Bracero visas obviously substituted for illegal migration. Immediately after the United States vastly raised the number of visas to an adequate 400,000 in 1954, illegal migration collapsed to near zero for the duration of the program. This outcome required both the adequate legal pathway and stronger enforcement, as Kelly Lytle Hernandez documents in her groundbreaking book, "Migra! A History of the U.S. Border Patrol."
Substantial illegal migration occurred exclusively in the early years of the program, when the number of visas -- around 100,000 a year -- was insufficient. But the end of this legal channel in 1965 was followed by unprecedented illegal migration in the 1970s and '80s.
Mr. Bacon and Professor Martin misrepresent the labor-market effects of excluding bracero workers. They are right that farm wages rose in the states that excluded braceros in the late 1960s. They do not mention that farm wages rose by the same amount, in the same years, in states that did not exclude any braceros (because they never had any). Farmers' response to bracero exclusion was to quickly adopt labor-saving technologies -- particularly in cotton, tomatoes and sugar beets -- in perfect accordance with "economic principles." That actually harmed United States farm workers by eliminating many of their own jobs.
Mr. Bacon mentions the unacceptable abuses of workers under the existing seasonal work visa. That is why this new proposal departs sharply from that tainted model. The proposal prevents workers from being tied to a single employer, and it eliminates unscrupulous recruiters the only way it can be done: bilaterally. He also mentions that many braceros' wages were stolen. No one knows that better than this group, which includes Alejandro Poiré, a former director of the Mexican government's program to restitute those losses. Thus the group insists on a 21st century system to transfer any withheld wages from the United States government securely and directly to individual workers.
Professor Martin suggests that the Mexican migration of the 1970s to 1990s was somehow created by the bracero agreements in the 1950s. But Mexican migration networks are far older; the Mexican-born fraction of the labor force in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico was higher in 1920 than 1990.
The policy decision of 1965 was to outlaw those longstanding, generational traditions of temporary mobility across the border. The dark consequence of that decision is today's giant black market in labor that has immeasurably harmed United States and Mexican workers. It is time to move past the failed policies and fossilized positions of the previous generation, and the "Shared Border, Shared Future" report offers a specific vision of how to do that.

Abstract: In August, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain's economy over fears that the so-called Brexit decision could weigh on growth. A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco stated that monthly gains of 50,000 to 110,000 should be sufficient to keep the labor market healthy.\n

Full text:   Here's a look at what's coming up this week:
ECONOMY
Eurozone estimates are for solid growth.
Official estimates coming out Monday are expected to show that the eurozone economy grew solidly in the third quarter as the region gradually emerges from nearly a decade of malaise. Analysts at Oxford Economics estimate that the gross domestic product in the eurozone rose 0.4 percent from the previous quarter, led by Germany and a recovering Spain. Although unemployment remains above 10 percent in the 19 countries of the eurozone, inflation is picking up from dangerously low levels, and surveys show that consumers and businesses are becoming more optimistic. "The wider European economy actually looks in pretty good shape," Oxford Economics said in a note to clients last week. Jack Ewing
Eyes are on personal income and spending data.
On Monday, the Commerce Department is set to report data on personal income and spending in September. Economists are looking for a 0.4 percentage point rise in each, with income buoyed by a still-healthy labor market. A bigger gain in income and spending than the consensus might set off alarm bells among traders who have been eyeing rising bond yields and expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December. A weaker number would suggest the economy was not as strong as recent data has indicated. Nelson D. Schwartz
BANKING INDUSTRY
Major European banks to report results.
Investors will once again be focused on Europe's banking sector as several of the region's biggest banks -- Credit Suisse, Société Générale of France and Standard Chartered, which is based in Britain but generates much of its revenue in Asia -- are expected to report their third-quarter results. Their results come as Deutsche Bank reported last week that it returned to a profit in the third quarter, providing some relief to investors after concerns about its stability. The bank is negotiating a settlement with the United States Justice Department in a case involving its underwriting of residential mortgage-backed securities. Chad Bray
ECONOMY
Fed to meet, but rate most likely to stay put.
Federal Reserve officials insist that their meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington will be like any other Fed meeting. They will look at economic conditions and decide whether the time has come to raise interest rates. This is a polite fiction. It's a safe bet that the Fed will not raise rates until after the presidential election. The economic consequences of the election are uncertain; the politics are fraught, and even proponents of a rate increase have said they do not see much difference in waiting a few more weeks. The Fed may use its post-meeting statement to prepare investors for higher rates in December at its final meeting of the year. Binyamin Appelbaum
Bank of England to report an updated inflation forecast.
The Bank of England will announce its latest monetary policy decision and unveil its updated forecast for inflation on Thursday. A news conference by Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, is to follow. The Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep interest rates steady as the British economy has performed better than expected since Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June. The Office of National Statistics said last week that Britain's economy grew at a 0.5 percent rate from July through September. That was down from an increase of 0.7 percent in gross domestic product from April to June, but ahead of economists' predictions.
In August, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain's economy over fears that the so-called Brexit decision could weigh on growth. The rate had remained steady at 0.5 percent since March 2009. Chad Bray
Final jobs report before Election Day.
On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its report on the nation's hiring and unemployment for October. This snapshot of the economy will be the last before Americans go to the polls on Election Day. In September, employers reported adding 156,000 jobs -- a showing that the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, called "a terrible jobs report" in the third presidential debate. Economists did not have quite as dire a view. The jobs engine is not roaring with as much energy as it has over the last five years, when monthly job growth on average surpassed 200,000, but with the unemployment rate down to 5 percent, job creation was expected to slow.
A recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco stated that monthly gains of 50,000 to 110,000 should be sufficient to keep the labor market healthy. Nonetheless, many Americans are working part time or for low wages or have become disheartened enough to drop out of the labor force altogether. Mr. Trump's complaints resonate among these groups and others anxious about the future. A strong report for October, by contrast, could be used by Hillary Clinton to bolster her argument that the Democrats are best positioned to build on the job gains seen during the Obama administration.

Full text:   REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- Spain has Podemos. Italy has its Five Star Movement, and Greece its Syriza. Now, the populist insurgency sweeping through Europe is finding a foothold in Iceland, where the Pirate Party, with its pirate flag logo and anarchist leanings, is poised to make big gains in a general election on Saturday.
Iceland is one of the most prosperous, equitable and accountable democracies in the world, and has recovered strongly from the 2008 financial crisis. Even so, the nation's political elite has been far from immune to public anger. Many voters are willing to risk it all by choosing the Pirate Party, which has spectacularly captured a chunk of the Icelandic electorate despite its niche origins as a hacktivist group.
"When I think about politics in Iceland, it makes me want to vomit," Sigmundur Knutsson, 62, said in a deli as he ate fermented shark, an Icelandic delicacy. "It's all about corruption among a very small elite," he said. "There is something that is not right. Something smells bad."
The Pirate Party, best known for its activism over copyright law and the protection of civil liberties, is expected to gain significantly in Saturday's election. It is riding on a wave of anti-establishment fervor spreading across Europe and the United States, upending traditional politics and fracturing mainstream parties.
For the first time in Iceland's long political history -- its Parliament was founded in 930 -- a dozen parties were jostling for power over this frozen volcanic landmass. Iceland, which is the size of Kentucky, has an electorate of about 260,000, barely enough people to fill three football stadiums.
Since its formation four years ago, the Pirate Party had gained three seats in the 63-seat Parliament. At its peak of popularity in April, when public outrage had erupted over millions of financial documents leaked from a boutique Panamanian law firm, the party commanded the support of 40 percent of the electorate, according to opinion polls. The documents, known as the Panama Papers, revealed the vast hidden wealth of politicians, including Iceland's prime minister, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, who stepped down over accusations of a conflict of interest.
Although support for the Pirates had since fallen by half, opinion polls conducted by Gallup in the run-up to the election showed that they remained the second most popular group after the mainstream, center-right Independence Party, which was in power when Iceland's economy collapsed in 2008.
The Pirate Party is unlikely to win an outright majority, but could still gain enough seats to form part of a coalition in the horse-trading that is likely to follow the election.
About 40 percent of Pirate supporters are under 30, and they were pinning their hopes on a party that has promised to install a more inclusive, transparent government.
The Pirates have pledged to enhance direct democracy by passing the world's first "crowd-sourced constitution," drafted by Icelandic civilians rather than politicians. Parliament blocked the document in 2013.
The party also wants to redistribute wealth and increase the government's anticorruption powers. (The country is already the 13th least corrupt country in the world, according to Transparency International, a watchdog group, ahead of the United States.)
"We want to see trickle-down ethics rather than make-believe trickle-down economics," Birgitta Jonsdottir, 49, the leader of the Pirate Party and a former WikiLeaks activist, said in an interview the day before the election.
Sporting sharp black bangs that sliced across her pale brow,Ms. Jonsdottir wore a black dress and black Doc Martens embroidered with red roses, fitting her self-description as an anarchist "poetician." (At age 14, she published her first poem, "Black Roses," about a nuclear holocaust.)
"We need to reboot politics," she said in her parliamentary office, next to a strip club on a narrow street. She worked on a laptop covered with a sticker that read: "National Security Agency Monitored Device."
Her party has granted citizenship to Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who stole a trove of highly classified documents after he became disillusioned with the agency's reach into the lives of millions of Americans.
In Iceland, a nation where internet penetration is among the highest in the world but social media is still a relatively new political tool, a strategist who once worked to help elect Senator Bernie Sanders president of the United States was helping push the Pirate Party's message through Facebook and Twitter.
Winnie Wong, who created the viral political hashtag #FeelTheBern, spent a few months training the Pirates' tiny media team on how to create viral content, and working with party leaders to improve their media presence. (She said her Icelandic was not good enough to create a Nordic equivalent of the Sanders campaign's famous hashtag.)
"They needed a bit of structure, and we gave them an intensive training on the mechanisms of what it takes to stage a successful insurgent campaign," Ms. Wong said in a coffee shop near Hallgrimskirkja, a silvery Lutheran church shaped like a gigantic rocket ship.
Soon, videos the party posted on Facebook gathered on average 26,000 views each, she said, equivalent to about 10 percent of Iceland's voting population.
"We really want them to win," she said, partly so that the next generation of American lawmakers can draw inspiration from Iceland for a better type of government.
Opponents had criticized the Pirate Party as political lightweights with little experience governing. The party focuses on more abstract, esoteric issues like the crowd-sourced constitution, critics say, when most voters are interested in more pressing topics like rising housing prices, student debt, pensions and the effects of climate change.
Still, those critics, like Birgir Armannsson, a member of the Independence Party, recognize that the political class shares part of the blame for such strong anti-establishment feeling. His party has been in power since 2013, and it was in the governing coalition in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.
"People lost confidence in traditional politics, institutions, society," he said in an interview. "People are still shocked. It's kind of like post-traumatic stress."
In 2008, Iceland's economy collapsed after its banking sector, fresh from deregulation, grew exponentially. In the years before that, Icelanders binged on credit, some becoming billionaires overnight. By 2006, the average Icelander was 300 percent wealthier than three years earlier. Cronyism became rampant.
When the crisis hit, Icelanders were plunged into debt and banks racked up losses of $100 billion, which amounted to roughly $330,000 for every Icelandic man, woman and child, according to Michael Lewis, the author of "The Big Short."
Since then, Iceland has rebuilt its economy, thanks in part to booming tourism, becoming something of a model of recovery for crisis-hit countries.
The investment units of banks have all but disappeared. Former financiers have moved on to new careers in the information technology or gaming sectors, or have gone back to fishing, the country's traditional source of wealth. Iceland has so far sentenced at least 29 senior bankers to prison for their involvement in the crisis. (By contrast, only one executive in the United States has gone to prison. Though major banks associated with the meltdown have paid billions of dollars for their role in the crisis, none of their top executives was held personally accountable.)
"The economy has been recovering," Mr. Armannsson said, adding that Iceland has low unemployment, low inflation, low inequality and healthy growth.
"You could say we are well off and our outlook is quite good," he said. "But part of the population is still not satisfied."
Despite efforts to remedy past mistakes and improve governance, "we are still in a political storm in the aftermath of the financial crisis," Mr. Armannsson said, sounding genuinely puzzled.
"This is a little bit extraordinary."

Full text:   The American economy moved into a higher gear last quarter, expanding at an annual rate of 2.9 percent and riding continued strength among consumers and a better performance in global trade.
The Commerce Department's report on the nation's gross domestic product, released Friday, is the next-to-last snapshot of the overall economy before voters go to the polls on Nov. 8. Americans will also get to gauge the economic fortunes of the nation from the monthly unemployment figures to be released on Nov. 4.
While the pace of economic growth in the third quarter fell well short of previous achievements, the latest data represented a significant improvement from the first half of 2016 and the best quarterly advance in two years. Economists also said the gains were probably strong enough to reassure Federal Reserve policy makers that it was safe to raise the benchmark interest rate when they meet in December.
"This is a good, solid number," said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. "The economy is growing at a decent clip. Consumer spending will continue to lead growth, and the fundamentals there remain positive."
For all the quarterly blips, the ups and downs on Wall Street and the back and forth between political parties, the American economy remains more or less on the same trajectory since the recovery began more than seven years ago: modest but consistent growth.
The bigger picture has remained remarkably steady, with yearly growth in the range of 1.75 percent to 2.75 percent. From 2010 to 2015, the economy grew at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent.
Economists like Michael Gapen of Barclays expect gross domestic product to expand 2.5 percent in the current fourth quarter, and then advance about 2 percent in 2017.
"The consumer is fine, and there is evidence that the industrial side of the economy is stabilizing and the big drags from inventories and weak investment are abating," Mr. Gapen said. "Manufacturing, trade and energy may no longer be significant headwinds, as they have been over the last year."
The 1.1 percent growth rate from January to June this year was the slowest first half since 2011, and it was well below what economists expected when 2016 began.
Much of that weakness was a result of an inventory buildup on store shelves and in warehouses that has only slowly been worked off. The lingering effects on business investment from the collapse in the price of oil and other commodities have also dragged down the economy.
Many experts initially forecast another subdued performance in the third quarter, but estimates crept higher this week after a report on Wednesday showed better-than-expected exports and lower imports in September.
Unlike some recent periods, which showed uneven gains, the growth in the third quarter was broad-based, with most industries advancing. For the second quarter in a row, trade was a net positive, adding nearly a full point to growth on a big jump in exports.
Consumer spending slowed from its barnburner pace earlier in the second quarter, but at 2.1 percent, it was healthy enough to suggest that shoppers remained optimistic. Other sources of slack, like a drop in spending on residential construction, were more than made up by businesses as they restocked shelves and began investing again in the energy industry and elsewhere.
The comparatively good economic news was welcomed by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, which has repeatedly made the case that the economy is in better shape than Donald Trump and other Republicans claim.
"Today's G.D.P. release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years," Jacob Leibenluft, a senior policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said in a statement. "It's clear we've made real progress coming back from the crisis."
Mr. Trump's campaign noted that growth during President Obama's time in office has fallen well short of 3 percent on an annual basis, and claimed that Mrs. Clinton's stewardship of the economy would not be any better.
"The growth numbers are catastrophic," Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement. "Hillary's tax, spend, borrow and regulate policies will cause an outright depression."
In a separate report Friday, the University of Michigan revised its final reading on consumer sentiment in October down slightly to 87.2. Oxford Economics attributed the decline to the fierce rhetoric that has characterized the final days of the presidential race.
"Consumers often feel less optimistic in election years, and 2016 is no exception," said Gregory Daco, head of United States macroeconomics at Oxford. "We anticipate that a reasonably solid macroeconomic backdrop will underpin a rebound in sentiment once the election has concluded."
The recent rebound in oil prices could also spur more economic activity among drillers and other energy producers in the months ahead, even if slightly higher gas prices won't please consumers.
Underscoring just how quirky economic data can be on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the Commerce Department noted that a big chunk of the export gains came from a surge in soybean exports that was unlikely to repeat itself in future quarters. Friday's release was the first of three estimates of quarterly growth that could be revised upward or downward by government number-crunchers; the next batch of data on G.D.P. is expected on Nov. 29.
Since joblessness hit a peak of 10 percent in 2009, the unemployment rate has been cut in half. Still, growth in the current recovery has fallen well short of previous rebounds in the 1980s and '90s.
The slack in the economy has contributed to paltry wage gains for most Americans until recently. In addition, plenty of workers are stuck on the sidelines or reluctantly working in part-time jobs because full-time positions are not available.
But now there are signs that wages are finally beginning to increase, as the steady drop in unemployment forces businesses to compete for new hires. With that in mind, the Federal Reserve is considered likely to raise interest rates when it meets in December; it would be the first increase in a year.
Policy makers at the Fed will gather next week, but most experts say there is little chance the central bank will act to tighten monetary policy so close to the presidential election.
While growth could rise above the 2 to 3 percent range for a quarter or two in the next year, it is unlikely to rise to the level last seen in the late 1990s, when economic activity was in the 3 to 4 percent range.
"The labor force is growing more slowly than it was in the 1990s, and productivity growth is slower," Mr. Faucher of PNC Financial said. "There are things we can do -- like improve the tax structure, implement regulatory reform and spend more on infrastructure -- but those are longer-term projects."

Full text:   The economic expansion that has been underway in the United States since 2009 is getting old, and soon will die.
At least that's the conclusion you would reach from various news media prognostications about the economic environment the next president will face.
"The next president will likely face a recession," said a CNN headline. "Recession May Loom for Next U.S. President No Matter Who That Is," said a Bloomberg headline in May. New York magazine was at least generous enough to frame the coming recession in the Clinton or Trump administration as an open question.
These prognostications could turn out to be right, of course. The economy faces all sorts of risks and threats, any of which could lead to a contraction. But the fact that the current expansion is more than seven years old -- "long in the tooth," as commentators have often observed -- reveals almost nothing about the likelihood of a contraction during the coming four years. The idea that it would happen is rooted in a faulty metaphor, and isn't backed by modern economic history.
It's tempting to think of an economic expansion as being like a life span. The older you get, the closer you are to death; a 95-year-old probably has fewer years left to live than a 60-year-old. But this year Glenn D. Rudebusch, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, looked at the evidence from post-World War II United States economic expansions, and did not find that pattern held up at all.
"A long recovery appears no more likely to end than a short one," Mr. Rudebusch wrote. "Like Peter Pan, recoveries appear to never grow old."
Expansions don't die of old age. They die because something specific killed them. It can be a wrong-footed central bank, the popping of a financial bubble or a shock from overseas. But age itself isn't the problem.
A look around the world also shows plenty of examples of expansions that have lasted a lot longer than either the seven years the current United States expansion has been underway or the longest expansion in American history, from 1991 to 2001.
Britain had a nearly 17-year expansion from the early 1990s until the 2008 global financial crisis. France had a slightly longer expansion that ended in 1992. And the record-holders among advanced economies in modern times, according to the research firm Longview Economics, are the Netherlands, which experienced a nearly 26-year "Dutch miracle" that ended in 2008, and Australia, which has an expansion that began in 1991 and is on track to overtake the Dutch soon for the longest on record.
Will a President Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump face a serious economic downturn or a recession in the next four years? Quite possibly. The Federal Reserve could make a mistake, either raising interest rates too quickly, and stopping the expansion in its tracks, or raising them too slowly, and then needing to move abruptly to combat inflation. A new financial crisis could emerge; some shock we can't even imagine might stop this expansion cold.
There is a decent argument that the United States economy is more susceptible to recession now than it has been for most of the last several decades, for two reasons.
First, growth has been around 2 percent a year, below the 3 to 4 percent that was commonplace in the second half of the 20th century. That means there is less of a growth cushion. It takes a smaller negative shock to pull the economy into contraction territory.
Second, the Fed may find itself with less room to reduce the damage of the next downturn. In modern recessions, the central bank has cut rates by an average of 5.5 percent, according to research by the Fed economist David Reifschneider. With rates below 0.5 percent and on track to rise very slowly, any small shock in the next few years could cause major economic damage, especially if the Fed's less conventional monetary policy tools either go unused or don't prove effective.
But those are separate issues from the more general idea that "we're due" for a recession, and they're also issues that have been present for all seven years of the current expansion.
It's true that we're closer to the arrival of the next recession than we were a year ago. But that's tautological. We're also a year closer to the destruction of Earth by the sun, or to a Cleveland Browns Super Bowl title.
And there's no particular reason to think either of those are going to happen during the next presidential administration either.

Abstract: According to the United States Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the average domestic airfare fell to $361 in the first quarter of 2016, the most recent quarter for which figures are available. The seasonal routes are currently starting at $79 one way. Because it is a European carrier, Norwegian Air is limited to flying between the United States and European territories, such as the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, but even its small scale of service may have an impact on larger carriers.

Full text:   Depressed fuel prices, the growth of low-cost carriers and tumultuous world events have combined to do one nice thing for travelers: lower airfares.
According to the United States Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the average domestic airfare fell to $361 in the first quarter of 2016, the most recent quarter for which figures are available. That's down 7.8 percent from the first quarter in 2015 and the lowest, adjusted for inflation, since 2010.
"Generally speaking, airfares are at their lowest levels in a long time. It starts with cheap fuel," said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly. "Consumers are getting a good deal again after a few years of rising fuel prices."
Special events like holidays and seasonal weather patterns influence airfares, which commonly fluctuate. But two international regions, the Caribbean and Europe, offer particularly good opportunities to save on transportation this fall and winter. The airfare prediction app Hopper shows prices, compared with last year, down 9 percent in the Caribbean for preholiday travel in December, and nearly 16 percent lower for the same period to Europe.
The Caribbean
Fliers to the Caribbean are benefiting from a wave of low-cost carriers adding tropical routes and possible attrition because of Zika fears on the part of some travelers.
From the Northeast, JetBlue Airways has been expanding in the region for over a decade and now serves 27 destinations in the Caribbean. In August, it was the first United States carrier in over 50 years to begin regularly scheduled commercial flights to Cuba, starting at $99 one way from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Santa Clara. Most recently it announced new flights to Aruba from Fort Lauderdale beginning Jan. 4, 2017, with fares starting at $99 one way.
Southwest Airlines launched flights in the region in 2014 but grew significantly last fall when it opened an international terminal at Houston's secondary airport, William P. Hobby Airport. From here it offers flights to several foreign destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Aruba, Belize, Jamaica, Mexico and Puerto Rico. It recently offered flights from Houston to Belize City for $126 one way.
In the second quarter of 2017, when its $295 million renovation of an international terminal at the Fort Lauderdale airport is scheduled to be completed, the airline will be poised to offer more flights in the region. In August, it began scheduling daily flights from Fort Lauderdale to Nassau in the Bahamas, with fares recently posted as low as $58 one way. From Newark, beginning Dec. 17, it will begin seasonal service to Puerto Rico, from $128 one way.
Another new entrant, Norwegian Air, will fly to Guadeloupe from Fort Lauderdale beginning Dec. 17 and resume service, which it launched last year, to Guadeloupe and Martinique from Kennedy in New York, Boston and Baltimore beginning Nov. 10. The seasonal routes are currently starting at $79 one way.
Because it is a European carrier, Norwegian Air is limited to flying between the United States and European territories, such as the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, but even its small scale of service may have an impact on larger carriers.
"It all matters, especially when you're dealing with destinations that are somewhat substitutable," said Mr. Kaplan, of Airline Weekly. "Some people might want badly to go to a particular place, but a lot of people just want a beach. So if one beach is a better deal than another, everything competes."
Several airlines plan to start flights to Cuba in the next few months, a rush to the island that analysts expect will keep prices relatively low until demand and the supply of seats balances out. Silver Airways offers flights to three cities in Cuba, including Santa Clara, from Fort Lauderdale beginning at $98 one way.
The best deals involve bigger markets served by competing airlines. "We're seeing a lot of competitive pressures keeping airfares down in any market served by more than one airline," said Patrick Surry, the chief data scientist at Hopper. "Cuba is a great story. It used to be you would pay $400 to $500 for a flight from Miami, which is a crazy price, when flights were restricted. Now we expect prices to drop to something more like the Bahamas."
Europe
From terrorist violence to the Brexit vote, Europe has weathered a tough year, and many North American travelers stayed closer to home. Airlines, stuck with empty seats, are trying to reduce capacity by canceling routes. "But that takes time, and for consumers that means good deals in the meantime," Mr. Kaplan said.
Delta Air Lines, for example, recently advertised round-trip fares from Denver to Paris for $541 and from Kennedy to Madrid for $729.
United Airlines recently sold round-trip flights from Chicago to Paris for $624, Los Angeles to Dublin for $628, and Newark to Zurich for $864.
In what was most likely a response to terrorist events, the Europe sales began last summer, which is typically high season.
"Last summer we saw much lower fares than we've seen previously," said George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, citing fares to France in high season for $800, around half of what they cost the year prior. "I think it's an incredible time to go to Europe because of the favorable exchange rate with the euro and the British pound being pounded."
The rise of low-cost carriers flying between the United States and Europe has also affected fares. In addition to its Caribbean flights, Norwegian Air offers rock-bottom trans-Atlantic routes. For example, one-way flights from New York to Copenhagen recently started at $172.70, to London at $244.90, to Paris at $220.60 and Stockholm at $153.
Keep in mind that the cheapest fares with this low-cost carrier, as with many others, means lots of additional fees. For example, on an international flight checked bags cost $65 each, reserved seats are $45 and pre-ordered meals are $32.
Another low-cost newcomer, the Iceland-based WOW Air, recently had one-way tickets from Newark to London at $145.99 and to Amsterdam for $179.99. All of its flights from North America, including departures from Boston, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami, connect through Reykjavik.
For no additional charge, the airline offers the WOW Stopover that allows travelers to spend time in Iceland when connecting through Reykjavik on any round-trip flight between North America and Europe.
When should you book these deals? Airfares are always in flux, and certainly the December holiday period is highest. Hopper recommends December bookings be made before the end of October, noting that fares rise about $1.50 a day after Halloween until 10 days before departure, when they rise about $6 a day. But if you're planning three months out, you might wait.
"Generally, patience pays," Mr. Kaplan said. "On average you get the best deals between a month and two months before you fly."

Full text:   If Hillary Clinton wins this election and becomes the first female president of the United States, American men may well be one of her most urgent problems.
Consider some startling statistics.
More than a fifth of American men -- about 20 million people -- between 20 and 65 had no paid work last year.
Seven million men between 25 and 55 are no longer even looking for work, twice as many black men as white.
There are 20 million men with felony records who are not in jail, with dim prospects of employment, and more of these are black men.
Half the men not in the labor force report they are in bad physical or mental health.
Men account for only 42 percent of college graduates, handicapping them in a job market that rewards higher levels of education.
Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and now a professor of economics at Harvard, estimates that a third of men between 25 and 54 without college educations could be out of work by midcentury.
Well-paying jobs that don't demand a college degree have been shrinking for generations -- and technology is accelerating that trend. Driverless cars, for instance, could eliminate trucking as we know it, a refuge for many blue-collar men.
The crisis is not confined to the white men backing Donald J. Trump, who has commanding majorities among men without college educations. The challenge of masculinity in America extends beyond race and political party.
Economists and scholars have assembled a trove of disturbing data about the plight of men, even as they acknowledge that women's employment has stalled for the past 15 years as well.
Nicholas N. Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute has released the latest compendium, "Men Without Work." Drawing on multiple data sets, he sketches an unsettling portrait not just of male unemployment, but also of lives deeply alienated from civil society. The seven million men who are not even looking for work -- about 60 percent of whom do not have four-year college degrees -- spent an average of five and a half hours a day watching television or movies. Very few cared for children or other household members, or did housework. A third admitted to illegal drug use.
Many of Mr. Trump's backers talk about losing out in the new economy, echoing the points the candidate makes on the campaign trail.
Joe Peterson and Al Paslow, 61 years old and friends since high school, waited for hours the other day to attend a Trump rally in Ambridge, Pa. -- a town named for the American Bridge Company. It was a resonant spot, in the heart of what was once a thriving steel and energy powerhouse. Mr. Paslow's mother grew up in Ambridge on the very street where the rally took place. Their family, friends and relatives all worked in the abundant steel mills in the Pittsburgh area -- Mr. Peterson's father as an electrician, Mr. Paslow's father as a blacksmith.
"Now these mills are gone, replaced by stores, shops and offices that could have been placed almost anywhere," Mr. Paslow said. "No industry here now; it's all been lost."
The two friends most recently worked as independent contractors in the oil and gas industry, earning six-figure salaries. Mr. Peterson had a high school education; Mr. Paslow a college degree. Last year, they were both laid off -- no severance or unemployment, because they were not technically employees.
"I worked for the oil industry, which is dead because of Hillary," Mr. Peterson said. Now, he said, he was "considered nothing." He is worried about whether his son will find work; both friends fear that they may never get a job again.
The friends were thrilled that Mr. Trump promised at the rally to bring the oil and gas industry back on his very first day in office. "Unbelievably, that was exactly what we wanted to hear," Mr. Paslow said. "Our hearts were uplifted."
More than economic loss, though, support for Mr. Trump appears to come from men who live in places where intergenerational mobility is low and who report worries about their finances, whatever their level of income, according to Jonathan Rothwell, a senior economist at Gallup who analyzed 106,000 interviews conducted over the past year.
Add to economic anxiety a spate of illness and disability. American men -- particularly men without a college degree -- are simply less healthy than women.
Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton, recently conducted a study of working-age men. "I came away thinking our biggest social problem is men," he said.
A huge number are on painkillers, including 43.5 percent of men who have stopped looking for work. Both physical and emotional pain -- sadness, stress and dissatisfaction with their lives -- were particularly acute among men without college degrees, the unemployed and those not looking for work.
On several measures of health, men fare worse than women, and black men fare worse than white men. Black men die at higher rates than white men from AIDS, heart disease, cancer and homicide.
Yet the gaps are growing smaller by gender and race, and bigger by income and education. A man born in 1950, who is now in the lowest 10 percent of household earnings, can expect to live 14 fewer years than a man in the top 10 percent, according to a Brookings Institution study. Smoking, the largest preventable cause of death, is more prevalent among lower-income and less-well-educated people, and accounted for a third to a fifth of the gap in life expectancy between men with college degrees and men with high school diplomas, according to Andrew Fenelon of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Jessica Ho of Duke University.
Poor health makes it harder to work. Mr. Krueger found that 11.5 percent of men who were not employed cited illness and disability as a factor. Mr. Eberstadt's analysis found that nearly two-thirds of American households where men were not in the labor force reported receiving money from at least one disability program in 2013.
American men are also far more likely than women to be in jail or to be convicted of a felony, compounding the difficulty of finding work. The government keeps almost no data on the 20 million men who are not in prison but have felony convictions. Mr. Eberstadt estimates that for men with a criminal record between 45 and 54, the odds of being out of the work force are 35 percent for white males and 40 percent for black males.
A segment of American men feel under cultural as well as economic assault.
Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University and the author of "Labor's Love Lost: Rise and Fall of the Working Class Family in America," directly links economic upheaval to the loss of masculinity. "It's much more difficult now to say, I'm a real man," he said. "A real man earns enough so his wife doesn't have to work."
Most economists, though, don't believe it's possible to go back to the days when manufacturing was king -- and few women would want to give up economic or societal power, either. So what could help American men?
Many of the policies aimed at spurring economic growth and supporting low-wage workers would assist American men without college educations in particular.
In the short term, liberal economists and even some conservative ones back an idea that Mrs. Clinton has said she would push in her first 100 days -- a $275 billion infrastructure jobs plan, which could provide at least temporary employment to a key segment of those hurting the most: blue-collar men.
Liberal economists tend to coalesce around other solutions, such as raising the minimum wage and expanding eligibility for the earned-income tax credit, a proven way to reduce poverty. Mr. Summers is one of many who would push the Federal Reserve to continue stimulating the economy to boost employment, rather than focusing on curbing inflation. He also argues for government subsidies to bolster the wages of less-skilled employees.
Wage insurance could address the plight of men like Mr. Paslow; as Mr. Krueger explains it, payroll taxes could be used to make up some of the gap between the higher hourly wages earned in manufacturing and the lower wages more common in the service industry.
Liberal and conservative economists agree on the failings of the education system and urge more focus on the school-to-work transition, since so many men without a college education are flailing.
Apprenticeship systems and expanded access to community colleges -- both ideas backed by President Obama -- could help train workers for high-demand jobs without requiring four-year colleges, Mr. Cherlin said. But conservatives worry about the cost of subsidizing community colleges.
Mr. Summers would like to see more government investment in areas with bad school systems, but conservatives prize local control.
Re-examining the effects of mass incarceration -- on black men in particular -- and reconsidering mandatory sentences have attracted bipartisan support, though such efforts stalled in Congress. Mr. Summers calls for improving incarceration-to-work programs.
While debate continues to rage about Obamacare, Mr. Krueger is convinced that expanding health insurance could provide American men with more preventive treatments and promote healthier lifestyles.
But in the long term, Isabel V. Sawhill and Richard V. Reeves, senior fellows at the Brookings Institution, argue that men must resign themselves to working in "pink collar jobs" -- those known by the acronym HEAL, for health, education, administration and literacy.
Economically, "women have adjusted better than men," Ms. Sawhill said. "They're the ones who are winning." Women dominate the (often lower-paying) service jobs that are the backbone of the new economy. Men make up just 20 percent of elementary and middle-school teachers, 9 percent of nurses, 16 percent of personal aides and 6 percent of personal assistants, Ms. Sawhill and Mr. Reeves noted.
Succeeding in the new economy and culture may well require rethinking conventional ideas about masculinity. Mr. Cherlin bemoans men's "continued reluctance to take jobs they think are beneath the dignity of real men."
From the conservative end of the spectrum, Mr. Eberstadt flags the disability system. He'd like to see it redefined as a "work first" program, much like welfare reform under Bill Clinton. He cites a Swedish program that ties disability benefits to showing up for job training and job placement.
Mr. Eberstadt would also like to intensify social pressure on the cadre of men who have stopped looking for work. "Why haven't we had the same sort of conversation about stigmatizing or shaming unworking men that we had 20 years ago about mothers on welfare?" he said. "They were not idle; they had little kids."
If she wins, focusing on American men could pay off for Mrs. Clinton. She could shore up support with traditional Democratic voters such as African-American men. Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic Party have lost considerable ground with a constituency they used to own, blue-collar men. Angry white men are not likely to trust Mrs. Clinton, Beltway politicians or the political system. But they will need their help.

Abstract: Mr. Sisi, under pressure to overhaul the economy, has been blamed for the shortages in subsidies for sugar and other products that Egyptians have relied on since World War I. He reduced the subsidies' share of the budget this year by 14 percent, to about $8.7 billion, according to the government-run news website Ahram Online. Ahmed Kamal, an aide to the minister responsible for the subsidies, blamed the private sector, a scarcity of Egyptian hard currency and rising global prices for the sugar shortage.

Full text:   CAIRO -- Egyptians pile sugar into mugs of tea by the spoonful -- or three or five. A staple long subsidized by the government for most of the population, sugar is the chief ingredient of the national pudding, Om Ali. It can feel like the only ingredient. It is also a prime reason that nearly a fifth of Egyptians have diabetes.
So a weekslong sugar shortage has plunged people into a panic. The sugar crisis, as it is known, has quickly become shorthand for the brewing anger against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's management of the economy and his overall rule.
"The people are going to snap," Ahmad el-Gebaly said as he turned away customers seeking sugar he did not have at his subsidized-goods store in Bulaq, a working-class neighborhood of Cairo.
"Nobody can stand him anymore," he added of Mr. Sisi. "Sugar is like rice and oil and wheat. You can never run out of it. You can never mess with it. Who can live without sugar?"
Still reeling from the political turbulence and militant attacks that followed the 2011 uprising, Egypt's economy is in free fall. Its pound is now worth 6 cents on the black market, about half its value a year ago.
Tourism has collapsed, remittances from Egyptian workers in the Persian Gulf have dropped and revenue from the Suez Canal has fallen. Inflation reached a seven-year high of 15.5 percent in August. Saudi Arabia delayed a shipment of discount petroleum products this month, setting off fears of a deteriorating relationship with an ally that has propped up Egypt with more than $25 billion since Mr. Sisi came to power in 2014.
Sugar is not the only scarce staple, as the plummeting pound has slashed Egypt's import-purchasing power. Cooking oil disappeared from shelves for a time this year, residents said, as did baby formula, and rice is in low supply. Some people complained that they could not find certain medicines, or that the prices had skyrocketed.
Mr. Sisi, under pressure to overhaul the economy, has been blamed for the shortages in subsidies for sugar and other products that Egyptians have relied on since World War I. He reduced the subsidies' share of the budget this year by 14 percent, to about $8.7 billion, according to the government-run news website Ahram Online.
These cuts and other actions were "inevitable to save the economic situation," Mr. Sisi said in a recent interview with a state-owned newspaper. He described the current situation as a "bottleneck" and promised, "We are on our way out."
But people are not patient. They are desperate. The official price for sugar is more than 15 cents per pound, up from 6 cents per pound two years ago, and on the black market it goes for triple that. Small shops ran out of sugar weeks ago, and upscale markets are rationing it to one kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, per person.
The government created a hotline for residents to report hoarders, and the police arrested a man on Sunday for possession of 10 kilograms of sugar, the Egyptian state news media reported.
"It is the worst shortage I can remember in my lifetime," said H. A. Hellyer, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a research organization based in Washington. "I think what everybody is worried about is a repeat of the 1977 bread riots."
Dr. Hellyer was referring to the nationwide protests that followed attempts by Anwar el-Sadat, then the president, to dismantle the subsidy system.
It was the only attempt, said Amro Ali, an associate professor of sociology at the American University in Cairo. The subsidies, he added, were untouchable. "It's kryptonite," he said.
Today, 88 percent of Egyptians -- about 80 million people -- can buy subsidized food through government-issued electronic cash cards. In a country where a quarter of the population lives in poverty and millions of workers barely have enough for basic expenses, the cards are a lifeline. The government also subsidizes water, electricity and gas for all.
Ahmed Kamal, an aide to the minister responsible for the subsidies, blamed the private sector, a scarcity of Egyptian hard currency and rising global prices for the sugar shortage. He said that private importers were expected to bring in some of the 800,000 tons of sugar that Egypt must purchase from abroad annually, about a quarter of the nation's yearly demand for 3.2 million tons, but that the country had fallen short of its goal this year.
Mr. Kamal said the problem had been exacerbated by business owners hoarding supplies and by the news media whipping up angst. He added that the government still had a four-month supply of sugar.
But little of it was available in Bulaq, the Cairo neighborhood where Mr. Gebaly's shop was the only subsidized grocery reliably open -- and he mostly turned people away.
"All I say, all day, is: 'There's no sugar, there's no sugar, there's no sugar, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,' " Mr. Gebaly said, before he was interrupted by a call of another customer asking for sugar. An older man waiting nearby gave up, grumbling: "You keep saying, tomorrow! Tomorrow!"
Residents said that the other six shops in the neighborhood that were licensed to sell subsidized goods had closed to avoid a police crackdown, but that they sometimes opened after hours to sell sugar illegally to small-time confectioners, cafes and people. The subsidy police have already arrested two neighborhood sugar traders, residents said.
Sumaya Oweis, 37, said she had stopped making her beloved sweet rice pudding and had cut down on tea. On a recent morning, she smacked her 4-year-old son after he stuck his hand in the sugar bowl. But what was she to do about her husband?
"May God destroy his mother's house!" Ms. Oweis groaned, slapping her palms to her face. "He has sugar in everything!"
For Ms. Oweis, like many residents, the sugar shortage came after months of growing hardship. Her husband, an itinerant worker, struggled to make $2 a day, she said. They are eating less because they cannot keep up with rising prices for food, like potatoes, which cost about 26 United States cents a pound now, up from about 5 cents several weeks ago.
"I'm losing weight," she said, pointing to her skinny arms. Her subsidized birth-control pills had disappeared off the shelves for a few weeks this year. When they returned to the market, Ms. Oweis said, the price for a month's supply had increased to $2 from $1.30.
Perhaps the shortage of sugar is somewhat of a blessing, given Egypt's problems with obesity and diabetes, wrote Mohammed Nosseir, a liberal politician.
The sugar shortage, "estimated at 80 percent, probably represents the amount of sugar we need to reduce in terms of consumption," Mr. Nosseir wrote in an editorial on the Daily News Egypt website. "If they consume reasonable amounts, Egyptians could easily afford to purchase unsubsidized sugar."
A teenager tried to make a similar point at Mr. Gebaly's shop. "I found out why there's no sugar!" he called out. "So nobody gets diabetes!" Everybody ignored him.
Videos about the crisis have been shared widely on social media.
In one, a tuk-tuk driver, identified as Moustafa Abdou in the Egyptian news media, ranted against Mr. Sisi. "Before the presidential elections, we had enough sugar," he said in the clip, which aired last week on the privately owned Al-Hayat television channel. It was quickly removed from the channel's Facebook page, but was viewed 4.7 million times on another Facebook page.
"They go on TV and they say Egypt is rising," Mr. Abdou said. "And the poor citizen cannot find a kilo of rice on the street."
In another video, a man set himself on fire in Alexandria, screaming after he set himself alight: "I can't afford to eat."
Mr. Ali, the sociologist, said it was the first public self-immolation since the uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.
"It shows you that the core problems have yet to be resolved," he said.

Full text:   Consumer prices in the United States recorded their biggest gain in five months in September as the cost of gasoline and rents surged, pointing to a steady buildup of inflation that could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in December.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its Consumer Price Index increased 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the index rose 1.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year increase since October 2014. It rose 1.1 percent in the year to August.
"Today's inflation data are not hot enough to put a rate hike up on the table next month, but it is also true the economy is strong enough to generate some inflation pressures," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Last month's increase in the price index was in line with economists' expectations. But underlying inflation showed signs of moderating against the backdrop of a slowdown in the pace of increases in health care costs after recent robust gains.
The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, gained 0.1 percent last month after climbing 0.3 percent in August. That slowed its year-on-year increase to 2.2 percent after a 2.3 percent rise in August.
The Federal Reserve has an inflation target of 2 percent and tracks an inflation measure that is hovering at 1.7 percent. The Fed lifted its short-term interest rate last December and has held it steady since because of persistently low inflation.
Last month, gasoline prices jumped 5.8 percent after falling 0.9 percent in August. Gasoline accounted for more than half of the increase in the price index last month.
Americans also paid more for electricity, with prices posting their biggest gain since December 2014. Households, however, got some relief from food prices, which were unchanged for a third consecutive month. The cost of food consumed at home declined for a fifth consecutive month.
Within the core Consumer Price Index basket, housing costs rose further in September. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence increased 0.4 percent, the largest gain since October 2006, after rising 0.3 percent in August.
Medical care costs rose 0.2 percent last month after surging 1 percent in August. The cost of hospital services was unchanged, while prices for prescription medicine rose 0.8 percent.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: The widespread uncertainty, and the challenges that arise from it, are acutely felt in the scientific community, dependent as it is on long-term funding, cross-border mobility and international collaboration. Around 30,000 scientists and researchers from member states are employed by British universities -- equivalent to 20 percent of their teaching and research staff -- and a full 60 percent of research papers in Britain are written with partners in the European Union.

Full text:   LONDON -- When Adam Durant started his company analyzing climate-related threats to aircraft, he and his team of researchers symbolized the possibilities offered by the European Union.
Soon after graduating from college, Mr. Durant received a prestigious European Union grant to study atmospheric chemistry and conduct climate-related research. When he started his business, he hired staff members from Belgium and France without having to sponsor their visas.
But since Britain voted in June to leave the bloc, Mr. Durant has become the archetype of something very different: a nervous entrepreneur, unsure about future funding and even considering leaving the country.
His worries mirror those of the British business community at large, and the concerns appear to be weighing on the country's economy.
Technically, nothing has changed since the referendum. But a vast number of questions remain, including the shape of Britain's future trading relationship with the European Union and the long-term rights of European nationals now working in the country.
The widespread uncertainty, and the challenges that arise from it, are acutely felt in the scientific community, dependent as it is on long-term funding, cross-border mobility and international collaboration.
"It's probable that the opportunities that existed pre-Brexit won't exist next year," Mr. Durant, 37, said. "Things are becoming more difficult."
Britain has long been a global leader in scientific research because of world-class universities that produce top scientific papers.
In particular, the country excels at health sciences and advanced engineering, areas that have thrived partly because of factors tied to Britain's membership in the bloc.
Though much of the debate before the referendum focused on Britain's financial payments to the European Union, the science sector has unquestionably benefited from membership, receiving net contributions of 3.4 billion euros, or about $3.7 billion, from a variety of European Union programs from 2007 to 2013.
European Union money accounted for 40 percent of funding for cancer research in Britain over the last decade, according to Digital Science, a consulting firm based in London. In nanotechnology research, that figure is 62 percent, and in evolutionary biology, it is 67 percent.
Those resources have plugged the gap in falling British government funding, adjusted for inflation, and low levels of investment from Britain's private sector, figures from Digital Science show. British businesses contribute the equivalent of 1.06 percent of their country's gross domestic product toward research and development, 80 percent less than what German companies contribute toward research and development in Germany.
The country has also attracted talent from across Europe. That is largely because of the relative ease of doing business in Britain, coupled with ecosystems developed around top universities, and that the bloc's free movement of labor means no citizen of a European Union member country requires a visa to work in Britain.
Around 30,000 scientists and researchers from member states are employed by British universities -- equivalent to 20 percent of their teaching and research staff -- and a full 60 percent of research papers in Britain are written with partners in the European Union.
All of those factors are crucial to Mr. Durant and his fledgling business.
After getting his degree, he went on to obtain a Ph.D. In 2007, he received a Marie Curie Fellowship, which finances research across the bloc. Then, after the eruption in 2010 of an Icelandic volcano that disrupted global air travel, he started Satavia.
The company was founded in 2013 with initial funding of [euro]500,000 from the European Space Agency -- which is partly funded by the European Union and works closely with the bloc -- along with a promise of up to [euro]4 million more. Satavia, which helps aircraft detect threats like ice and volcanic ash, now employs four scientists in Cambridge.
"European funding has been critical to the success" of the company, Mr. Durant said.
But shortly after the Brexit vote, he was turned away from a research network involving European partners. He has since stopped writing research proposals because of the uncertainty. He is even considering moving Satavia's headquarters from Britain.
His experience is not unique.
C-Tech Innovation, a company focused on energy efficiency and renewables that is involved in 15 energy and biotech projects funded by the European Union, has similar worries.
The company has 44 employees and is based in the northern town of Chester. Without the funding, its model "would not operate," said Rob Bell, C-Tech's director of research and innovation. Businesses tend to shy away from the early stages of a technology because of the high risk involved, Dr. Bell explained, and that gap is generally plugged by European money.
Some companies are already moving, like Herba Invest, a small drug company in southern England that is relocating to Spain.
Across the industry, 40 foreign researchers have turned down positions or are thinking of doing so, while another 100 are planning to leave Britain or have already left, according to Scientists for E.U., a British group that is campaigning to keep the country in the bloc. In all, it has logged 371 such "adverse effects."
Though those figures may be low, some worry they may be a harbinger of things to come.
There are also fears that the European Medicines Agency, which has overseen regional drug approvals since 1995 from its offices in London, could move to the Continent once Britain leaves the European Union, and drug companies could follow suit to streamline the regulatory process.
Some research outfits also worry they will lose access to European researchers.
"Mobility of people drives the issues and with that the mobility of ideas, of investment," said Keith Burnett, vice chancellor of the University of Sheffield, a major recipient of European Union grants, particularly in evolutionary biology, physics and astronomy. Building a scientific community, he said, is like building a city.
A lot will depend on how the government of Prime Minister Theresa May negotiates for Brexit.
It has so far given assurances that it would safeguard the scientific community's funding, at least through 2020. Supporters of Brexit have also said that the government can use money that would otherwise have been sent to Brussels on scientific research.
But as the negotiations get underway -- Mrs. May has said she will start formal talks on leaving the European Union by the end of March -- that could all change.
She has said that Britain would not accept the bloc's rules that allow the free movement of labor. And despite pledges of financial support from pro-Brexit politicians, promises have been made to spend on causes that have broader appeal, like Britain's National Health Service. An expected slowdown in economic growth could also hurt tax receipts, putting still more pressure on the budget.
In a sign of growing anxiety among academics, a conflict recently erupted between the London School of Economics and the government when the university said it had been instructed to bar non-British academics from advising the government on Brexit negotiations. Britain's Foreign Office has, however, denied the report.
But not everyone is downbeat. Some are even raising their bets, like the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, which has said it will invest 275 million pounds, or $341 million, in Britain.
Darrin M. Disley, the chief executive of the Horizon Discovery Group, a biotech company in Cambridge, supported Britain remaining in the European Union. But even after the result, he said the country could find new opportunities further afield.
"If you've got the innovation, the right links to universities, the right links to industry, the right entrepreneurial environment, the right funding, that's an outstanding recipe," he said.
"The concern is will the government fill the gap in funding?"

Abstract: Proposition 13 was an assault on the property-tax structure in California, where plebiscites are hard-wired into the political ethos and voters tend to exercise the franchise aerobically. Owners of real estate quickly saw their property tax bills slashed.

Full text:   In between America's two most famous tea parties, the Boston affair in 1773 and the protest movement that arose in 2009, there was a referendum known as Proposition 13. Like the tea parties, it was rooted in an abhorrence of taxation (with or without representation). Like them, too, it had enduring consequences.
Proposition 13 was an assault on the property-tax structure in California, where plebiscites are hard-wired into the political ethos and voters tend to exercise the franchise aerobically. In 1978, they approved this ballot initiative by nearly 2 to 1, setting in motion a continuing debate over whether they had acted with beneficent wisdom or with heedless foolishness. Owners of real estate quickly saw their property tax bills slashed. But they, and millions of others, also found themselves burdened with assorted new fees and levies to compensate for lost state and local government revenues.
For better or for worse, Proposition 13 inspired tax revolts in other states. In its wake, anti-tax firebrands rose to prominence, such as Grover Norquist, who turned his no-tax-increase pledge into an article of faith for conservative office seekers. In California, the birthplace of many American trends, politicians in both major parties have long regarded Proposition 13 as they would a subway line's third rail: You touch it, you die.
The 1978 vote shapes the latest offering from Retro Report, a series of video documentaries exploring major news stories of the past and the long shadows they cast. This installment comes as the 2016 presidential race enters the homestretch, a campaign in which taxation has loomed large -- not local property taxes so much as federal income taxes, specifically those of Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee.
It seems evident that Mr. Trump went years paying not a nickel's worth of those taxes. "That makes me smart," he said in his first debate with Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Besides, he said later, any tax paid "would be squandered, too, believe me."
His words echoed those of Howard Jarvis, a pugnacious businessman who was a principal architect of Proposition 13, formally called the People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation. Jarvis worked on it with another businessman, Paul Gann. In terms of temperament, they could not have been more different. Gann was quiet-spoken, Jarvis a pillar of bombast. As such, he became the public face of the referendum -- a prophet of fiscal rectitude to his admirers, a grumpy cheapskate to his detractors. He drew inspiration from another Howard: Beale, the mad newscaster in the 1976 film "Network," who was immortalized by his signature line: "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"
Soon after Proposition 13 passed, Jarvis shrugged off concerns about forfeited revenue. "The bureaucrats have just squandered it," he said. Sound familiar?
In truth, Jarvis, who died in 1986, three years before Gann, was against more than taxes. He also opposed many of the things taxes paid for, including schools, parks, libraries and garbage collection. As recalled in the Retro Report video, he was unfazed by severe spending reductions that the proposition forced upon many communities.
"The most important thing in this country is not the school system, nor the police department, nor the fire department," he said. "The right to preserve, the right to have property in this country, the right to have a home in this country -- that's important."
His crusade took shape in an era of double-digit inflation throughout the country, and escalating real estate valuations in California. As property assessments soared, so did the taxes on them, at rates too rapid for many homeowners to absorb. The state was primed for a "mad as hell" moment.
Proposition 13 rolled back property values to their 1975 levels, and imposed a 2 percent limit on yearly increases in assessments. The tax on property could not exceed 1 percent of the value. In addition, any attempts to raise many types of taxes were cramped by a new requirement of approval by a two-thirds majority, be it in the State Legislature or at the local level.
Right away, property-tax revenues plummeted nearly 60 percent. The state -- led then, as now, by Gov. Jerry Brown -- helped keep cities and counties afloat by diverting about $5 billion from a surplus it had accumulated.
Over the long haul, fallout from the proposition landed broadly. Property taxes, estimated now at $55 billion a year statewide, declined as a share of government revenue. Hotel, utility, sales and other taxes were increased to take up the slack. As cities and counties struggled to raise revenue on their own, a good deal of power shifted from them to Sacramento, the state capital.
Inevitably, there were winners and losers. Wealthier property owners greatly benefited. So did those owning their homes for decades, given the relatively small annual increases in their assessments. Better to have bought a house in 1975 than, say, in 2015. It is not uncommon in California for an older couple's tax bill to be appreciably lower than that of a young family living next door in a house that is nearly identical but newly purchased at a steep price. Critics deplore the inequity. On the other hand, older people on fixed incomes are insulated from tax increases they might find punishing.
There are many hands. On one hand, Proposition 13 led local governments to lay off employees and defer essential maintenance. On the other, it impelled them to become more efficient. On one hand, it protected older people from possibly being driven from their homes. On the other, it reduced the turnover of properties, making it harder for young couples to find a nest of their own. On one hand, the proposition's opponents say it has shrunk the share of property-tax collections paid by businesses, and shifted the burden to homeowners. On the other, California's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office said in a report last month that, while the homeowners' share is "slightly larger" than it used to be, factors other than Proposition 13 were the reason.
Since 1978, California has become somewhat proposition-happy. So have other states that turn to the voters on matters that once may have been left to legislators. In California, the November ballot will ask for ayes or nays on proposals to ban the sale and possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, to impose price controls on state drug purchases, to uphold a ban on plastic grocery bags, and to end capital punishment or -- in a separate initiative -- to quicken the death penalty process.
What Californians (and others) have also learned is that you get what you pay for. People want their roads repaired, streetlights installed and schools kept open. All of them cost money. And that means taxes. San Jose, Calif., is an example of how a decline in property tax collections can pinch badly, as a February article in The Atlantic showed. Because the city lacks a thriving commercial district, it is hard-pressed to generate sales tax revenue.
Four years ago in, yes, another ballot initiative, Californians recognized the need for a steadier flow of state revenue. They approved a slight increase in the sales tax, and raised income tax rates on individuals earning $250,000 or more each year. The sales-tax increase is about to expire, but a proposal to extend the higher income tax rate is up for a vote in November.
Not surprisingly, an advocacy group called the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association opposes the extension. Also not surprisingly, one does not hear many references to Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the eminent Supreme Court justice, who observed decades ago that "taxes are what we pay for civilized society."

Full text:   Dividend-paying stocks have had a terrific run for the last five years and already have double-digit gains in the first three quarters of 2016.
But as money has been moving out of bonds and into these equities in search of income -- dividend stocks are yielding 2.5 percent, nearly a point higher than 10-year Treasury notes -- investors find themselves in a quandary.
For one thing, traditional high-yielding areas of the market are trading at frothier levels than in recent memory.
The price-to-earnings ratio for utility shares in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for example, is now 17, based on projected profits over the next 12 months. That represents a 20 percent premium to the sector's historical average.
"The parts of the dividend market that feel most at risk are stocks that are perceived to be more stable and bondlike, like regulated utilities and consumer staples stocks," said Ben Kirby, a manager of the Thornburg Investment Income Builder Fund.
Mr. Kirby said his fund, which beat more than 70 percent of its peers in the third quarter and more than 90 percent in the last decade, has been reducing its exposure to these areas this year.
At the same time, an alternative approach known as dividend growth -- which focuses not on high yielders, but on modest payers that are likely to increase their dividends consistently over time -- is also running into problems.
The earnings growth rate among companies in the S.&P. 500 has been declining for five consecutive quarters, according to Standard & Poor's Global Market Intelligence, and dividends represent that portion of profits that is returned to shareholders.
"It's hard to believe that there's a lot of room for dividends to grow in the absence of earnings growth," said Floyd Tyler, president and chief investment officer at the asset management firm Preserver Partners. "That's a real headwind."
Moreover, corporations have just been through an extended stretch in which dividends have grown much faster than their historical average.
Josh Peters, senior portfolio manager for Morningstar Investment Management, pointed out that over the last 12 years, the growth rate for dividends on an inflation-adjusted basis has been 5.9 percent. That is significantly faster than the historical real dividend growth rate of about 2 percent for stocks in the S.&P. 500.
Payout ratios -- which measure the percentage of a company's earnings being used for dividends -- have been rising. This combination of slowing earnings growth and rising payout ratios is why Mr. Peters said "the golden age of dividend growth is over."
This leaves investors with few options.
Melda Mergen, head of North American equities for Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said it makes sense to "be as diversified as possible." She added, "You have to try to balance the growers with the current payers."
That involves embracing economic sectors that have not historically been associated with dividends.
Take technology. Though the sector has a below-average current yield of 1.6 percent, tech companies are now the second-largest contributor to S.&P. 500 dividends, behind the financial sector, based on total dollars returned to shareholders.
"There are pockets of tech with good cash flow and strong balance sheets," Ms. Mergen said. "And companies are starting to hear more shareholder demand to have more profits returned through dividends."
The key, she said, is to look at high-quality companies with strong balance sheets and reliable earnings that -- in the event of an economic downturn -- will be likely to maintain payouts.
Mr. Kirby also prefers high-quality companies, but he notes that these stocks have been in big demand in recent years. So to find quality businesses that trade at decent prices, investors must be willing to consider economically cyclical companies, which may not be popular with dividend investors this late in the economic recovery.
Take the CME Group, which runs several financial exchanges in the United States, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.
"This is a high-quality business with high market share in each of the contracts it trades, so there's pricing power," Mr. Kirby said. "And what's interesting about the stock is that it's a bit countercyclical." He pointed out that volatility and fear were usually detrimental to financial businesses. But "whenever investor concerns rise, they hedge that risk with futures and options contracts, so CME's trading volume can increase in those times," he said.
In addition to the stock's 2.2 percent dividend yield, the company often issues a special dividend at year-end, which sometimes can effectively double the yield, he said.
John D. Linehan, manager of the T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund, said, "In order to be a value-conscious dividend investor, you have to make some sacrifice today, whether that means compromising on valuations, stability of earnings, or the regions where you invest."
When Mr. Linehan took over management of the fund nearly a year ago, he began broadening the universe of potential holdings. "There can be more attractive opportunities outside the United States without sacrificing on quality," he said, noting that foreign stocks now make up about 7 percent of the fund's assets.
As an example, "we were having problems finding opportunities in consumer staples companies in the U.S. where valuations look stretched," he said. Yet overseas, he found cheaper stocks like Diageo, the London-based multinational maker of spirits such as Guinness and Johnnie Walker.
Robert Hordon, a manager of the First Eagle Global Income Builder Fund, said he had similar experiences with real estate stocks. In the United States, real estate stocks have shot up since March 2009, raising questions about the sector's valuations.
"That being said, we are owners of real estate securities outside the U.S., in Asia, where high-quality real estate stocks are trading at more reasonable valuations," he said. One example, he said, is Mandarin Oriental International, which is based in Hong Kong and owns and operates hotels and residences there, elsewhere in Asia and in other parts of the world.
Mr. Hordon added that the United States market "is a relatively low-yielding stock market anyway."
What is more, American stocks have outperformed foreign shares for several years, a traditional sign to value-minded investors that better opportunities may exist elsewhere.

Full text:   The Federal Reserve still hasn't raised interest rates, though it insists that an increase is just around the corner. An even bigger decision that cannot be put off -- it will be made by American voters on Nov. 8 -- is stirring concern all over the world.
Stock prices have for the most part risen, all the same. Even with the prospect of higher interest rates, the imminent presidential election and heightened uncertainty in Europe, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.3 percent in the third quarter, to 2,168.27.
How much longer the Fed's easy monetary policy will continue to placate Wall Street is anyone's guess. But with little evidence that keeping interest rates just above zero at this stage appreciably bolsters the economy and businesses -- and with stocks and bonds already expensive -- the best guess of some advisers is that the strategy may not help investors much longer.
The Fed may be at risk of inflating a bubble, but portfolio managers have preferred, though reluctantly in some cases, to be inside it rather than outside. But with returns from loose monetary policy diminishing in the economy and in stocks -- the market isn't much higher now than it was in the spring of 2015 -- some investors are becoming concerned.
"I think we are reaching the limits of how much central banks can stimulate the market," said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an investment consulting firm. "The equity market has kept going on liquidity, not fundamentals. Now we're reaching the stage where liquidity is not helping as much anymore."
Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, agreed that the days of maintaining faith in the Fed were numbered, although he offered a wide range for what that number is.
"Over the next three to six to 12 months, I'm pretty confident that this game of central bank support will continue" to prop up stocks, he said. "Over the longer term, things are far more uncertain and highly dependent on how things play out in the real economy."
Others contend that there is plenty of uncertainty for stocks in the short term, too, as the political outlook makes the course of the economy harder to gauge.
"Nobody has a really good sense, fundamentally, where this market should be going over the next couple of quarters," said Scott Klimo, co-manager of the Sextant International Fund. Beyond the question of whether the Fed will raise rates in December, he said, "there is the possibility of right-wing nativist governments taking over in Europe, and who knows what's going to happen in the United States."
The reality of how different this presidential election is from the typical one is finally setting in, Mr. Klimo said.
"We've always had a sense that, 'I want this guy to win, but if the other guy wins, it won't be a disaster,"' he said. "That's not true now."
The prospect of "nationalism and protectionism" should Donald J. Trump win the presidency is a concern for Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management at Northern Trust.
The outlook for trade is already fragile without any change in American policy. In late September, the World Trade Organization lowered its forecast for 2016 global trade growth to 1.7 percent from 2.8 percent in April. The body attributed the revised forecast to a "dramatic slowing of trade growth" early this year.
The presidential election and the Fed meeting the next month are reasons Ms. Nixon is "not going to be interested in making bold moves" in the markets now, she said, even as she acknowledged that the Fed was also unlikely to make any bold moves.
"The Fed delivered exactly what we thought they would -- nothing much," she said about the September meeting. "Our base case is they won't move in December, either.
"There's always a reason" for the inaction, she added. "Every time the Fed seems ready to do something, there's some sort of macro surprise; the economy has not cooperated."
Despite her misgivings, Ms. Nixon continues to favor stocks over traditionally safer instruments like Treasury bonds.
"We are still very positively inclined toward risk assets," she said. "We think rates are going to stay low, and the calendar is very much our friend now."
She was referring to the trough in corporate profits that occurred late last year; once a year has passed, comparisons will become more favorable.
Yet Mr. Sri-Kumar warned that the outlook may not be so rosy after more pages are turned on the calendar. The markets may breathe a sigh of relief if Hillary Clinton is elected next month, he said, but they may hold their breath again next summer when it comes time for the president, whoever it is, to decide whether to renominate Janet L. Yellen to continue running the Fed when her term as chairwoman expires in early 2018.
Another matter for investors to confront is how, and how easily, Britain will extricate itself from the European Union, he added.
The mechanism for carrying out "Brexit" is for Britain to invoke Article 50 of the union's Lisbon Treaty. That begins the negotiation of the terms of separation and the relationship between the country and the union afterward. That must be completed within two years after Article 50 is invoked, which Prime Minister Theresa May said this month would occur in March.
As worrisome as these issues are, many investors heavily exposed to stocks rationalize the high valuations by pointing out that other investments are even more expensive.
"The challenge with all of this is the value of financial assets is not absolute," Mr. Memani said. With bond yields so low, he said, "equities are going up because they offer more value."
But it would be imprudent, in his opinion, to avoid Treasuries and other historically safer bonds altogether, no matter how low interest rates are and how much the Fed supports stock prices.
"Normally, at these rate levels, you wouldn't make any fixed-income allocations," he said. "But with so much uncertainty, high-grade bonds have a significant place in a portfolio as ballast against a potential downturn" in stocks.
Funds that own both major asset classes did well in the third quarter. The average domestic equity fund tracked by Morningstar gained 4.6 percent. International stock funds did better, up 5.7 percent, led by a 7.8 percent rise in portfolios that focus on emerging markets, which had underperformed for years.
The average taxable bond fund was up 2 percent in the third quarter. Specialists in high-yield instruments did especially well, rising 4.7 percent, as did emerging markets, up 4.2 percent.
Funds of all sorts did well in the quarter, but actively managed stock mutual funds remained a tough sell. Investors sold a net $112.8 billion of them in the period, according to Morningstar, and put a net $61.2 billion into the market through exchange-traded funds. SPDR S.&P. 500, a large, actively traded E.T.F. that tracks the benchmark index, returned 3.8 percent during the quarter, trailing the 4.4 percent return of the average mutual fund that specializes in large domestic stocks.
Bond investors poured $52.2 billion into actively managed mutual funds and $28.9 billion into E.T.F.s, which are mostly passively managed vehicles that try to match the returns of an index.
Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income at BlackRock, expects rates to rise modestly.
"They're not going to move up that much," Mr. Rieder predicted, "because so many people in an aging population need income." Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions; high demand for bonds would tend to keep yields relatively low.
But with monetary policy likely to remain looser for longer, he anticipates inflation picking up. Based on that forecast, he recommends Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, which offer the creditworthiness of other Treasury bonds but feature rates that move in line with inflation.
TIPS are "one of the most mispriced assets in the market today," Mr. Rieder said. "More and more people are going to buy inflation."
Other instruments he favors, with prices that are relatively immune to rising interest rates, include short- to medium-term emerging market debt and mortgage securities from nongovernmental issuers.
Mr. Sri-Kumar does not view rising rates as a threat. His advice is to "stay very defensive" by making a liberal allocation to Treasury bonds and keeping as much as 30 percent of a portfolio in cash.
As for stocks, he encouraged investors to stick with areas like health care and utilities and to emphasize the United States over foreign markets.
Staying close to home is a common theme, especially when contemplating the near future.
"From a short-term horizon, we're very overweight U.S. assets," Ms. Nixon said, because what economic growth there is in the world seems to be concentrated in the United States.
Looking further ahead, Ms. Nixon recommends more diversification abroad, particularly in emerging markets.
Mr. Memani combined those ideas.
"The best stocks to own for a five-year run are U.S. domestic stocks and emerging markets," he said. Referring to the sluggish economic conditions, he added: "If we come out of this mess, emerging markets will have to take more of a role in global growth. Valuations there are not cheap, but they're better than in developed markets."
He warned investors who need income that "you'll have to take risks" because interest rates are so low. Among the more prudent risks, in his view, are dividend-paying stocks, municipal bonds and master limited partnerships, which are exchange-traded vehicles that typically invest in energy infrastructure like pipelines.
Mr. Klimo, like Mr. Sri-Kumar, favors health care stocks. "For pure demographic reasons, I think they will remain attractive for a long time," he said.
Funds that concentrate on health care stocks rose 5.5 percent in the third quarter, the best sector performance after the gains of 12.9 percent for technology and 7.1 percent for financial services.
Among foreign stock markets, Mr. Klimo prefers those in Southeast Asia.
One area in which he said he was "far, far underweight" is financial services. Alluding to serious difficulties at big banks like Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank, he said, "We have no idea what's going on inside these companies."
The end of exceedingly loose Fed policy has been coming for so long that it should be no surprise when it arrives. Even so, it could shock investors when it happens, and even if it doesn't for the foreseeable future.
"We've just kept the drug going," Mr. Sri-Kumar said. "It's quite comforting; we don't want to wean ourselves off it. But eventually we'll have an overdose that no one can do anything about."

Abstract: [...]recently, bond and stock prices have generally moved in opposite directions when stocks falter. "Diversification still works, but the way to think about it is that the cost of diversification has gone up," says Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. Because bonds don't have much room to rally at current price and yield levels, they may merely hold steady, or potentially lose a little when stocks falter.

Full text:   It has been easy for stock investors to love bonds as they have generated handsome returns while providing protection when the stock market falls.
Until recently, bond and stock prices have generally moved in opposite directions when stocks falter. But something different happened in September, and it could render bonds a weaker tool for portfolio diversification.
On Sept. 9, when the stock market fell 2.45 percent in a single day, the bond market did not follow its traditional script. Instead of rallying, the average core bond portfolio tracked by Morningstar dipped 0.34 percent that day. The one-day loss for many funds, including Vanguard Total Bond Market, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond, Pimco Total Return and Metropolitan West Total Return, while less than a half a percentage point, still amounted to more than 10 percent of their current yield.
In itself, a loss like that isn't going to upend anyone's retirement plan, but it doesn't merely portend declining long-term returns for bonds: It could also reduce the buffering effect of bonds in a portfolio that contains stocks.
Jeffrey Knight, co-head of Global Asset Allocation at Columbia Threadneedle, says that problem is likely to continue in the future. In his view, what happened on Sept. 9 is "exhibit A" for what he expects to play out when central banks start to tap the brakes on their aggressive policies to stimulate economic growth.
"Both stock and bond values have been driven up by monetary policy, and as we approach an inflection point where that policy changes, they both have the same reason to sell off," Mr. Knight said.
We may indeed be closer to that inflection point. While the Federal Reserve chose to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at its September meeting, the latest odds put a very high probability on a December increase. In the meantime, the yield of the 10-year Treasury rate has quietly inched up from below 1.4 percent in early July to 1.7 percent. That is still well below the 2.25 percent at the beginning of the year, but it signals that a shift may be underway.
James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, is mindful that previous rate increases in the bond market have quickly reversed themselves, but he says that this time may really be different. Without the Federal Reserve's intervention, Mr. Paulsen says, the 10-year Treasury yield would be in the vicinity of 4 percent based on current levels of economic growth, core inflation and wage growth. "I am not suggesting we are headed there this year," he said. "But if this recovery persists, and the Fed takes its peg off, I would not be at all surprised to see us around 4 percent before the next recession."
If that were to play out, rising yields would mean bond prices would fall. Total return is the sum of yield and changes in bond prices. Today's razor-thin yields of around 2 percent for quality bond funds suggest that initial total returns will probably be negative, though over time patient investors will benefit from the reinvestment of higher yields.
The challenge is to anticipate today how you might react to a less rosy performance for bonds -- which have returned 4 percent annualized over the last 15 years -- and make any necessary portfolio tweaks. "Diversification still works, but the way to think about it is that the cost of diversification has gone up," says Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. Because bonds don't have much room to rally at current price and yield levels, they may merely hold steady, or potentially lose a little when stocks falter.
The implications are worth considering. It could mean slightly larger bear market losses for diversified stock and bond portfolios. In 2008, for example, when United States stocks fell 37 percent, high-quality core bonds rallied more than 5 percent. An investor with a standard, index-based portfolio containing 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds lost about 20 percent that year. But bonds rallied while stocks fell. If bonds hadn't risen in value but instead had lost 2 percent, the portfolio would have lost 23 percent.
While not cheery news, that's not an end-of-days prospect. Core bond funds that invest in high-quality United States securities may not produce world-beating returns, but they are not likely to lose much, either. One important aspect of core bond funds -- their relatively short 5.5-year average duration -- should prevent big losses. Duration is a measure of a bond portfolio's sensitivity to changing interest rates. A one percentage point rise in a portfolio's yield typically causes the price to fall in line with its duration. That translates to a 5.5 percent price decline for a core bond fund with a 5.5-year duration if rates were to rise one percentage point.
In the spirit of hypothetical stress testing, Vanguard crunched the numbers for what would be a highly unlikely event: an abrupt three percentage point increase in the yield of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate index from its current very low 1.95 percent. The index has a current duration of 5.5 years. That increase would produce a return of negative 13.1 percent in the first year. If rates stabilized after that move, the cumulative loss by the end of the second year would be 8.75 percent. Returns would be back above break even in Year 4 thanks to the reinvestment of the much higher yield.
How bad would that be? It depends on your perspective. "In a horrible, truly worst-case scenario, a high-quality bond index fund is still less risky over the course of a year than stocks are in one day," says the investment adviser Allan Roth, founder of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, alluding to the 20 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on Oct. 19, 1987.
A well-honed actively managed bond fund might mitigate a portfolio's sensitivity to rising rates.
For example, right now bond index funds that closely mirror the Barclays U.S. Aggregate index are loaded with Treasury and government agency bonds. Those are what you want when markets falter, but they have extremely low yields today and typically are very sensitive to rising rates. By comparison, the Baird Core Plus Bond has the freedom to decide on its bond mix.
"Trying to hit a lot of singles, and not swing for home runs" as the fund's co-manager, Mary Ellen Stanek, describes the strategy, has delivered index-beating performance since the fund's 2000 inception. The fund also ranks in the top quartile of its peers over the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods. Currently, the fund's Treasury stake is much lower than what is stuffed in its benchmark index, and it owns a lot more American corporate bonds. On average, high-quality corporate bonds currently have yields that are at least one percentage point higher than Treasury bonds. "We think we're in the seventh inning for corporate bonds. The fundamentals look pretty good," says Warren Pierson, also a co-manager.
Another option, and a conservative one, is to move some of your money out of bonds and into cash. Even investment strategists -- a tribe always at the ready with the best relative values in stocks and bonds -- acknowledge the "optionality" value of cash these days, which is an obtuse way of saying it makes sense to have some money on the sidelines ready to get back in the game after sell-offs. "The opportunity cost in the short run is low," says Mr. Turnill, the BlackRock strategist.
Mr. Roth, the Wealth Logic founder, has made five-year certificates of deposit the centerpiece of his clients' fixed-income portfolios. For example, the current 1.75 percent yield offered on deposits of at least $25,000 by Ally Bank is nearly on par with the 1.95 percent yield of the Barclays Aggregate bond index. Even in the event of paying the penalty for an early withdrawal, the effective yield would be more than 1 percent. "We have no principal risk, and our money is 100 percent government guaranteed," says Mr. Roth. (If you're looking to remove some rate risk from your 401(k) portfolio, check if there is a so-called stable value fund in your plan; the average current yield is 1.8 percent, according to Hueler Analytics.)
Of course, cash is a market timing call, and market timing is not easy to do properly. What's more, cash or liquid investments like money market funds or short-term CDs aren't likely to keep pace with inflation in the long run. But if you become deeply worried about bonds and stocks, cash is not the worst place to wait out a shifting market.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. LONDON -- Once upon a time, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, there was a royal yacht, upon which Her Majesty the Queen, Elizabeth II, who also reigns over Canada, Australia and New Zealand and heads the Commonwealth, would sail upon the waters.
The royal yacht, Britannia, 412 feet long and 139 feet tall, was launched in 1953 and traveled more than a million nautical miles.
Alas, the yacht proved rather expensive to maintain, and while the Conservative Party had promised to replace Britannia, the Labour Party won the 1997 general election and decommissioned it, in a ceremony that led the queen to shed public tears.
The yacht remains, in its glory, a tourist attraction in Edinburgh, where in a more commercial age it is also available to rent for private dinners and social events.
But with Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union, a decision known as Brexit, there is a strong move in the Conservative Party to bring back the glory of empire -- and the royal yacht.
"I think we have to ask ourselves what sort of Britain we want to live in and what we can do," Jake Berry, a lawmaker, said Tuesday in Parliament, "to make Britain great again." His answer? "If Brexit is going to mean successful Brexit, it should also mean the return of our royal yacht!"
The Conservative benches loudly murmured their approval, and about 100 Tory lawmakers supported the motion -- roughly the same number who fiercely backed Brexit before the referendum, giving former Prime Minister David Cameron fits.
Many of them have dreams of a wholly sovereign Britain with all the old symbols of this island nation's empire, when "Britannia ruled the waves" -- the royal yacht, the old dark blue British passport, the supreme power of Parliament. And even though the Brexit supporters won, they remain combative, suspicious that Mr. Cameron's successor, Theresa May, who quietly opposed Brexit, will somehow betray them. And they have no intention of giving up in their desire for a clear break with Brussels.
With the same small majority in Parliament, Mrs. May is thus as vulnerable to intraparty parliamentary pressure as Mr. Cameron was. If the vote was meant to "reclaim" full British and parliamentary sovereignty from those supposedly faceless Brussels bureaucrats, then, these same lawmakers argue, Mrs. May should consult them on every aspect of Britain's negotiating position with the European Union.
That she is refusing to do, even as the pound has dropped considerably amid the uncertainty about Britain's economic future. Mrs. May has said she will invoke Article 50, signaling Britain's formal notice of withdrawal from the European Union, by the end of March, beginning a two-year negotiation with the other 27 member states. But many in her own party want Parliament to approve even that decision, not just the government's negotiating stance.
"I and many others did not exercise our vote in the referendum so as to restore the sovereignty of this Parliament only to see what we regarded as the tyranny of the European Union replaced by that of a government," said Stephen Phillips, a Conservative.
But Mrs. May insists that to have successful negotiations, she must maintain a kind of radio silence and not provide "running commentary" on the talks. For that reason, she says, she will not ask Parliament to vote on invoking Article 50, and the High Court held hearings on Thursday in a lawsuit testing the constitutionality of her position. Of course, she will have to secure Parliament's approval for any final deal.
Mrs. May did agree, in what was widely labeled a concession, to let Tories vote for a debate on Brexit called for by the opposition Labour Party, while emphasizing that Parliament should not "undermine the negotiating position of the government."
Whatever that turns out to be.
At the moment, there is no plan, just a set of arguments and political positioning. And there is little reference yet to the views and interests of the Europe outside Britain, with which Britain will finally have to negotiate, once it finishes negotiating with itself.
Along with a 17 percent drop in the pound against the dollar since the June vote, inflation is beginning to rise and banks are talking openly about moving their headquarters out of London to remain in the European Union. In this atmosphere of anxiety among business leaders and foreign exchanges, Mrs. May's silence on substance disguises another of her problems: fierce divisions within her own government about what negotiating position to take.
Despite her quiet opposition to Brexit, she publicly endorsed the referendum and put three prominent Brexit supporters in charge of crucial ministries. For the most part, like their parliamentary supporters, they are pressing for a "hard Brexit," a clean break with the European Union that would end unlimited migration from Europe to Britain and give up membership in the single market or even a customs union with the rest of the bloc.
But other ministers, including Philip Hammond, the powerful chancellor of the Exchequer, are eager to preserve Britain as an area of free trade and protect the services sector of the economy, which represents about 80 percent of Britain's gross domestic product.
Financial services alone -- dominated by the City of London, the capital's financial district -- represent 10 percent of G.D.P. and a large share of government tax receipts, and already some large banks and investment houses are discussing alternatives to London to preserve their access to the European Union.
Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin are not-so-quietly jostling for what many believe will be a sustained slow bleed from London, but well-paid bankers are wary of France's high taxes and consider the night life of Dublin and Frankfurt far too dull. Some think New York will be the ultimate beneficiary.
And while some favoring Brexit suggest that German carmakers, for instance, will seek duty-free status for Britain in any future deal, Britain is largely postindustrial, with trade in goods representing only about 20 percent of the economy.
But to maintain some access to the single market would almost surely mean continuing to pay into the budget of the European Union and probably accepting a high degree of free movement of European citizens, which Brexit supporters would regard as betrayal.
Mrs. May herself has said very little, other than that Britain must limit migration and strive for "the maximum possible access to the European market for firms to trade with and operate within," which is more aspirational than substantive.
So the battle inside the government must be resolved before Britain can begin what will be unequal negotiations with the European Union, which is waiting for a British position before responding. The leaders of France and Germany have made it clear that Britain will not emerge with a better deal after voting to leave the union.
Speaking in Paris last week, President François Hollande of France insisted: "There must be a threat, there must be a risk, there must be a price. Otherwise we will be in a negotiation that cannot end well."
Trying to calm financial markets, Mrs. May's aides say the prime minister has not ruled out anything.
Janan Ganesh, a columnist for The Financial Times, summed up the situation on Twitter: "There's no plan. Each panic-inducing remark gets toned down. May as well ask your cat."
Correction: November 11, 2016, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Memo From Britain article on Oct. 14, about efforts by British conservatives to force Prime Minister Theresa May to consult them about every aspect of Britain's departure from the European Union, misstated, in some editions, the month that Britons voted on exiting the bloc. It was June, not July.

Abstract: On Tuesday, John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser, and Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, announced that NASA would also allow private companies to hitch their own modules to the International Space Station. In 1989, on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, President George Bush announced an initiative to send astronauts back to the moon and then onward to Mars.

Full text:   In an essay published Tuesday on CNN's website, President Obama renewed his call for American astronauts to visit Mars.
"We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time," he wrote.
The plan is not new: The president laid out the same goal in 2010 during a speech at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
But the column on Tuesday, along with a joint blog post by senior White House and NASA officials, offered new details on how the United States expected to reach the red planet.
In August, NASA awarded contracts to six companies to develop habitats that could eventually sustain astronauts on deep-space missions like Mars. On Tuesday, John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser, and Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, announced that NASA would also allow private companies to hitch their own modules to the International Space Station.
In the next decade, the officials added, work aboard the space station will move into a stage in which new technologies will be tested in the stretch of space between Earth and the moon.
Still, plenty of challenges remain. Here are some answers to the most pressing questions.
Is travel to Mars even possible?
Yes. For decades, a human mission to Mars has been regarded as difficult but doable, given enough time and money and a willingness to subject astronauts to risks like radiation during the long journey.
Then why aren't we there already?
In his article, President Obama quoted John Noble Wilford, the New York Times reporter who covered the Apollo moon landings in the 1960s and '70s. Mars tugs at the imagination "with a force mightier than gravity," Mr. Wilford wrote.
Wernher von Braun, the mastermind of Apollo, sketched out plans for reaching Mars, too. Back then, many people thought the journey would move from the moon to Mars in a decade or two.
But President Richard M. Nixon pared back NASA's grand ambitions, leaving just the space shuttle. Astronauts have not ventured beyond low-Earth orbit since 1972, when the crew of Apollo 17 returned home after a 12-day trip to the moon.
In 1989, on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, President George Bush announced an initiative to send astronauts back to the moon and then onward to Mars. When NASA came back with a plan that was rumored to cost half a trillion dollars over two to three decades, the initiative faded.
The main challenge is not technical; it is political and financial. If Congress was to provide steady funding for the next 20 years, NASA could probably finish the task. But changes in presidential administrations have generally led to re-examination and changes in NASA's marching orders.
Unlike the flush years at the height of the Apollo program, peaking at 4.4 percent of the federal budget in 1966, NASA's budget today is steady and comparatively small: The $19.3 billion for the space agency this year amounts to about 0.5 percent of federal spending.
Won't SpaceX get there sooner?
At the International Astronautical Congress last month in Guadalajara, Mexico, Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, announced his architecture for a giant rocket and spaceship -- what he called the Interplanetary Transport System -- that would take colonists to Mars, 100 at a time. The trips could begin as soon as 2024, he said.
Mr. Musk was confident, but that was a highly optimistic timeline. His smaller, workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9, has had two catastrophic failures in the past two years. A larger rocket under development, the Falcon Heavy, is years behind schedule.
SpaceX still has to prove new technologies, like the ability to land big spacecraft on Mars. And Mr. Musk was vague about how his company would pay for all this. SpaceX is still fairly small in size and profits, and Mr. Musk conceded that he would need to rely on "a huge public-private partnerships."
Has NASA been preparing for a trip to Mars?
Yes, but the pace has been slow. NASA has never received a large infusion of money to pursue a trip to Mars. And while the destination has not changed, the details certainly have.
For the last couple years, NASA news releases, web pages and social media postings have been festooned with the #JourneyToMars hashtag, tying a multitude of projects to the long-term goal of sending astronauts to Mars.
In 2010, the Obama administration scuttled the rockets and crew capsule that were to have been part of the canceled Constellation program in favor of developing better technologies for space travel.
Members of Congress objected, particularly those from Texas and Florida, home to big NASA facilities.
The Orion crew capsule from the Constellation program was revived, and Congress instructed NASA to start work on the Space Launch System, a heavy-lift rocket similar to the one that would have been built for the moon.
The first launch of the Space Launch System, without a crew, is scheduled for late 2018. The second launch, with astronauts, would be at least three years later.
The space agency is only now filling in details of what it would like to do on subsequent deep-space missions between Earth and the moon, which it calls "the proving ground."
When might the work begin in earnest?
Operating the International Space Station costs NASA $3 billion to $4 billion a year. Ditching the station -- which NASA plans to do in 2024 -- would free up money to build the other big pieces for a human Mars mission.
Last year, a team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory presented a proposal on how the agency could get to Mars in the early 2030s with its existing budget, along with increases to keep pace with inflation.
It would not be enough for the astronauts to land on Mars, as a lander would be too expensive.
This year, engineers at Lockheed Martin, building upon the pieces that NASA is developing, offered a proposal to send a spacecraft into orbit around Mars by 2028. NASA officials are not yet convinced.
At the International Astronautical Congress meeting, William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said he expected NASA astronauts in orbit around Mars in the 2030s.
But a landing will not occur until the 2040s, he said.

Forcing Europe to Rethink Its Painful Embrace of Austerity

Abstract: In the United States, the Obama administration responded to the Great Recession with a $787 billion fiscal stimulus bill -- a mixture of tax cuts and increased government spending. In Washington, bickering over the size and duration of many social programs -- emergency unemployment benefits, food stamps and housing supports -- effectively curtailed the scope of these efforts.

Full text:   LONDON -- As Europe has grappled with the trauma of a devastating financial and economic crisis, policy makers have consistently relied on one approach to managing the damage -- budget austerity.
Shrink government spending by trimming pensions and cutting social programs, the logic runs, and the markets will gain confidence in the tough-minded people in charge. Confident markets make for happy markets. Money will pour in, and good times will roll.
Even as prosperity has remained painfully elusive across much of Europe, leaders have time and again renewed their faith in the virtues of this harsh medicine.
Until now.
Some policy makers are flashing tentative signs that they may be prepared to slacken their grip on public coffers to spur growth and improve the lot of ordinary people suffering joblessness and diminished wealth. In the clearest sign of this shift, the heavily indebted Italy is increasingly inclined to challenge Germany -- the guardian of austerity -- to loosen European purse strings.
The development comes after Britain's stunning vote to abandon the European Union, an angry rebuke of the economic elite within struggling communities, and as populist, anti-immigrant movements across the Continent gain traction.
Above all, the change could be an antidote to years of dogmatic European policies, replacing a failed effort to generate economic growth through cutting spending with a focus on bolstering investment.
"Austerity is out of the discussion in a way," said the Italian finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, during a recent interview in Rome. "We need to bring more growth and more jobs to Europe."
The most obvious place the new dynamic is unfolding is in Britain.
Before the June 23 vote for "Brexit," the man in charge of the budget, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, was publicly pursuing the aim of delivering a budget surplus by 2020. The target required cuts.
But as the political class absorbed the ballot result, interpreting it as a demand for redress from communities reeling from high unemployment and wage stagnation, Mr. Osborne acknowledged that his goal could no longer be achieved.
His successor, Philip Hammond, has raised the ante.
In a speech at an annual gathering of the governing Conservative Party on Monday, the new chancellor declared that the government would borrow more to finance new infrastructure projects -- presumably creating construction and manufacturing jobs.
Budget cutting has given way to fresh spending in large part because of fears of the economic consequences of Britain's potentially tortuous European divorce proceedings. Investment is expected to slow, reflecting grave uncertainty. British exports could be threatened. High-paying finance jobs could shift from Britain to other countries in Europe.
But any fair conversation about austerity must reckon with a complex reality: There are great divergences between the rhetoric of policy-making and the actual spending of money.
In Britain, Mr. Osborne presented himself as a courageous guardian of the treasury, intent on making cuts to balance the books. At the same time, he ran budget deficits that were proportionately larger than those in France, where a Socialist government, supposedly intent on handing out loot unencumbered by arithmetic, was in power.
In the United States, the Obama administration responded to the Great Recession with a $787 billion fiscal stimulus bill -- a mixture of tax cuts and increased government spending. Its economy proceeded to recover more vigorously than Europe's, giving rise to the notion that stimulus was at work on the American side of the Atlantic, while austerity prevailed across the water.
That story, however, is overly simplistic.
In Washington, bickering over the size and duration of many social programs -- emergency unemployment benefits, food stamps and housing supports -- effectively curtailed the scope of these efforts. In Europe, a vastly more generous social safety net limited the impacts of joblessness.
Any alteration to European economic policy inevitably involves Germany. The region's largest economy, it wields outsize influence over the levers of economic policy.
The European Union maintains rules limiting budget deficits and public debt burdens. Countries that exceed the limits are subject to negotiations over the consequences.
To Germany, those rules are immutable (unless Germany is the one asking for some slack). The German economic view, analysts say, is dominated by moralistic judgments and a grave fear of inflation. Deficits reflect weakness of will and undermine the value of money. Prosperity comes from discipline and sacrifice.
German voters have expressed alarm at any possibility that their abundant savings might be used to rescue reckless borrowers on the Mediterranean. This trait has been most on display as Germany has demanded sharp cuts in government spending as a condition for successive bailouts of Greece by European authorities. But it has similarly colored German demands for strict adherence to the limits on deficit spending by Spain, Portugal and other crisis-assailed European nations. (And never mind, critics charge, that most troubled European economies landed there not because of too much public spending, but because of disastrous private borrowing -- often extended by German banks.)
Germany, economists say, is effectively combating a phantom: The real threat is not inflation, but the opposite -- deflation, or falling prices. When prices are dropping, that means demand for goods and services is weak, and that reduces the incentive for businesses to expand and hire.
Faced with such a downward spiral, the traditional economic playbook calls for government to step in and spend money, even if that entails running deficits. Construction projects, for example, put cash into the pockets of construction workers, who then spread their wages through the economy.
Spain and Portugal experienced veritable depressions during the worst of the crisis. Both have been eager for relief from the strictures of these spending caps. Both are running budget deficits well above the limit -- 3 percent of gross domestic product. Yet in July, European authorities chose not to fine either country, instead giving them additional time to bring their deficits under the cap.
"On the merits, Spain, Italy and France should be ganging up on the Germans and outvoting them and strong-arming them," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England, and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "For whatever reason, they don't get there, and I genuinely don't understand it."
Italy is now making a run at it.
Last month, its prime minister, Matteo Renzi, accused Germany of putting European interests at risk by refusing to allow more government spending.
"Stressing austerity means destroying Europe," Mr. Renzi declared at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. "Which is the only country which receives an advantage from this strategy? The one which exports the most: Germany."
In a series of recent interviews in Rome, top Italian officials outlined intentions to liberate Europe from austerity.
"If you want to close this divide and you want to persuade your citizens that there is opportunity in the internationalization of the economy and innovation, you need to invest a lot," said the Italian minister of economic development, Carlo Calenda. "The question is whether you do it within the European rule or whether you break the European rule. What we are trying to do is to stay within the European rule."
But not forever, Mr. Calenda added. Greece confronted Germany loudly and directly as it submitted to wrenching cuts as a condition of the bailouts. Italy is mounting a quieter challenge, operating within the rules while finding favorable interpretations that allow greater spending.
"We do think there is space to maneuver in order to change the European rule," he said. "If we will be in a situation where we need to act in a stronger way, especially on fiscal space, then we will take that into consideration."

Full text:   Amid a presidential campaign marked by fears about the country's economic future, the American jobs machine keeps chugging.
Employers added 156,000 positions in September, the Labor Department said on Friday, enough to accommodate new entrants to the labor force and entice back workers who dropped out after the Great Recession. The unemployment rate, which had been stuck at 4.9 percent since spring, ticked up slightly to 5 percent, but that was mostly because more people were drawn into the labor force by evidence that hiring is still going strong.
For all the anxiety at home and turmoil abroad, like the vote in Britain to withdraw from the European Union, the current expansion shows little prospect of ending abruptly.
Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2 percentage point last month, bringing the wage gain over the last 12 months to 2.6 percent, well above the pace of inflation. The typical workweek also grew slightly in September, after a pullback in August.
"It was solid, not spectacular," said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. "The good news is that participation went up, even though the unemployment rate did, too. Regaining that ground is very important."
Before the report was released, economists on Wall Street looked for the economy to add 172,000 jobs in September. Revisions for July and August showed that 7,000 fewer jobs were created in those months than the Labor Department first estimated.
Given the latest figures, the Federal Reserve is still expected to delay raising interest rates until late this year, and there was little in the report to suggest that the job gains might lead to significantly higher inflation.
"There are still plenty of unemployed people out there, enough for employers to continue to hire at a substantial pace," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.
"The expansion will end before you run out of labor," added Mr. Gapen, who estimates that the unemployment rate could drop to 4 percent by the end of 2017. The overall participation rate inched up to 62.9 percent, above the low point of 62.4 percent last September, but well below the most recent peak of 66.4 percent in early 2007.
With many prime-age workers still available to be hired -- what economists and policy makers at the Federal Reserve blandly term "labor market slack" -- the current pace of hiring should be able to continue with little threat of overheating the economy.
Moreover, the labor force itself jumped by nearly half a million, a bright spot in an otherwise steady picture of the economy.
The nation has added an average of 178,000 jobs a month this year, less robust than the average monthly gain of 229,000 in 2015 but still a healthy reading given the longevity of the recovery and the slowdown in population growth among adults of working age.
Mr. Gapen attributed most of September's dip in job creation, which was below the consensus forecast and the annual average, to an unexpected 11,000 drop in government payrolls.
The public sector added more than 50,000 positions in July and August, and Mr. Gapen said the private sector's relative strength was what counted, not a slowdown in government hiring.
"It's not a negative signal," he said. "We see the miss as mainly a one-off government issue."
Despite the robust hiring in the last couple of years, tens of millions of workers have barely felt the benefits of the recovery, and notable pockets of economic weakness remain more than seven years after it began.
Those two contrasting realities -- healthy hiring and falling unemployment on the one hand, millions of economically sidelined Americans on the other -- sustain the narrative of the two main presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.
Both candidates' critiques of the economy contain kernels of truth. Friday's report, while generally strong, contained fodder for both.
The jump in participation, and healthy gains in higher-paying professional services fields, bolster Mrs. Clinton's case that the economy is growing steadily and creating decent-paying jobs. The drop in manufacturing jobs by 13,000 will underscore fears among blue-collar voters that their livelihoods are imperiled, a main factor in Mr. Trump's appeal.
In addition to strong gains in services, the closely watched construction industry added 23,000 jobs. The housing market has been booming in many parts of the country, and like manufacturing, construction remains an important source of middle-class jobs for workers with just high school diplomas.
"I'm heartened to see that we have an unmistakable trend toward good-quality jobs," said Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez. "I know there's a doom and gloom caucus out there, but they're on a collision course with the facts."
Another encouraging development was a slowdown in the huge round of job cuts in the mining and logging industries prompted by falling prices for oil and other commodities.
After falling for 23 consecutive months, with 223,000 jobs slashed during that time, employment in the sector was flat last month.
"Instead of declining, jobs may start coming back to the sector," Ms. Swonk said, noting that the recent rebound in oil prices may spur new investment in exploration and drilling after a two-year drought.
Although Wall Street watches every jobs report, this one drew less attention because the Federal Reserve is not expected to raise rates until December at the earliest. The Fed will meet in November, but it is not expected to raise rates so close to the election.
Moreover, waiting until December to decide whether to tighten monetary policy would allow policy makers to consider the October and November jobs reports.
Mr. Gapen said December remained the most likely target for the Fed's next interest rate increase, but he added that it was hardly certain.
"We think there's a 60 percent chance the Fed will act, or slightly better than even," he said. "There is a little something for everyone in this report from a policy-making perspective."
The 2.6 percent increase in wages in the last 12 months is better than the 2.3 percent annual increase in 2015, but it is still less than many recession-ravaged workers would hope to see at this point in the recovery.
Still, there are plenty of signs the tighter labor market is finally paying off and producing raises, for workers at both the bottom and the top of the pay scale. This trend may also indicate that minimum wage increases in many states are beginning to filter through the broader economy.
As the more modest gain in payrolls for September suggests, some big employers have slowed the pace of recruiting slightly, but they continue to add to payrolls.
Ernst & Young, the giant accounting and consulting firm, plans to hire 15,200 people in the United States in the 2017 fiscal year, which began July 1.
In the 2016 fiscal year, Ernst & Young hired 16,375 people, said Dan Black, Ernst & Young Americas recruiting leader. "It's not a put-the-brakes-on moment," he said. "It's more of a maintain-and-sustain scenario."

Full text:   Mylan, the maker of the allergy treatment EpiPen, said Friday that it had reached a $465 million settlement with the Justice Department and other government agencies over questions on whether the company had overcharged Medicaid for the treatment by improperly classifying it as a generic drug.
The federal government said this week that Mylan had been told multiple times that it was wrongly classifying the EpiPen, which led the Medicaid and Medicare programs to overpay for the product. Although it has not been disclosed how much it had overpaid, officials said spending on the EpiPen totaled nearly $1.3 billion from 2011 to 2015.
Mylan has been under intense scrutiny since the summer for raising the price of EpiPen to more than $600 for a pack of two from about $100 since it bought the product in 2007.
In a statement, Mylan said the settlement did not imply any admission of wrongdoing. It also said the settlement had not been finalized, and that it expected to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services.
"This agreement is another important step in Mylan's efforts to move forward and bring resolution" to the EpiPen issue, the chief executive, Heather Bresch, said in the statement.
The settlement represented a remarkably fast resolution to an issue that first surfaced over the summer and a handful of United States senators wrote to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees the Medicaid program, asking questions about the issue.
Whether a drug is classified as a brand-name or a generic makes a big difference. The makers of generic drugs pay rebates to the government of 13 percent of the average manufacturers' price. But manufacturers of brand-name drugs must offer discounts of about 23 percent off that average price, or the difference between the average price and the best price they have negotiated with any other American payer, whichever gives the bigger discount.
In addition, brand-name manufacturers must pay more in rebates if their products' prices rise faster than inflation, as EpiPen's did.
When the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services responded to the senators on this issue, the agency said it "cannot comment on the total amount of rebates owed by Mylan related to this incorrect classification."
EpiPen's designation as a generic dates back decades, to before Mylan bought the product. EpiPen contains epinephrine, a drug that is available as a cheap generic, but Mylan has the exclusive right to sell the drug as part of a patented auto-injector.
The federal government issued a rule this year requiring all companies with drugs that have been approved under what the Food and Drug Administration calls a new drug application to either reclassify them as brand-name drugs or seek a waiver. Mylan had previously said it would seek such a waiver, but on Friday it said it agreed that the EpiPen would be classified as a branded drug beginning in April of next year.
Mylan will take a $465 million charge in the third quarter to pay for the settlement, the company said. It also lowered its earnings guidance to between $4.70 and $4.90 a share, compared to the previous estimate of $4.85 to $5.15, citing the financial implications of previously announced changes to its patient access programs for the EpiPen.
Following a public outcry, Mylan has said it will offer more help to patients with their out-of-pocket costs and expand the number of uninsured patients who can get free EpiPens. It also has announced plans to begin selling a generic version of the EpiPen at a lower list price.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and one of the senators who initially raised questions, said she was pleased with the settlement. However, she said in a statement on Friday, "this must be the tip of the iceberg. If other drugs are misclassified, and surely EpiPen isn't the only one, the public deserves to know it."
In its letter to senators earlier this week, the Medicaid agency said it was undertaking a "comprehensive review" to see if other companies have also misclassified their drugs. But it said it could not say which manufacturers may have also wrongly identified their drugs as generics.
Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan who studies the drug industry, said Mylan's swift action was a good idea.
"They are smart to quickly end the uncertainty regarding past Medicaid pricing," he said, adding, "The government was willing to quickly settle because there are questions about why it allowed Mylan to pay rebates it says it told the company were too low."

Abstract: The savings shortfall means many Americans face the prospect of retiring solely on Social Security, which replaces just 39 percent of pre-retirement income for the average worker retiring at 65, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Delayed claiming is especially beneficial for married couples, since one spouse is likely to live well past the so-called "break-even date," or the point at which a claimant will have made back the benefits forgone while delaying a claim. [...]the Social Security survivor benefit allows a surviving spouse to step up to 100 percent of a deceased spouse's benefit, and married couples often do well with a delayed filing for the higher-earning spouse.

Full text:   Michael Kitces sees it regularly in his financial planning practice: clients who are close to retirement but haven't saved.
"They fall into two groups -- either they don't focus on it, or they are despondent," says Mr. Kitces, director of wealth management for Maryland-based Pinnacle Advisory Group and publisher of the popular Nerd's Eye View blog, which focuses on financial planning. "They think their retirement is doomed -- it's a real lose-lose scenario."
Mr. Kitces' clients are not alone.
Among workers age 55 or higher and nearing retirement, 48 percent have saved less than $100,000, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. A third have less than $25,000.
The savings shortfall means many Americans face the prospect of retiring solely on Social Security, which replaces just 39 percent of pre-retirement income for the average worker retiring at 65, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
But near-retirees do have some opportunities to improve their retirement math.
Catch Up
Mr. Kitces encourages clients facing shortfalls not to give up on saving. That is particularly true for empty-nesters, who may be able to redirect income formerly devoted to raising children and paying college tuition.
He recommends creating a household budget while the children are still on the household payroll that tracks child-related spending specifically. That can help people reallocate that spending to retirement saving once their children are out of the house.
Mr. Kitces usually suggests maximizing savings contributions in workplace 401(k) accounts that offer the incentive of tax deferral and employer matches, or an I.R.A.
Savers over the age of 50 also benefit from higher "catch-up" limits on tax deferred savings than their younger counterparts. This year, the combined limit for 401(k) accounts is $24,000; for I.R.A.s, it is $6,500.
Ramped-up contributions later in life can still yield a significant nest egg: Mr. Kitces calculates that if a couple earning a combined $100,000 started saving 30 percent of their income at age 51, they could accumulate more than $1 million in savings by age 65.
Delay
For most households, waiting to file for Social Security offers the best opportunity to increase retirement income.
Benefits -- which are adjusted annually to account for inflation -- can be claimed as early as age 62, but monthly benefits rise 8 percent for every year that you wait (credits for delay are available until age 70).
"There's nothing you can put your money into today that will create a better rate of return," says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar, an investment research and management company.
Yet nearly half of American workers file at age 62, data from the Social Security Administration shows.
"We see a real tendency among our clients to take Social Security early," says Kevin Dorwin, managing principal at Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough in San Francisco. "They feel they need the income right away and don't want to get shortchanged on it."
Delayed claiming is especially beneficial for married couples, since one spouse is likely to live well past the so-called "break-even date," or the point at which a claimant will have made back the benefits forgone while delaying a claim.
Moreover, the Social Security survivor benefit allows a surviving spouse to step up to 100 percent of a deceased spouse's benefit, and married couples often do well with a delayed filing for the higher-earning spouse.
"The impact of delaying is even more profound for someone with less savings," says William Meyer, a founder of Social Security Solutions, which offers online software that helps claimants optimize their benefits. "The additional cumulative benefits represent a larger proportional amount if you have $200,000 in saving instead of $3 million."
Defer
Working longer offers a retirement math triple play by reducing the number of years a retiree must rely on savings, permitting more years of retirement account contributions and setting the stage for a delayed Social Security claim.
"The combination of minimizing withdrawals from investment portfolios and allowing for greater compounding can make a very big difference," says Mr. Dorwin.
He calculates that a 65-year-old couple with combined income of $150,000 could bolster their retirement income by 30 percent if they worked an additional three years, rather than retiring immediately, as a result of higher Social Security benefits and drawdowns from a larger portfolio.
Of course, working longer isn't always possible -- health problems and job loss often get in the way.
But American workers do seem to be getting the message that it's a worthwhile goal. A Gallup poll reports that today's workers expect to retire at 66, on average. By contrast, the average retirement age for those who have already retired is 61.
Review
Retirement planning models often rely on rules of thumb that don't always apply in individual situations.
Standard planning, for example, holds that retirees need to replace 70 to 80 percent of pre-retirement income to maintain their standard of living. But Mr. Blanchett's research suggests that the actual replacement rates vary from 54 percent to 87 percent of income.
His review of actual retirement expenditure, based on data from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey, also suggests that spending falls over the course of retirement. That is especially true for older retirees, who tend to spend less on travel, entertainment and other discretionary items.
Households facing saving shortfalls should consider cutting back on discretionary spending, Mr. Blanchett says: "It might not be easy, but it could be done."
Empty nesters facing retirement income challenges should also consider moving to a smaller home or relocating to a less expensive part of a metropolitan area.
Along with extracting equity that can be invested to produce income, substantial savings come from eliminating (or reducing) mortgages, and reducing home maintenance and property tax costs, according to Mr. Kitces.
"More often than not, people do it because the house feels large and empty, but it can produce a lot of savings," he says.
Minimize
Taxation of retirement income plays an important role in determining how long retirement savings will last.
Conventional wisdom instructs retirees to draw money first from taxable accounts, and then from tax-deferred 401(k) and IRAs. But Mr. Meyer recommends a more nuanced approach by withdrawing from multiple accounts to minimize taxes.
He acknowledges that an initial focus on taxable accounts makes sense because they are the least tax-efficient.
But the multi-account approach is especially beneficial for retirees who delay their Social Security claim: They will be in lower tax brackets during the early years of retirement -- an ideal time to take at least some income from tax-deferred accounts. That can trim tax bills later on, when income Social Security (and required minimum distributions after age 70.5) push many retirees into higher tax brackets.
"Strategically tapping your savings leaves you more to spend in retirement," Mr. Meyer says.

Full text:   LONDON -- For those blithely inclined toward the view that Britain would somehow find a way to sever its relationship with the European Union free of drama or financial consequences -- like canceling a car rental reservation, with a tad more paperwork -- Friday was a sobering day of reckoning.
As the British pound plunged some 6 percent against the American dollar in the span of two minutes in early trading in Asia, the markets offered a reminder that divorce tends to be messy, expensive and laced with uncertainties. It rarely ends happily.
The selling was so frenzied and swift that those who swap currencies for a living spoke of computerized transactions going haywire, rogue algorithms at work or a data entry error. The drop in the value of the pound appeared excessive, and it soon recovered some losses, though the British currency was down about 17 percent -- around 25 cents -- since June 23, the day Britain voted to abandon Europe.
More than anything, though, the precipitous drop seemed to attest to an increasingly unmistakable reality: Britain's vote to exit the European Union -- Brexit, in common parlance -- has put its commercial relationships with the world on uncertain and potentially perilous ground. That poses risks for the British economy, making its money less attractive to hold.
"The world believes that the U.K. is going to be poorer in the future, and find it more expensive to trade," said Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research institution in London. "Essentially, the world is betting against the pound." And against the British economy.
The immediate cause of the plunge appeared to be a speech by the French president, François Hollande, on Thursday evening in Paris, in which he endorsed the view that Britain must be forced to swallow unpalatable terms of departure to discourage other European Union members from eyeing the exits.
"The U.K. has decided to do a Brexit, I believe even a hard Brexit," Mr. Hollande said. "Well, then, we must go all the way through the U.K.'s willingness to leave the E.U. We have to have this firmness.
"If not," he continued, "we would jeopardize the fundamental principles of the E.U. Other countries would want to leave the E.U. to get the supposed advantages without the obligations."
Hard Brexit, Soft Brexit, Brexit Over Easy. No one really knows what these terms mean (and the last one is made up). But, crudely, they divide potential outcomes into the ones in which Britain maintains effective inclusion within Europe's single market -- a realm sprawling from Ireland to Romania, holding some 500 million people -- and the ones in which Britain winds up outside.
Mr. Hollande's line echoed a speech given by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany earlier that day.
The week began with an admission from Britain's new Conservative prime minister, Theresa May, that access to the European market is likely to be a casualty of Britain's pursuit of a primary aspiration expressed in the Brexit vote: imposing limits on immigration.
European leaders have been resolute that free movement of people across the borders of member nations is a nonnegotiable cost of admission in the common market.
But Brexiteers had steadfastly maintained the illusion that Britain could have it both ways -- that it could retain access to the European market while still controlling immigration. In destroying that idea, the prime minister's admission badly rattled the markets.
The stakes are considerable. Britain ships nearly half its exports to other European Union members. The giants of global banking have turned London into a financial center rivaling New York, using hubs here to extend their reach across the rest of the European market.
Investment has poured into Britain from around the world, as major manufacturers have set up factories so they can sell their wares across Europe without incurring tariffs.
To one degree or another -- and no one really knows how much -- Brexit puts all of this in play.
Negotiations between Britain and Europe are expected to commence sometime early next year. Whatever settlement results must be ratified by the remaining members of the European Union, meaning that Britain's economic prospects are now tethered to the vagaries of domestic politics in 27 other countries.
None of these risks were unforeseen. During a fractious campaign leading up to the referendum, great reams of paper were released sketching out the potential effects on the British economy should voters opt to leave. Reports varied on details and degree, but they nearly unanimously concluded that Brexit would entail economic pain.
The British Treasury surveyed the trading arrangements the government might strike with Europe after a Brexit vote and concluded it could lop some 6.2 percent off the gross domestic product by 2030. That would leave the average household worse off by about 4,300 pounds a year (at the current, depressed exchange rate, about $5,300).
But those campaigning to leave dismissed such talk as fearmongering. They described a swashbuckling and reinvigorated Britain that would break free from a stagnating Europe -- the land of unemployed children moving in with their parents -- to instead focus on improving trade with faster-growing countries like China, India and the United States.
Since the vote, those who urged leaving Europe have pointed to the facts that the sun still rises and the earth still spins to declare validation.
Even as the pound has fallen against the dollar, consumer spending has generally held up along with employment. Economic growth has yet to be hit. Boutiques and high-end restaurants in London remain packed.
Some have focused on the upsides of a declining pound, which makes British exports cheaper on world markets and renders Britain a more affordable tourist destination.
But this misses the fact that nearly one-third of the goods and services consumed in Britain are imported. In dollar terms, the price of those goods and services is spiking. Eventually, economists assume, this inflation will work its way through the economy, further depressing growth by crimping consumer spending and potentially sowing unemployment.
During the campaign, those in favor of leaving offered assurance that, whatever resulted, Britain would ultimately secure a beneficial trade deal with Europe. Germany sells vast quantities of cars to British consumers, giving it every incentive to keep trade flowing unimpeded by tariffs. As the largest economy in the union, Germany would hold the cards.
But in her speech on Thursday, Ms. Merkel took direct aim at that argument, telling a gathering of industry leaders that any wavering on the principle of free movement of people would pose "a systemic challenge for the entire European Union."
The sudden plummeting of the pound appeared to signal that investors were absorbing the intricacies of this dynamic, and seeing through the Brexiteers' claims that Britain could impose limits on immigration while also negotiating a settlement with Europe that would maintain access to the common market.
Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who campaigned for leaving the European Union and is now foreign secretary, managed last week to maintain the government line while simultaneously making fun of the charade.
"Our policy is having our cake and eating it," he told the British tabloid, The Sun.
But on Sunday, as Prime Minister May addressed a gathering of her governing Conservative Party in Birmingham, she essentially dumped the cake in the bin.
"We have voted to leave the European Union and become a fully independent, sovereign country," Mrs. May declared. "We will do what independent, sovereign countries do. We will decide for ourselves how we control immigration."
In short, a "hard Brexit" appeared to be in Britain's future.
"Somehow, a whole combination of people were in denial up until now," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England, and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
"There were the people who thought Brexit would be reversed," he continued. "There were the people who delusionally thought there would be a soft Brexit, and all the northern Europeans would be nice to them. And there were people who believed that this crew in charge of the British negotiations were somehow going to strike a good deal. All of the delusions have run out of material."

Full text:   Stocks on Wall Street fell broadly on Tuesday, led by sharp drops in utilities and phone companies.
United States government bond prices slumped, and gold had its worst day in nearly three years.
A big driver of the day's trading was rates, with investors closely watching the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which has risen as the price of the note has dropped. The yield on Tuesday rose to 1.69 percent, up from 1.63 on Monday, and up more than a tenth of a percentage point in less than a week.
The price of gold dropped sharply as investors anticipated that rates would keep rising. Higher rates diminish the appeal of gold, which investors tend to favor when they fear that low rates will encourage inflation. Gold slumped $42.70, or 3.5 percent, to $1,266.30 an ounce.
Investors are nervous about the timing and the pace of any increase in the extremely low interest rates controlled by the Federal Reserve, and comments from central bank officials recently have added to their jitters.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 85.40 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,168.45. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.71 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,150.49. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,289.66.
As the yields have risen, investors who had poured money into steady dividend payers like phone and real estate companies and utilities have begun selling because bonds are becoming more attractive as a source of income. Utilities have fallen 7 percent since Sept. 22, after soaring 21 percent in the first six months of the year.
On Monday, a crucial manufacturing gauge in the United States showed surprising strength. Then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Loretta Mester, a "hawk" who thinks the central bank should be raising rates, reiterated her position in a Bloomberg interview.
Investors are looking ahead to a report on job creation out Friday to better gauge how soon the Fed will act. The Fed is expected by most investors to wait until December to raise rates.
Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said investors were hoping for a continued "goldilocks" situation of modest economic growth.
"The best thing for the market right now is for the economy to be strong enough to dispel the fear of recession," he said, "but not too strong that it accelerate the Fed tightening process."
Among stocks making news, Newell Brands fell 65 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $51.60 after announcing it would sell 10 percent of its businesses, including part of its outdoor segment and its consumer storage unit. The company owns Mr. Coffee, Paper Mate, Elmer's and other brands.
In overseas markets, the FTSE 100 in Britain jumped 1.3 percent, just shy of its record high of 7,122, as the pound continues to sink after the country's prime minister gave a clear timetable on Sunday for leaving the European Union. The pound is now near a 31-year low of $1.2741.
In other currency markets, the euro slipped to $1.1197 from $1.1215 and the dollar rose to 102.81 yen from 101.57 yen.
United States benchmark crude oil fell 12 cents to $48.69 a gallon. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 2 cents to close at $50.87 a barrel in London.

Abstract: With the changes in the world -- the end of the Cold War; the collapse of the Soviet Union and, with it, its military, financial and diplomatic support of the P.L.O.; and the drying up of funds from Arab countries angered over Arafat's support of Iraq in the recent Persian Gulf war -- the time had come for the Palestinians, too, to seek peace.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Shimon Peres, one of the last surviving pillars of Israel's founding generation, who did more than anyone to build up his country's formidable military might, then worked as hard to establish a lasting peace with Israel's Arab neighbors, died on Wednesday in a Tel Aviv area hospital. He was 93.
His death was announced by his son Nehemya Peres, who is known as Chemi, and his personal physician and son-in-law Dr. Rafi Walden, outside the Sheba Medical Center, where he had been hospitalized for the last two weeks.
Mr. Peres died just over two weeks after suffering a stroke. Doctors kept him largely unconscious and on a breathing tube since then in the hope that it would give his brain a chance to heal. But he deteriorated as the nation he once led watched his last battle play out publicly and as leaders from around the world sent wishes for his recovery.
As prime minister (twice); as minister of defense, foreign affairs, finance and transportation; and, until 2014, as president, Mr. Peres never left the public stage during Israel's seven decades.
He led the creation of Israel's defense industry, negotiated key arms deals with France and Germany and was the prime mover behind the development of Israel's nuclear weapons. But he was consistent in his search for an accommodation with the Arab world, a search that in recent years left him orphaned as Israeli society lost interest, especially after the upheavals of the 2011 Arab Spring led to tumult on its borders.
Chosen by Parliament in 2007 to serve a seven-year term as president, Mr. Peres had complicated relations with the hawkish government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, elected in 2009. While largely a ceremonial post, the presidency afforded Mr. Peres a perch with access and public attention, and he tried to exert his influence.
For someone who was dogged for decades by a reputation for vanity and back-room dealing, Mr. Peres ended his years in public office as a remarkably beloved figure, a founding pioneer who set an example for forward thinking by promoting the country's high-tech prowess and cultural reach.
Never at a loss for a bon mot in his Polish-accented Hebrew, English and French, Mr. Peres said of his transformation: "For 60 years I was the most controversial figure in the country, and suddenly I'm the most popular man in the land. Truth be told, I don't know when I was happier, then or now."
Historic Handshake
In his efforts to help Israel find acceptance in a hostile region, Mr. Peres's biggest breakthrough came in 1993, when he worked out a plan with the Palestine Liberation Organization for self-government in Gaza and in part of the West Bank, both of which were occupied by Israel.
After months of secret negotiation with representatives of the P.L.O., conducted with the help of Norwegian diplomats and intellectuals, Mr. Peres persuaded his old political rival Yitzhak Rabin, then the prime minister, to accept the plan. It became known as the Oslo Accords.
Mr. Peres, who was serving as foreign minister, signed the accords on Sept. 13, 1993, in a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House as Mr. Rabin and their old enemy Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the P.L.O., looked on and, with some prodding by President Bill Clinton, shook hands.
It was a gesture both unprecedented and historic. Up to that time, Israel had refused to negotiate directly with the P.L.O. Mr. Peres broke the taboo, and the impasse.
"What we are doing today is more than signing an agreement; it is a revolution," he said at the ceremony. "Yesterday a dream, today a commitment."
"We are sincere," he pledged to the Palestinians. "We mean business. We do not seek to shape your lives or determine your destiny. Let all of us turn from bullets to ballots, from guns to shovels."
Later that day, in a television interview, Mr. Peres pronounced himself 100 percent sure that peace had arrived. With the changes in the world -- the end of the Cold War; the collapse of the Soviet Union and with it its military, financial and diplomatic support of the P.L.O.; and the drying up of funds from Arab countries angered over Arafat's support of Iraq in the recent Persian Gulf war -- the time had come for the Palestinians, too, to seek peace.
"If you have children," he said, "you cannot feed them forever with flags for breakfast and cartridges for lunch. You need something more substantial. Unless you educate your children and spend less money on conflicts, unless you develop your science, technology and industry, you don't have a future."
Mr. Peres, Mr. Rabin and Arafat were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994.
But the era of good feelings did not last. Barely a year later, Mr. Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish gunman upset by the accords; the death elevated Mr. Peres to the post of prime minister. But a series of Palestinian suicide bombings undercut Mr. Peres's authority, and he lost a narrow election to Mr. Netanyahu in 1996.
Conflict between Israel and the Palestinians accelerated in 2000 after a visit by the opposition leader Ariel Sharon to the sacred plaza in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. The next day, the Israeli police fired on stone-throwing protesters, inaugurating a new round of violence that became known as the second intifada.
It did not end until Arafat died in 2004, bringing new leadership to the Palestinians and a new effort at coexistence led by Mr. Sharon, a former hawk who had been elected prime minister. He withdrew Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza and small parts of the West Bank.
Mr. Peres had tried before to get a peace settlement, in 1987, between Israel and Jordan. He was foreign minister in a coalition government with Yitzhak Shamir when he proposed an international peace conference on the Middle East. But Mr. Shamir and his Likud faction scuttled the plan.
Mr. Peres had sought to settle the future of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel had occupied since the Arab-Israeli War in 1967. As a first step, he proposed that Jordan and Israel could either divide the land or share the government but that Israel should not control the area forever.
A Coalition, and Calm
Mr. Peres became prime minister at the head of an unusual coalition of Israel's two major political parties, his own Labor Party, and the Likud, the party led by Yitzhak Shamir, who served as deputy prime minister and foreign minister. In accordance with the coalition agreement, the two men exchanged posts after 25 months.
Mr. Peres brought a period of tranquillity to the social environment, which had been frayed by animosities between European and Middle Eastern Jews and between religious Jews and secular Jews.
He presided over the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon after an invasion that had generated unprecedented controversy, and he became the first Israeli prime minister to take the difficult steps required to deal with the nation's fundamental economic problems and ruinous inflation.
During his time in office, Israel airlifted some 7,000 Ethiopian Jews who had trekked to refugee camps in Sudan to escape famine, anti-Semitism, forced conscription of boys and other threats that had made their lives in Ethiopia precarious. Mr. Peres called the clandestine rescue operation a "daring and wonderful" act of "self-redemption."
Taking over what was expected to be a government of national impasse, Mr. Peres left office with an image as a dignified, self-confident statesman.
But while he was prime minister, severe strains developed in relations between the United States and Israel growing out of a major spy scandal involving an American, Jonathan Jay Pollard, and the disclosure in 1986 of Iranian arms deals.
A man of medium height and slender, athletic build -- his dark hair turned gray and then white in his later years -- Mr. Peres always exuded vitality, despite a schedule that kept him going 18 hours a day. When, on his 88th birthday, he was offered a traditional Jewish greeting, "May you live till 120," he retorted without missing a beat, "Don't be stingy."
Mr. Peres was married to the former Sonya Gelman, who shunned the spotlight to the point of refusing to move into the president's house when he took his last public post. She died in January 2011. They had three children: a daughter, Zvia, and two sons, Jonathan and Nehemya. They and Mr. Peres's eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive him.
Mr. Peres was an effective speaker, comfortable in front of large audiences as well as the television camera. He cultivated party members -- remembering their names and attending their weddings and bar mitzvahs -- and nurtured his relationship with the intelligentsia.
He also wrote poetry and was given to quoting the ancient Greeks and Flaubert and Churchill. He published a dozen books, including "The New Middle East," in 1993, and "Battling for Peace," a memoir, in 1995. His last book was an affectionate political biography of his mentor, the country's founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion.
A Journey From Poland
He was born Shimon Persky on Aug. 16, 1923, to a merchant family in the small village of Vishniewa, Poland. His parents, Yitzhak and Sara Persky, took him to Palestine when he was 11, where he studied in Tel Aviv and then entered an agricultural school.
In 1941, he helped found Kibbutz Alumot in the eastern Lower Galilee, where he worked as a herdsman and was elected kibbutz secretary. He soon became active in the Mapai, which was to become Israel's Labor Party, and at 18 was appointed the coordinator of the youth movement of the Histadrut, the General Labor Federation.
He rose rapidly, getting experience in the intricacies of Israeli political life. In 1944, Ben-Gurion, then the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, sent Mr. Peres with a small reconnaissance group to Eilat on the Red Sea to survey the Sinai Desert and make maps, which became important strategic assets during the 1948 war of independence.
It was on that mission that a friend sighted a nest of eagles, "peres" in Hebrew. "Persky," he said, "why don't you change your family name to Peres?" He accepted the suggestion, though the bird they saw was in fact more a vulture than an eagle.
When Israel became independent in 1948, Mr. Peres was named head of the naval service. Within two years, he was sent to the United States to lead a defense supply mission in New York. He was 27 and spoke no English, but within three months, after rounds of intensive private lessons, he was fluent. He took courses at the New School for Social Research and New York University, and later at the Harvard School of Public Administration.
In 1951, Ben-Gurion, then prime minister and minister of defense, appointed Mr. Peres director general of the Defense Ministry, where he used his Harvard training to reorganize the department. Mr. Peres became known as one of "Ben-Gurion's boys" -- protégés of the "Old Man" -- a group that included Teddy Kollek and Moshe Dayan.
Those years may have been the genesis of a lifelong rivalry with Mr. Rabin, who at the time was chief of the operations branch, the second-highest position in the Israeli Army. He complained of what he called Mr. Peres's excessive authority.
At the Defense Ministry, Mr. Peres was in charge of a substantial portion of the nation's total budget, and he played a central role in developing the young nation's industry, particularly in aeronautics and electronics.
He stressed domestic weapons production, but when Egypt received advanced military equipment from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, Mr. Peres began to cast about for new sources of supply. He finally turned to France.
His timing was excellent. The French believed the Algerian revolutionaries fighting for independence were fueled by President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and saw Israel as a source of intelligence about Egypt. Mr. Peres negotiated a $1 billion arms deal and acquired a reputation as a canny bargainer.
The arms negotiations formed a basis for the Franco-Israeli alliance that led to Israel's lightning capture of Sinai in 1956. Zeev Schiff, for many years the military editor of the newspaper Haaretz, said, "There is no doubt that Peres was one of the brains behind Suez."
Ben-Gurion felt that a pre-emptive war was bad for Israel in terms of public opinion and was reluctant until the last. Mr. Peres saw it as an opportunity to get a better position among the superpowers, a special relationship through a "joint venture of going to war together."
Out of that joint venture came French help in building a nuclear reactor in Dimona, which provided Israel with the ability to build nuclear weapons.
"I reached the stage in France where I was trusted by everybody, and really the sky was the limit," Mr. Peres said many years later.
Power Struggles
In 1957, Mr. Peres was awarded the French Legion of Honor, one of many international distinctions. In 2012, President Obama presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
The American honor partly reflected Israel's shift in alliance to the United States from Europe in previous decades. While under Ben-Gurion, and his successor, Levi Eshkol, Mr. Peres had negotiated with the West German defense minister, Franz Josef Strauss, to get arms and continued to get weapons from France as well. But he came to rely increasingly on the United States. He visited Washington frequently and met with Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
Mr. Peres ran for the country's Parliament, the Knesset, in 1959, in his first bid for national elective office. With the support of Ben-Gurion, he was given a position high enough on his party's electoral list to be assured of victory.
In the political turmoil that preceded the 1967 Middle East War, Mr. Peres tried to negotiate a return to power for Ben-Gurion, who had retired. In the course of his negotiations, he proposed a coalition to Menachem Begin, the head of the right-wing Herut Party, despite Ben-Gurion's belief that if Mr. Begin ever came to power, he would bring Israel to the "precipice of destruction."
Shabtai Teveth, a professor of history at Tel Aviv University and the biographer of Ben-Gurion, said in an interview, "I believe Peres will go down in Zionist and Israeli history as the man who legitimized Begin and the Herut."
Ten years later, in 1977, when Mr. Peres challenged Mr. Rabin, the split in the Labor Party opened the way for the election of Mr. Begin as prime minister.
When Israel's top leaders were discredited because of the country's lack of preparedness for the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Mr. Peres made a bid for power. To block him, Finance Minister Pinchas Sapir recruited Mr. Rabin, who had been ambassador to the United States and bore no responsibility for the wartime failures. Mr. Rabin named Mr. Peres defense minister, a decision he later came to regret. In his memoirs, Mr. Rabin called him unscrupulous and untrustworthy. He wrote that he could not believe a word Mr. Peres said.
Their decades-old feud flared again in 1976 when an Air France plane that left Tel Aviv for Paris was hijacked in Athens and taken to Entebbe, Uganda. The hijackers held about 100 Israeli passengers hostage. Mr. Peres accused Prime Minister Rabin of weakness for resisting a military solution. A raid by Israeli commandos on July 3, 1976, rescued 91 passengers and 12 crew members.
The next year, Mr. Peres again sought nomination as his party's candidate for prime minister, but he again lost out to Mr. Rabin. When Mr. Rabin was forced to drop out after disclosures that he and his wife had violated Israeli law by maintaining a bank account in Washington, Mr. Peres led the party, but he lost in the general election to Mr. Begin.
Mr. Peres finally became prime minister in 1984 when he led his Labor Party into the coalition with Likud.
He returned to office as foreign minister in July 1992 in the government of Mr. Rabin and was soon working toward the accord signed a year later. In 1996, Mr. Peres, who had taken over as prime minister after Mr. Rabin's assassination, called an early election, certain of victory.
But a series of terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and Mr. Peres's decision to mount an offensive against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon -- during which scores of Lebanese refugees sheltering at a United Nations base in Qana died in an Israeli artillery barrage -- led to ill feelings in Israel and the surprise victory by Mr. Netanyahu of Likud.
Ehud Barak then replaced Mr. Peres as head of Labor and kept him in a minor role in his government, which was elected in 1999.
Mr. Peres spent that period partly building up his Peres Center for Peace but made another political comeback when Mr. Sharon was elected prime minister in 2001 over Mr. Barak.
Mr. Peres took Labor into the Sharon-led government in a bid for national unity. Later, in 2005, he left Labor and joined the new centrist party, Kadima, formed by Mr. Sharon.
Mr. Peres, who frequently drew on historical allusions, thought of himself as a philosopher more than a politician. When asked about the 1993 Oslo Accords, he said: "There was no alternative. We had to do it." He added, "An ancient Greek philosopher was asked what is the difference between war and peace. 'In war,' he replied, 'the old bury the young. In peace, the young bury the old.' I felt that if I could make the world better for the young, that would be the greatest thing we can do."
Correction: September 29, 2016, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an obituary in some editions on Wednesday about Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and president of Israel, misstated the year that a Franco-Israeli alliance led to Israel's capture of Sinai. It was 1956, not 1967.

Full text:   Donald J. Trump attacked the Federal Reserve on Monday night before the largest audience he has yet addressed, telling the millions of people watching the first presidential debate that the nation's central bank is acting as an arm of the Democratic Party at the expense of the economy.
It is an extraordinary accusation, backed by no evidence, that plows across a bipartisan line. Since the 1970s, presidential candidates and presidents have avoided publicly criticizing the Fed's decisions about raising and lowering interest rates.
Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, was "doing political things" by holding interest rates at low levels. He said that the American economy was in a "big, fat, ugly bubble" that would pop when the Fed started raising rates. Ms. Yellen, he said, was waiting until President Obama left office.
This accusation, which Mr. Trump has leveled several times in recent weeks, is roundly rejected by Fed officials -- including those who agree it is time to raise interest rates. It is also rejected by a wide range of independent observers.
"There is simply no evidence that the Yellen Fed is doing anything at all partisan, or with an eye toward influencing elections," said Peter Conti-Brown, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studies the Fed. "It is simply a falsehood."
Even Fed critics, like R. Glenn Hubbard, a former chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and an adviser to Mitt Romney in 2012, would not back Mr. Trump.
"I disagree with the current stance of and approach to the conduct of monetary policy by the Fed," Mr. Hubbard said on Tuesday. "Having said that," he added, "I do not believe for a moment that Janet Yellen is acting for a political purpose as opposed to doing what she believes is right."
The Fed has held interest rates at low levels since the financial crisis to increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. A growing number of economists, including some Fed officials, think the economy is strong enough that the Fed should be raising rates more quickly. But technocrats on both sides of the debate say they are not thinking about the election.
"I can say, emphatically, that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy," Ms. Yellen said last week in response to a question about one of Mr. Trump's earlier salvos. "We do not discuss politics at our meetings and we do not take politics into account in our decisions."
Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has criticized Mr. Trump's remarks as inappropriate and potentially disruptive to financial markets. "He should not be adding the Fed to his long list of institutions and individuals that he is maligning," she said.
The Fed is not independent. It is an arm of the federal government, chartered by Congress to maximize employment and minimize inflation. But politicians and economists in the United States and other developed nations have generally concluded that central banks operate most effectively when they are insulated from short-term political pressures.
Mr. Conti-Brown said that Mr. Trump's comments were a dangerous attack on that independence. He said the Fed was navigating a difficult economic environment in which it needed the freedom and flexibility to experiment. "If Trump succeeds, then the Fed simply won't have this freedom of movement to experiment," he said.
The Fed's modern era of operational independence officially started in 1951, but even then, presidents continued to treat the central bank as an arm of the administration.
In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson shoved William McChesney Martin, the Fed chairman, against a wall at his Texas ranch and demanded that the Fed keep interest rates low.
When Arthur Burns became the Fed chairman in January 1970, President Richard Nixon said at the swearing-in ceremony, "I respect his independence. However, I hope that independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed."
Mr. Burns got the message. Rates stayed low during Mr. Nixon's re-election campaign.
Gradually, under Jimmy Carter and his successors, presidents began to leave the Fed alone. The Obama administration says it does not comment on monetary policy.
The president does pick the people who run the Fed and Mr. Obama has appointed all five members of the Fed's board. (Two seats are vacant because Senate Republicans refuse to vote on Mr. Obama's nominees.) Three of those officials, including Ms. Yellen, served as economic policy officials in the Clinton White House in the 1990s. The Fed governor Lael Brainard has donated to Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign.
Monetary policy decisions are made by a committee composed of the board and presidents of the regional reserve banks, who are not presidential appointees.
A recent review by Goldman Sachs economists found "there is no sign of an election influence on policy decisions in election years," although the authors added that the Fed did seem to avoid changing policy at its final meeting before an election.
Still, Mr. Trump's critiques have resonated with some conservatives.
"Trump is correct to criticize the Fed," said Terry Schilling, the executive director of the American Principles Project, a conservative advocacy group. "Our broken monetary policy is one of the biggest problems holding our economy back."
It is not clear, however, that the Fed could significantly increase interest rates. The economy remains relatively weak, and rates are low in every developed nation. When the Fed raised rates in December, for the first time since the financial crisis, it drove up the price of American exports, weakening the domestic economy.
Mr. Trump himself acknowledged this reality earlier in the presidential campaign. In May, he said on CNBC, "If we raise interest rates and if the dollar starts getting too strong, we're going to have some very major problems." A few weeks later, Mr. Trump told Reuters, "I'm not a person who thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job."
Now, however, Mr. Trump says he has made up his mind. "I used to hope that the Fed was independent," Mr. Trump said during another of his appearances on CNBC. "And the Fed is obviously not independent. It's obviously not even close to being independent."

Full text:   The photo suggested promise. On the sidelines of a peace ceremony in Colombia, President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and Secretary of State John Kerry met for the kind of brief exchange that, under normal circumstances, might have been the start of a thaw after years of icy relations.
But these are not normal circumstances: Venezuela's economic and political crises have left it more isolated than it has been in years -- and not just from the United States.
Shortages of food and medicine have left Peru calling for a bloc of countries to pressure Mr. Maduro to accept humanitarian donations, something that he declines to do. Mercosur, the South American trade bloc, has threatened to expel Venezuela over human rights violations and not complying with its trade laws.
And even the State Department, after Mr. Kerry's meeting with Mr. Maduro, issued a statement indicating that the men's encounter in Cartagena was not a photo op but rather Mr. Kerry's chance to express "our concern about the economic and political challenges that have affected millions of Venezuelans."
The year, marked by economic collapse, has been one of the most unstable for Venezuela, leading to fears among diplomats who now struggle for ways to reach out to a country whose leftist leaders have closed ranks.
Triple-digit inflation and a 10 percent economic contraction are expected this year at the same time that Mr. Maduro has faced a congress led by the opposition and a growing movement to oust him. But Mr. Maduro has doubled down, surrounded himself with a cadre of hard-liners and military men, blocked the congress with his courts and locked up many people who demand a recall vote.
"The main concern in the U.S. is the risk of utter collapse and uncontrolled chaos," said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy forum in Washington. "And that is why there is this kind of effort to keep this communication going."
Venezuela and the United States have not had ambassadors in each other's capitals in several years. Privately, American government officials said they did not know whether more meetings would occur between the two sides and that Mr. Maduro's intentions have long been unpredictable.
An American official, who requested anonymity to discuss delicate diplomatic matters, said that the meeting between Mr. Kerry and Mr. Maduro had been arranged two weeks before Monday's signing ceremony in Colombia that ended the war between the Colombian government and the FARC rebel movement.
The Venezuelans canceled that meeting last week, but at the last minute, Mr. Maduro went to Cartagena after all.
The spat with Mercosur illustrates how the country's political instability is causing isolation from its neighbors. This month, four former allies of Venezuela -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- refused to allow Mr. Maduro's government to accept the group's rotating presidency, accusing it of human rights violations, among other transgressions of the group's bylaws.
Many of the complaints stem from crackdowns against attempts to hold a recall referendum. Despite wide support for the vote, according to surveys, the government recently said it would delay the referendum in a way that would allow Mr. Maduro to choose his successor should he be removed from office.
That development got a rebuke from the State Department, which said it was troubled, citing media restrictions and "unexplained delays" that it said would "deprive Venezuelan citizens the opportunity to shape the course of their country." Venezuela responded with a barrage of criticism against the United States last week during a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, delivered by its foreign minister after Mr. Maduro abruptly canceled his trip to New York.
Other countries are voicing concern about Venezuela's humanitarian crisis, asking Mr. Maduro to simply accept assistance.
This month, the new Peruvian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, called for a group of countries including Chile, Argentina and Colombia to begin sending drugs and food.
Yet he did not seem hopeful.
"Now Maduro doesn't want that because he says everything is perfect in Venezuela, but that's not true, everybody knows that," he said in a recent television interview. "And the second thing is there has to be pressure in a nice way, without trying to interfere too much. There has to be some kind of moral persuasion."

Full text:   Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump kept fact-checkers busy throughout their first debate on Monday night as they sparred over their policies and records on the economy, national security, the environment and their personal pasts. In keeping with how he has run his campaign, Mr. Trump stretched the facts more often than Mrs. Clinton did; a couple of times, Mrs. Clinton literally called out for fact-checkers from the stage. (Here's how we analyzed it live, and the highlights.)
Foreign Policy and National Security
On Mr. Trump saying Mrs. Clinton had been "fighting ISIS your entire adult life."
In reality, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, began as an Al Qaeda affiliate that sprang up in Iraq as the Sunni insurgency amid the power vacuum created by the American invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein's government in 2003. It was largely defeated and pushed into Syria during the Obama administration's first term, when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. It eventually split from the original Al Qaeda and rebranded itself as ISIS, sweeping back into Iraq in 2014, when she was out of office.
--Charlie Savage
_____
On Mrs. Clinton blaming Russia for conducting cyberattacks, saying Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia were playing a "long game."
She's right, but the United States has not yet publicly named Russia as the attacker against the Democratic National Committee, much less the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs.
"The United States has much greater capacity," she said, seeming to threaten that the United States could respond in kind. She appeared to be referring to Washington's offensive cyberability, made clear in the American attacks on Iran's nuclear program, code-named "Olympic Games," which played out while she was secretary of state. Again, the United States has never admitted to that cyberoffensive action.
Mr. Trump seemed to try to deflect responsibility away from Moscow. "It could be Russia," he said, "but it could also be China." United States intelligence officials disagree: This most recent round of attacks, they concluded with "high confidence," indeed originated from Russia.
--David E. Sanger
_____
On Mr. Trump saying the Islamic State would never have come into power if the United States had stayed in Iraq.
The assertion is impossible to disprove, but it's unlikely that 10,000 troops remaining in Iraq would have made much of a difference -- especially in Syria and Libya, where the United States never had troops.
--David E. Sanger
_____
On Mr. Trump saying that the United States should have taken Iraq's oil.
It is an assertion that he made a few weeks ago, and one that was roundly criticized at the time. Seizing Iraq's oil -- or the resources of any country -- is illegal under international law, and doing so would have likely prompted condemnation from around the world. In purely practical terms, seizing Iraq's oil would have required tens of thousands of American troops to protect Iraq's oil infrastructure, which is spread out across the country and largely above ground. It also is probably safe to assume that Iraqis themselves would have objected to their country's main source of wealth being used to enrich another country.
--Matthew Rosenberg
_____
On Mr. Trump's accusation that the withdrawal of troops left a vacuum in Iraq and Syria, which allowed the Islamic State to take root.
In fact, Mrs. Clinton advocated arming moderate rebels in Syria and said afterward that Mr. Obama's refusal to do so may have left a vacuum there. She also privately backed a Pentagon proposal to leave a larger residual force in Iraq than the administration ended up leaving.
--Mark Landler
_____
On Mr. Trump's assertion that many NATO countries do not contribute their full share to NATO.
Mr. Trump was correct in asserting that many NATO countries do not contribute their full share to NATO -- a complaint that Mr. Obama and a former secretary of defense, Robert Gates, have also voiced. But he was wrong about NATO failing to fight terrorism. NATO was in Afghanistan starting in 2003 -- part of the battle against Al Qaeda.
--David E. Sanger
_____
On Mr. Trump's opposition to the Iraq war.
Mr. Trump said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began. But during the buildup to the war, he expressed his support in an interview with Howard Stern, according to audio unearthed by BuzzFeed.
--Steve Eder
_____
On Mrs. Clinton's assertion that the United States needs an "intelligence surge" to help prevent terrorist attacks by homegrown violent extremists.
The United States already collects and shares more intelligence than ever. The F.B.I. has been successful in arresting suspects who are in contact with terrorist figures overseas. The greater challenge for law enforcement today is often that homegrown terrorists commit no crime until an attack. And the F.B.I. is not allowed to conduct open-ended investigations without evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Nor is it allowed to collect intelligence solely related to people's views. Admiring Osama bin Laden or the Islamic State or expressing hatred for the United States is not a crime.
--Matt Apuzzo
_____
On Mr. Trump's claim that the United States is "not updating" its nuclear arsenal and the Iran nuclear deal.
Mr. Trump is wrong. The United States has a major nuclear modernization program underway, at a cost of tens of billions of dollars. On the Iran nuclear deal, he complained that the United States paid $1.7 billion in cash to Iran. It did. But it was Iran's money, for military goods never delivered to Iran after the Iranian Revolution. (The principal was $400 million; the remaining $1.3 billion was interest owed in the ensuing three decades.)
--David E. Sanger
Economy
On Mr. Trump saying that China is "devaluing their currency" to gain an economic advantage.
This is an outdated accusation. Countries that hold down the value of their currency can sell goods in other countries more cheaply. And many economists see evidence that China suppressed the value of its currency for years, contributing to its rise as an industrial power. But in recent years, China has sought to stabilize and even increase the value of its currency, part of a broader shift in its economic policies. There is no evidence that China is presently engaging in currency devaluation.
--Binyamin Appelbaum
_____
On Mr. Trump's claim that Ford is leaving the United States and taking "thousands of jobs" with it.
Mr. Trump described a dire situation for the United States' industrial economy, saying that "Ford is leaving," referring to the auto giant, and that "thousands of jobs are leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving."
Ford is moving its manufacturing of many smaller cars to Mexico, but has said that the move will not result in job losses in the United States.
Ohio and Michigan have, indeed, suffered major manufacturing job losses over the past generation. But in the past year, Ohio has gained 78,300 jobs, and Michigan has gained 75,800 jobs. In August, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in Michigan and 4.7 percent in Ohio, both in line with the national rate.
--Neil Irwin

Mrs. Clinton on Mr. Trump's tax plan:
Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump's tax plan would increase the federal debt by "over $5 trillion," and that it would penalize middle-income families.
The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that Mr. Trump's plan would cost a minimum of $4.4 trillion. A liberal group, Citizens for Tax Justice, pegs the minimum cost at $4.8 trillion. But the final bill could be significantly greater. Mr. Trump has offered multiple versions of some elements of his plan. A tax break for small businesses, in particular, could add more than $1 trillion to the final bill.
The Trump campaign, however, insists that the final cost would be just $2.6 trillion. This is based on a stripped-down version of Mr. Trump's plan -- one that is inconsistent with his campaign's public promises. It also assumes that lower tax rates would encourage much stronger economic growth, reducing the cost.
Would it hurt the middle class? Mr. Trump's plan would reduce the average tax burden for low-income, middle-income and upper-income households -- but it would not cut everyone's taxes. Indeed, a new analysis finds roughly 7.8 million families with children would pay higher taxes under Mr. Trump's plan.

On Mr. Trump and NAFTA :
Mr. Trump said that the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, "is the worst trade deal" in American history, and possibly in world history.
More than 20 years after its passage, NAFTA remains a political lightning rod. But the evidence suggests it wasn't a big deal in economic terms. Indeed, the Congressional Research Service concluded in 2015 that the "net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest." The reason: Trade with Canada and Mexico comprises a small portion of American economic activity.

_____
On Mr. Trump's claim that "we have a trade deficit of almost $800 billion a year," blaming trade deals for this.
He has the number wrong. The United States trade deficit was about $500 billion in 2015, and is on track for a similar number this year. He is likely referring to the trade deficit in goods, which was $762 billion last year. But that was counteracted by a $262 billion surplus in services.
In other words, while the United States imports more physical goods than it exports, it exports more services, including things like financial services, tourism, and software.
--Neil Irwin_____
On Mr. Trump and the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Trump said the Federal Reserve is "doing political things" by holding interest rates at a low level. He charged that the Fed would raise rates as soon as Mr. Obama left office.
This is a baseless accusation. The Fed has held borrowing costs at historically low levels since the financial crisis to encourage economic growth. Some Fed officials would like to raise rates slightly. Some want to wait a little longer. But Fed officials are uniform in dismissing the idea that politics is playing a role in this debate, and outside experts see no evidence that the Fed is misleading the public.
In attacking the Fed, Mr. Trump is plowing across a line that presidential candidates and presidents have observed for the past several decades. There has been a bipartisan consensus that central banks operate most effectively when they are shielded from short-term political pressures. Indeed, President Richard M. Nixon's insistence that the Fed should not raise rates in the early 1970s played a role in unleashing a long era of inflation -- and in convincing his successors that it was better to leave the Fed to its technocratic devices.

On Mrs. Clinton's changing position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.
Mrs. Clinton said she had "hoped it would be a good deal" but that when it was negotiated, she did not agree with the terms. In fact, Mrs. Clinton spoke out more than 40 times in favor of the trade deal, saying it would be a "strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia," without making her support contingent on how it would turn out.
--Mark Landler
Energy and the Environment
On Mrs. Clinton's accusation that Mr. Trump said climate change was a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.
Mr. Trump responded, "I do not say that."
But in 2012, Mr. Trump tweeted, "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive." Over the past year, Mr. Trump has repeatedly called climate change a hoax, and said that he is "not a believer" in the established science of human-caused climate change.

The Candidates
On Mr. Trump's loan from his father.
Mrs. Clinton said it was $14 million in loans from Mr. Trump's father that helped him get his real estate business off the ground. Mr. Trump said it was just a "small" loan. A recent Wall Street Journal article notes a series of loans and gifts that Mr. Trump received from his father, citing a casino disclosure document from 1985 showing that Mr. Trump owed his father and his father's company about $14 million.

_____
On Mr. Trump's claims that the 2008 Clinton campaign was behind questions of President Obama's birthplace.
In defending himself for raising questions about Mr. Obama's birthplace, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton's confidant Sidney Blumenthal pushed those questions on a McClatchy reporter when Obama was running for president in 2008.
A former McClatchy journalist has said that Mr. Blumenthal encouraged him in 2008 to explore Mr. Obama's connections to Kenya, including whether he was born there, but Mr. Blumenthal has flatly denied this.
--Megan Twohey
_____
On Mr. Trump's comments toward women:
At the end of the debate, Mrs. Clinton slammed Mr. Trump for comments he made about a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, pointing out that he had called her "Miss Piggy" and "Miss Housekeeping."
Mr. Trump expressed confusion as to where those comments came from, but Ms. Machado has shared them in multiple interviews this year and Mr. Trump himself has admitted that he openly pushed her to lose weight when he took over the Miss Universe pageant.
--Megan Twohey
Crime
On Mr. Trump's statements on "stop-and-frisk."
Mr. Trump objected to Lester Holt's characterization that "stop-and-frisk," the New York Police Department practice targeting minority and high-crime areas for searching people, had been found to be unconstitutional racial profiling. Mr. Trump said that the judge who issued that ruling had the case taken away from her, and that New York's new mayor had opted not to go forward with defending the policy.
Both Mr. Holt's and Mr. Trump's statements are true. In 2013, a federal judge in New York, Shira A. Scheindlin, struck down the practice as unconstitutional, citing data showing that blacks and Hispanics were being disproportionately stopped. Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, appealed the ruling.
Later in 2013, a federal appeals court removed Judge Scheindlin from the case. But then Bill de Blasio became mayor, dropped the litigation and repudiated the policy, mooting the litigation before it could be resolved at a higher level.

_____
On Mr. Trump's claims that murders are up in New York City.
Mrs. Clinton said they are down. Mrs. Clinton is correct. Crime statistics show that murders are down year on year, to 246 from 257. A spokesman for the New York Police Department weighed in on Twitter to say that murders and shootings are down significantly. "#NYC is on pace to have one of the safest years on record for crime."

Abstract: Government programs -- like Social Security, the earned-income tax credit and food stamps -- have kept tens of millions from sinking into poverty year after year. [...]a main driver behind the impressive 1.2 percentage point decline in the poverty rate, the largest annual drop since 1999, was that the economy finally hit a tipping point after years of steady, if lukewarm, improvement.

Full text:   Not that long ago, Alex Caicedo was stuck working a series of odd jobs and watching his 1984 Chevy Nova cough its last breaths. He could make $21 an hour at the Johnny Rockets food stand at FedEx Field when the Washington Redskins were playing, but the work was spotty.
Today, Mr. Caicedo is an assistant manager at a pizzeria in Gaithersburg, Md., with an annual salary of $40,000 and health benefits. And he is getting ready to move his wife and children out of his mother-in-law's house and into their own place. Doubling up has been a lifesaver, Mr. Caicedo said, "but nobody just wants to move in with their in-laws."
The Caicedos are among the 3.5 million Americans who were able to raise their chins above the poverty line last year, according to census data released this month. More than seven years after the recession ended, employers are finally being compelled to reach deeper into the pools of untapped labor, creating more jobs, especially among retailers, restaurants and hotels, and paying higher wages to attract workers and meet new minimum wage requirements.
"It all came together at the same time," said Diane Swonk, an independent business economist in Chicago. "Lots of employment and wages gains, particularly in the lowest-paying end of the jobs spectrum, combined with minimum-wage increases that started to hit some very large population areas."
Poverty declined among every group. But African-Americans and Hispanics -- who account for more than 45 percent of those below the poverty line of $24,300 for a family of four in most states -- experienced the largest improvement.
Government programs -- like Social Security, the earned-income tax credit and food stamps -- have kept tens of millions from sinking into poverty year after year. But a main driver behind the impressive 1.2 percentage point decline in the poverty rate, the largest annual drop since 1999, was that the economy finally hit a tipping point after years of steady, if lukewarm, improvement.
Over all, 2.9 million more jobs were created from 2014 to 2015, helping millions of unemployed people cross over into the ranks of regular wage earners. Many part-time workers increased the number of hours on the job. Wages, adjusted for inflation, climbed.
"Another hidden benefit was lower prices at the pump," Ms. Swonk said. "People who couldn't afford the commute before could now afford to accept a minimum-wage job."
There are different roads out of poverty, said Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, a social science research institution, but today, one of the most promising is to "go somewhere where they raised the minimum wage."
About 43 million Americans, more than 14 million of them children, are still officially classified as poor, and countless others up and down the income ladder remain worried about their families' financial security. But the Census Bureau's report found that 2015 was the first year since 2008, when the economic downturn began, that the poverty rate fell significantly and incomes for most American households rose.
"If you look under the hood of the census report," Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative research organization American Enterprise Institute, said, "you see more people are working, so fewer people are going to be in poverty."
After a long period of rising inequality, Elise Gould, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington, added, the benefits of the improving economy finally began to seep downward. Wage increases were "even stronger at the bottom than in the middle," she said.
For those on the lower rungs of the income ladder, a step upward can be profound. For some, it means the difference between sleeping on a friend's couch and having a home. For others, it is the change from getting shoes at Goodwill to buying a new pair at Target, or between not having the money to buy your daughter an ice cream cone to getting her a bicycle for her birthday.
The poverty rate fell in 23 states, with Vermont leading the way. The rest stayed flat; none got worse. And other evidence suggests the improvement has continued, if not as strongly, this year.
Mr. Caicedo, 32, initially found his job on Craigslist last summer, starting at $12 an hour. Recently, he was promoted to his salaried position and now drives a 2015 Nissan Pathfinder. His wife was able to leave her job at a clothing store and take care of their four children.
Michael Lastoria, who started the chain called & Pizza where Mr. Caicedo works, said: "We try to pay as close to a fair or living wage as possible," roughly $2 an hour above the minimum with a steady full-time schedule and benefits. "We want people to have careers, not just jobs," he said.
The availability of full-time jobs at a livable wage may be essential to move out of poverty but is not necessarily enough. Many poor people, saddled with a deficient education, inadequate health care and few marketable skills, find small setbacks can quickly set off a downward spiral. The lack of resources can prevent them from even reaching the starting gate: no computer to search job sites, no way to compensate for the bad impression a missing tooth can leave.
Many of those who made it had outsize determination, but also benefited from a government or nonprofit program that provided training, financial counseling, job hunting skills, safe havens and other services.
Cheyvonné Grayson, 29, grew up in South-Central Los Angeles, where he, at the age of 14, saw a friend gunned down. Since graduating from high school, Mr. Grayson has worked mostly as a day laborer. In 2014, he was paying $300 a month to sleep on someone's couch and showing up at 6 a.m., morning after morning, at nonunion construction sites in the hopes of getting work.
Often the supervisors and workers spoke only Spanish, and it was hard to understand the orders and measurements. He remembered one foreman looking him up and down, skeptical that he could do the job.
"I had to prove this man wrong," Mr. Grayson said.
At every site, he said he tried to pick up skills, carefully observing other workers, asking questions and later reinforcing the lessons by watching YouTube videos. Even so, the work was inconsistent and paid poorly, he said.
What made the difference, he said, was getting into the carpenters' union -- a feat he could not have achieved without the help of the Los Angeles Black Worker Center. "That was the door opener," Mr. Grayson said.
He had to borrow a few hundred dollars for fees and tools, but his first apprenticeship as a carpenter started at $16.16 an hour. He quickly moved up to $20.20 an hour and is paid for his further training. He is now hanging doors for new dormitories at the University of Southern California.
For the first time in his life, he opened a bank account.
Seventeen hundred miles east, Christine Magee, a mother of four, joined an intensive self-sufficiency program administered by the Chicago Housing Authority and the Heartland Alliance after she fell into bankruptcy from racking up $22,000 in debt on a credit card. As a recipient of a federal housing voucher, Ms. Magee was eligible to enroll.
She set three goals after joining the program in 2014: buy a house, raise her dismal credit rating and get a better job that would provide for her retirement someday.
"She was really motivated," said her counselor, Barbara Martinez. "Not everyone is."
Ms. Magee's husband has found only sporadic work. But she has moved from a health-technician job that paid $23,000 a year and left her family on Medicaid to one at a veterans hospital that pays more than $35,000 and provides health and educational benefits. The extra earnings automatically went into an escrow account.
A couple of weeks ago, she graduated from the program with more than $8,000 in savings -- which she plans to use for a down payment on a home -- and a bank letter confirming she qualifies for a mortgage.
"I knew," Ms. Magee said, "there was something more out there."

Full text:   PHOENIX -- It was over 100 degrees in the scrubby sprawl on the city's northern frontier earlier this month, but inside the 40-foot-long thermal chamber, it was 48 degrees -- same as it was for the playoff game on that January night in Foxborough, Mass. The floor was covered in green artificial turf, like a football field.
Through a side door was a similarly stark and windowless space, this one at room temperature, the same setting as the officials' locker room in Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots, about 2,300 miles away.
From the outside, the chamber looks like a long storage container plopped on a pavement wasteland behind two seemingly ordinary office buildings. John Pye, a 46-year-old aerospace engineer born and raised in Canada, walked the distance in the glaring light and baking heat of midday and pulled a large door handle, like that on a walk-in freezer.
"We're heading into where we spent about three months of our lives a year and a half ago," Pye said.
And suddenly he was transported to another time, another place, when (and where) N.F.L. footballs and air pressure were all the rage.
The 2016 season has started without the Patriots' star quarterback, Tom Brady, who is serving a four-game suspension for his role, murky as it may be, in Deflategate. Brady and the Patriots were ensnared in a contentious investigation to determine if, for the A.F.C. championship game in January 2015, against the Indianapolis Colts, they conspired to purposely deflate their game-day footballs below league standards for Brady's benefit.
Part of the reason Brady is not playing now is what Pye and his co-workers found then -- or, more precisely, could not find: a plausible scientific explanation for why the Patriots' balls were not fully inflated.
"I would feel bad if I thought I made a mistake or I thought I overlooked something," Pye said. "But we made measurements and put the facts out, and it went from there."
Deflategate was a white-hot controversy in the spring of 2015, most of the heat radiating from New England, like solar flares from the sun. Everyone was an expert, it seemed, willing to explain why the game balls used exclusively by the Patriots were so far below 12.5 pounds per square inch, the N.F.L.'s lowest allowable limit, and whether that even mattered.
Deflategate swept a nation into debates over science (the Ideal Gas Law) and culture (cheating in sports), from the predictable (Can the N.F.L. be trusted? Can the Patriots?) to the less so (What is the effect of vigorous rubbing on a football?). Arguments were clouded by allegiances and conspiracy theories, reports and rumors.
But it was here, in the temperature-controlled silence of a desert bunker, that Pye oversaw months of experiments to try to determine if air was intentionally removed from the footballs, or if the recorded levels could be explained by science.
When the results of the N.F.L.'s investigation were released in May 2015, the sports world devoured it. It was called the Wells report, and the first half of it was filled with circumstantial evidence of foul play and delicious components of a great mystery.
There was the setting, in a modern American castle, the home stadium of the league's top franchise. There was no dead body, but a pile of game-used footballs. There was no smoking gun, but there were conflicting pressure gauges. There was a famous athlete linked to shadowy ball boys by text messages that hinted at a cover-up. There were bungling investigators (game officials) and an unexplained bathroom stop. There was even a rainy night.
Like an ink blot, it became whatever anyone wanted to see.
The second part of the Wells report did not receive the full brunt of attention initially. It was a wonky scientific document filled with equations, tables and graphs, linked by explanations of experimental methods and laws of physics. It was 68 pages, plus a six-page executive summary at the beginning and a nine-page appendix at the end. The title pages said that it was "prepared by" a company called Exponent, of Menlo Park, Calif.
Pye was one of four primary scientists and engineers leading Exponent's investigation. Exponent "identified no set of credible environmental or physical factors that completely accounts for the additional loss in air pressure." It did not say that someone deliberately removed air from the footballs, but it might as well have.
Soon enough, the Exponent report, too, was submerged by scrutiny. With the name of the firm and the men responsible for producing it now public, the attacks came from swarms of Patriots fans, which was to be expected. More surprising, at least to Exponent, the work was pulled apart by other scientists. Several went public with their critiques.
An M.I.T. engineering professor's lecture on the matter drew tens of thousands of viewers on YouTube. A 16-page rebuttal to the Exponent report by the American Enterprise Institute was given instant and wide credibility. ("It is therefore unlikely that the Patriots deflated the footballs," it concluded.) One of the naysaying scientists who received national attention was a Sacramento fourth grader.
Some journalists quickly discredited Exponent entirely, with one columnist calling Exponent "a consulting firm with dubious bona fides" and "a hired gun." Some suggested the data was made up, a case of "falsifying results" to give the N.F.L. what it wanted, and argued that science "meant nothing in this case."
Exponent heard and read it all and said nothing, maintaining what it calls "professional silence" until the entire matter was resolved. That took more than a year of hearings and appeals and talk of Brady taking the case to the United States Supreme Court.
Now that Brady has accepted his punishment and is sitting out, Exponent is finally talking. And it wants everyone to know: It was right all along.
"When we released the report, I stood behind it 100 percent," Gabriel Ganot, one of the four Exponent executives to lead the Deflategate investigation, said. "Having heard whatever everybody has said, and having reviewed the thoughts of the critics, I still stand behind it 100 percent."
Forming the Team
Pye was in his corner office in Phoenix when he got a call from New York. It was Robert Caligiuri, 65, a principal engineer who has worked at Exponent for nearly 30 years and is one of Pye's mentors.
Caligiuri stood alongside Ganot, 32, a materials engineer, in the lobby of the Midtown Hilton. They had just finished a meeting a block away at the New York offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the law firm hired by the N.F.L. to investigate the fast-spreading wildfire already known as Deflategate.
The law firm needed someone to investigate the science portion of the scandal. One of Ganot's former professors at Columbia recommended Exponent.
At the time, Pye was working on a project for Britain's Ministry of Defense, designing robot-driven Land Rovers fitted with ground-penetrating radar systems to detect improvised explosive devices in the Middle East.
"John, we need you to do these tests for us," Pye recalled Caligiuri saying. "It's footballs. I'm going to give you some pressures and I'm going to give you some scenarios, temperatures and environment, and I need you to do some tests."
Pye smiled at the memory.
"It always starts with 'some tests,"' he said.
Caligiuri passed along the basics: The Patriots' footballs were thought to be pumped up to about 12.5 p.s.i. before the game, the Colts' balls at 13 p.s.i. The halftime readings were much lower and varied. The temperature outside was 48 degrees. It was known that the balls were tested at halftime inside, at room temperature: 11 Patriots balls but only four Colts balls, because officials ran out of time. The referee had two gauges, and one was way off.
"These halftime measurements, is there really anything there?" Caligiuri said, boiling down Exponent's mission. "That's the basis for it."
Pye was still on the phone when he started plugging numbers into the Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT. Pressure drops with temperature. The balls would, of course, be deflated by halftime, to some degree.
"My impression from the very first phone call was that this was going to be an explainable thing," Pye said.
Caligiuri called Duane Steffey, 55, a principal scientist for Exponent with a Ph.D. in statistics. He added him to the team, too.
"Is there a real difference here?" Steffey said. "Because we were about to embark on a significant investigation, and if all of this is within the noise level, and within a margin of error, then there's really nothing here. So that's the first thing we did."
Within a day or two, it was clear: The numbers were statistically significant. They could not be fully explained within accepted error margins.
By then, the public was already debating the effect of that night's rain, whether balls lost air when they were used, and the fact that the Patriots were on offense more in the first half. New England Coach Bill Belichick held a news conference to suggest that the "rubbing process" might explain everything.
"We knew this was going to get a lot of scrutiny, from your eighth-grade science classes to your physics professors," Pye said. "So we wanted to try to answer all those questions."
The conference room at Exponent's Phoenix laboratory has vast windows overlooking the mostly shadeless landscape. About 10 scientists and engineers gathered around the room's oval table and tossed around ideas, which were written on a whiteboard.
"Everything we can think of," Pye said. "Whether it's human related, environment related, physics related, materials related, including the football and the gauge itself. We tackle the measurements, we tackle the environment, we tackle the inflation side. And we write this all down, kind of group them, think of ways we can refine this model. And then I get back on the phone to Bob. He's back to Menlo Park at this point, and I said, 'Bob, we've got a plan."'
Caligiuri, a grandfather with a trim white mustache, oversaw everything. Steffey handled the statistics. Pye handled the experiments. Ganot was the go-between, making six trips to Phoenix in the course of a couple of months.
Not all of Exponent's work receives public scrutiny, but Caligiuri knew this would, maybe as much as anything.
"We knew there would be controversy here," Caligiuri said. "And we needed absolutely the best people we could possibly put on it. That's why I organized it the way I did. I knew the way to approach this -- and frankly we had seen the news, we saw the people blaming it on the way he rubbed the footballs and people talking about it and stuff -- and we knew that there were some questionable things out there already. So we knew we needed to be totally bulletproof here."
6,000 Projects a Year
The U-shaped, three-story Exponent headquarters in Menlo Park is about 10 miles from where Tom Brady went to high school. It is fronted by a shallow rectangular pool whose primary feature is a twisted, blue steel beam bent into a loop, like an unfamiliar cursive letter. It was part of a 2,000-foot television transmission tower in Missouri that collapsed during repairs in 1988. Some of the falling beams, 35 feet long and five inches in diameter, buried themselves 40 feet into the ground. Exponent investigated the accident.
In the lobby are oil paintings of two of the five Stanford professors who started the company as Failure Analysis Associates. The company built its reputation on large-scale disasters -- crashed planes, exploded oil rigs, burst pipelines, fallen buildings. One of the paintings is of Alan Tetelman, wearing a bushy 1970s-style mustache and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up. He was president in 1978 when, on his way to investigate a plane crash, he was killed in a plane crash.
The company now employs more than 1,000 people working out of 20 offices, including two in Asia and two in Europe. It went public in 1990 (its ticker symbol was FAIL), changed its named to Exponent in 1998 (ticker symbol: EXPO), and reported revenue of nearly $313 million last year.
Exponent's work force includes nearly 500 employees with doctorates. They include physicists, metallurgists, epidemiologists, automotive engineers and data scientists.
"Everything from A to Z," Caligiuri said. "Architects to zoologists. I think we still have a zoologist."
The work is now fairly divided between "reactive" investigations (what went wrong) and "proactive" projects (product development). For the latter, having its headquarters in Silicon Valley -- Facebook headquarters is a mile away -- was a stroke of good fortune for Exponent. To get an idea of the breadth of companies that have hired Exponent, Caligiuri said, "look at the Fortune 500."
Exponent certainly has its critics. It is often hired by insurance companies and companies in duress, perhaps facing lawsuits and the prospect of monstrous recalls and payouts. And when those companies receive research from Exponent that supports their claims -- that says they or the company they insure were not at fault, for example -- they often use the research to bolster their case, in courtrooms and in the court of public opinion.
Exponent investigated the collapse of the Twin Towers for Swiss Re, one of the World Trade Center's major insurers, after Sept. 11. It was hired by Exxon after the Valdez oil spill and by BP after the Deepwater Horizon explosion. NASA hired Exponent after the space shuttle disasters. The Department of Justice hired Exponent after the Oklahoma City bombing.
Automobile companies routinely hire Exponent to provide backup investigations during scandals, one reason Exponent's 150-acre complex in Phoenix includes a two-mile oval track, for testing -- and crashing -- cars and other vehicles. Exponent's research and experts have sided with the likes of Suzuki (with rollover worries about its Samurai) and Toyota (unintended acceleration). A 2013 Exponent investigation into a long fight over ignition switches in General Motors cars helped lead to a widespread recall.
Such public and controversial cases are a small part of what Exponent does. It works on 6,000 projects each year for 2,000 clients. But some have given Exponent a reputation as a "hired gun," as The Los Angeles Times called Exponent in 2010 -- a company that will provide scientific affirmation and gravitas for a price.
Exponent staunchly denies that its scientific favor can be bought. It says that it is just as likely that its research runs counter to its clients' hopes, but that research then gets tucked away, never to see the light of day.
"Clients hire Exponent because of our reputation for our independent, high quality, thorough and objective technical and scientific evaluations," Exponent's chief executive, Paul Johnston, said in an email. "We frequently give results to clients that are not what they would have wished, which can often be seen through the resulting product recalls."
The first-floor hallways of Exponent's California headquarters are lined with laboratories, all accessible only with an electronic card. There is a biomedical lab with a bone-cutting saw. There is a fluids lab with a combustion chamber. There is a chemistry lab, a photonics lab, a chromatography lab. There are X-ray machines, CT scanners and two scanning electron microscopes.
Client confidentiality is a major issue. To prepare for a visit from a journalist and a photographer, Exponent employees covered a couple of in-progress, large-scale experiments in blue tarps. A 3-D printer in the prototype room was hidden behind paper while it hummed and buzzed.
Out a side door, where the traffic from nearby Highway 101 could be seen and heard, a warehouse is filled with objects from prior experiments. Ganot described it as the warehouse from the final scene of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," but would not permit a look inside. Outside, in the sun, the ground was covered in metal parts and enormous gas pipes, some of them burst, all of them there to be studied because something had gone wrong. A car nearby was covered in a tarp, unidentifiable.
It might be strange, then, that a company that covets discretion and is known, if at all, for investigating disasters that often kill people and can cost billions of dollars in damages, would want to tackle something as mundane and inconsequential as the air inside N.F.L. footballs.
"The visibility of this project fits into some of the largest that we do at this firm," Pye said. "But when you think about the impact? Meh. Not so much. No one is losing their lives here. The building is not burning down. The vehicle is not crashing. The product is still working. Nothing's caught on fire."
So why even get involved?
"It's an interesting scientific problem," Caligiuri said. "It clearly was not as simple as what it was portrayed in the early days. Frankly, it could be controversial, but we are not afraid of controversial matters."
A Gillette Stadium Simulator
The temperature inside the thermal chamber at Exponent's highly secured laboratories in Phoenix can be set anywhere from minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) to 60 (140 degrees Fahrenheit).
Depending on the day, it might hold a car or a truck or batteries or personal electronics or something else that someone wants to test for performance in extreme conditions. In early 2015, during the N.F.L. playoffs, it was filled with hot tubs.
Then the Patriots beat the Colts and the Deflategate scandal began. Thousands of fans and media members converged on Arizona for the Super Bowl in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, unaware that the cold conditions at New England's Gillette Stadium soon would be reconstructed in a thermal lab in the desert a few miles away.
Pye was in charge. He is a gregarious man with the air of a suburban dad. He did not play football but looks as if he could have. Pye and his wife have a son and a daughter, and their son plays football for the freshman team at his high school.
Now Pye can perform a good party trick. Toss him a football and ask about its pressure.
"I'll say 12.3," he said, squeezing one. He stuck a gauge in it and showed the digital result: 12.25.
Pye was born in Kamloops, British Columbia, but his family moved frequently because his father managed hotels. Pye ended up in Florida for high school, then back to the University of Toronto for a degree in engineering science. He earned a master's degree and a doctorate in aerospace engineering at Stanford. That led him to nearby Exponent, where much of Pye's work involves robotics and the military. Since 2005, Pye, now an American citizen, has overseen Exponent's Test and Engineering Center on the far northern edge of Phoenix.
"What we do here is the big stuff," Pye said.
Exponent could have investigated footballs just about anywhere. But Phoenix had a big thermal chamber. It had Pye. And was just about as far from New England as could be.
"A rule we enforced on ourselves is that we had to control for football-fan bias," Pye said. "So we specifically did not involve our Boston office."
Ganot went to Gillette Stadium to examine the scene of the alleged football crime. He wanted to understand the space between the field and the officials' locker room, since temperature transitions were an important part of the experiments. He wanted to examine the room's heating and cooling system, the reliability of its thermostat, the consistency of the room conditions.
The locker room in Arizona was roughly the same size as the one in Gillette Stadium and was set to match the known conditions from the game. Next door, the floor of the "field" was covered in artificial turf. It was not merely decoration. Pye wanted something that could get wet so that when the balls hit the ground, they would pick up moisture, just as they did on that cold, wet night in Massachusetts.
The experiments began with the two gauges used by the referee Walt Anderson -- one called the "logo" gauge, with a Wilson logo on it, the other the "non-logo" gauge. One gave relatively accurate pressure readings, while the other read significantly higher, adding to the cloud of confusion over Deflategate.
Pye's nine-member team analyzed the gauges and compared them to 50 others of the same model. They tested the potential effects of temperature, various ball pressures and battery life. Did it matter that one had a longer needle? (No.) Did it matter who used them? (No.)
Analysis of the gauges consumed 18 pages of the report. Among its conclusions was that the gauges used were different, but consistently different.
About half of the report was devoted to "physical, usage, and environmental effects." Did the balls lose air when used in the game? (According to automated squeezing tests with 650 pounds of force administered 1,000 times, no.) Does vigorous rubbing matter? (Yes, but the effect wears off in 30 minutes, long before the officials would have tested the air pressure before the game.)
As part of those experiments, Pye set up a television replaying the game in real time. Exponent employees imitated what they watched -- throwing the balls, falling on them, shuffling them out of play, wiping them with towels, spraying them with water to simulate rain.
"He was the head ball boy," Pye said, nodding to an employee named Daniel Kingsley.
Kingsley shrugged. Unlike the Patriots' ball boys, he has a Ph.D in mechanical engineering.
The trickiest part of the investigation, and where there remains the most debate, was over the timing of the measurements taken at halftime. The Ideal Gas Law and Gay-Lussac's law are among those that explain how much the air pressure inside something like a football decreases with colder temperatures and increases with warmer ones.
The tougher question facing Deflategate investigators was determining how quickly the internal temperature and pressure of the balls would have changed as the environment changed. And while officials recorded the order of balls as they were measured during about 13 minutes of halftime -- Patriots' balls first -- the exact timing was unclear.
"If you waited forever in the locker room before you took the halftime measurements, they should be the same," Pye said. "The issue was that it was something less than that."
For weeks, Pye and his team ran tests, ball by ball, gauge by gauge, game simulation after game simulation, trying to account for all the possibilities.
In the end, Exponent said that it could not "determine with absolute certainty" whether there had been tampering with New England's balls. The insinuation was more damning.
"We conclude that within the range of game characteristics most likely to have occurred on Game Day, we have identified no set of credible environmental or physical factors that completely accounts for the additional loss in air pressure exhibited by the Patriots game balls as compared to the loss in air pressure exhibited by the Colts game balls," the report said.
"If we had the exact same report and would have said the pressures are explainable, you never would have heard anything about it," Pye said. "The N.F.L. would have said, 'Oh, O.K., and moved on.' You wouldn't have heard about Exponent, you wouldn't have heard about John Pye, you wouldn't have heard about all the things that happened from then."
Three Types of Critics
The report that Pye, Caligiuri, Ganot and Steffey wrote could not have a less sexy title: "The Effect of Various Environmental and Physical Factors on the Measured Internal Pressure of N.F.L. Footballs." They checked it, double-checked it, triple-checked it. They had others at Exponent read it and rerun the numbers. The Princeton physics professor Daniel Marlow, consulted throughout, gave it a final read.
Exponent submitted the report to Paul, Weiss, the law firm in New York. There had been little interaction between the coinciding investigations -- one featuring dozens of interviews and analysis of text messages and fascinating behind-the-scenes accounts and entanglements, and Exponent's dive into the science of air pressure.
(One exception came when Paul, Weiss asked Exponent if it was possible for someone to take a bag of 12 footballs into a bathroom and deflate them, at least a little, in 1 minute 40 seconds. A Patriots ball boy was seen taking balls into the bathroom on the way to the field before the game, and it became the primary theory for how the balls lost their air pressure. Pye found a small office and had several Exponent employees try. Yes, definitely, he told the lawyers in New York.)
On May 6, 2015, the N.F.L. released what instantly became known as the Wells report, named for the lead lawyer in the investigation, Theodore V. Wells Jr. It concluded that it was "more probable than not" that Patriots employees were deliberately releasing air from footballs and that Brady knew about it.
It was prominent news. And as people dug deeper into the report, past the juicy circumstantial evidence, and dipped into the science and data of Exponent's analysis, the Ideal Gas Law had its talk-radio moment. Professors and other scientists questioned Exponent's findings. Columnists tore into Exponent's credentials. The "hired gun" headlines returned.
Exponent officials heard it and read it all. They remained silent as their reputation took shot after shot.
"That was difficult," Caligiuri said. "There's always an urge to respond to critics."
Pye put the critics into three categories. One was the unabashed fan who was "going to make the call on feeling over questions of fact."
"That doesn't bother me at all," Pye said. "That's just the world we live in."
Second were the armchair scientists, those who understood enough to raise reasonable questions, usually quickly dismissed. Exponent anticipated them in this case, which is one reason it conducted every experiment it could think of, even if it knew the answers. "We tried to head those people off," Pye said.
Third were Exponent's peers, the usual audience for Exponent's work. They are the ones who frustrate Exponent most.
"The real world is the real world -- it's not a binary thing," Pye said. "Binary is a human invention; the real world has a continuum. So you need to understand where your work fits on that continuum. To those people, we wanted to provide enough data so that they could understand what we did, but also understand the significance of what we did. What I found, in a lot of criticisms, is that subtlety, that significance piece, was missed."
Caligiuri was more direct.
"What disappoints me the most from the scientific community is they said we didn't do things that we did," he said. "And it's in the report. I believe in the scientific method. I believe in challenging what people say. That's all part of the verification and validation process. I have no problem with that. But if you're going to look at what someone else has put forward as a hypothesis, a theory or experimental verification, you have to understand what they did, and then work from there. And I'm not sure that everybody did that."
A rare chance to set the record straight came at an appeal hearing for Brady at the N.F.L.'s New York offices. Caligiuri and Steffey were among the others questioned and cross-examined.
"The hearing was somewhat therapeutic," Steffey said.
Exponent still receives emails from adamant critics, and its role in Deflategate has cost it several prospective clients, the company said. At least one in the Northeast told Exponent that it could not risk its own credibility by being associated with the company behind the controversial Deflategate science.
But there are no regrets. Brady is sitting out his suspension, and Exponent has moved on. The thermal chamber still has its artificial turf, but it now is testing lithium-ion batteries, not footballs.
"The thing that I wanted to make sure came out when we were no longer quiet was that there's real science here," Pye said. "There's real engineering. We didn't start from feelings. We started from facts -- the facts that we had, which were complete to the degree that they were complete. And we took those as far as we thought science and engineering could take them. And then presented that."
Pye opened the metal door of the chamber. He stepped out of the New England winter night and into the afternoon blast of an Arizona summer.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A divided Federal Reserve, struggling to decide how soon to prune its economic stimulus campaign, said on Wednesday that it would wait at least a little longer.
The Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, although most of its officials said they expected to raise rates by the end of the year.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said she saw no reason to rush. The economy keeps bubbling along without boiling over. "We're generally pleased with how the economy is doing," she said at a news conference. "The economy has a little more room to run than might have previously been thought. That's good news."
But concern is growing among some Fed officials that the central bank is waiting too long to resume moving borrowing costs back toward normal levels. The decision to wait passed by a vote of 7 to 3, the narrowest margin in almost two years. Ms. Yellen said Fed officials had "struggled" to reach a consensus, though she said the disagreement was mostly about a narrow question of timing.
The Fed's latest round of economic projections reflected a broad consensus; 14 of the 17 Fed officials surveyed anticipated at least one rate increase this year.
"The committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence," the Fed said in its postmeeting statement.
The Fed's next meeting is in November, concluding six days before the presidential election, but the Fed is widely expected to defer any decisions until its final meeting of the year in mid-December. Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that the Fed would not consider politics in making its decision, but that line, often repeated by Fed officials, is regarded as tactful rather than truthful.
Fed officials cited the uncertain consequences of Britain's vote to leave the European Union as a reason they did not want to raise rates in June. They are unlikely to act on the eve of a presidential election that could have larger economic consequences.
"The Fed will not want to be seen as influencing political outcomes," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed-income at BlackRock.
Even the decision to wait, however, exposes the Fed to continued attack by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who has repeatedly charged that Ms. Yellen is delaying necessary action to help Democrats.
Ms. Yellen was pressed repeatedly about the Fed's motives Wednesday. "I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy," she said. "We do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions."
The Fed decided to wait despite an upturn in economic conditions after a weak start to the year.
"Growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year," its statement said. It noted consumer spending remained relatively strong, while business investment remained relatively weak, a pattern that continues to defy easy explanation.
The Fed also said it now saw the chances of faster growth as "roughly balanced" against the risks of economic disruption, an improvement over its bleaker outlook in recent years.
"Our decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy," Ms. Yellen said.
(Ms. Yellen, however, indicated the Fed did not include the presidential election in this assessment. Asked, for example, about the economic consequences of Mr. Trump's proposal to impose higher tariffs on imports, she declined to answer, calling that a "political issue.")
So why did the Fed decide to wait? Ms. Yellen said that the growth of the labor market had exceeded the Fed's expectations while inflation remained sluggish, suggesting the economy had room to grow.
One sign of progress is the continuing rebound in the share of American adults in their prime working years, between the ages of 25 and 54, who are working or looking for work.
"More people, presumably in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages, have started actively seeking and finding jobs," Ms. Yellen said. "This is a very welcome development both for the individuals involved and for the nation as a whole."
The three dissenters, all of whom voted in favor of raising interest rates by a quarter-point in September, were Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City; Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; and Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
The statement did not explain their votes, but all three described their concerns in the weeks before the meeting. Mr. Rosengren, a longtime proponent of the Fed's stimulus campaign, has become increasingly concerned that the Fed, by waiting too long to raise rates, will need to move more sharply, a pattern that often ends in a recession.
The last time three Fed officials dissented from a policy decision was nearly two years ago, when a bloc of reserve bank presidents wanted Ms. Yellen to move more quickly to tighten policy.
Notwithstanding the debate about when to take the next step, Fed officials are increasingly agreed that they will not be raising rates for very long. As recently as last September, Fed officials predicted the Fed's benchmark rate would rise to 3.4 percent by the end of 2018. On Wednesday they predicted it would reach just 1.9 percent by that time, and that it would top out at 2.9 percent.
Fed officials are increasingly reconciled to the reality of a downturn in global interest rates that has dampened the force of the Fed's stimulus campaign even as the Fed stands still. The central bank stimulates the economy by pushing borrowing costs below normal levels. The decline in market borrowing costs means that the normal level has been falling toward the Fed's rate.
The Fed remains in a better position to raise rates than other major central banks, which are struggling to drive up inflation in the face of even lower interest rates and weaker growth.
The Bank of Japan tried earlier on Wednesday to reinvigorate its own struggling campaign to bolster inflation, announcing for the first time that it would try to drive inflation above its current 2 percent target. Whether it will succeed is an open question: Despite an aggressive stimulus campaign, now in its fourth year, prices in Japan fell by 0.5 percent during the most recent 12-month period.
The European Central Bank cut its growth and inflation forecasts at its most recent meeting but, like the Bank of Japan, did not increase its stimulus campaign, judging it was doing what it could.
Officials at all three banks have suggested that too much is being asked of monetary policy. They argue that fiscal policy makers must embrace some combination of fiscal stimulus and structural reforms to increase growth, a view shared by a wide range of independent economists.

Abstract: Like regular people keeping accounts at a local bank, lenders hold their unused cash at central banks like the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. The European Central Bank, which oversees monetary policy for countries that use the euro, introduced negative rates in 2014.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Japan's central bank is reviewing its economic policies, asking why they have failed to kick-start growth, as intended. Its much-anticipated report is due on Wednesday. One target is negative interest rates -- an unconventional tactic adopted in Japan and Europe that turns the usual rules of borrowing and lending upside down.
What are negative interest rates?
Negative interest rates mean depositors pay money to save their money, a reversal of the normal rules of economics.
In this case, the depositors are banks. Like regular people keeping accounts at a local bank, lenders hold their unused cash at central banks like the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. Normally, they receive a small amount of interest in return.
But with negative rates, central banks charge a fee instead. The idea is to encourage banks to put their money to more productive use, lending it to households and businesses. Negative rates are supposed to then ripple through economies by lowering the cost of borrowing for everyone -- something that should encourage economic growth.
What sort of countries have negative rates?
Those with ultra-low inflation or deflation, meaning falling prices associated with weak economic growth. The European Central Bank, which oversees monetary policy for countries that use the euro, introduced negative rates in 2014. Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, which are not part of the eurozone, also have negative rates.
Japan's central bank followed in January, announcing that it would charge commercial banks a fee of 0.1 percent on a portion of their reserves that they keep with it.
What does the Bank of Japan hope to accomplish?
The bank is trying to lift consumer prices, which have been sliding for most of the past 20 years. Falling consumer prices hurt corporate revenues, keeping companies from raising wages or spending on new projects.
But the bank's efforts are foundering. Its main tool has been an extensive bond-buying program, similar to policies adopted by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank. Bond-buying injects money into a country's financial system. From there, it is supposed to flow to the rest of the economy.
It worked for a while, but recently the effect has faded. Prices are falling again, and the bank needed to try something new.
Are negative rates working?
Money was already cheap in Japan, and negative rates have succeeded in making it even cheaper. The yield on 10-year government bonds, for instance, fell below zero in February, meaning investors are lending the government money knowing that they will not be repaid in full.
Yet deflation has not vanished: Core consumer prices fell 0.5 percent in July. Nor has there been an explosion of new bank lending, as businesses say they can't find enough profitable uses for funding, even if the money is cheap.
And deflation itself undermines the effectiveness of negative rates. If corporate revenues are shrinking because of falling prices, companies will find that even the most generous loan becomes harder to repay. Many potential borrowers are still telling bankers, "No thanks. Keep your cash."
Still, people must be happy that money is cheap, right?
Not the bankers. Between the new fees they are paying the central bank and a general decline in lending income, profits at commercial banks are being squeezed by negative rates. Some analysts also think negative rates hurt broader public confidence. Policy makers are trying to show creativity in finding ways to revitalize their economies -- but out-there tactics like negative interest rates risk looking more like desperation.

Full text:   The governors of New York and New Jersey have staked out such starkly different positions on the minimum wage that their discord could result in uneven pay scales for thousands of workers at the airports that serve New York City.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, has fully embraced a union-backed campaign for a $15 minimum wage, but Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, vetoed a bill that would have raised his state's minimum wage to $15.
Their rift could result in a decision this week by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to adopt a higher minimum wage for its workers in New York than for those who work at its facilities in New Jersey.
The agency operates the region's three major airports -- La Guardia and Kennedy International in New York City and Newark Liberty International in New Jersey. Airport workers have been agitating for an increase in their minimum wage to $15 an hour for more than two years.
Each governor controls half of the 12 seats on the agency's board of commissioners, so they usually work out their differences privately. But the monthly meeting of the board on Thursday promises a novel showdown. In what some Port Authority insiders say would be a first, the agenda for the meeting lays out competing resolutions on the issue of the minimum wage.
Commissioners will be asked to vote on two options for changing the $10.10 hourly minimum that it set for its facilities in 2014. One calls for the Port Authority to reset to the higher of the two states' minimum wages. The other calls for using the minimum wage that prevails in the state where the facility is, unless it is lower than $10.10.
The difference could be quite large. The New York Legislature agreed this year to changes in the minimum wage that would raise it to $15 for workers in New York City by the end of 2018. New Jersey's minimum wage has been $8.38 an hour since the start of 2015 and is scheduled to rise only to offset inflation.
To go along with New York's higher minimum wage, at least three of the six commissioners from New Jersey would have to vote for the first option. The board chairman, John J. Degnan, an appointee of Mr. Christie, has stated his reluctance to such a large increase in the past.
Some of the other New Jersey commissioners have indicated a willingness to support a raise to $15 an hour, but how they will vote is not altogether clear, said Hector Figueroa, president of 32BJ Service Employees International Union. The union represents about 7,000 workers at the Port Authority's airports who handle baggage, perform customer service and clean terminals and aircraft cabins.
"It's been a difficult campaign," Mr. Figueroa said in an interview. The agency's slow movement on the matter, he added, "shows that there is a rift, that there still is this debate internal to the Port Authority."
Union members have become regular fixtures at the monthly board meetings, pleading for higher wages and benefits, often in Spanish. Some of them grew angry and stormed out of a meeting in November after Mr. Degnan called for a study of the effects of raising wages.
At the May meeting, Gertrudes Lopez-Ortiz, who cleaned United Airlines planes at Newark Liberty, told the commissioners: "For more than a year, I have come to these meetings and told you with tears in my eyes how I struggle to put food on the table because I earn so little money. And still you do nothing."
Last month, the Port Authority posted that study, conducted by the consulting firm Intervistas, on its website. The study concluded that the effects of the 2014 increase to $10.10 an hour had been "mixed but relatively modest," and that employment at the airports had grown since then.
Intervistas cited the complication of the Port Authority's policy of requiring that companies doing business at the airports charge customers what businesses in the surrounding communities charge. That "street pricing" policy could leave some merchants squeezed between a rising cost of labor, particularly in New Jersey because of its lower minimum wage, and a limit on how much of that increase could be passed on to customers.

Full text:   EL FURRIAL, Venezuela -- One oil rig was idle for weeks because a single piece of equipment was missing. Another was attacked by armed gangs who made off with all they could carry. Many oil workers say they are paid so little that they barely eat and have to keep watch over one another in case they faint while high up on the rigs.
Venezuela's petroleum industry, whose vast revenues once fueled the country's Socialist-inspired revolution, underwriting everything from housing to education, is spiraling into disarray.
To add insult to injury, the Venezuelan government has been forced to turn to its nemesis, the United States, for help.
"You call them the empire," said Luis Centeno, a union leader for the oil workers, referring to what government officials call the United States, "and yet you're buying their oil."
The declining oil industry is perhaps the most urgent chapter of Venezuela's economic crisis. Oil accounts for half of the Venezuelan government's revenues, what former President Hugo Chávez once called an "instrument of national development." The state oil company poured its profits, more than $250 billion in all from 2001 to 2015, into the country's social programs, including food imports.
But those profits have evaporated with mismanagement and the drop in global oil prices over the past two years. Now, even Venezuela's subsidized oil shipments to its vital ally Cuba are slowly being phased out, oil executives with operations in Venezuela contend, forcing Havana to look to Russia for cheap oil.
For President Nicolás Maduro -- like Mr. Chávez, who died in 2013, before him -- Venezuela's oil wealth has been essential to the nation's identity and sovereignty, the financial might behind its regional ambitions and its angry defiance of the United States.
The United States has always been a huge market for Venezuela's oil. But with Venezuela's state oil company hobbling along, it was actually forced to start importing oil from the United States.
Early this year, the United States began shipping more than 50,000 barrels a day of the light crude that Venezuela needs to prepare its own oil for export, joining a handful of suppliers that have become vital to keeping the country's oil industry afloat.
Even that lifeline is tenuous. Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, is struggling to pay for the foreign oil. Some tankers wait in port for as long as two weeks to be paid, and sometimes they leave because of a lack of payment, said an oil executive who requested anonymity to avoid reprisals from the government.
The problems are just some of the reasons Venezuela's oil production has plummeted to 2.4 million barrels a day, down 350,000 barrels from a year ago. That is nearly a million barrels below what it was in 1998 when Mr. Chávez took power.
Venezuela is racked by shortages of foods like corn and rice, which it once easily imported using the company's vast foreign currency revenues. Essential medicines like antibiotics have disappeared. The economy is set to contract by 10 percent by the end of the year and has already seen triple-digit inflation.
The price of bread alone has doubled from month to month, now about 50 cents a loaf in many places, at a time when the oil workers here say they are making less than a dollar a day because of the inflation.
"We are practically working for free," said Pedro Velásquez, a supervisor at an oil field in the town of Punta de Mata.
Whatever money the government can muster to improvise patchwork repairs in its oil fields and processing plants is now drying up.
With the state oil company hobbled by debts, two-thirds of its exports go to paying off Chinese and other lenders. The company is running out of resources to pay international technicians, or even its own people.
"The decline is speeding up, and that will continue to happen," said Lisa Viscidi, a Latin America energy expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research institute. "Conditions are getting worse and worse; there's less and less money to invest."
The condition of Venezuela's state oil company has international oil traders concerned that its collapse could jolt an otherwise oversupplied global market. They note that when labor strife brought nearly all production in Venezuela to a halt for several weeks at the end of 2002 and in early 2003, global prices jumped more than 30 percent, marking the first in a series of international crises that ushered in a decade of climbing oil prices.
Venezuela accounts for less of the international oil market today, but its exports still make up roughly 2 percent of the world's output. That means that a serious decline in Venezuelan exports, especially if accompanied by a crisis in Nigeria or Iraq, could tighten the market enough to send oil prices climbing again.
"A collapse in Venezuela would be an accelerator for oil prices; it would be a total shock," said Helima Croft, the chief commodity strategist for Royal Bank of Canada. "This country is literally imploding."
Right now, she added, "There is no oil producer that is falling apart as fast as or as dramatically as Venezuela."
Neither PDVSA nor its American subsidiary Citgo agreed to requests for interviews.
The challenges ahead are ever-present here in the vast oil fields of El Furrial, in northeastern Venezuela. Beneath the flat, grassy expanses lies the very grade of oil that Venezuela must now import to blend with its large reserves of heavy oil to ship them abroad.
At its peak, El Furrial alone produced 453,000 barrels a day, equivalent to about 80 percent of the national production of Ecuador. But in 2009, Mr. Chávez nationalized Wilpro, an American consortium that handled the complex natural gas injection at the site designed to coax more oil out of the ground. Production has declined by more than half.
Workers at El Furrial today tell a story of decline and mismanagement. There is not even enough drilling mud -- the most basic fluid required to keep drill bits cool and well bores clear -- to keep all of the rigs running.
At one PDVSA well pad here, China National Petroleum Corporation now fills the gap left by Wilpro. But the site had not been operating for several weeks because PDVSA had not delivered a vital piece of equipment that suspends tubing over the well.
Once completed, the well might produce 3,500 barrels of oil per day, but it was not clear when that would be.
"It's the first time we've ever gone three weeks waiting this way," said Nelson Ruiz, a manager. "Normally we would get the project going after one signature, and the drill would be in the ground."
But it is the issue of food that is demoralizing the workers the most.
Workers at one production site described how they eat so little food now, they watch out for their co-workers in case they faint. Claudio Lezama, who has spent the past eight years at the site, said he weighed about 200 pounds several years ago. Between his manual labor and being able to afford only one meal a day, he is now 145 pounds.
Sitting in a trailer where workers take their breaks, he said that he worked as a stone mason to afford to feed himself during his time off. A colleague said she had taken to reselling food like yucca, cheese and eggs.
"You're a black-market seller," Mr. Lezama said, chiding her for raising prices when food was in short supply in Venezuela.
In a complaint filed in July by a group of workers at the state oil company, the workers detailed a history of extensive petroleum leaks since 2012 in El Furrial stemming from lack of maintenance and costly infrastructure that was left abandoned.
The complaint said the problems also posed a health risk for surrounding communities.
"All this has been hidden from view, generating multimillion-dollar losses," the complaint said. "We workers are extremely angry because no one has done anything to put a stop to this disaster."
These days, some oil workers fear that simply going to work puts them at risk. Carlos Robles, a union leader, spent a recent afternoon talking to supervisors of a well about a number of attacks by armed gangs who robbed that facility and others of laptops, air-conditioning units and metal equipment.
It was getting to be 6 p.m., the time that workers warned that the gangs begin to prowl; the streets of El Furrial were empty, looking as if a curfew were in place.
"The only thing between us and being robbed is God and the Virgin," said Juan Díaz, a supervisor at the site, as his shift continued into the night.
International service companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger are scaling back their operations as Venezuela's state oil company struggles to pay its debts to them -- as much as $25 billion -- with a flurry of bonds and promissory notes.
And as the production from El Furrial and other fields plummets, the state oil company has to lean ever more heavily on Citgo, which is being forced to leverage to the hilt.
Last year, Citgo borrowed $2.5 billion to keep PDVSA afloat. And now it plans to borrow an additional $800 million to update a refinery on the island of Aruba to produce synthetic light oil, according to executives who have been briefed on the plans.
Mr. Centeno, the union leader, said Venezuela's state oil company had become so strapped that it had stopped providing its workers with new boots, helmets and gloves.
"PDVSA is on the floor now," he said.

Full text:   When the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate last December after keeping it near zero for seven years, Fed officials were in general agreement that they might increase rates as many as four times in 2016.
They thought the United States economy was finally strong enough -- and the prospect of inflation close enough -- that it was time to start raising interest rates back toward the level regarded as normal before the financial crisis.
But the economy did not follow that script. The Fed has not raised rates once this year, and it's unclear when it might do so.
Economic growth has continued, but it has not accelerated. There is still no sign of stronger inflation. And, more broadly, Fed officials have increasingly concluded that the world itself has changed. They no longer expect to return interest rates to precrisis levels. As a result, they are no longer in as much of a hurry to get started.
As Fed policy makers look ahead to their meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, they are increasingly divided over the best way forward. Some say the time has come for another increase in the Fed's benchmark rate. A number of these officials are particularly concerned that low rates are encouraging excessive speculation in areas like commercial real estate. But others argue that the economy is still benefiting from low rates -- and, in the absence of inflation, they see little reason to pull back.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, must extract a consensus from her increasingly fractious committee. She has offered relatively little insight into her own views. In a speech in August, she said the case for raising rates had "strengthened" but did not answer the crucial question: Strong enough? Or not yet?
Mistiming a rate increase has consequences. If the Fed moves too soon, it could derail what remains a relatively weak economic expansion. If it waits too long, it could be forced to hit the brakes even harder.
The Fed Is Wrestling With 3 Questions
1. How many people want jobs?
During an economic recovery, the number of people who can't find work gradually dwindles. Employers start chasing applicants. Wages start to rise. And the Fed starts raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.
Seven years into the current recovery, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.9 percent, a historically normal level, but the rest of the picture doesn't look quite right. The unemployment figure counts only people who are actively seeking work, but millions of adults remain on the sidelines.
By keeping rates low, the Fed could draw more of those people back into the work force. And so far there is no sign of overheating.
2. How low are interest rates?
The Fed cut its benchmark rate by five percentage points in response to the Great Recession. That is five points of stimulus, right? Well, Fed officials are increasingly convinced that it has become more like three points of stimulus.
Global interest rates are in a historic swoon. The problem can be described as a glut of money or an absence of attractive investment opportunities. The result is a narrowing gap between the market rate and the Fed's benchmark rate.
That means the Fed is providing less stimulus than it thought, which in turn means it doesn't need to pull back quite so quickly, since it doesn't have as far to go. But ...
3. What damage is done if the Fed does nothing?
The Fed usually increases rates because it fears inflation, and inflation remains sluggish, in part because of the weakness of the global economy. But Fed officials have other worries. Notably, they are worried about creating future financial crises.
Low rates are intended to encourage financial speculation. But too much risk-taking is not a good thing. And the longer rates stay low, the greater the risks. Fed officials have highlighted some areas, like commercial real estate, but they are also worried about the problems they cannot see. After all, the next crisis usually comes from a different place than the last one.
This fear of the unknown has become a major argument for moving more quickly to raise the benchmark rate.

Full text:   OAKLAND, Calif. -- The docks at the Port of Oakland are a tangle of cranes, shipping containers, railroad tracks and snaking lines of trucks waiting to load and unload cargo.
Streamlining this kind of traffic is one of the few ideas Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton agree on.
Mrs. Clinton has said that if she is elected president, her administration will seek to spend $250 billion over five years on repairing and improving the nation's infrastructure -- not just ports but roads, bridges, energy systems and high-speed broadband -- and would put an additional $25 billion toward a national infrastructure bank to spur related business investments. Mr. Trump said he wanted to go even bigger, saying his administration would spend at least twice as much as Mrs. Clinton.
Mr. Trump, taking a page from liberal economists, said he would fund his plan by borrowing several hundred billion dollars, but has offered no specifics. Mrs. Clinton's more detailed proposal, by contrast, would be paid for by a business tax overhaul aimed at collecting additional revenue from companies that have parked assets abroad.
These are only plans, of course. Either would have to get through Congress and the inevitable acrimony over any proposal to raise taxes or add to the national debt.
Still, the candidates' agreement, combined with growing accord among economists that increased spending on infrastructure could invigorate the American economy and raise overall living standards, has led to a cautious optimism that some sort of big public works push is coming, regardless of who is elected.
"The next administration will be in prime position to deliver on a comprehensive infrastructure plan," said Tom Jensen, vice president for transportation policy at UPS.
Infrastructure spending, unlike many other forms of government outlays, holds the power to give the economy a sustained lift for decades down the line.
First comes the addition of jobs -- particularly the kinds of higher-wage blue-collar jobs that have been lost in recent years -- and spending on products like concrete and steel to build new roads and repair worn-out bridges. After that initial jolt, the economy would continue to reap the important but harder-to-measure benefits of fewer delays, faster internet connections and more reliable power.
You can see much of that here at one of the nation's busiest ports, an export hub that sends tons of important California products like Napa Valley wine, Central Valley almonds and Silicon Valley Teslas to China's growing middle class.
Aiming to gain other ports' market share, Oakland has embarked on a number of projects -- some big, some small -- to add cargo and speed things up. There are new traffic-reducing measures, such as an appointment system for trucks picking up cargo and extended hours at its largest terminal.
It is also working on several infrastructure projects: This year, the port applied for a $140 million federal grant to build a bridge over a choked intersection where trucks waste time waiting for trains to pass. A half-mile away sit 14 new rail lines that are part of a new operation where shippers can transfer products from one container to another without leaving the port.
Shipping companies often make these transfers at off-site warehouses -- wasting more time and money. The Port of Oakland, which acts as a landlord, is hoping its investment will entice companies to move more cargo to its docks.
This would not just give the port more rent. The economy would also gain additional jobs as private sector shippers added their own money to erect buildings near the port's rail connection, and fill them with machines.
Weakness in those kinds of business investments is one reason the current economic recovery has been so sluggish. Companies' spending on new buildings and equipment, which depends in part on improvements in the nation's transportation network and energy and digital pipelines, has been a persistent weak point throughout the nation's recovery from the Great Recession.
The federal government, with its wide latitude to spend on ambitious projects, is in a singular position to make investments no one else will.
But the government's power to act has also set off a robust debate about how much more it should spend on infrastructure and how it should be funded. Spend too little, and the nation's backbone deteriorates and the cost of future repairs mounts. Spend too much too fast, and the government could crowd out private investment, possibly leading to higher inflation and pushing up interest rates.
Today, with maintenance lacking and interest rates low, a host of influential economists, including Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, argue that America's need for better infrastructure is so great that it could increase its debt load and still come out ahead.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Summers laid out his case: The federal government can borrow at something like 1 percent interest a year, and through enhanced productivity it would reap something like 3 percent a year in higher tax receipts.
"I am as worried about the debt burden on my children's generation as anybody, but deferring maintenance on the foundation of our economy is a much greater risk to them," Mr. Summers said.
Others argue that any rise in infrastructure spending should be paid for through a tax increase or budget cuts elsewhere. That view was bolstered by a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that while federal investment increased productivity, that did not automatically mean the nation would be better off by borrowing to fund such investment.
Decades ago, the federal government spent big. The Interstate System of highways spawned new suburbs, and transportation grants helped build rail networks like the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, whose commuter trains hum past the Port of Oakland as they travel to and from San Francisco.
Now the United States has more people and a bigger economy. But relative to its gross domestic product, the nation spends only about half as much on infrastructure as it did during the 1950s and '60s.
The result is that, like the population itself, America's roads, bridges and power plants are aging. That's one reason the American Society of Civil Engineers, in its most recent report card on infrastructure, gave the United States a D-plus despite the extra infrastructure spending that flowed from the big 2009 economic recovery act.
The costs are substantial, if hard to see. Neglect the water system, and you may have leaky pipes and larger bills, or even lead contamination. Rough roads equal more flat tires. Substandard internet connections add to the isolation of rural communities.
Each day, UPS drivers in northern New Jersey and New York City lose an average of 16 minutes -- often much longer -- to heavy traffic. Six years ago the company started dispatching an additional 61 drivers to make sure everyone hit their stops, and it would need more drivers if traffic got worse.
Of course, even if tens of billions of dollars more were set aside for road improvements, that would not on its own guarantee that traffic congestion would ease. Infrastructure may be among the most bipartisan of federal spending areas, but politics in general can be a problem. One of the persistent criticisms from economists is federal lawmakers' tendency to spread cash across the country instead of focusing on places where the economic payoff would be greatest.
And apart from the debate over how to pay for national upgrades, there is the question of how much can be gained from additional infrastructure spending versus how much can be gained by making better use of what is already in place. Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution and a longtime critic of how the government builds and runs the nation's transportation infrastructure, laid out a long list.
An increase in infrastructure spending would still lift the economy, Mr. Winston said, "but my God, wouldn't it be so much better if we were more thoughtful about what we do with the money we have?"
This, at least, is where the nation's D-plus grade turns out to be good news. Economists say infrastructure's productivity lift is greatest when investment is being raised from low levels. Put another way: The more broken down the nation becomes, the harder it is to find something that does not need to be fixed.
"We're not talking about bridges to nowhere," Mr. Summers said. "We're talking about bridges that are on the verge of collapsing."

Full text:   BEIRUT, Lebanon -- In Aleppo, there are again reports of dead children. In Damascus, clashes reverberate close to downtown.
Across Syria, airstrikes are inching back into the realm of the expected, and the United States acknowledged on Saturday that its warplanes had inadvertently bombed Syrian government troops.
After less than a week, the partial cease-fire declared by Russia and the United States is fraying. Help has still not reached those who need it most, despite promises at the start of the truce that the government would allow aid convoys to travel.
'Machine Guns Never Stop at Night'
Homam al-Asaad, 28, a resident of Saraqeb in Idlib Province, where the fighting continues, was ambivalent about the truce.
Some civilians, who were displaced to our village from others, moved back to their houses. They are happy with the truce, and those who were delaying their marriages are getting married now.
But militarily speaking, it still feels the same: Fighter jets are still bombing, and machine guns never stop at night. Civilians still drive their vehicles with lights turned off to avoid being a target. Fighters are still on the front line because they don't trust the regime and the truce.
But I think this truce or any truce is always good since people are really tired of the war. I don't think the truce is the solution. But still, having a truce to relieve the people is needed.
'Our Daily Life Is Miserable'
Fattah Issa, 38, lives in Kobani, a border town in northern Syria controlled by Kurdish militias that is far from the front lines. An ethnic Kurd who left a government job in Damascus when fighting began, he shared a video message from in front of a border gate, which Turkey keeps virtually sealed.
The truce didn't much affect life in Kobani. The war is now taking place around Aleppo city, and here, in the northern countryside of the province, it is calmer now.
Kobani's problem now is inflation and the blockade imposed by Turkey. Our daily life is miserable, for all of us. The instability and continuous displacement, all because they couldn't reach a solution to this crisis.
I hope the cease-fire will lead to an inclusive truce in the region and a political solution that recognizes the rights of the Kurds in Syria, so we can have our cultural rights like the rest of the Syrians.
'No One Respects the Cease-Fire'
Abu Yaman, 45, a Transport Ministry employee in Damascus, was jarred awake on Saturday morning by some of the most intense fighting there in weeks. The clashes, he said, reminded him of when rebels were on the offensive in the city four years ago.
Yesterday, I woke up at 7:45 a.m. to the loud sound of a rocket that landed near the Crush soda factory, 300 meters from my neighborhood. The clashes lasted two hours, heavy guns, mortar shells, ambulances taking soldiers to Tishreen Military Hospital nearby.
It just took two hours of clashes to make me completely forget there is supposed to be a cease-fire in Syria. I stayed home and didn't leave because the regime forces cut the road. My windows shook, and my children woke up, again, to explosions.
I heard from the regime television channels that the rebels were waging a big offensive to move closer to Abassiyeen Square, but the regime forces stopped them. The rebels said the opposite. In the end, we understood that no one respects the cease-fire and it won't last long.
Many People Were Injured by Snipers
Abdelkafi al-Hamdo, a teacher and antigovernment activist in the rebel-held eastern district of the divided city of Aleppo, described the faltering cease-fire in a series of text messages.
Today I had a walk again with my wife and my daughter, for the fourth day. When we were near the old city, people shouted at me, "Don't walk on that side." I asked them why. They told me that yesterday many people were injured by snipers in this place. I was shocked because I had walked in this side before the truce many times and, fortunately, I hadn't been shot.
A few hours later, he added:
It seems that machine guns, snipers, tank bombs and many weapons are not included in the cease-fire.
And he passed along a message about an older patient from a friend who works in a hospital.
Uncle Abu Abdo came to us saying, "I need a doctor to treat my ears that are damaged by Assad's barrel bombs." I apologized, telling him no specialist doctor in Aleppo. He said with sorrow: "What is our guilt to be killed and injured without treatment? Even the treatment is forbidden."

Full text:   Eight years ago, President Obama pledged to wind down the war in Iraq and redouble efforts to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan. "As president, I will make the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban the top priority that it should be," he said during a campaign speech. "This is a war that we have to win."
Lasting peace, Mr. Obama said, would depend on not only defeating the Taliban but helping "Afghans grow their economy from the bottom up." He added, "We cannot lose Afghanistan to a future of narco-terrorism."
Now, at the twilight of his presidency, these goals are receding further into the distance as America's longest war deteriorates into a slow, messy slog. Yet despite this grim reality, there has been no substantive debate about Afghanistan policy on the campaign trail this year. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton has outlined a vision to turn around, or withdraw from, a flailing military campaign.
The war in Afghanistan has cost American taxpayers in excess of $800 billion -- including $115 billion for a reconstruction effort, more than the inflation-adjusted amount the United States spent on the Marshall Plan. The Afghan government remains weak, corrupt and roiled by internal rivalries. The casualty rate for Afghan troops is unsustainable. The economy is in shambles. Resurgent Taliban forces are gaining ground in rural areas and are carrying out barbaric attacks in the heart of Kabul, the capital. Despite an international investment of several billion dollars in counternarcotics initiatives, the opium trade remains a pillar of the economy and a key source of revenue for the insurgency.
"It does not appear that the Afghan forces in the near future will be able to defeat the Taliban," said a senior administration official who spoke about the White House's appraisal of the campaign on the condition of anonymity. "Nor is it clear that the Taliban will make any significant strategic gains or be able to take and hold on to strategic terrain. It's a very ugly, very costly stalemate."
The administration's current strategy commits the United States to keeping roughly 8,400 troops in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future and spending several billion dollars each year subsidizing the Afghan security forces. The goal has been to coax the Taliban to the negotiating table by beating them on the battlefield, a prospect that now seems remote.
The next American president may be tempted to adopt the Obama policy and hope for the best. That would be a mistake. At the very least, the next administration needs to carry out a top-to-bottom review of the war, one that unflinchingly addresses fundamental questions.
One such question is whether the Afghan Taliban -- an insurgency that has never had aspirations to operate outside the region -- is an enemy Washington should continue to fight. American forces started battling the Taliban in 2001 because the group had provided safe haven for Al Qaeda, which was based there when it planned the Sept. 11 attacks. While Al Qaeda has largely been defeated, the Taliban has proved to be extraordinarily resilient.
Another question is what it would take to bring the conflict to an end -- either by enabling Afghan forces to defeat the Taliban or by bringing them into the political fold -- and whether that is something the United States is realistically capable of achieving.
This will not be an easy discussion. A precipitous drawdown from Afghanistan may well have calamitous consequences in the short run, exacerbating the exodus of refugees and expanding the area of ungoverned territory in which extremist groups could once again subject Afghans to despotism and plot attacks on the West.
But American taxpayers and Afghans, who have endured decades of war, need a plan better than the current policy, which offers good intentions, wishful thinking and ever-worsening results.

Full text:   LONDON -- After delaying a project to build a nuclear power plant with Chinese investment, Britain's government on Thursday gave the go-ahead for the plant, but insisted on new conditions designed to protect the security of critical infrastructure.
The decision ended weeks of uncertainty that had strained relations with China, which is financing more than a third of the $23.7 billion power station, and with France, whose largely state-owned energy giant EDF is paying for the bulk of the project.
By pressing ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant on the Somerset coast of England, Prime Minister Theresa May appears to be open to greater involvement by China in Britain's energy industry. China also wants to build and operate a nuclear plant of its own design at another British site, at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex.
Mrs. May said in July that her government would not yet sign off on the Hinkley Point deal, reportedly on security and economic grounds, deciding instead to review the plans for the new power plant. It was one of her first big political moves after succeeding David Cameron as prime minister, and was seen as a sign that she was uncomfortable with some aspects of Mr. Cameron's aggressive pursuit of an economic partnership with Beijing.
In recent weeks, Mrs. May has upended a variety of Mr. Cameron's domestic policies. She has abandoned his financial targets and, most recently, overturned his education policy by advocating for allowing selective admissions in schools.
Thursday's decision suggested that the price of any significant policy shift on the Hinkley project would simply have been too high.
If the project did not proceed, the French energy firm, EDF, would have made claims to be compensated for development and construction; trade with China would have almost certainly suffered; and Britain would have lost out on the Hinkley plant's production, expected to be able to cover 7 percent of the country's electricity needs. And with around 26,000 jobs at stake, British trade unions were campaigning for the power station to go ahead.
Britain's energy secretary, Greg Clark, promised on Thursday that the government "will introduce a series of measures to enhance security and will ensure Hinkley cannot change hands without the government's agreement."
"After Hinkley, the British government will take a special share in all future nuclear new build projects," he added.
That announcement seemed designed to increase British control over critical aspects of national infrastructure, similar to those exercised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
After the delay to the Hinkley project's approval was announced in July, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said in a commentary that it added "uncertainties to the 'Golden Era' of China-U.K. ties."
"China can wait for a rational British government to make responsible decisions," the editorial said, "but cannot tolerate any unwanted accusation against its sincere and benign willingness for win-win cooperation."
With its huge economic muscle, China is a formidable trade partner for Britain, particularly after Britain's vote to quit the European Union. Mrs. May's government is hoping to boost trade with non-European partners. She and President Xi Jinping of China met at the gathering of Group of 20 leaders this month in Hangzhou, China.
On Thursday, China's CGN, which is one of the partners in the Hinkley deal, said it was "delighted that the British government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation."
Michel Sapin, the French finance and economy minister, said in a statement Thursday that the decision was "a major step in French-British industrial and energy cooperation."
However the opposition Labour Party in Britain dismissed the new security safeguards announced by the government as "window dressing," saying that most of the protection they afforded could already be achieved under existing legislation.
Critics of the Hinkley project said the British government had ignored the biggest failing of the project: It is a bad deal for the money.
In exchange for building the plant, EDF has been guaranteed 92.50 pounds (about $120) for every megawatt hour of electricity produced, rising with inflation, for 35 years -- equivalent to more than twice the current wholesale price of electricity.
In a Twitter post, Caroline Lucas, a lawmaker and co-leader of the Green Party, described the decision as "stunningly short sighted," adding: "We need clean, renewable energy not an outdated, overpriced white elephant."

After 4 Months of Gains, Retail Sales Take a Cautious Turn

Abstract: Rising incomes and job growth have trickled into consumer spending, supporting economic growth even as a strong dollar and low energy prices have hurt the United States industrial sector.

Full text:   Shoppers in the United States took a step back in August, cutting their spending on cars, furniture and building materials to bring down total retail sales after four straight months of gains.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that retail sales fell 0.3 percent in August, a sign of caution in American consumers.
Rising incomes and job growth have trickled into consumer spending, supporting economic growth even as a strong dollar and low energy prices have hurt the United States industrial sector. Over the first eight months of the year, retail sales rose 2.9 percent compared with that period in 2015.
"The underlying fundamentals for the consumer remain quite strong," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. "That makes August's clunker of a report a little hard to explain."
Mr. Stanley noted that the decline in retail sales might reflect some doldrums before the presidential election and that sales reports in the next few months would be critical.
Still, consumers clearly appeared to pause in August. Spending on building material and furniture dipped, though home sales have been healthy in recent months. Auto dealers reported declining sales ahead of the new model year. Sales also fell at gas stations, largely reflecting the lower price of oil. Even online and catalog sales, a sector that usually posts strong gains, slipped.
Not all categories declined. Back-to-school shopping appeared to bolster sales of clothing. And spending at restaurants and grocery stores also improved.
The solid retail spending of previous months had defied the anemic economic growth in the first half of 2016. Retail sales seemed to largely track a robust pace of hiring, which similarly went against the slowing pace of overall economic growth.
The unemployment rate remains a healthy 4.9 percent. And monthly job gains have averaged 232,000 since June, an indication that many employers expect growth to pick up.
More Americans are also finally enjoying solid income gains. The median household income jumped 5.2 percent last year to an inflation-adjusted level of $56,516, the Census Bureau said on Tuesday. It was the largest annual increase since 1967, when the government started reporting the data.
Still, the durable but sluggish recovery means that incomes have not yet fully recovered from the recession. The median household still earns 1.6 percent less than it did in 2007, before the downturn struck.

Abstract: The Labor Department said producer prices fell in August as gas and food prices declined. The stock is mired in a five-day losing streak that has pulled its value down 7.5 percent since regulators said that the bank opened more than 2 million accounts and credit cards without customers' consent, with some generating fees.

Full text:   Stocks on Wall Street changed course again on Thursday and climbed as Apple led a big gain for technology companies and energy companies recovered some of their recent losses. Investors looked over a series of mixed economic reports as they sought clues about the Federal Reserve's intentions and the health of the economy.
Energy companies bounced back after two rough days, though the price of oil rose only a small amount. Health care and phone company stocks also climbed. Bond yields wobbled and finished little changed, a sign that investors were not sure what would happen with interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 177.71 points, or 1 percent, to 18,212.48. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 21.49 points, or 1 percent, to 2,147.26. The Nasdaq composite gained 75.92 points, or 1.5 percent, to 5,249.69.
It was the fourth big move for the market in five days as investors tried to anticipate whether the Fed would raise interest rates next week. Based on weaker producer prices and manufacturing and less spending by shoppers, investors appeared to conclude that rates would remain unchanged for now.
Apple rose to its highest price in nine months on reports of strong preorders for the new iPhones it introduced last week. The stock, up 12 percent this week, added $3.80, or 3.4 percent, to $115.57. Other technology companies also rose. Microsoft gained 93 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $57.19 and Intel picked up 94 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $36.56.
Benchmark crude rose 33 cents to $43.91 per barrel in New York. It fell almost 6 percent in the last two days. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 74 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $46.59 a barrel in London. Among energy stocks, Marathon Petroleum rose $1.87, or 4.5 percent, to $43.74 and Chevron gained $1.08, or 1.1 percent, to $99.50.
Investors pored over a series of economic reports. The Labor Department said producer prices fell in August as gas and food prices declined. Lower producer prices reduce inflation, and the Fed has said it wants to see evidence that inflation is edging upward before it raises rates. Inflation has remained consistently low in recent years.
Bond prices wobbled. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 1.70 percent.
Among companies in the news, Goodyear Tire & Rubber climbed after the company raised its dividend and said it planned to return $4 billion to shareholders over the next few years. The stock rose $1.58, or 5.1 percent, to $32.39.
Aerie Pharmaceuticals surged $9.48, or 44.9 percent, to $30.61 after the company reported positive results from a late-stage trial of Roclatan, an experimental glaucoma drug.
AMC Networks fell $1.44, or 2.8 percent, to $50.53 after a Stifel Nicolaus analyst, Benjamin Mogil, downgraded the company because competition is growing and ratings for its hit "The Walking Dead" may weaken as the show enters its seventh season.
Wells Fargo lost 37 cents to $46.15. The stock is mired in a five-day losing streak that has pulled its value down 7.5 percent since regulators said that the bank opened more than 2 million accounts and credit cards without customers' consent, with some generating fees.
The price of gold fell $8.00 to $1,313.50 an ounce and silver lost 3 cents to $19.04 an ounce. Copper remained at $2.16 a pound.
The dollar slid to 102.13 yen from 102.43 yen. The euro dipped to $1.1246 from $1.1249.
The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares traded 0.9 percent higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.5 percent while the CAC 40 in France edged up 0.1 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 tumbled 1.3 percent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.6 percent.

Full text:   Only serious nerds like me eagerly await the annual Census Bureau reports on income, poverty and health insurance. But the just-released reports on 2015 justified the anticipation.
We expected good news; but last year, it turns out, the economy partied like it was 1999. And this tells us something very important -- namely, that a government that wants to can make American society more equitable, improving the quality of life for ordinary families.
The reports showed strong progress on three fronts: rapid growth in the incomes of ordinary families -- median income rose a remarkable 5.2 percent; a substantial decline in the poverty rate; and a significant further rise in health insurance coverage after 2014's gains. It was a trifecta that we haven't hit since, yes, 1999.
It's true that the surge in median income comes after years of disappointment, and even now the typical family's income, adjusted for inflation, is slightly lower than it was before the financial crisis. But the percentage of Americans without health insurance is now at a record low. And the overall performance of the Obama economy has given the lie to much of the criticism leveled at President Obama's policies.
Think back to the 2012 election campaign. There were already signs of the conspiracy-theory, bigotry-driven politics of this year's election; Donald Trump was loudly proclaiming that Mr. Obama's birth certificate was fake, and Mitt Romney eagerly accepted Mr. Trump's endorsement.
But there was also something of a policy debate. Republicans accused Mr. Obama of being a "redistributionist," taking money away from "job creators" to give free stuff to the 47 percent. And they claimed that these socialistic policies were destroying incentives and blocking economic recovery.
There was, in fact, a grain of truth in the first part of this accusation. Mr. Obama is no socialist, but since his re-election he has presided over a significant rise in taxes on high incomes. In fact, the top one percent is now paying about the same share of its income in federal taxes as it did in 1979, before Ronald Reagan began the era of big tax cuts for the rich. And some of the increased tax take is being used to subsidize health insurance for middle- and lower-income families.
Conservatives predicted disaster from these initiatives. Tax hikes on the rich, they insisted, would stall the economy. Obamacare's combination of regulation and subsidies, they declared, would kill millions of jobs without increasing the number of Americans with insurance.
What happened instead after Mr. Obama was re-elected was the best job growth since the 1990s. But family incomes, at least as estimated by the Census, continued to lag. So there was still some statistical basis for the right's Obama-bashing. Now that statistical basis is gone.
You might ask whether these numbers reflect reality. It's often claimed that Americans aren't feeling any economic recovery -- and if anyone were to ask Mr. Trump, he would no doubt claim that the Census numbers, like every number he doesn't like, are cooked.
But be wary of polling on this issue. When Americans are asked how the economy is doing, many of them just repeat what they think they heard on Fox News: By large margins, Republicans say that unemployment is up and the stock market is down under Mr. Obama, the opposite of the truth. On the other hand, when you ask people how well they personally are doing, the Obama years have been marked by large improvements -- a sharp increase in the percentage of Americans who see themselves as thriving.
So the good news is real. And it should (but won't) finally break the grip of trickle-down ideology on much of our political class.
You know how the argument goes: Any attempt to help working families directly, we're told, will backfire by hurting the economy as a whole. So we must cut taxes on those "job creators" instead, counting on a rising tide to raise all boats.
It would be an exaggeration to say that the Obama administration has done the reverse, but there definitely was an element of trickle-up economics in its response to the Great Recession: Much of the stimulus involved expanding the social safety net, not just to protect the vulnerable, but to increase purchasing power and sustain demand. And in general Obama-era policies have tried to help families directly, rather than by showering benefits on the rich and hoping that the benefits trickle down.
Now the results of this policy experiment are in, and they're not bad. They could have been better: The stimulus should have been bigger and more sustained, and Republican opposition hamstrung the administration's economic policy after the first two years. Still, progressive policies have worked, and the critics of those policies have been proved wrong.

Full text:   For years, the standard knock on this economic expansion has been twofold: Growth has been slow, and big businesses and wealthy investors have been its major beneficiaries, rather than middle-class wage earners.
And it has been a fair criticism. At least until recently.
The growth rate is still disappointingly slow, but that second part no longer appears to be true. After all these years, the fruits of the recovery are now being delivered more broadly. While all the attention is focused on new census data confirming the change, it is actually a broad range of evidence that makes the case compelling.
The most decisive evidence of improving fortunes is found in new census data released Tuesday showing that median household income rose a whopping 5.2 percent in 2015, to around $56,500. According to that data, incomes rose for black families, white families, Hispanic families and Asian-American families. It rose for young people and in households headed by middle-aged adults and older people. In short, the improvement was across the board to a remarkable degree.
Those new census numbers don't come as a complete shock. And there's little reason to think they're a statistical aberration. Rather, they are broadly consistent with a body of evidence that shows inflation-adjusted incomes for the mass of Americans have finally started to rise in a meaningful way.
One dirty secret of economic analysis is that there is no perfect way to measure the financial well-being of 320 million Americans. Every measurement of income is flawed in its own way. So the best we can do is look at how people are doing from a range of measures, understand the differences among them and what they show.
For example, the median household income numbers released Tuesday aren't adjusted for changes in the size of a typical household. Two individuals making $50,000 and living separately form two middle-income households; if they move in together, they form a single high-income household. Shifts in how many people marry, divorce or cohabitate can shift the apparent median household income without changing the underlying economic well-being of the middle class.
You could look at income measures per person rather than per household, such as per-capita disposable personal income data compiled by the Commerce Department. But because that is an average, it can mask shifts in distribution. If a billionaire like Bill Gates walks into a bar, the average wealth of the people therein will be astronomical, but it doesn't mean the typical patron can now afford to switch from drinking Miller Lite to Dom Pérignon Champagne.
Flaws acknowledged, that measure has showed consistent annual real per-person after-tax income growth since the start of 2014, and that number is up 10.3 percent since the expansion began in mid-2009.
Or maybe you want to focus more on the status of wages, rather than broader measures of income. After all, it is people's earnings from a job, rather than from a pension or investments, that reflect underlying economic conditions. One way of looking at that is the Labor Department's data on average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory employees, a longstanding data series on what working stiffs take home in wages.
It has also been rising, at around a 2.5 percent rate before factoring in for inflation, which has been low enough to make that extra 2.5 percent in hourly pay add up to a gain in purchasing power. Part of the story behind the good median income numbers for 2015 is that oil prices fell sharply that year, pulling down inflation and helping the after-inflation income gain look higher.
Or maybe you want to adjust shifts in income for things like the value of tax credits and social welfare benefits, and the value of health care and other benefits received. The Congressional Budget Office does that math -- but with such long time lags that the 2013 numbers were published only recently.
So how does the current economic expansion stack up according to some of the more readily available measures of income? How did Americans fare in the period from 2010 to 2015, for example, compared with the five-year periods following the end of the previous two recessions (that would be 1992-1997 and 2002-2007)?
The 5.6 percent rise in median household income from 2010 to 2015 is a great deal better than in the mid-2000s expansion and somewhat worse than in the mid-1990s recovery. Using inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers, the mid-1990s and current expansion are about the same, compared with no gain in the mid-2000s. Both the poorest and richest Americans did better in the 1990s but worse in the mid-2000s.
Interestingly, that pattern reverses when looking at per-capita personal income. That measure was strongest in the mid-2000s, perhaps reflecting strong income gains at the top of the ladder (there's Bill Gates walking into a bar again).
So the good news is that this expansion is generating stronger income growth for typical American families than they experienced in the early part of this century. The bad news is that it falls short of the results from the mid-1990s. The five-year time horizon used here -- 1992-1997 -- understates the strength of that expansion, because the economy was in an all-out boom from 1998 to 2000. The median household still makes 1.6 percent less in inflation-adjusted terms than it did in 2007, before the global financial crisis.
It's worth celebrating the real progress finally being made in getting the benefits of the expansion spread more broadly. But we will need the caveat that it isn't hard to find evidence that the gains could be stronger still.
