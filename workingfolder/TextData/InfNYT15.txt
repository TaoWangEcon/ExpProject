Full text:   Consumer debt is rising. How Americans handle that load and how much cash they spend will determine the fortunes of an important stock sector.
Stocks that benefit from consumer spending -- including those in categories like autos, home furnishings, retailers and restaurants -- have been very strong performers recently. Over the three years through December, consumer discretionary stocks returned more than 18 percent annually, on average, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
But what does the future hold for this sector? On the positive side, unemployment rates continue to decline, wages have grown modestly among lower-income earners, and plummeting energy prices have given consumers more spending firepower.
Consumer debt, however, has been inching back up after contracting for years. At the end of the third quarter it totaled $12 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It peaked at $12.68 trillion in 2008, but dropped during a wave of foreclosures. Since late 2013, however, consumer borrowing again has been rising.
Recent data also show that defaults on various types of consumer loans have been ticking up. Default rates on bank cards, first mortgages and auto loans rose in November, according to the S&P/Experian Consumer Credit Default Indices.
Consumer debt cuts both ways, of course. In moderation, it can help encourage economic activity. Carried too far, it can create bubbles that threaten the economy. Some analysts say debt is still in the helpful stages and consumer spending therefore has room for nontoxic growth. "We still see the consumer leading economic growth," said Sam Stovall, United States equity strategist with S&P Capital IQ. He predicted consumer spending would grow 3.1 percent in 2016, spurred by gains in jobs and wages.
Jay Nogueira, head of the global consumer sector for T. Rowe Price, was cautiously bullish about the consumer discretionary sector. Credit card debt per household is $6,900, he said, placing it only at 2004 levels, well below the 2007 peak of $8,600. In addition, he said, "Housing is set up for a long and steady recovery, as opposed to boom and bust." He favors stocks like Home Depot, Williams-Sonoma, Whirlpool and Mohawk Industries.
One argument for a continuing housing rebound comes from Brad Sorensen, head of market and sector analysis for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Homeownership peaked before the financial crisis at 69 percent, he said, and has fallen to about 63 percent. There is room for growth, he said.
But even bulls on consumer spending see areas of concern. For example, auto lending has emerged as a highly profitable area for banks, and just about anyone can get a car loan these days, said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities for BMO Global Asset Management. "Once you walk into a showroom, money will be no object," he said.
Similarly, Mr. Sorensen warned: "The standards have loosened, and all people are able to get loans. They are letting the weakly creditworthy get loans."
Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst with Bankrate.com, said only a small fraction of auto loans were made at the zero percent interest rates trumpeted on television. In an auto showroom recently, he said, a salesman told him that at that moment the dealership was negotiating several loans at "20 percent or above."
Still, auto loans are not that big, in aggregate, compared with housing debt. Statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show that auto loans increased by more than 12 percent from the third quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2015. That left the total of auto credit at $1.05 trillion, a small fraction of the more than $8 trillion of mortgage debt.
Also of concern for the consumer sector, some large retailers have had disappointing performances recently. Among the worst hit was Macy's. Its stock has fallen to roughly $35 a share from a mid-July peak above $70.
Barbara Miller, a portfolio manager with the Federated Kaufmann fund, sees "more competition from Internet sites" as a major factor. To keep up with Internet rivals, she added, department stores must also increase spending on technology, further deflating results.
Mr. Nogueira of T. Rowe Price said the sell-off had gone too far. "I think it's an overreaction," he said. One big reason for poor sales at Macy's and other chain stores was the warm November and December weather, he said. Macy's has also been hurt by the strong dollar, which has depressed its traditionally robust tourist business.
Investors who are not scared off by retailers' problems -- or by loosening standards and mushrooming debt in auto loans -- can choose from a variety of funds that track consumer discretionary stocks. These include the Fidelity Select Consumer Discretionary fund and the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary E.T.F.
The level of prevailing interest rates will affect consumer spending, but the impact of the Federal Reserve's recent increase in short-term rates is far from clear. Mr. Stovall said that even if the Fed continued to raise rates, they were likely to remain very low for some time.
It is even possible that if inflation increases as the Fed expects, real interest rates will lag, essentially giving consumers negative inflation-adjusted interest rates down the road. That would be good news for borrowers and for an economy that depends on hefty but manageable consumer debt. "Consumers will be leading the way in economic growth," Mr. Stovall said. Investors in the consumer discretionary sector will certainly hope so.

Abstract: Nearly every other significant asset class fared worse, too, including investment-grade bonds and less creditworthy high-yield issues, foreign currencies and commodities like gold and oil. International stock funds fell 2.9 percent, as losses in emerging markets, mainland Asia and Latin America more than offset gains in Europe and Japan.

Full text:   The stock market withstood fierce punishment last year and had almost nothing to show for it. A strong fourth quarter healed some of the damage but as the year closed and 2016 began, the battering in the market began yet again.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended 2015 at 2,043.94, down just 0.7 percent for the year, after a late rally helped the benchmark recover most of the ground lost during a sharp summertime swoon. The 6.5 percent fourth-quarter gain followed a 6.9 percent third-quarter decline.
One reason for the flat-but-volatile performance is that there was much to worry about, yet not much happened.
"The markets went nowhere all year because there was a lot of noise and we were waiting for the Fed," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
Wall Street and the world waited nearly all year for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The central bank obliged at last in mid-December, nudging the target for its main short-term rate up by a quarter percentage point and suggesting that more increases were coming in 2016.
As for the noise, "we worried about Greece blowing the euro up, China slowing down and another government shutdown" in the United States, Mr. Kelly said. "We worried about them, but in the end they didn't become a real problem. They just kept people on the sidelines. Not that these problems have gone away, but we've managed to look through them."
Investors lately have done more than look. They have endured another pummeling. A plunge in the Chinese currency, the renminbi, apparently on fears of economic weakness, led to a sharp drop in Chinese stocks in two of the year's first three trading days that spilled over into markets worldwide. The S.&P. 500 lost 6 percent in the first week of trading, the worst start to a year ever.
That was a departure from the placid and profitable fourth quarter. The average domestic stock fund was up 4.3 percent, according to Morningstar, led by double-digit gains for portfolios that concentrate on technology and health care. International stock funds rose 3.3 percent, as China and Japan outperformed.
The fourth-quarter gains alleviated widespread weakness that had been masked by comparative strength in the large companies that dominate the S.&P. 500. The full-year decline in the index still allowed it to outperform shares of smaller companies and nearly all major foreign markets, especially in the developing world. Nearly every other significant asset class fared worse, too, including investment-grade bonds and less creditworthy high-yield issues, foreign currencies and commodities like gold and oil.
For all of 2015, the average domestic stock fund fell 1.3 percent, with specialists in small companies down 5 percent and midsize companies down 4.4 percent. Average losses exceeded 20 percent for portfolios that concentrate on energy and other commodities.
International stock funds fell 2.9 percent, as losses in emerging markets, mainland Asia and Latin America more than offset gains in Europe and Japan.
For all the turbulence before the fourth quarter and so far in 2016, the markets seemed to take the Fed's rate increase in stride. The S.&P. 500 closed December almost exactly where it was on Dec. 15, the day before the move, and the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds was 2.27 percent on both days.
Bond funds were nevertheless weak to poor. The average one fell 0.7 percent during the fourth quarter, hurt by a 2 percent decline in the high-yield niche. For the full year, bond funds in general were off 1.4 percent, with high-yield bonds losing 4 percent.
Although Wall Street accepted the rate increase graciously, some investment advisers wish that it hadn't happened and wonder how markets will perform this year, especially if the Fed keeps raising rates.
"They did it because they felt they had to," said Hank Herrmann, chief executive of Waddell & Reed. "I don't think the data necessarily supported doing it."
GDPNow, a forecasting tool of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, estimated on Jan. 6 that the economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter. The forecast has eroded steadily from nearly 3 percent two months earlier.
The Fed has signaled that it will raise rates four times this year, but the markets don't believe it, and neither does Mr. Herrmann. Based on prices of interest-rate derivatives, two further increases are expected. He anticipates either one or none.
"Economic data will provide the answer, and I think it's going to remain something less than robust," he said. "I don't think we have an inflation threat. There's still room for employment to increase and not cause a lift in wages."
Charles de Vaulx, chief investment officer at International Value Advisers, is concerned that inflation will bubble up. He also worries about the opposite problem: deflation. Either could occur, he warned, as the Fed tries to step back from crisis mode and return to normal monetary policy while the world pares excessive debt on the books of governments, businesses and consumers.
"It's a binary outcome. Will deflationary trends stay in place for another 10 years or will there be inflation?" Mr. de Vaulx said. "The outcome is unknown, and investors have to acknowledge their ignorance. They should avoid making a one-way bet," by overemphasizing government bonds, for example, to safeguard against deflation, or commodities to hedge against inflation.
Whichever way it plays out, he foresees anemic long-term performance, or worse, for many investments.
"Stocks and bonds will be able to deliver exceedingly low returns for the next five to seven years," he predicted. "Investors have to plan accordingly."
That means buying a diverse group of assets, stressing ones that appear cheap. For Mr. de Vaulx that includes stocks and bonds in emerging markets; high-yield debt, particularly bonds issued by oil-service companies; and gold and other commodities. He also encourages stockpiling cash, which he called "a critical tool to have in a low-return environment where volatility may be with us for a while."
"The key is to have realistic expectations, then diversify, hold cash, be nimble, be willing to be contrarian," he advised.
Robert J. Horrocks, chief investment officer of Matthews International Capital Management, questions how realistic the Fed's economic expectations are and what the consequences will be for Asia if growth remains soft.
"The jury is still out on how strong underlying growth in the U.S. economy is," Mr. Horrocks said. "Inflation is still well contained. The Fed was pretty fast off the mark, and I suspect that worries some Asian markets."
That's because growth prospects in the region aren't so great, either, and its central banks haven't been much looser with monetary policy than the Fed.
"In the very short term, we have some headwinds," he said. "I'm not sure how strong the case is" for emphasizing Asia "at a time when the Fed is raising rates."
Asian stocks aren't cheap, Mr. Horrocks pointed out, although he thinks valuations compare favorably with American and European markets. Looking past the near future, "the underlying elements that support growth and ultimately increase profits are still there in Asia," he added, including stronger productivity growth than other regions and more rapidly expanding economic output.
He recommends high-quality companies that pay healthy dividends and have strong competitive positions within their industries. Of the two big mainland markets, he prefers China to India, but he finds good opportunities at lower prices in Thailand and Malaysia. He would also seek out "middle-class growth stories" in industries like retailing, insurance, health care and consumer staples.
Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at GMO, likewise finds the short-term economic outlook daunting, and not just in Asia. He pointed out that the value and volume of global trade shrank last year, something that has never occurred outside of a recession.
Mr. Inker encourages investors to go cheap and go abroad. His preferred destination is emerging markets, which have suffered from high indebtedness and weak prices in commodities like the oil and industrial metals that they export. Emerging markets took a turn for the worse -- funds that focus on them fell 13.4 percent in 2015 -- as the dollar grew stronger, reducing the dollar value of their assets and raising the burden of the dollar-denominated debt that proliferates in the developing world.
"There's a lot to be afraid of there, but generally the best money is to be made where people fear to go," he said. "People have given up on emerging; you can buy good companies at really cheap prices."
Oil prices are bound to recover at some point, he added, but he conceded that it could take a while.
"It's hard to imagine a situation where the price stays at $30 to $40 a barrel for long if the world is producing as much oil as it consumes," he said, noting that "production activity has come to a screeching halt."
Among American assets, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities offer better value for safety-conscious investors than conventional Treasury instruments, Mr. Inker said. He also considers it worth taking a chance on high-yield bonds for the long haul, but he cautioned that they "could get worse before they get better."
Mr. Kelly of J.P. Morgan also favors high-yield bonds, even though he expects economic and investment conditions to get better before they get worse now that the Fed has begun to raise interest rates. The first move to raise rates in a tightening cycle can lift the economy by putting more money into the hands of savers, he said, while borrowers on fixed-rates loans often see no change for a while. Home sales can improve, too, as the prospect of higher mortgage rates compel buyers to act.
After that initial activity, growth slows and further rate increases can choke off a recovery. That's what Mr. Kelly envisions.
"You want to avoid a situation where you're raising rates as the economy is slowing down," he said. Because the Fed waited so long, "there's a risk of that toward the end of the year. We have the potential for a typical central-bank-induced boom and bust."
Before it happens, Mr. Kelly expects stocks in economically sensitive sectors like financial services and consumer cyclicals to outperform. He also likes emerging markets. The appreciation of the dollar in anticipation of rising interest rates has hurt them, but now that rates are heading up, the dollar may reverse course.
"My instinct is if something is cheap and good for long-term investors, don't wait for a better buying opportunity," he said.
But many investors in 2016 have focused on selling opportunities, especially in assets that took spectacular drops in 2015, like oil and Chinese stocks. Mr. Herrmann wonders if the Fed will be all that eager to tighten credit further. He would stick with safer investments, including Treasury bonds and stocks in sectors that can generate growth in an anemic economy, such as health care, technology and consumer staples. He also advised being prepared for more excitement, like it or not.
"It's a confusing time," Mr. Herrmann said. "You have to predict the unpredictable now more than ever."

Full text:   TEHRAN -- On the day that crushing international sanctions against Iran were to be lifted, state television opened its morning hourly news program with an item on children's vaccinations. There were no flag-waving youths or cheering crowds on Tehran's streets, just the usual Saturday morning rush hour, the start of the Iranian workweek.
The low-key reception given "implementation day," when the nuclear deal was finally completed and Iran was freed to rejoin the international economy, reflected the multiple disappointments and broken promises Iranians have experienced in the two years the negotiations dragged on. While the government talked up the deal to lift people's hopes, few expected to see any improvement in their lives.
"I haven't seen any excitement," said Ali Shoja, an office cleaner riding the Tehran subway on his way to work. "They speak of billions of dollars coming, but as in the past, I don't expect those dollars to reach my pockets."
Even the swap of seven Iranians held in American prisons for the Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and three other Americans held here failed to stir up interest.
State television had its own reason to play down the milestone. The end to the sanctions is a success for the government of President Hassan Rouhani, but comes at a cost for Iran's ruling system. Since the deal was signed in July, Iran has had to put into storage more than 12,000 centrifuges, ship out almost its entire stockpile of enriched uranium and remove the core of its heavy-water reactor. Many officials, especially hard-liners, find it hard to present the nuclear agreement as a victory, especially when so much was given up in compromise.
"Nuclear burial," the hard-line newspaper Vatan-e Emrouz wrote in a headline on its front page on Saturday, showing a picture of freshly poured concrete, similar to what replaced the core of the reactor.
The government, at odds with the hard-liners, prefers to focus on the economic gains Iran can expect now that sanctions, some in place since 2007, are lifted. Mr. Rouhani also emphasizes at almost every opportunity how, during his administration, Iran has stepped out of its isolation.
Indeed, the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is planning his second visit to the country; the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, will visit Tehran on Jan. 22; and Mr. Rouhani will visit Italy and France immediately after Mr. Xi leaves.
At the center of the diplomatic activity stand the big rewards of the nuclear agreement -- Iran's vast natural resources, which go well beyond oil and gas, and access to one of the last untapped markets in the world. Several deals have already been made, awaiting only the lifting of the sanctions.
Mr. Rouhani likes to call the deal a "win-win" for both sides, though conservatives in both Iran and the United States say it is more win-lose, with the other side winning. Whatever the outcome of that debate, Iran indisputably will once again be able to sell its oil and make international financial transactions. But as Europe and Asia gear up for their share of the bonanza, businesses in the United States, the main broker of the nuclear agreement, will mostly be watching from the sidelines.
Iran's appetite for investments and imports goes beyond its oil and gas industry, though officials here have said they need at least $150 billion and possibly much more to keep crude oil flowing in the coming decades. "Basically we need everything: hundreds of planes, new ports, an update of our infrastructure," said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to Mr. Rouhani's government.
American companies are showing interest, but sanctions dating to 1984, when Iran was designated a state sponsor of terrorism, will force them to work through subsidiaries. Because of that, one analyst predicted, European and Asian companies will divvy up the Iranian market.
American companies "will wait at least until after the U.S. presidential elections" before making any serious moves, to see who wins, said Amir Cyrus Razzaghi, the president of the Ara Enterprise Group, a Tehran-based business consultancy. The risk of a Republican winning and reimposing harsh sanctions, he said, was too great. "In reality, any American company will only come a year later."
It might take even longer, given the hodgepodge of sanctions still in place and removable only by a Republican-dominated Congress that has no interest in lifting them.
With some exceptions, there is still an American trade embargo with Iran, largely preventing most Americans from doing business with Iran and vice versa. While Iranian financial institutions will once again have access to the international banking system, they generally cannot use it to conduct transactions that go to -- or even through -- the United States, as many major financial transactions now do.
"Iran was under sanctions before the nuclear issue came about, and the window of business that the United States will be able to do with Iran will remain quite narrow, almost as narrow as it is now," said Farhad Alavi, the managing partner of the Akrivis Law Group, a Washington firm that specializes in sanctions law and export controls.
Even after implementation day, a complicated maze of exceptions to the remaining American sanctions will "give much pause" to United States businesses, Mr. Alavi said.
Iran complied with the requirements of the nuclear deal at breakneck speed, something that analysts attributed to Mr. Rouhani's wish to bring that triumph to critical parliamentary elections in February. But there was another reason. Insiders admit that the government is near bankruptcy, after years of burning up savings, and that the economy has all but ground to a halt.
Iranians see the signs everywhere. "My husband owns a shop for ladies' coats, and he hasn't sold a thing in the past few weeks," said Mojgan Faraji, an unemployed former journalist. The implementation of the deal will "mostly have a positive psychological impact," she said. "After that, we'd have to wait to see whether purchasing power will increase."
Under the weight of the sanctions, declining oil sales and, lately, declining oil prices, Tehran has been forced to scrap direct cash handouts for some of the wealthier strata of society. Middle-class Iranians, hurt by inflation that only recently declined from 42 percent to 12 percent, wonder whether the rate has really dropped as far as the government has been saying.
"What is getting cheaper, tell me?" one woman could be overheard saying in a Tehran taxi last week. Gasoline and utilities have become more expensive, as have rents. Housing prices have recently gone down, the Tehran real estate organization has said. A slump in sales has also been reported.
Few think the lifting of sanctions will mean an overnight improvement in their financial situation. Cynicism has the upper hand, after years of what many say were empty promises of improvement.
"I do not follow the nuclear news," said Ali Baseri, a 45-year-old printing-house worker who was taking his father to the hospital. "How will this solve my economic problems? I do not care, and I don't see anybody around me caring."
Many point to the drop in oil prices. Historically, oil sales have provided a third to a half of the government's annual budget expenditures. But the price collapse endangers that.
Iran itself will contribute to the problem after sanctions are lifted, adding 500,000 barrels a day on top of the approximately 1.2 million barrels now being produced daily. The aim, the oil minister, Bijan Zangeneh, has repeatedly said, is to eventually return to the former production capacity of 4 million barrels a day.
"Iran is determined and will be able to fulfill its wish to increase the export of oil and gas, even if the oil price drops to $5 per barrel," Farshad Ghorbanpour, an analyst in Tehran, said. He also said that after implementation, Iran's fleet of oil tankers could once again obtain international insurance and start working.
The end of the sanctions will also give a lift to trade and commerce. "Now, we have over 1,000 letters of credit waiting to be accepted by international banks," said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political commentator with close ties to the government.
Mr. Razzaghi, the consultant, said he was entertaining representatives from a Turkish company who were thinking of investing over $100 million in food processing operations. He also said that a European bank had shown interest in the potential purchase of a midsize Iranian bank.
"But that would be a long process, maybe two to three years," he said. "What matters is that after the implementation things will start moving."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. SHOULD a Phoenix-area jeweler be able to create his own private insurance company to cover his jewelry stores against possible terrorist attacks, specifically those "relating to radioactivity from a 'dirty' bomb or from nuclear fuel or nuclear waste"?
And should he be allowed to sell such terrorism policies to other small business owners who operate in large cities, even though the insurance he created openly states that it will not cover claims in cities with more than 1.5 million people?
The answer, the Internal Revenue Service said in a 422-page response, is no. The business owner's lawyers said it was perfectly legal. A judge is expected to rule in the case this year.
That ruling may determine the future strategies of entrepreneurs and small-business owners who have set up their own insurance companies to cover all manner of risks, some against likely occurrences, others less so.
Establishing these so-called captive insurance companies, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of private companies, is perfectly legal where there are legitimate insurance needs not covered by commercial insurance companies. Captives have become increasingly popular in the last decade because they greatly reduce affluent business owners' tax bills.
The premiums paid to the captive are tax-deductible. (The tax code has allowed premiums of up to $1.2 million a year to be tax-free.)
Some small captives are coming under scrutiny when the insurable risks -- many for things unlikely to happen or already covered more economically by commercial insurance -- are being used as a way to sidestep taxes, since few, if any, claims are paid out. And the money paid into the captive can be transferred to heirs at greatly reduced tax rates.
The I.R.S. is using the captive set up by Benyamin and Orna Avrahami, the owners of the Arizona jewelry stores, to challenge the validity of some small captives. It is arguing in its brief filed in United States Tax Court that the couple should not be able to deduct the premiums paid to their captive insurer.
How many captives have exploited the tax rules is hard to know, because captives are regulated by individual states -- as is any insurance company -- and some, as in the Avrahami case, have incorporated themselves offshore, which gives them an added layer of secrecy.
Captives face other challenges as well. Congress included language in its 2015 appropriations bill that tightens the rules that grant people large tax breaks on the premiums they pay into these insurance companies. The rules take effect next year.
"What you're going to see is a lot of people scrambling to understand what's happening," said David J. Slenn, a lawyer at Quarles & Brady in Naples, Fla., and the chairman of the American Bar Association's captive insurance committee. "They're going to have to fix the structure so in 2017 they qualify to make the election" to get a tax break on the premiums.
Concern about small captive insurance companies has been percolating since they landed on the "Dirty Dozen List of Tax Scams" published by the I.R.S. last year.
If the small captive doesn't pay out insurance claims, the money accumulates as it does in a commercial insurance company. The company could elect to pay dividends to the people who own the captive. In the abusive structures, lawyers and accountants say, the captives pay out little in claims and the people receiving dividends are the children or grandchildren of the people who set up the insurers.
While those dividends would be taxed, the rate would be far lower than the income tax rate that the business owner would have avoided in putting the premiums into the captive, and the money would go to the heirs without being subject to the much higher gift-tax rate.
In the appropriations bill, Congress set out to make this more difficult. At first glance, the appropriations bill seemed to give small captives a lift by increasing the tax-deductible premium in 2017 to $2.2 million and indexing it to inflation.
But Congress then added new hurdles. To prove that they are entitled to a tax deduction of the premiums, small captives now must meet one of two requirements.
One requires that a captive prove that no more than 20 percent of the premiums come from one policyholder. Jay D. Adkisson, former chairman of the A.B.A. captive insurance committee and a lawyer at Riser Adkisson, said captives owned by one person wouldn't be able to meet this standard. Policyholder is defined in such a way that all family members are treated as one policyholder.
The second requirement prohibits an insured company from being wholly owned by one person and the captive by his or her heirs. And it limits the difference in ownership to 2 percent, Mr. Adkisson said. If, for example, the insured company were owned 100 percent by the parents, their children could own only 2 percent of the captive.
"People are scrambling to understand that ownership rule," Mr. Slenn said. "It can be pretty dangerous, and not just to those who are trying to abuse the transfer tax."
There could, for example, be business owners who have used captives to pay claims but at the same time, on the advice of their accountants and lawyers, have named their children as the owners of the captive as part of an estate planning strategy. Or, Mr. Slenn said, there could be trusts that own the small captives as well as other assets, but it is the business owner's children who are the ultimate beneficiaries. Still, in some situations, certain types of trusts may still work.
There is also no allowance for an existing captive to be grandfathered in under the new guidelines. If people don't make changes this year, they could be subject to the taxes that a regular captive pays next year. A captive could also find itself responding to an I.R.S. investigation, litigation or penalties. Yet if the owners unwind the small captive, they could be hit with capital gains taxes on the premiums paid into the captive, Mr. Slenn said.
The I.R.S. has signaled in the Avrahami case that it may be stepping up its enforcement efforts. At the very least, the agency seems to be making an example of this couple, who took what the I.R.S. deemed aggressive steps in the construction of their small captive.
The couple enlisted Celia R. Clark, one of the lawyers in this field who has written about the estate tax benefits of captives. With her assistance, the couple created a captive with restrictions on the amount, manner and reason it would pay out claims. (It paid out a claim only after the I.R.S. began investigating it.) It also, the I.R.S. says in its brief, seemed to base its annual premium on the size of the tax deduction the couple needed for a given year and not on the price of the risk it was insuring.
"In one year, you have half the premium charged, when there hasn't been any change in the exposures presented by the risk," said Donald W. Bendure, a risk and insurance management consultant at Robert Hughes Associates. He recently criticized the Avrahamis' captive in a call for American Bar Association members. "It really does have to make sense."
Mr. Adkisson, in the same call, was even harsher in his criticism: "The formalities are followed, but they're undone by email. Celia Clark, the owner of the company, the tax attorney and the C.P.A. are talking about a lot of issues where they make it pretty clear that what they're trying to do is create Kabuki theater for the service so if the service takes a look, it looks like a real captive."
Ms. Clark declined to comment. Tim A. Tarter, a tax lawyer in Phoenix who is the Avrahamis' defense lawyer, said, "We believe the facts support a finding that this was set up the way it was intended -- to insure risks that are not available commercially or to provide gap-type coverage."
While tax planners are often aggressive on behalf of their clients, there are many other owners of small captives who will need to rethink what they have done.
"This is years of some bad practices finally coming to light," Mr. Slenn said. "A lot of people are waiting to see what happens with Avrahami."

Correction: January 20, 2016, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Personal Finance pages on Saturday about a crackdown on so-called captive insurance companies, which are established by businesses ostensibly to protect against risk but that often also greatly reduce their owners' tax bills, misstated the action such companies must now take to demonstrate they are entitled to a tax deduction of premiums. They must either prove that no more than 20 percent of the premiums come from one policyholder, or that an insured company is not wholly owned by one person and the captive by his or her heirs. They do not need to prove both of those things.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Industrial production in the United States fell last month, and the Labor Department's Producer Price Index slipped.
The reports released on Friday followed weak figures on construction, manufacturing and export growth that suggested a significant cooling of domestic growth in the last quarter of 2015.
Business inventories were also weak, posting their biggest drop in slightly more than four years in November.
Despite a strong labor market, prospects for consumer spending are not encouraging against the backdrop of the stock market sell-off. While a separate report showed the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 93.3 early this month from 92.6 in December, household perceptions of conditions weakened.
The economy has been hammered by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand, which have undermined manufacturing and export-oriented industries. Spending cuts in the energy sector and business efforts to cut an inventory overhang have also been drags.
"The economy got hit from all sides in December," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. "If these weak data keep going into 2016, the outlook is going to grow even dimmer given the recent financial market turbulence and the fears over what a slowdown in China means for the rest of the world."
Businesses stepped up efforts to reduce the merchandise bloat. A report from the Commerce Department showed that inventories fell 0.2 percent in November, the largest drop since September 2011. Inventories dipped 0.1 percent in October.
The Federal Reserve said industrial production fell 0.4 percent in December, primarily as a result of cuts in utilities and mining, after declining 0.9 percent in November. For the fourth quarter, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 3.4 percent.
The weakness could prompt economists to lower their fourth-quarter estimates of gross domestic product, which range from an annual rate of 0.5 percent to 1.4 percent. The economy grew at a 2 percent pace in the third quarter.
The Labor Department's report said the Producer Price Index slipped 0.2 percent after increasing 0.3 percent in November. In the 12 months through December, the index declined 1.0 percent, after falling 1.1 percent in November. Producer prices fell 1 percent in 2015, the weakest since the series started in 2010, after rising 0.9 percent in 2014.
After a report on Thursday showing a steep drop in import prices in December, weak producer prices suggest that an anticipated increase in inflation will probably fall short of the Fed's 2 percent target.
Inflation, which has been tamed by dollar strength, tepid wage growth and cheaper oil, is expected to rise this year as 2015's weak figures fall out of the calculation. The inflation outlook will most likely determine the timing of further interest rate increases by the Fed, which last month imposed the first rate increase in nearly a decade.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. It may be time for everyone to take the markets seriously again.
As stock prices started tumbling in the first trading days of the year, many Wall Street professionals were tempted to describe the declines as the sort of adjustment that the market has gone through in recent years before moving higher.
But that optimism evaporated this week as the selling intensified. Concerns are now growing that the markets are signaling that the United States economy, despite its recent bright spots, is on the verge of a slowdown.
The fear is that economic problems in China have set off negative reactions around the world that could ultimately weigh on American households and corporations.
On Friday, stocks in the United States touched their lowest levels since late August. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the main benchmark for the United States market, is now down 8 percent for 2016 and nearly 12 percent below its benchmark high reached last year.
Oil prices resumed their decline, settling below $30 a barrel on concerns about China and a potential flood of new oil from Iran.
In the face of the market turmoil, investors are showing signs that they are again seeking out safe-haven investments like government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined to 2.05 percent from 2.09 percent on Thursday, after earlier falling below 2 percent for the first time since October.
"Technically we are in a bear market," said Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world's largest money management company.
"There is just a broad reassessment of risk right now."
A bear market occurs when stocks are down more than 20 percent from a high. The Russell 2,000, a measure of small-cap stocks, is actually down 23 percent from its peak. It fell 1.75 percent on Friday.
The debate now is whether the steep drops in the markets are an indication that the United States economy is falling into a trough that the country's economic policy makers have not anticipated. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates in December, a move that showed that the Fed was on balance optimistic about the outlook for the United States economy.
On the one hand, it is important not to read too much into market moves. Markets often misinterpret what is really going on in the economy. The stock market came roaring back from sharp declines in 2011 and, more recently, from a rout last summer.
Also, since the financial crisis of 2008, the United States economy has displayed the ability to power through rough patches in financial markets.
Analysts note that the world's central banks can always increase their stimulus policies if the economies they watch over start to sag again.
The global sell-off in stocks started in China, where the main Shanghai index dropped 3.6 percent on Friday. The index has fallen more than 20 percent from its December high. Stocks in London ended down 1.93 percent. Stocks in Frankfurt closed down 2.54 percent.
The S.&P. 500 ended Friday down 41.51 points, or 2.16 percent. The much narrower Dow Jones industrial average fell 390.97 points, or 2.39 percent. The Nasdaq composite index declined 2.74 percent.
Investors were quick to sell companies that appear most vulnerable to a drop in global growth.
Shares of Intel, the giant chip maker, for instance, plummeted over 9 percent on Friday. When reporting earnings Thursday afternoon, Stacy J. Smith, Intel's chief financial officer, made comments about future sales that unsettled investors. "This outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious on the level of economic growth, particularly in China," Mr. Smith said.
Investors also shunned shares of companies that had soared in 2015. Netflix, which fell 2.8 percent on Friday, is now down 20 percent from its high in 2015.
The turbulence in the markets is causing pessimism over the economy to grow. And economists say they are taking seriously some of the signals they see in markets. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, asserted that the markets that, in effect, predict interest rates and inflation appear to be doing a better job than, say, officials at the Fed.
Such markets have in recent months been more pessimistic, predicting lower interest rates and inflation, both of which can act as an early warning of lower economic growth ahead.
"Here's where I believe the market has it right," Mr. Bernstein said.
A month ago, investors in an interest rates futures market were predicting a nearly 90 percent chance that the Fed would increase interest rates in April, according to Bloomberg. Now that market is predicting only a 32 percent chance.
The United States economy is expected to grow 2.5 percent this year, according to a poll by Reuters of over 90 economists. A year ago, they were forecasting growth of 2.8 percent.
One school of pessimists asserts that the central banks' policies used to stimulate slowing economies since the crisis are losing effectiveness. Such policies stoked huge increases in debt that borrowers will now struggle to pay back, causing broader stress on large economies. This threat seems particularly large in China, which unleashed a credit binge after 2008, but the defaults in the United States energy industry are also a sign of how debt-fueled growth can backfire.
A less gloomy camp contends that markets are just getting used to a world that is going to grow more slowly than in the past. Stock markets may struggle for a time, they say, but they are not going to crash and they are not signaling a severe global recession.
A lukewarm economic outlook could be heard in the comments from the executives of United States banks that are reporting their fourth-quarter earnings.
Wells Fargo, which derives the vast majority of its business from the United States, said on Friday that while there were hopeful signs in the domestic housing and auto markets, economic activity was by no means roaring.
"There are pockets of strength," John Stumpf, the Wells Fargo chief executive, in a call with analysts. "I am not going to say it is robust."
The bank's executives expect lower gas prices to bolster growth more broadly, as consumers and businesses enjoy smaller energy bills. Still, Mr. Stumpf added, consumers "have not spent a lot of their gas savings."
Likewise, Mr. Fink of BlackRock expressed concern that low energy prices here and abroad were not feeding through into the real economy.
"We have just not seen the consumer consuming," he said. "At some point we will find a bottom in energy, and then things will stabilize."
Lower global economic activity can cause prices to fall in the United States, which can erode the profitability of American companies and make their shares less attractive to investors.
But the global turbulence may feed more directly into the United States financial system -- through country's largest banks. Citigroup, for instance, has $20.5 billion of loans, mortgages, credit cards and other assets in China, the bank's executives detailed on Friday. The bank also said that it was carefully monitoring its credit lines to businesses and consumers in Russia and Brazil.
Shares of Citigroup were down far more than those of other large United States banks on Friday, falling more than 6 percent.
Investors are now on tenterhooks as they wait for data that might clarify the strength of the United States economy and the stance of central banks.
Philip J. Orlando, a senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors, a mutual fund company, said he was waiting for the government report on United States gross domestic product, to be released on Jan. 29, and any announcements or utterances from officials at the Fed, whose monetary policy committee will meet on Jan. 26 and Jan 27.
"The market is acting as if China is already in recession and is dragging the U.S. into recession and there is nothing we can do about it," Mr. Orlando said, "and there is nothing you can do to refute it until there are more data points."

Oil Glut Grows and Takes a Toll on the Economy

Abstract: "What was once viewed as a gift is now viewed similarly to the gift of the monkey's paw," said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. [...]this time, the Saudis and other big producers increased output to try to preserve market share and undercut higher-cost competitors like those drilling in the shale fields of Texas and North Dakota.

Full text:   HOUSTON -- The world is awash in crude oil, with enough extra produced last year to fuel all of Britain or Thailand. And the price of oil will not stop falling until the glut shrinks.
The oil glut -- the unsold crude that is piling up around the world -- is a quandary and a source of investor anxiety that once again rattled global markets on Friday.
As prices have dropped, the amount of excess production has been cut in half over the last six months. About one million barrels of extra oil is now being dumped on the markets each day.
But that means the glut is still continuing to grow, and it could take years to work through the crude that is being warehoused, poured into petroleum depots or loaded onto supertankers for storage at sea.
The shakeout will be painful, taking an even bigger toll on companies, countries and investors.
Global stocks sank sharply on Friday, as the price of oil slipped below $30 a barrel. The glut was at the heart of the tumult, as investors worried that the demand from China would drop and supplies from Iran would grow.
"The glut is the 800-pound gorilla in the room," said Steve McCoy, vice president for drilling contracts at Latshaw Drilling, an Oklahoma service company that prospered in recent years from the American shale boom. "The world simply produced too much, and now we have to use it up or many oil-producing countries and some oil companies may drown."
Just a couple of years ago, producers and petro-states were making vast fortunes drilling and pumping relentlessly to fuel expanding middle classes in Asia, Latin America and Africa. But suddenly they are producing more than anyone needs at a time when China and other rapidly growing economies, once hungry for energy, are pulling back.
The extra oil has sent the price of crude into a tailspin, down more than 70 percent over the last 18 months.
That, in turn, has helped depress stock markets around the world, as investors worry about global growth. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is off around 8 percent in just the first two weeks of the year; European shares are down even more. Chinese stocks have dropped 20 percent from their December peak, putting the market in bear territory.
"What was once viewed as a gift is now viewed similarly to the gift of the monkey's paw," said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. "Global financial damages trump the benefits of cheap oil at anything under $30 a barrel."
It could get worse.
The nuclear deal with Iran should allow the country to start exporting far more oil, once sanctions are lifted, potentially in a matter of days. Iran could add as much as 500,000 barrels a day to the global markets.
Tentative progress in negotiations between warring factions in Libya, battling for control of oil and export terminals, could unleash another flood. And Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq continue to maintain a pumping frenzy to grab Asian markets.
The United States is slowly cutting production. Major oil companies have dropped their rig count, and dozens of small businesses have gone bankrupt. But the industry cannot simply flip the switch on big projects, like deepwater production projects in the Gulf of Mexico, that require companies to keep pumping to cover their costs. Smaller companies have to keep producing from shale fields, even at a loss, to keep paying their lenders.
"Sheikhs and shale caused this," said Scott Tinker, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin. "They are both producing more oil. That is the fundamental driver."
A million to two million barrels a day of excess production may not seem like much in a world market that requires 94 million barrels daily. But the amount of daily oversupply in recent months is the largest since oil prices collapsed in the late 1990s.
Back then, the price dropped below $10 a barrel, on an inflation-adjusted basis. Oil from new fields flooded the market just as the Asian financial crisis was roiling emerging markets.
Most of the glut today can be explained by a near doubling of American domestic oil production since 2008. The shale boom added roughly three million barrels a day to the global market.
In the past, when markets got out of kilter, Saudi Arabia and its partners in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries slashed production to support prices. But this time, the Saudis and other big producers increased output to try to preserve market share and undercut higher-cost competitors like those drilling in the shale fields of Texas and North Dakota.
Even as prices slipped through 2015, global production climbed. The Energy Department projects that overall inventories will rise by an additional 700,000 barrels a day in 2016.
The balance of oil supply and demand can swing abruptly, along with price, as they did in the early 2000s.
At the time, the Chinese and other emerging-market economies went into overdrive just as production in the United States and Mexico was declining and big producers like Venezuela and Nigeria were facing political turbulence. By mid-2008, the price of oil had risen to nearly $150 a barrel.
That is the possibility that many analysts are now contemplating, even if not at a price that high. An unexpected drop in supply or rise in demand could create a floor for prices, ease the glut and eventually lead to a slow recovery.
On the supply side, if tensions erupting between Saudi Arabia and Iran lead to armed conflict or an insurrection, the excess production could quickly disappear.
The boom in Iraqi oil production faces multiple threats, including Islamic State terrorism. The government is falling behind in its payments to international oil companies, water is running low for pumping to revive aging oil fields, and northern Kurdish fields are short on pipelines.
Low oil prices have already constrained exploration and production investment around the world.
American oil producers are in retreat; companies have decommissioned more than 60 percent of their rigs in the last year or so. Since peaking at 9.7 million barrels a day early last year, domestic oil production has fallen by more than half a million barrels. Rosneft, Lukoil and Western companies are also dropping big projects in Russia.
Some analysts also say that the concerns about slowing demand in emerging markets, a byproduct of the economic weakness, are overblown. China and India, for example, are working hard to build up enormous strategic reserves, which adds to the demand.
RBC Capital Markets, a division of Royal Bank of Canada, estimates that China's needs will continue to grow as it places an additional 65 million to 70 million barrels in its reserves this year. India began amassing a strategic reserve only last year, and it has a goal of storing roughly 330 million barrels over the next several years.
"Increased demand can certainly help," said Michael Tran, an RBC commodity strategist. "But the growing supply glut is what ultimately got us below $30-a-barrel oil, and significant supply cuts are what will ultimately have to dig us out."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The United States economy continued to show mixed signals from late November to early January, as improvements in the labor market and consumer spending were offset by the drag of a strong dollar and low energy prices, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday.
Economic activity expanded in nine of the country's 12 districts, the Fed said in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide.
The Boston Fed described economic activity as upbeat, while the New York and Kansas City districts described it as essentially flat. Most others described activity as modest.
Half the central bank's districts in the United States said the outlook for future economic growth remained mostly positive.
But while the labor market continued to improve and most districts reported "slight to moderate" growth in consumer spending, other sectors showed further strain.
Most manufacturing sectors weakened and "several districts reported the strong dollar's negative impact on demand," the Fed said. Contacts in the Philadelphia and San Francisco districts also cited weak global demand as contributing to declines.
Elsewhere, most areas of the energy sector "struggled further" as oil and gas prices continued to drop. The Cleveland and Kansas City districts reported that warmer-than-usual weather "increased already abundant inventories of oil and gas and kept downward pressure on already low energy prices."
The Fed raised interest rates last month by a quarter of a percentage point, from near zero, the first increase in almost a decade.
On the whole, Fed policy makers see four additional quarter-point increases in 2016 but have made clear that would depend on data and a tangible move in inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target.
The report showed little sign that the wage pressures that started to tick up in October and November were becoming sustained.
Nearly all districts said overall price pressures were minimal, and just two districts reported an acceleration in wage gains.
"Wage pressures remained relatively subdued," the Fed noted.
The Beige Book was compiled by the Philadelphia Fed with information collected on or before Jan. 4, 2016.

Full text:   United States job openings rose in November and employers appeared to have trouble finding qualified workers, a trend that could prompt a pickup in wage growth this year. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 82,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.43 million, the Labor Department said on Tuesday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. The rise lifted the jobs openings rate to 3.7 percent from 3.6 percent in October. Hiring rose to 5.2 million from 5.17 million the month before, continuing to lag job openings. The hiring rate was unchanged at 3.6 percent. Job openings are high relative to the unemployment rate of 5 percent. "We interpret this as a sign of a mismatch between the needs of employers and the skills of job seekers," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. The so-called Jolts report is among the data watched by Fed officials to get a pulse on both the labor market and inflation.

Full text:   The stock market ended 2015 with a whimper and began the new year with a shudder. Even before Wall Street showed up for business on Monday morning, stocks fell 7 percent in China, and the turmoil that started in Asian markets cascaded around the world.
The stock market in the United States fell 1.5 percent that day, based on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. In the face of troubles in the Chinese markets and a flare-up of geopolitical worries, including news of a North Korean nuclear test and heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf, the S.&P. 500 had the worst five-day start in its history, ending down almost 6 percent.
That unsettling start could have a salutary effect. It provides yet another reminder that investing in stocks is inherently risky: Unless you are prepared to accept losses, you should not be in the market.
In interpreting the week's news, it's also worth remembering that a few days or even a month of stock returns will not tell us much about where the market will be a year or more from now. In fact, although everyone would like to know where the current gyrations will take us, the unpleasant truth is that there is simply no reliable way to foretell the short-term path of the market.
You might not know that from the forecasts of major Wall Street investment houses. The start of a new year is the season for prognostication, and many analysts have issued very specific predictions. The consensus on Wall Street is that the S.&P. 500 will rise 7 percent for all of 2016.
Not everyone has come up with a year-end target for the index, however. Among the reports on the future path of the market, one was perhaps the most useful and certainly honest. Bespoke Investment Group published it. Its three authors, Paul Hickey, Justin Walters and George Pearkes, began their 2016 forecast with this disarming statement: "We have no idea."
This candid disclosure ensured that the authors will not have to eat their words. They acknowledged that their lack of specificity might be unsettling: "That's probably the last thing you wanted to hear from us regarding our views towards the next year in the stock market. In all honesty, though, to try and look out one year from now and tell people what the market will or will not do is a fool's errand."
Yet they had plenty of interesting and skeptical things to say in the 161-page report. They explained why it is possible that the market will soar and finish 2016 with a double-digit gain -- and why it is also quite possible that the long bull market is coming to an end this year. There is no certainty about either outcome, of course.
What is likely, if not absolutely certain, is that the Wall Street consensus will be wrong.
The Bespoke report reviewed the recent history of Wall Street predictions and found them wanting. Since 2000, it found, the consensus has called for an average yearly increase in the S.&P. 500 of about 9.5 percent. The actual average annual change was less than 4 percent, however, and consensus predictions were inaccurate in every single year, sometimes by preposterous margins. In 2001, for example, the consensus called for a gain of 20.7 percent. But the index fell by 13 percent. In the horrible year of 2008, the consensus was that the market would rise 11.1 percent. As many investors may recall, it fell by 38.5 percent. Not once since 2000 has Wall Street predicted that the market would decline in a calendar year. Yet the market actually fell in five of those years.
This doesn't mean market analysis is useless. There is evidence, for example, that factors like stock valuations affect overall market returns over periods of five years or more, and that the level of prevailing interest rates influences returns over shorter periods. At the moment, those two factors point in different directions, however.
After years of gains, overall valuations are stretched, by most measures, which may augur poorly for future returns. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500, for example, ended the year above 18, compared with an average since 1926 of a little over 15. That implies that investors are paying more for stocks than they have in the past. Higher prices often lead to price declines, but there is no assurance that this will happen on a known timetable, or that it will happen at all.
On the positive side, interest rates, both the short-term ones set by the Federal Reserve and the longer-term rates established in the bond market, are extremely low by historical measures. That's the case even though the Fed has begun raising short-term rates. At the moment, for example, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes is about 2.1 percent, compared with an average of more than 6 percent since 1962. With the rates on relatively riskless investments in Treasuries remaining so low, the stock market may seem attractive as long as the economy grows and companies generate profits -- in other words, unless the economy falls into a recession.
On that score, the bond market may offer helpful clues. No recession since 1962 has occurred without an advance signal from the bond market known as an "inverted yield curve." This simply means that short-term rates become higher than longer-term rates, reversing the typical order of things. When that reversal happens, the Bespoke report said, it "represents a belief by the market that current inflation and real interest rates are too high, and that activity will eventually contract, reducing inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates."
The yield curve right now is rising sharply, indicating that the bond market does not see a recession on the horizon. While the market has often predicted recessions that have never occurred, no recession has occurred without such a prediction. In short, this is a portent of stability. But like other indicators, it is not infallible.
That is worth remembering, too. If there were a single reliable indicator of the market's direction, smart managers would use it and profit handsomely. But systems and methods aimed at ensuring investment outperformance rarely prevail for very long.
The latest evidence of this is to be found in forthcoming data from S&P Dow Jones Indices on the persistence of mutual fund returns. I've written extensively about earlier findings, because the S&P Dow Jones team has conducted this study twice a year since 2002. Aye M. Soe, senior director of index research and design for S&P Dow Jones Indices, shared the new data with me.
It tracked domestic mutual funds through September 2015, and there were no surprises. As in the past, the numbers showed that active mutual funds that performed well in one year were rarely able to sustain that performance in subsequent years. In fact, the statistics indicated that they performed no better as a group than you would have expected if their managers had merely flipped coins. The data suggested, once again, that most people would fail if they tried to predict the direction of the overall market or of particular stocks and bonds.
"I feel the game is rigged against the average investor," Ms. Soe said.
People often pay high fees for investment management that produces scant measurable benefit. It's usually wiser, for longer-term investments, to hold them in broadly diversified, low-cost holdings, probably in index funds.
As for where the market is heading this year, you might as well flip a coin.

Full text:   The newest numbers on the state of the American job market are good news on almost every front and show that 2015 was a blockbuster year for jobs. That raises some important questions -- and doubts -- about what will happen in 2016.
The 292,000 jobs the Labor Department estimates the nation added in December, combined with upward revisions to past months, affirm that 2014 and 2015 had the strongest job gains since the boom of the late 1990s -- 5.8 million positions added to the nation's payrolls in a mere 24 months. It was enough to drive the jobless rate to 5 percent in December 2015 from 6.7 percent at the end of 2013.
Given the scars left by the 2008 recession and slow recovery, this is all unabashed cause for celebration. There are opportunities for workers now that just weren't there in the years immediately after the recession.
The bad news in the report, if you can call it that, was that average hourly earnings were unchanged. But given the very low inflation, American workers have still seen meaningful improvement in earnings power over the last year -- a 2.5 percent rise in hourly earnings against a backdrop of barely visible inflation.
Which brings us to the questions that remain.
A big question for the year ahead is whether the breakneck pace of job growth of the last two years can continue now that the jobless rate is close to what economists consider full employment. And this boils down to how many Americans who currently aren't working can be coaxed back to work.
In the latest numbers, the ratio of the population that was working ticked up to 59.5 percent in December, the highest since May 2009. That's the good news. The bad news is that number was 63 percent on the eve of the recession that began at the end of 2007.
Here's some quick math. The lowest the unemployment rate has been in modern times was 3.8 percent in the spring of 2000. For the economy to get to that low level (which coincided with the peak of the dot-com boom, but that's a different story) with only the current labor force -- people who are either working or actively looking for a job -- 1.9 million more Americans would need to find work.
But if the United States keeps adding jobs in 2016 at the rate it did in 2015, we'll hit that number in no time: in September, to be precise.
The sharp improvements of the last couple of years could imply "modest slowing in jobs growth going forward, as the available supply of qualified workers has been thinned out," said Rick Rieder, a chief investment officer at BlackRock, in a note. "Paradoxically, if our thesis is correct, this forthcoming slowing in jobs growth would be a sign of labor market tightness, not weakness."
In other words, something has to give. Either some of those millions of Americans who dropped out of the work force will return, allowing continued rapid job growth, or the rate of job growth will have to slow down to something closer to the rate at which the working-age population is growing (below 100,000 jobs a month, versus the 221,000 jobs a month added in 2015).
"With such strong employment gains, you might have expected December's unemployment rate to dip below 5 percent," Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist of the Economic Outlook Group, said in a research note. "But it didn't happen and for good reason," namely that 466,000 more people counted themselves as being in the labor force.
Whether the "missing" workers will return as the labor force keeps improving is a question with short-term implications for the Federal Reserve and for the state of the economy when the 2016 election takes place. But even more important, it has long-lasting implications for America's productive capacity.
If the growth in labor force participation that was evident in December goes away in future months and labor force participation stagnates, it will imply that the United States is actually quite close to full employment. That suggests that inflation is imminent, that the Fed will need to raise interest rates relatively quickly and that job growth will be slowing by the time voters go to the polls to pick the next president. In the longer run, it implies that growth will slow down from its already sluggish levels in the next couple of years.
On the other hand, if a combination of improving job opportunities and higher wages pulls some of those people who are neither working nor looking for a job into the work force, it will imply that the Fed can take its time with rate increases, and job growth could remain robust for some time to come.
The most likely result is some mix of both: The rate of job creation will slow, but the labor force will also grow as people return to the work force.
But how the balance tilts is one of the important questions for American workers and the role of the United States in the global economy in the years to come.

Full text:   The last time the American economy registered such a prolonged stretch of impressive job creation, Facebook didn't exist and Beyoncé was still a member of Destiny's Child.
For all of 2015, the nation added 2.65 million jobs, capping a two-year, back-to-back gain that was the best since the late 1990s, the government reported on Friday.
"I think this really is illustrative of the fact that economic momentum in the United States is still awfully strong," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. "In spite of the craziness we've seen from Asian markets this week, the fundamentals here at home are still solid."
The year ended with a particularly strong sprint. In December, employers hired an additional 292,000 people, the Labor Department said, and October and November were revised up by a total of 50,000, pushing the average for the last three months to 284,000.
At 5 percent, the jobless rate, which was unchanged from the previous month, has fallen by more than half since exceeding 10 percent in October 2009.
Looking ahead, the biggest question is whether overall growth will remain strong enough to keep hiring advancing, or whether turmoil in China and elsewhere around the globe will weigh down the United States economy.
Democrats, who are fighting to retain the White House and retake the Senate, would seem best poised to take advantage of the positive economic news. Republican presidential candidates have attacked President Obama and his party's economic policies, but such criticisms have been muted lately and could lose their sting if the employment picture keeps improving.
Still, many voters continue to express widespread dissatisfaction with their own prospects and those of the larger economy. The main shadow darkening the latest monthly jobs report was further evidence that wage growth for the typical worker remains sluggish. Average hourly earnings fell slightly in December, leaving the overall yearly gain at a meager 2.5 percent.
"If we take the rise of the outsider as a dominant theme in American politics now, clearly part of that is the general feeling that the recovery has been much slower than it should be, particularly for less educated workers and individuals with lower incomes," said Peter Ireland, an economist at Boston College.
The Obama administration was eager to point to news that the economy is finally gaining significant traction. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, began Friday's daily briefing in Washington by noting that over the last two years, job creation had been the strongest since the last years of the Clinton administration and that the decline in the unemployment rate had been the fastest in 30 years.
He called such trends something "the American people can be justifiably excited about."
Based on the latest figures, which are still subject to revision, the average monthly gain in jobs last year of 221,000 was up from the 2013 average of 199,000, though short of the 260,000 reached in 2014.
"The remarkable thing is how consistent employment growth has been over the past three or four years," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "That's quite an achievement."
Pressure to raise pay at a faster pace will eventually mount, he said.
Analysts noted that wages, which are measured in nominal terms, are better than they might seem at first glance, because inflation fell to such low levels last year. Adjusted for changes in prices, the real gain was roughly 2.1 percent, the highest since the recovery began more than six years ago.
While that is not a bad showing, said Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan and a former member of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, most of those gains have occurred at the top end of the wage distribution.
"The middle class has continued to get hammered, and what we've seen is increasing inequality," Ms. Stevenson said. "That was true in the recovery, and also true prior to the recovery."
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said that disparity helped explain why many Americans are so discontented with their fortunes.
"Median family income has fallen, not risen, so there's a great disgruntled-but-employed majority out there," Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. "People want a raise," he said. "I don't think raising the minimum wage is the right way to solve this problem, but I understand why it might look appealing."
Mr. Holtz-Eakin blamed the anemic growth in productivity, which he said helps depress wages.
Moreover, many Americans have no choice but to settle for part-time work or are too discouraged to keep looking for employment after years of fruitless searching. A broader measure of unemployment that includes these people stayed at 9.9 percent in December. And a relatively low labor participation rate, which barely ticked up to 62.6 percent last month from 62.5, continues to bedevil the recovery.
The wage challenge long predates the recession, said Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor. "When I look at the data over the last 40 years, the last stretch where we had respectable real wage growth was in the late '90s, and we had unemployment of 4 percent," Mr. Perez said. "I think we still have slack in this labor market."
An analysis of long-term changes released this week by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis focused on how automation and the movement of jobs abroad are continuing to reduce the number of middle-skill jobs, like those in manufacturing and production. One result is a labor market that increasingly resembles a barbell, with jobs concentrated at the high- and low-skill ends of the spectrum.
"The picture is clear: Employment in nonroutine occupations -- both cognitive and manual -- has been increasing steadily for several decades," the report concluded. "Employment in routine occupations, however, has been mostly stagnant."
Guarded optimism about the labor market contributed to the Federal Reserve's decision a few weeks ago to raise interest rates from the near-zero levels, where they had rested since 2008.
Much of Friday's report seemed to validate that decision.
Unemployment among African-American men, whose jobless rate is typically twice as high as white's, fell to 8.7 percent from 10.9 percent, the lowest in more than seven years. The jobless rate for women dropped to 4.4 percent from 4.6 percent. Employment grew most vigorously in professional and business services, which added 73,000 workers, while the construction industry added an unexpectedly strong 45,000 jobs last month, with at least part of the gain because of unseasonably warm weather.
Sitel, a customer care provider in Nashville, has been celebrating its biggest growth in years. Sean Erickson, an executive vice president, said that Sitel hired 7,500 people in the United States last year for sales, customer service, technical support and front-line management positions.
"Where we saw the greatest growth was in financial services, retail, travel and transportation," Mr. Erickson said, with weaker demand in manufacturing and communications. He said the company, with 62,000 employees worldwide, had poured money into employee training.
The company's success also highlights how much the job market has shifted. One of the biggest areas of growth has come from providing flexible, temporary or part-time employees who can work from home to help businesses quickly scale staff up, or down in response to demand, Mr. Erickson said.
It is still scaling up.

Abstract: A reasonable strategy would have been to buy time with credit expansion and infrastructure spending while reforming the economy in ways that put more purchasing power into families' hands. With interest rates still close to zero and inflation still below target, the Fed would have limited ability to fight an economic downdraft in any case, and it has probably reduced its effectiveness further by signaling its eagerness to raise rates at the first excuse.

Full text:   So, will China's problems cause a global crisis? The good news is that the numbers, as I read them, don't seem big enough. The bad news is that I could be wrong, because global contagion often seems to end up being worse than hard numbers say it should. And the worse news is that if China does deliver a bad shock to the rest of the world, we are remarkably unready to deal with the consequences.
For those just starting to pay attention: It has been obvious for a while that China's economy is in big trouble. How big is hard to say, because nobody believes official Chinese statistics.
The basic problem is that China's economic model, which involves very high saving and very low consumption, was only sustainable as long as the country could grow extremely fast, justifying high investment. This in turn was possible when China had vast reserves of underemployed rural labor. But that's no longer true, and China now faces the tricky task of transitioning to much lower growth without stumbling into recession.
A reasonable strategy would have been to buy time with credit expansion and infrastructure spending while reforming the economy in ways that put more purchasing power into families' hands. Unfortunately, China pursued only the first half of that strategy, buying time and then squandering it. The result has been rapidly rising debt, much of it owed to poorly regulated "shadow banks," and a threat of financial meltdown.
So the Chinese situation looks fairly grim -- and new numbers have reinforced fears of a hard landing, leading not just to a plunge in Chinese stocks but to sharp declines in stock prices worldwide.
O.K., so far so bad. And some smart people think that the global implications are really scary; George Soros is comparing it to 2008.
As I suggested above, however, I have a hard time making the numbers for that kind of catastrophe work. Yes, China is a big economy, accounting in particular for about a quarter of world manufacturing, so what happens there has implications for all of us. And China buys more than $2 trillion worth of goods and services from the rest of the world each year. But it's a big world, with a total gross domestic product excluding China of more than $60 trillion. Even a drastic fall in Chinese imports would be only a modest hit to world spending.
What about financial linkages? One reason America's subprime crisis turned global in 2008 was that foreigners in general, and European banks in particular, turned out to be badly exposed to losses on U.S. securities. But China has capital controls -- that is, it isn't very open to foreign investors -- so there's very little direct spillover from plunging stocks or even domestic debt defaults.
All of this says that while China itself is in big trouble, the consequences for the rest of us should be manageable. But I have to admit that I'm not as relaxed about this as the above analysis says I should be. If you like, I lack the courage of my complacency. Why?
Part of the answer is that business cycles across nations often seem to be more synchronized than they "should" be. For example, Europe and the United States export to each other only a small fraction of what they produce, yet they often have recessions and recoveries at the same time. Financial linkages may be part of the story, but one also suspects that there is psychological contagion: Good or bad news in one major economy affects animal spirits in others.
So I worry that China may export its woes in ways back-of-the-envelope calculations miss, that the Middle Kingdom's troubles will one way or another have the effect of depressing investment spending in America and Europe as well as in other emerging markets. And if my worries come true, we are woefully unready to deal with the shock.
After all, who would respond to a China shock, and how? Monetary policy would probably be of little help. With interest rates still close to zero and inflation still below target, the Fed would have limited ability to fight an economic downdraft in any case, and it has probably reduced its effectiveness further by signaling its eagerness to raise rates at the first excuse. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is already pushing to the limits of its political mandate in its own so far unsuccessful effort to raise inflation.
And while fiscal policy -- essentially, spending more to offset the effects of China spending less -- would surely work, how many people believe that Republicans would be receptive to a new Obama stimulus plan, or that German politicians would look kindly on a proposal for bigger deficits in Europe?
Now, my best guess is still that things won't be that bad -- nasty in China, but just a bit of turbulence elsewhere. And I really, really hope that guess is right, because we don't seem to have a plan B anywhere in sight.

Full text:   Seven years ago, the collapsing United States economy laid a dead hand on the rest of the world, a dubious role that was then assumed by Europe, whose sovereign debt crisis often pumped fear around the globe.
Now, it appears to be China's turn to cause havoc far beyond its borders.
China's challenges have been debated for years, but in recent months they have taken on a greater importance in the minds of investors and policy makers. China was the focus when stocks sold off sharply during the summer, and such worries have again driven global markets down in recent days.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for instance, plunged 2.4 percent on Thursday after the Chinese currency continued to fall and trading was halted on its stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average is now trading 9.8 percent below the all-time nominal high that it reached last year.
China's convulsions have come at an inopportune time. The Federal Reserve recently increased interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, a move that appears to have intensified an exodus from riskier markets. And there are signs of weakness in the United States economy, like the manufacturing sector.
The White House said on Thursday that it was monitoring the turbulence in the markets. "Obviously, we're aware of the kind of volatility that we've seen in China over the last several days, and this has had an impact on markets in other countries, including ours," said the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest. "So that's certainly something that we're closely watching."
China is in many ways different from the United States or Europe, and its unique strengths and weaknesses are complicating efforts to assess the level of damage that the country might inflict on the rest of the world. This task is made even harder by the enmeshed nature of the world's markets and economies. Problems in one large country can transmit to other places in several ways -- and they may feed on themselves as they do so.
But despite this murkiness, some analysts and economists say they are becoming less optimistic that the United States will remain unscathed by China's struggles.
"If things were to get really disruptive, global growth would stall to where the U.S. would be affected," said George Goncalves, a rates strategist at Nomura in New York. "These issues started percolating last year and they don't just go away because the calendar year changed."
The slowing of China's economy from historically high rates of growth has long been expected to weigh on growth elsewhere. "The China that had been growing at 10 percent for 30 years was a powerful source of fuel for much of what drove the global economy," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale. The growth rate has slowed to an official figure of around 7 percent. "That's a material deceleration," Mr. Roach said.
But investors have long doubted the official numbers. And they are increasingly worried that the Chinese authorities' handling of the country's challenges may set off chain reactions that hurt other markets.
Much now depends on how China manages the devaluation of its currency, the renminbi. By allowing it to fall against other currencies, the Chinese authorities apparently hope to spur higher exports and reduce imports, bolstering Chinese businesses in the process.
Countries devalue all the time without causing too many shock waves. But it is not clear how far the authorities want the currency to fall. "Mere uncertainty about where the exchange rate will ultimately be creates higher risk premiums in financial markets," said Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citigroup's private bank. "That can diminish when there is stability, but we don't have stability right now."
And there are ways in which a Chinese devaluation could go wrong. A devaluation could end up being unsettlingly large. China, for instance, slashed the value of the renminbi in 1994, an event that investors have not forgotten.
A steep drop in the renminbi could do significant harm to the real economies of other countries. A much cheaper renminbi could, for instance, make it much harder for companies in, say, Indonesia or South Korea to compete in world markets against Chinese rivals. Some countries might then slash the value of their currencies to regain competitiveness, setting off a currency war.
In such a scenario, the dollar, as a safe haven currency, would most likely strengthen, creating a headwind for United States corporations that export into global markets. A stronger dollar would make imports into the United States cheaper, potentially intensifying the forces that have pushed inflation down to a level that has made the Federal Reserve nervous. "Inflation is now going to have a hard time rising," said Mr. Goncalves, the strategist.
Fearing that the United States economy might soon sag, investors would most likely clamor for the Fed to hold off on increasing interest rates. A monthslong guessing game over monetary policy could then occur, stoking further uncertainty.
Global investors might soon also have to contend with high numbers of defaults in China's corporate sector. Chinese companies have borrowed billions of dollars in recent years. As the renminbi falls, many companies may find it harder to pay back dollar debts.
Most large foreign banks do not appear to be holding dangerous amounts of dollar-denominated debt owed by Chinese corporations. As a result, such banks may avoid taking the sort of losses they suffered on mortgage bonds during the 2008 financial crisis. Still, rising defaults could harm Chinese investors and banks, creating the sort of headlines that could at least cause global investors to scale back their risk-taking.
Still, the current storm in the markets may pass, as it did last year.
The recovery going on in the rest of the world may yet survive China's turbulence. Policy makers in Europe, Japan and the United States can always respond aggressively, as they have done in past crises. The dollar could weaken under such stimulus.
And China may just be going through a necessary but bumpy adjustment, not a full-blown shakeout.
China may, for instance, be able to manage a steady devaluation and absorb corporate defaults while avoiding a dangerous level of financial instability. Its government, after all, has far deeper pockets than the Europeans at the height of the Continent's crisis. And on some measures, China is still doing rather well. Growth may be slowing, but the Chinese government may ultimately care more about employment than headline growth figures, said Mr. Roach of Yale. And he noted that China's jobs numbers had been healthy in recent months. This could be a sign that China's plan to shift more of its economy away from manufacturing and toward the services sector, which creates more jobs, is bearing fruit. "The bottom line for the economy is that it's still growing fast enough to create a lot of jobs," Mr. Roach said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, marshaled a strong consensus among Fed officials for the momentous decision to raise the central bank's benchmark interest rate last month, but concerns among policy makers about the strength of economic growth could slow the march toward higher rates.
Officials are focused on the persistence of sluggish inflation. While rising prices are unpopular, central bankers see benefits in moderate inflation.
But for almost four years, there has been less inflation than the Fed's 2 percent annual target; some policy makers worry that higher interest rates will not help, according to an official account of the December meeting published on Wednesday.
For some of those officials, the decision to raise rates was a "close call," the meeting account said. It added that "many participants remained concerned about the downside risks attending the outlook for inflation." And it described general agreement among the 17 officials who make up the Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, to keep a close eye on prices.
By the time the Fed formally announced its December decision to raise interest rates, ending the seven-year period during which it held short-term rates near zero, the attention of investors had already shifted to the question of how quickly the Fed would raise rates a second time, and a third.
Fed officials forecast in December that they were likely to raise rates by one percentage point in 2016, most likely in four quarter-point increments. Referring to that prediction in an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, said that "those numbers are in the ballpark."
Not everybody is necessarily in line with that thinking, though. The meeting account, released after a standard three-week delay, did not address the issue directly, but its description of the internal debate underscored differences on the timing and frequency of future moves.
In particular, it raised the question of how much further Fed officials are willing to raise rates without clear evidence the pace of inflation is also rising.
Most Wall Street analysts predict the Fed will not raise rates at its next meeting, in late January, but they generally expect the Fed to raise its benchmark rate at the following meeting, in March.
Laura Rosner, an economist at BNP Paribas, said the minutes provided less information than she expected about the Fed's plans, but she still put the odds of a March increase at 80 percent. She said she did not expect the questions about inflation to be resolved by then, but she wrote on Wednesday that "inflation data released leading up to the March meeting are unlikely to increase worries." Ms. Yellen and her allies have already demonstrated they are willing to raise rates despite the uncertainty.
Other analysts, however, said they were surprised by the Fed's emphasis on its inflation concerns.
"Given all their worries about inflation, it's a wonder they even hiked at all," wrote Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. "Absent from this discussion was any sense that further tightening in the labor market would bolster their confidence in the inflation outlook. Instead, they wanted proof: not only expected progress, but also 'actual' progress on their inflation objective."
Mr. Feroli said a March raise now depended, in his judgment, on data showing increased inflation.
The minutes described Fed officials as optimistic that the economy would continue its steady, but slow, growth this year. They generally predicted the strength of the domestic economy, fueled by increased consumer spending, would outweigh the weakness of the global economy, which has limited foreign demand for American products.
They also expected growth to be strong enough to drive continued improvement in labor market conditions -- fewer people without jobs, fewer people in jobs that they do not like and, perhaps most important, more workers able to obtain raises.
As employment increases and wages rise, the Fed expects inflation to rise more quickly, in keeping with a longstanding pattern. A majority of Fed officials, led by Ms. Yellen, view this pattern as sufficiently reliable that they decided to start raising rates before it actually happened.
"Nearly all participants were now reasonably confident that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term," the minutes said. And because the influence of monetary policy is gradual, they worried that waiting to raise rates would risk driving economic growth to unsustainable heights or fostering a speculative bubble.
The Fed, however, has repeatedly forecast that inflation would rise, and it has repeatedly been wrong. Some officials are concerned the central bank is once again overestimating the economy.
Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, has argued that her colleagues are underestimating the potential deflationary impact of global economic weakness. The minutes, describing this view, said a couple of officials "worried that a further strengthening of the labor market might not prove sufficient to offset the downward pressures from global disinflationary forces."
The Fed has taken comfort in the stability of inflation expectations, which show Americans have not changed their views about the likely level of future inflation. But that blanket has been fraying for some time. Measures of expectations derived from asset prices are far weaker than survey measures, and in recent months, some of the survey measures have also shown signs of declining.
The minutes said several officials expressed "unease" about that decline, while others saw benign explanations, arguing that lower oil prices, for example, were exerting an influence that would soon fade once the energy market stabilized and began to rise.
So far, that has not happened.

Full text:   A new survey by NBC News and Esquire magazine measures what anyone paying attention to Campaign 2016 already knows -- Americans are angry, especially white, middle-class Americans.
The "rage survey" released this week found that half of Americans say they are more angry than they were a year ago, and a plurality of them say they get mad at least once every day at something they hear or read in the news. They say that they're living in less-powerful America, that life hasn't turned out the way they had hoped, and that for them, the American dream has died.
This fury is a bipartisan thing: More than three-quarters of Republicans and two-thirds of Democrats surveyed feel this way. Two presidential candidates have positioned themselves to ride this discontent: Donald Trump, who is seeking the Republican nomination, and Bernie Sanders, who wants the Democratic nomination. Their appeals couldn't be more different.
In his pledges to banish undocumented Mexican immigrants, Muslims and most foreign competition from the American landscape, Mr. Trump plays on what the survey's authors call "the anger of perceived disenfranchisement -- a sense that the majority has become a persecuted minority." These people could be Republicans or Democrats; they don't agree that immigration strengthens the nation and are "significantly" more likely to say the American dream is dead and twice as likely to say "white men are struggling to keep up in today's world."
Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, taps into voters who say their American dream is ending because hard work doesn't pay off like it used to. Even as his fellow candidates have emphasized national security issues, Mr. Sanders has stubbornly stuck to a domestic message: The richest Americans are getting richer while the poor get poorer.
This message cuts across racial and gender lines and is based on sound numbers. For almost four decades, inflation-adjusted wage increases have not kept pace with American workers' increased productivity, nor with the rate of economic growth; middle-class Americans who are the muscle behind the nation's economy are basically working harder for less. To boot, the only Americans who saw their incomes rise between 2006 and 2014 were those at or near the top of the income scale.
The rage survey suggests that people with a household income of $50,000 to $75,000 are the angriest of all. That's Middle America.
This spitting-mad electorate presents challenges for all candidates, but it's these two who are confronting it directly. History shows that public outrage can be misdirected against people and institutions that aren't the cause of the discontent, or harnessed to drive corrective policy. Mr. Trump has chosen the first course, Mr. Sanders the second. Mr. Sanders's challenge now is to show angry Americans a realistic path out of their predicament -- and then get them to the polls.

Full text:   SAN FRANCISCO -- When pundits and presidential candidates talk about inequality and the tiny sliver of the population whose fortunes have soared, they often drop names like Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Sheldon Adelson and Mark Zuckerberg.
But those are just the most visible members of a larger but less-talked-about cadre of the big winners in today's economy. This group consists of roughly 250,000 Americans who mainly populate the executive offices and managerial suites of major companies and financial institutions, along with a smattering of top law firms, hedge funds and other elite aeries.
These people -- the top one-quarter of 1 percent of the country's employed population -- have enjoyed explosive gains in income and wealth in recent decades, even as salaries and wages stagnated for the typical American worker.
"You hear about C.E.O.s, entertainers, athletes and hedge funders, but that's the tip of the iceberg," said Nicholas A. Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford who is finishing a paper examining the underlying dynamics of income inequality. "It's a much, much bigger group and they are outpacing everyone else."
Like those of many of his peers who are presenting new research at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association, which began here on Sunday and ends on Tuesday, Mr. Bloom's findings are bringing to light fresh perspectives on why income inequality is growing and how it is reshaping the national and global economy.
While the much-talked-about 1 percent is doing just fine, the supersize gains are taking place even further up the income ladder, according to what Mr. Bloom and four colleagues found by examining 35 years of data from the Social Security Administration.
The phenomenon is not limited to Wall Street or the big banks -- manufacturers rewarded their top executives every bit as generously as did firms in the finance, insurance and real estate sectors. And this pattern is being repeated in countries where the political landscape is quite different from that of the United States, like Sweden, Germany and Britain.
"This is a truly global phenomenon, and I don't know any serious economist who would deny inequality has gone up," said Mr. Bloom, a native of Britain whose politics veer toward a laissez-faire approach and the Conservative Party there. "The debate is over the magnitude, not the direction."
The economic association's meeting is something of a barometer of what concerns economists most, drawing more than 13,000 attendees from the ranks of academia, as well as research groups and the private sector. And in panels, research presentations and speeches, what was once mainly a preoccupation of ivory tower Marxists and other players on the margins of the profession is taking center stage.
"In the last few years, there's been a huge change in the mainstream of the profession," said Steven Fazzari, an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis who first came to the conference as a job-hunting graduate student in 1982. "The issue of income inequality was a backwater in the economics field, and it was largely ignored."
At the same time, there's a growing consensus among economists of all ideological stripes that inequality is growing -- in the United States and abroad -- even if the usual political fault lines appear when the discussion turns to the consequences of the trend and whether new public policies are needed to address it.
"It's pretty much indisputable that the percentage of income being earned by the top 1 percent, or the top quarter of 1 percent, is going up," said Richard H. Thaler, the association's president.
"It was true five years ago, but it was not as widely recognized," said Mr. Thaler, a behavioral economist who teaches at the University of Chicago. "As with climate change, scientific consensus takes a while to build."
And, to borrow language from an economic seminar, there's also a striking correlation between the emergence of income inequality as an issue here and the near-rock-star status accorded a handful of once-obscure experts on the subject inside and outside academia.
The best known of these is Thomas Piketty, whose 700-page tome, "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," became an improbable best-seller in 2014 and made the French academic a media superstar.
Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has collaborated with Mr. Piketty, won a MacArthur "genius" grant in 2010. Raj Chetty of Stanford, who has looked closely at economic mobility, also received a MacArthur grant and has presented findings to Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush and Obama administration officials.
"There are definitely fashions in the field," said Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "As much as most economists might hate to acknowledge it, there's no way you can't respond to Piketty's success."
Anticipated presentations at the economic association meeting include new findings from David Autor, an influential M.I.T. economist, on the links between college performance and increased financial aid as well as research by Enrico Moretti of Berkeley into how state tax increases prompt the highest earners to move to lower-tax locations.
For all the intense focus on the roots and extent of income inequality today, most academics are leery of any easy solution. At the same time, they acknowledge that their traditional tools are inadequate for the task.
"There's no reason the free market will solve this," Mr. Bloom said.
He believes inequality is being magnified by technological change and what's known as skills bias, where workers with a particular expertise reap the biggest reward. Neither is amenable to quick fixes.
In Professor Bloom's new paper, which he wrote with David J. Price, a Stanford graduate student, and three other economists -- Jae Song, Fatih Guvenen and Till von Wachter -- the top quarter of 1 percent of Americans appears to be pulling away from the rest.
For workers at this threshold, who earn at least $640,000 annually, their salaries rose 96 percent from 1981 to 2013, after taking account of inflation.
The trend was especially pronounced among the most successful enterprises in the American economy, creating a divergence between the highest-paid people at companies that employ more than 10,000 people and the rest of the work force. In this rarefied circle, overall pay jumped 140 percent versus a 5 percent drop for the typical employee at these corporate behemoths.
The split in compensation between executives and everyone else was much less pronounced at smaller companies, according to the research by Mr. Bloom and his colleagues. At these firms, between 1981 and 2013, top salaries rose 49 percent, while median pay rose 30 percent.
In addition, Mr. Bloom and his team also found a sharp divergence between pay at the most successful companies and also-rans in the same field -- think Apple versus BlackBerry. The highest-paid workers cluster at the winners, heightening income disparities in the overall work force.
Mr. Bloom traces the outsize gains to large grants of stock and options to top workers at big companies, with their fortunes rising in line with the performance of the stock market.
"There used to be a premium for working at a big company, even in a lower-level job," he said. "That's not true anymore. The people who have really suffered are lower-level employees at big companies."

Abstract: According to data released on Wednesday by the Internal Revenue Service, the average rate for federal income taxes paid by the country's top 400 income earners rose from 16.7 percent in 2012 to 22.9 percent in 2013, almost exactly where they stood in the early 2000s, though well below the level of the early 1990s.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Is the party over for America's super-rich?
For 20 years beginning in the early 1990s, the effective tax rates for those at the very top of the income ladder generally dropped. Then, in 2013, after a pair of unusual tax increases negotiated by the Obama White House went into effect, taxes went up on this group.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Internal Revenue Service, the average rate for federal income taxes paid by the country's top 400 income earners rose from 16.7 percent in 2012 to 22.9 percent in 2013, almost exactly where they stood in the early 2000s, though well below the level of the early 1990s. By any measure, that's a victory for the cause of tax justice, analysts said.
But the recent rate increases, many experts also noted, still do little to overcome the broader issue of a separate, more comfortable tax system for the ultrawealthy.
"The 2013 increase in the capital gains rate was a significant move towards greater tax fairness," said Jared Bernstein, who was the top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during President Obama's first term. "But when you consider the breadth of the tax avoidance industry, much of which is about sheltering income from exposure to any tax liability at all, it's just a drop in the bucket."
Even with the higher tax rates in 2013, the top 400 highest-earning taxpayers, who took home an average of about $265 million that year, paid a significantly lower share of their reported income in taxes than those just below them. For example, the top 1 percent of earners -- whose average income was $1.24 million -- paid roughly 27 percent of their income in taxes.
Moreover, when payroll taxes are taken into account, many people with much lower incomes, in the range of $150,000 to $200,000, pay effective tax rates that are similar to those imposed on the rich.
Essentially, the rich have benefited from two crucial developments over the last few decades: The first was a declining tax rate on investment income, which fell in the late 1990s under pressure from a Republican Congress after President Bill Clinton raised income tax rates in 1993. It fell even further under President George W. Bush in the early 2000s, who cut both ordinary income rates and investment rates.
(Both went back up with the 2013 tax increase, though the rate on investment income remains lower than in the early 1990s.)
Supporters of keeping tax rates on capital gains and dividends lower than ordinary income tax rates say there are good reasons for doing this. They note that the policy helps limit double taxation of corporate income and argue that it fosters innovation by encouraging greater investment and risk-taking.
But because the ultrawealthy derive an outsize portion of their income from investments, these tax cuts disproportionately benefited them.
The tax cuts on investment income then had a second important effect: They brought back from an earlier era the incentive for the ultrawealthy, working in tandem with highly sophisticated tax advisers, to game the tax system by transforming ordinary income into investment income, which is now taxed at about half the top rate.
To take one recent example: Private equity fund managers have historically received part of their income in management fees, on which they pay the relatively high standard income tax rate, and part of their income as a share of their funds' profits, on which they pay the relatively low tax rate on investment income.
In recent years, however, it has become common for private equity fund managers to "waive" a substantial portion of their management-fee income and instead receive an even greater portion of their income as a share of profits from their funds, which are taxed at a lower rate. (The I.R.S. has recently proposed rules that would limit this practice.)
Historical experience has shown that partly as a result of this gaming, the ultrawealthy tend to whittle down the rates they actually pay over time for any given level of official tax rates. By contrast, the average rates for most other taxpayers tend to remain relatively stable when tax laws do not change.
Between 2004 and 2012, official income tax rates on regular income and investment income did not budge for affluent or wealthy taxpayers.
But during that time, thanks in part to techniques like fee waivers, the top 400 income earners went from paying an average rate of 18.2 percent to an average rate of 16.7 percent. For the top 1 percent of earners, excluding the wealthiest top one-tenth of 1 percent, rates rose ever so slightly, to 24.1 percent from 23.9 percent.
This historical evidence suggests that the ultrawealthy will soon find ways to limit the impact of the recent rate increases under President Obama. For example, many wealthy taxpayers already exploit tax strategies, like keeping income in offshore entities, that allow them to defer taxes on investment income for years, allowing the money to compound on a tax-free basis.
"The goal of the tax avoidance industry is to shelter income from exposure to any tax liability at all," Mr. Bernstein said. "I guarantee you they're figuring out a workaround to this higher gains rate as we speak."
Indeed, many ultrawealthy taxpayers can be expected to explore additional strategies for deferring investment income in response to the higher tax rates, according to Victor Fleischer, an expert on tax law at the University of San Diego. (He noted that the tax avoidance caused by deferrals wouldn't show up in I.R.S. data because the income isn't recorded until it is taxed years after the fact.)
While some of these strategies may be of dubious legality, the ability of the I.R.S. to weed them out has been eroded. Adjusting for inflation, the agency's budget dropped by nearly 20 percent from 2010 to 2015, falling to $10.9 billion from $13.4 billion, according to calculations done by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, relying on government data. This has led to significant cuts in enforcement officials tasked with clawing back tax revenue from the wealthy.
The Republican leadership in Congress, which has influence over the I.R.S. budget, has given little indication that it is open to reversing this trend.
In the end, the ultimate arbiter of the fate of the Obama tax increases is likely to be his successor. Every leading Republican presidential candidate has proposed reducing some or all of the rates Congress agreed to raise on the wealthy in 2012, which were part of a deal to avoid even more extensive tax increases. Under any of those proposals, taxes on the rich would probably fall below even their recent lows.
By contrast, the leading Democratic candidates have called for preserving or increasing those rates. If they were to raise taxes further on investment income, it could have the dual effect of both raising rates on the wealthy and making certain tax avoidance strategies less lucrative.

Abstract: [...]while the paper never published any results from that investigation, an attack on Judge Gonzales, with what looks like a fictitious byline, did appear in a small Connecticut newspaper owned by one of Mr. Adelson's associates. Because Mr. Adelson's political spending has made him a huge player in Republican politics -- so much so that reporters routinely talk about the "Adelson primary," in which candidates trek to Las Vegas to pay obeisance. [...]it's an ugly spectacle, and it's probably going to get even uglier over the course of the year ahead.

Full text:   Wealth can be bad for your soul. That's not just a hoary piece of folk wisdom; it's a conclusion from serious social science, confirmed by statistical analysis and experiment. The affluent are, on average, less likely to exhibit empathy, less likely to respect norms and even laws, more likely to cheat, than those occupying lower rungs on the economic ladder.
And it's obvious, even if we don't have statistical confirmation, that extreme wealth can do extreme spiritual damage. Take someone whose personality might have been merely disagreeable under normal circumstances, and give him the kind of wealth that lets him surround himself with sycophants and usually get whatever he wants. It's not hard to see how he could become almost pathologically self-regarding and unconcerned with others.
So what happens to a nation that gives ever-growing political power to the superrich?
Modern America is a society in which a growing share of income and wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, and these people have huge political influence -- in the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign, around half the contributions came from fewer than 200 wealthy families. The usual concern about this march toward oligarchy is that the interests and policy preferences of the very rich are quite different from those of the population at large, and that is surely the biggest problem.
But it's also true that those empowered by money-driven politics include a disproportionate number of spoiled egomaniacs. Which brings me to the current election cycle.
The most obvious illustration of the point I've been making is the man now leading the Republican field. Donald Trump would probably have been a blowhard and a bully whatever his social station. But his billions have insulated him from the external checks that limit most people's ability to act out their narcissistic tendencies; nobody has ever been in a position to tell him, "You're fired!" And the result is the face you keep seeing on your TV.
But Mr. Trump isn't the only awesomely self-centered billionaire playing an outsized role in the 2016 campaign.
There have been some interesting news reports lately about Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas gambling magnate. Mr. Adelson has been involved in some fairly complex court proceedings, which revolve around claims of misconduct in his operations in Macau, including links to organized crime and prostitution. Given his business, this may not be all that surprising. What was surprising was his behavior in court, where he refused to answer routine questions and argued with the judge, Elizabeth Gonzales. That, as she rightly pointed out, isn't something witnesses get to do.
Then Mr. Adelson bought Nevada's largest newspaper. As the sale was being finalized, reporters at the paper were told to drop everything and start monitoring all activity of three judges, including Ms. Gonzales. And while the paper never published any results from that investigation, an attack on Judge Gonzales, with what looks like a fictitious byline, did appear in a small Connecticut newspaper owned by one of Mr. Adelson's associates.
O.K., but why do we care? Because Mr. Adelson's political spending has made him a huge player in Republican politics -- so much so that reporters routinely talk about the "Adelson primary," in which candidates trek to Las Vegas to pay obeisance.
Are there other cases? Yes indeed, even if the egomania doesn't rise to Adelson levels. I find myself thinking, for example, of the hedge-fund billionaire Paul Singer, another big power in the G.O.P., who published an investor's letter declaring that inflation was running rampant -- he could tell from the prices of Hamptons real estate and high-end art. Economists got some laughs out of the incident, but think of the self-absorption required to write something like that without realizing how it would sound to non-billionaires.
Or think of the various billionaires who, a few years ago, were declaring with straight faces, and no sign of self-awareness, that President Obama was holding back the economy by suggesting that some businesspeople had misbehaved. You see, he was hurting their feelings.
Just to be clear, the biggest reason to oppose the power of money in politics is the way it lets the wealthy rig the system and distort policy priorities. And the biggest reason billionaires hate Mr. Obama is what he did to their taxes, not their feelings. The fact that some of those buying influence are also horrible people is secondary.
But it's not trivial. Oligarchy, rule by the few, also tends to become rule by the monstrously self-centered. Narcisstocracy? Jerkigarchy? Anyway, it's an ugly spectacle, and it's probably going to get even uglier over the course of the year ahead.

Full text:   Steady job growth, low mortgage rates and tight inventories helped spur rising home prices in October, and a stronger job market lifted consumer confidence in December, separate reports showed on Tuesday.
The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.5 percent in the 12 months ending in October, up from a 5.4 percent pace in September.
Home values have climbed at a roughly 5 percent pace during much of 2015, as strong hiring has bolstered a real estate market still recovering from a housing crash that led to a recession eight years ago.
Rising demand, however, has not been met with an increase in sales listings, causing prices to rise much faster than inflation or wages this year. This could limit the number of first-time buyers coming into the market next year. Still, many buyers are also benefiting from 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaging less than 4 percent, making it cheaper to borrow. Mortgage rates have historically been closer to 6 percent.
But the gains in home prices have been uneven. San Francisco, Denver and Portland, Ore., led with reported increases of 10.9 percent over the last year. Prices in Chicago and Washington rose less than 2 percent. The 20-city index remains 11.5 percent below its peak in July 2006, and metro areas such as Cleveland, Detroit, Miami, Minneapolis and Tampa are still significantly below their prerecession highs.
The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of the homes in the United States. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average.
In another report, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 96.5 this month from November's revised 92.6. Americans were more optimistic about current conditions and about the future.
"As 2015 draws to a close, consumers' assessment of the current state of the economy remains positive, particularly their assessment of the job market," said Lynn Franco, the group's director of economic indicators.
More than two-thirds of consumers said they expected interest rates to rise over the next year, the highest share since August 2013. On Dec. 16, the Federal Reserve raised the short-term interest rate it controls for the first time since 2006.
Hiring has been healthy in 2015. Employers added an average of 210,000 jobs a month through November. Unemployment has stayed at a seven-year low of 5 percent for two straight months.

Full text:   Like Rand Paul before him, Ted Cruz is promoting a tax plan that relies heavily on a value-added tax, or VAT. And like Mr. Paul, Mr. Cruz is not calling his VAT a VAT.
He has good reason not to.
Mr. Cruz talks a lot about his proposal for a 10 percent flat tax on personal income, which would be far smaller than the current income tax. It would collect about $8 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation.
He is less effusive about his 16 percent "business flat tax," which would collect $25 trillion over a decade, again per the Tax Foundation. That's more than enough to offset the revenue lost from repealing both the payroll tax and the corporate income tax, which Mr. Cruz proposes to do.
Over all, because of the cut in individual income taxes, Mr. Cruz's plan would lose a few trillion dollars of revenue over a decade. That's a lot. But because of the big VAT, the revenue loss is smaller than in the tax cuts proposed by some other Republican candidates, like Donald Trump.
So how does this big tax work? A VAT is a tax on "value added" in the economy. Businesses collect it on their total revenues, minus the cost to buy the stuff they resold. A retailer pays the tax on sales to consumers, minus what he paid wholesalers for product. A wholesaler pays on his sales to retailers, minus what he paid to manufacturers. A manufacturer pays on his sales after the cost of parts, and so on.
When you add it all up, it's equivalent to a very broad sales tax on all the goods and services in the economy. Most other advanced countries have a tax like this, with exceptions for favored sectors like education and health care. Mr. Cruz says he would tax everything, which is how he could raise so much money with a rate of 16 percent.
Some people contend this tax is likely to be very unpopular once people figure out what it is, and that's probably true. Conservatives tend to dislike a VAT because it is a quiet, efficient way for the government to tax a lot. ("VAT is a French word for Big Government," the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist tweeted in 2014.) Liberals object that these taxes disproportionately hit the poor, since they apply at a flat rate to consumption, and the poor consume more of their income than the rich do.
But some people misunderstand the horrors of VATs. In particular, they assume a new, large VAT will cause a sharp rise in prices, as businesses simply add the tax onto the price of goods and services. But that would only happen if the Federal Reserve let inflation rise.
New taxes may increase the cost of doing business, but overall price levels can only rise if central banks adopt monetary policy that allows them to. You may have noticed that, over the last decade, the United States and other advanced countries had sharply fluctuating fiscal policy, including significant changes in tax rates, but low and stable inflation. That's because the link between taxes and prices is not automatic.
While a VAT is similar to a sales tax, there is another way to think about it. It seems obvious that a tax resembling a sales tax would get added to consumer prices, but that's less obvious about a tax resembling a payroll tax or one resembling a tax on profits. A payroll tax could fall on employees; a profits tax could fall on owners. And indeed, since a VAT is a tax on business revenue minus most expenses but not employee compensation, it is equivalent to a tax on business profits plus a tax on business payrolls, at the same time that it is like a sales tax.
Another way to understand this is to think about the political fights over the sales tax. Retailers often oppose proposals to raise sales taxes. If all of a sales tax were simply passed on to the consumer, why would retailers care about the rate? The answer is that a sales tax is also economically similar to a tax on profits plus payrolls, and the retailers don't want to face more taxes on profits.
That leaves a big question: Would a VAT like Mr. Cruz wants ultimately be paid by consumers, or by workers and business owners, or by some combination?
The answer is important, but not quite as important as it would first seem, because all options ultimately describe the same set of people. We are all consumers -- even the owners of businesses -- who have bothered to accumulate wealth because it will make it possible to consume things later. A VAT could be passed entirely onto consumers in the form of higher prices. This would cause consumers' real incomes to decline by 16 percent. Or, prices could stay the same, and businesses could adjust to the new tax by cutting employees' wages and taking home less in after-tax profits, also causing their real incomes to decline by 16 percent.
While the two options would have similar effects across the whole economy, their effects on individuals would vary, mostly because people already have some wealth they earned before the tax was imposed. If the VAT were to cause a rise in prices, its effects would be that of any other bout of inflation: The value of wealth would decline for owners of debt, whether banks that hold mortgages or retirees with savings in Treasury bonds.
On the other hand, the decline in businesses' after-tax profits as a result of the need to pay VAT would show up as a decline in stock prices. Anyone owning stocks would be hurt. It wouldn't be quite so bad for them if we also had a bout of inflation, because that would reduce the real amount of corporate debts (companies would have to pay the same number of dollars to settle their existing bonds, but a dollar wouldn't be worth as much anymore) and that savings would accrue to shareholders.
So that still leaves two questions: Who, exactly, would pay? Would the Fed inflate in response to this new tax or not? Alan Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote an article on these questions for Tax Notes last year, arguing that the central bank will tend to react to a new tax by allowing inflation only to the extent that is necessary to avoid disruption in the labor market -- and that extent depends upon the structure of the tax.
Taxes that are imposed on workers' wages after they are paid, such as the income tax, need not lead to inflation. These can be allowed to fall on workers, who will simply see their after-tax incomes fall, without disrupting the overall labor market. But higher indirect taxes on workers -- like the employer-paid part of payroll tax or Mr. Cruz's proposed VAT -- may require an inflation offset. That's because these taxes reduce the wages that businesses are willing to pay.
Employers find it's hard to cut the nominal wage a worker is paid, because workers tend to get very upset. Of course, that wage "stickiness" is good for the worker who doesn't face a wage cut, but it also means companies will tend to hire fewer workers. A significant new VAT that did not come with a bout of central bank-driven inflation would cause unemployment to soar.
In Mr. Viard's view, a VAT like the one Mr. Cruz is proposing would probably need to come with a significant, one-time burst of inflation -- but not a full 16 percent. More likely it would require about half that, because Mr. Cruz would repeal the employer-paid part of the payroll tax, partly offsetting those employers' new VAT bill.
So the Cruz plan would indeed probably lead to a significant, one-time rise in the price level of less than 16 percent. The tax would fall partly on consumers, and partly on workers and business owners, who of course are more or less the same people.
That assumes the Federal Reserve actually responds to the tax with a labor market stabilizing policy, which is one of its key policy aims. But its other key policy aim is price stability, and as you may have noticed in recent years, the Fed has been perhaps overly obsessed with this latter aim, failing to hit even its own modest targets for inflation despite labor market weakness.
Given that track record, the Fed will not be eager to allow a one-time, high-single-digit rise in prices, even if a change in tax policy made such a rise really useful. If the Fed held prices down despite firms' desire to cut wages, adopting the VAT could cause a sharp bout of unemployment and a recession.
All that disruption is the reason it would be very challenging to shift the United States to a VAT-based tax system.

Doubling Down on W

Full text:   2015 was, of course, the year of Donald Trump, whose rise has inspired horror among establishment Republicans and, let's face it, glee -- call it Trumpenfreude -- among many Democrats. But Trumpism has in one way worked to the G.O.P. establishment's advantage: it has distracted pundits and the press from the hard right turn even conventional Republican candidates have taken, a turn whose radicalism would have seemed implausible not long ago.
After all, you might have expected the debacle of George W. Bush's presidency -- a debacle not just for the nation, but for the Republican Party, which saw Democrats both take the White House and achieve some major parts of their agenda -- to inspire some reconsideration of W-type policies. What we've seen instead is a doubling down, a determination to take whatever didn't work from 2001 to 2008 and do it again, in a more extreme form.
Start with the example that's easiest to quantify, tax cuts.
Big tax cuts tilted toward the wealthy were the Bush administration's signature domestic policy. They were sold at the time as fiscally responsible, a matter of giving back part of the budget surplus America was running when W took office. (Alan Greenspan infamously argued that tax cuts were needed to avoid paying off federal debt too fast.) Since then, however, over-the-top warnings about the evils of debt and deficits have become a routine part of Republican rhetoric; and even conservatives occasionally admit that soaring inequality is a problem.
Moreover, it's harder than ever to claim that tax cuts are the key to prosperity. At this point the private sector has added more than twice as many jobs under President Obama as it did over the corresponding period under W, a period that doesn't include the Great Recession.
You might think, then, that Bush-style tax cuts would be out of favor. In fact, however, establishment candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush are proposing much bigger tax cuts than W ever did. And independent analysis of Jeb's proposal shows that it's even more tilted toward the wealthy than anything his brother did.
What about other economic policies? The Bush administration's determination to dismantle any restraints on banks -- at one staged event, a top official used a chain saw on stacks of regulations -- looks remarkably bad in retrospect. But conservatives have bought into the thoroughly debunked narrative that government somehow caused the Great Recession, and all of the Republican candidates have declared their determination to repeal Dodd-Frank, the fairly modest set of regulations imposed after the financial crisis.
The only real move away from W-era economic ideology has been on monetary policy, and it has been a move toward right-wing fantasyland. True, Ted Cruz is alone among the top contenders in calling explicitly for a return to the gold standard -- you could say that he wants to Cruzify mankind upon a cross of gold. (Sorry.) But where the Bush administration once endorsed "aggressive monetary policy" to fight recessions, these days hostility toward the Fed's efforts to help the economy is G.O.P. orthodoxy, even though the right's warnings about imminent inflation have been wrong again and again.
Last but not least, there's foreign policy. You might have imagined that the story of the Iraq war, where we were not, in fact, welcomed as liberators, where a vast expenditure of blood and treasure left the Middle East less stable than before, would inspire some caution about military force as the policy of first resort. Yet swagger-and-bomb posturing is more or less universal among the leading candidates. And let's not forget that back when Jeb Bush was considered the front-runner, he assembled a foreign-policy team literally dominated by the architects of debacle in Iraq.
The point is that while the mainstream contenders may have better manners than Mr. Trump or the widely loathed Mr. Cruz, when you get to substance it becomes clear that all of them are frighteningly radical, and that none of them seem to have learned anything from past disasters.
Why does this matter? Right now conventional wisdom, as captured by the bookies and the betting markets, suggests even or better-than-even odds that Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz will be the nominee, in which case everyone will be aware of the candidate's extremism. But there's still a substantial chance that the outsiders will falter and someone less obviously out there -- probably Mr. Rubio -- will end up on top.
And if this happens, it will be important to realize that not being Donald Trump doesn't make someone a moderate, or even halfway reasonable. The truth is that there are no moderates in the Republican primary, and being reasonable appears to be a disqualifying characteristic for anyone seeking the party's nod.

Abstract: According to a 2012 survey, about a third of people who get no or partial pay when they take time off for a new child end up doing things like borrowing money, dipping into savings or putting off paying bills. The paid family leave program both support is designed as social insurance much like Social Security, funded by a 0.2 percent payroll tax increase.

Full text:   HILLARY CLINTON has vowed not to raise taxes on the middle class.
It's a pledge that has worked well for others on the campaign trail before her, a resonant assurance to voters who saw themselves as middle class or aspired to be. But it's a bad promise.
Mrs. Clinton is using a definition of middle class that has long been popular among Democratic policy makers, from her husband to Barack Obama when he was a candidate: any household that makes $250,000 or less a year. Yet this definition is completely out of touch with reality. It also boxes her in.
The most recent Census Bureau data showed that median household income -- what people in the exact middle of the American spectrum earn -- is $53,657.
Those families who make $250,000 a year, on the other hand, belong to an elite group: Americans who earn enough to be in the highest 5 percent of the income distribution. That top stratum captures anyone who makes $206,568 or more -- not everyone in the so-called middle class that Mrs. Clinton says she is dedicated to protecting, but too large a chunk of it.
This doesn't matter just because the math is so off. In an era of deepening income inequality, those people in the top 5 percent who are being classified as middle class are pulling further away from the rest of us. Americans at the bottom or in the middle have experienced five years of falling or stagnating income; those in the top 5 percent have generally seen their incomes increase. Between 1967 and 2014, median household income went up by $9,400 while those 5 percenters are now making $88,800 more, all adjusted for inflation.
A policy response should give those who are sliding backward a hand up, most likely funded by the people who are doing so well. But under Mrs. Clinton's pledge, some of the well off won't be called on to help out, and are in fact lumped in for receiving a boost. (I should note that my spouse works on the technology team for the Clinton campaign, but is not involved in policy.)
Mrs. Clinton's pledge also blocks her from backing policies that would almost certainly benefit middle-class Americans, even if it raised their taxes slightly.
Take paid family leave. As things stand, Americans are not legally guaranteed any pay when they take time away from work for the arrival of a new baby or to care for a sick family member. According to a 2012 survey, about a third of people who get no or partial pay when they take time off for a new child end up doing things like borrowing money, dipping into savings or putting off paying bills. Fifteen percent enroll in public benefits.
Senator Bernie Sanders also wants to help the middle class, but he wants to do it in a way that could mean raising its taxes, even if he promises that most of an increased burden will fall on the wealthy. This has made him a target of the Clinton camp, which is telling voters that Mrs. Clinton is the only candidate pledging to shield the middle class.
Mr. Sanders, as well as Martin O'Malley, who is also running for the Democratic nomination, have avoided any pledge against middle-class tax increases. The paid family leave program both support is designed as social insurance much like Social Security, funded by a 0.2 percent payroll tax increase.
Yet Mrs. Clinton's pledge rules out supporting such a proposal. While she has frequently talked about paid family leave, she says her plan will call on only the wealthiest to pay for it.
Mr. Obama, who also made a pledge not to raise middle-class taxes, has seen how limiting it can be. Early last year, he made an effort to levy some taxes on 529 college savings accounts, given that 70 percent of account balances in those and similar accounts are owned by families who make more than $200,000. The revenue from the tax would have been plowed into college subsidies that would reach low- and middle-income Americans.
It was a doomed idea. Some families with closer to median income do use 529 accounts. So adding a tax would, technically, increase some middle-class people's burden, thus violating Mr. Obama's promise. Backlash erupted not just from Republicans, but fellow Democrats, and he dropped the idea less than a week after floating it.
Even Mr. Sanders, who often talks about income inequality, isn't entirely immune from the allure of the $250,000 threshold. He's ruled out middle-class tax increases except to fund paid family leave, promising to somehow get the needed revenue for his platform from banks and the very rich. And in other areas -- top tax rates, Social Security payroll taxes -- he adopts the $250,000 cap for no clear reason related to the policies themselves. That speaks to the spell this arbitrary limit has cast over the Democratic Party.
It's one it needs to break. The middle-class pledge has not just been outpaced by Democrats' policy ambition. It's been outpaced by voters' reality.
Over the last decade and a half, fewer and fewer Americans are identifying as middle class, and a growing share says it is working or lower class. Income inequality compresses many downward and lifts up the sliver already at the top.
That shifting identity should relieve candidates of the sense that there is a political urgency in spouting the phrase "middle class," and it demands a new framework -- one that is honest about the class divisions in the country.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Foreign arms sales by the United States jumped by almost $10 billion in 2014, about 35 percent, even as the global weapons market remained flat and competition among suppliers increased, a new congressional study has found.
American weapons receipts rose to $36.2 billion in 2014 from $26.7 billion the year before, bolstered by multibillion-dollar agreements with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. Those deals and others ensured that the United States remained the single largest provider of arms around the world last year, controlling just over 50 percent of the market.
Russia followed the United States as the top weapons supplier, completing $10.2 billion in sales, compared with $10.3 billion in 2013. Sweden was third, with roughly $5.5 billion in sales, followed by France with $4.4 billion and China with $2.2 billion.
South Korea, a key American ally, was the world's top weapons buyer in 2014, completing $7.8 billion in contracts. It has faced continued tensions with neighboring North Korea in recent years over the North's nuclear weapons program and other provocations. The bulk of South Korea's purchases, worth more than $7 billion, were made with the United States and included transport helicopters and related support, as well as advanced unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles.
Iraq followed South Korea, with $7.3 billion in purchases intended to build up its military in the wake of the American troop withdrawal there.
Brazil, another developing nation building its military force, was third with $6.5 billion worth of purchase agreements, primarily for Swedish aircraft.
The report to Congress found that total global arms sales rose slightly in 2014 to $71.8 billion, from $70.1 billion in 2013. Despite that increase, the report concluded that "the international arms market is not likely growing over all," because of "the weakened state of the global economy."
It was the second successive year that global sales remained steady, suggesting that the market has begun to level off after several years of extreme fluctuation.
The lack of market expansion has led to greater competition among suppliers. Some arms producers have adopted measures like flexible financing, counter-trade guarantees and coproduction and co-assembly agreements to try to secure sales, according to the report.
"A number of weapons-exporting nations are focusing not only on the clients with which they have held historic competitive advantages due to well-established military-support relationships, but also on potential new clients in countries and regions where they have not been traditional arms suppliers," the author of the report, Catherine A. Theohary, wrote.
Despite the competition, the report concluded that, given its positioning, the United States was likely to remain the dominant supplier of arms to developing nations in coming years.
The annual report by the Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress, was delivered to Congress this week and analyzes trends in arms sales between 2007 and 2014.
As in previous years, the vast majority of arms were supplied by large, established countries to developing ones, which made $61.8 billion in total purchases in 2014.
The report is considered among the most detailed nonclassified international arms sales data available to the public. To ensure that information is comparable to 2014 dollars, the report adjusts figures from previous years for inflation.

Full text:   Tucked inside the mammoth tax and spending bill passed by Congress this month is a much-anticipated provision that will lock in a large tax break for small-business capital investments that has been temporary until now.
The break is intended to make it more affordable for small companies to buy up to $500,000 a year worth of equipment like computers, machinery and vehicles.
Known as the Section 179 deduction, the tax provision allows qualifying capital items to be written off immediately on a business's taxes, instead of being depreciated over a number of years. That has the effect of lowering a business's taxable profits, sometimes significantly.
The deduction is essentially limited to small and midsize companies. It begins phasing out when a company spends more than $2 million a year on qualifying purchases, and is eliminated entirely for those that spend more than $2.5 million.
Jerry Kortesmaki, the owner of London Road Rental Center in Duluth, Minn., relies on the deduction to stock up on equipment for his machinery and party supplies rental business. This year, he is using it to help pay for some $200,000 in new goods, including chairs, a mini-excavator, four trailers, an insulation blower and a sewer camera.
"I've been able to grow my company very quickly because I've been able to reinvest whatever I made in buying more equipment to rent," said Mr. Kortesmaki, who has 11 full-time workers at his 13-year-old company.
The deduction works like this: If a company has a $90,000 profit and decides to spend $50,000 of it on new computers, the company would normally write off the cost of the equipment gradually, deducting a portion of it each year over the span of the computers' useful life. But Section 179 allows the business to deduct the entire $50,000 cost at once in the year the equipment is purchased, reducing the company's taxable profit to $40,000. (The deduction cannot exceed a business's total net income.)
Nearly all small businesses, even the very tiniest, should consider taking advantage of the deduction, said Tanya Ouellette, an accountant with Raiche & Company in Dover, N.H.
"It doesn't have to be a huge piece of equipment," she said. "I tell my clients, 'If you bought a new Apple laptop, we're going to take a 179 on that.' "
For equipment dealers like Sherry Wuebben, who sells farm machinery, the permanence is as big a deal as the tax break itself. For the last few years, she and her customers have watched nervously as the year's final days slipped away, wondering when -- and whether -- Congress would renew the deal that many business owners rely on to finance their big-ticket purchases.
"We would get phone calls every day from customers about it, wondering if they should go ahead and buy," said Ms. Wuebben, who is an owner of St. Joseph Equipment in La Crosse, Wis. "The uncertainty weighed very heavily on them."
Section 179 was once a fairly limited tax break, with an annual cap of $25,000 or less. But in 2003, Congress temporarily raised the limit to $100,000, and in 2008, as the recession set in, it raised the cap again to $250,000. In 2010, hoping to stimulate more spending, Congress increased the limit to $500,000, allowing businesses to use the deduction toward expensive items like factory machinery and trucks.
But each increase was a temporary measure requiring annual reauthorization to prevent the cap from returning to $25,000 -- and Congress developed a habit of waiting until the very last days of the year to make a decision. In 2012, it missed the calendar deadline completely and passed legislation on Jan 1, 2013, retroactively raising the deduction limit for equipment business owners had purchased the previous year.
"The uncertainty drives my clients up a tree," said Paul Neiffer, an accountant with CliftonLarsonAllen in Yakima, Wash., who specializes in the agricultural industry. "Not knowing each year if it will be extended prevents a lot of our farmers from pulling the trigger on buying equipment."
From now on, they will know. Signed on Friday by President Obama, the 233-page tax deal includes in its myriad tax breaks one that permanently sets the Section 179 cap at $500,000, subject to inflation adjustments.
Mr. Kortesmaki said he was confident enough that Congress would once again lift Section 179's cap to go ahead this year with his planned capital purchases, even before the legislation was passed. But other business owners held off -- and this year, the deal came too late for some, Ms. Wuebben thinks.
"You can't plan to spend that kind of money with just two weeks left in the year," she said. "We might see some activity this year, but the real benefit for us will come next year, when customers can plan ahead for it."
Some companies do try to jam in qualifying purchases before the calendar year ends. Last year, Congress raised the Section 179 limit for the year on Dec. 16. The next day, the prices farm machinery sold for at auctions increased compared with just a few days earlier, according to Greg Peterson, the owner of Machinery Pete, a site that tracks equipment auction prices.
"The response is nearly Pavlovian at this point," he said. "The farm audience had grown so used to this annual silly dance of wait-and-see on our friends in Washington."
Making Section 179's higher limit permanent will cost taxpayers $77 billion in foregone revenue over the next 10 years, according to a government estimate. The tax break's aim is to stimulate spending -- but does it work?
An analysis by the Congressional Research Service found that expensing allowances like Section 179 appear to "have a minor effect at best" on how much businesses spend on capital goods. Expectations for future sales growth, not tax considerations, motivates most of the investment in the kinds of assets eligible for expensing.
The main advantage of expensing allowances, the report suggests, comes from simplifying the tax accounting business owners face on their capital purchases.
Still, owners like Mr. Kortesmaki see the tax break as a crucial one for helping their small business grow a bit bigger.
"I'd rather invest that money in my business than pay taxes on it," he said. "Having this become permanent makes my business planning for the next few years a whole lot easier."

Capital Goods Orders Fall, but Consumer Data Points Are Solid

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- New orders for capital goods fell in November and the previous month's increase was revised sharply lower as the strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector showed few signs of abating.
But the outlook for the economy remains encouraging, with other data on Wednesday showing consumer sentiment at a five-month high in December and personal income rising for an eighth straight month in November. That should support consumer spending and generate enough economic growth for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates steadily next year.
"The economy is not too cold and not too hot; it is just right. The Fed can stay the course," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at the MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Commerce Department said orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a closely watched proxy for business spending plans -- dropped 0.4 percent in November. The figure for October for these so-called core capital goods was revised down to a 0.6 percent increase, from a 1.3 percent rise.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, is also being hurt by business efforts to reduce inventory bloat and sluggish global demand. The dollar has gained almost 20 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners over the last 18 months.
A survey this month showed manufacturing contracted in November for the first time in three years.
"Unless we see a big rebound in December or upward revisions, it appears that investment in equipment contracted in the fourth quarter," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
A separate report showed the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased to 92.6 this month, the highest reading since July. Low inflation, characterized by deep discounts at shopping malls, accounted for the rise in sentiment this month.
Prospects for consumer spending next year also got a lift from another report from the Commerce Department, showing income increased 0.3 percent last month, after gaining 0.4 percent in October. Wages and salaries advanced 0.5 percent, adding to a 0.6 percent gain in October.
A tightening labor market, marked by a jobless rate that is in a range some Fed officials consider consistent with full employment, is starting to lift wages.
The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.4 percent in the 12 months through November, the largest increase since December, after increasing 0.2 percent in October. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core index rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months through November, for the 11th straight month. It is the Fed's preferred inflation measure.
The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis inadvertently released part of the consumption portion of its report late Tuesday.
Other indicators suggested some loss of momentum in the housing market. Sales of new single-family homes in November rose less than expected and the previous month's increase was revised down.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that sales increased 4.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 490,000 units. October's sales pace was revised down to 470,000 units from the previously reported 495,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.3 percent of the housing market, rising to a rate of 505,000 units last month. Sales were up 9.1 percent compared with November of last year.

Final 3rd-Quarter Estimate Shows Economy Growing at 2% Rate

Abstract: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, said he was struck by a seemingly obscure but telling data point in the third quarter report: a 2.9 percent increase in final sales to domestic purchasers, which strips out the negative impact of inventory changes and net exports.

Full text:   The government revised its estimate of economic growth in the third quarter down slightly on Tuesday, as consumer spending helped sustain a modest growth rate despite a dip in net exports caused in part by the stronger dollar.
"The Achilles heels of the second half of 2015 are inventories and trade, which remain a drag on growth," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. "The good news is that consumers are showing a willingness to carry the economy into the new year."
At an annualized rate of 2 percent, the pace of expansion in the third quarter was not far out of line with the slow but steady gains registered since the recovery began in mid-2009. Last year, the United States economy -- as measured by changes in gross domestic product adjusted to eliminate the effects of inflation -- grew by 2.4 percent. In 2013, it expanded at a 1.5 percent rate.
After a big buildup of goods in warehouses and on shelves in the first half of 2015, inventories proved to be a headwind in the third quarter.
Businesses have been cautious about spending, while plunging oil prices have prompted energy companies to cut back on new investments. A weaker trade balance also exerted pressure, reducing growth by 0.3 percentage point.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes fell by 10.5 percent in November, an unexpected plunge that the group and private economists attributed to the start of new government rules that may have slowed down mortgage closings.
"We expect delayed sales activity to be recouped in coming months as the real estate industry adjusts to these new regulations," Barclays said in a note to clients on Tuesday.
For all the blows the economy has absorbed in recent years, it has maintained a remarkably even keel.
Consumer demand, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of economic activity, has been rising at a rate of roughly 3 percent. Similarly, employers continue to hire at a steady pace and average hourly earnings are showing signs of life after years of stagnation.
Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, said he was struck by a seemingly obscure but telling data point in the third quarter report: a 2.9 percent increase in final sales to domestic purchasers, which strips out the negative impact of inventory changes and net exports.
"That's a very respectable top line figure," he said. "The economy's underlying growth rate is more in the neighborhood of 3 percent than 2 percent."
Economists expect the growth rate in the current fourth quarter to be similar to that of the third quarter, with the economy's rate of expansion for 2015 expected to be just over 2 percent.
One major source of weakness recently has been the strong dollar, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. The dollar's rise hurts American companies by making American exports more expensive for overseas buyers. At the same time, the picture for growth in both Asia and Europe remains cloudy.
"Employment has been holding up but the big economic story has been downward pressure from a strong dollar," Mr. Slok said. "And the rest of the world, unfortunately, is still weak."
Indeed, last week's interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which came as some other central banks overseas were maintaining more accommodative monetary policies, could push the dollar even higher.
"The negative effect from inventories is temporary," Mr. Behravesh said, "but weak exports will be part of the U.S. picture for at least another year or two."
Tuesday's revision is the last of three estimates by the Commerce Department of economic growth in July, August and September. The downward adjustment had been expected, with economists predicting before the report that growth would be revised down to 1.9 percent.
The first estimate, in October, showed growth of 1.5 percent. That was revised upward to 2.1 percent last month.
A fresher take on the economy's prospects will come on Wednesday, when the Commerce Department reports data for consumer spending and income in November. Economists are forecasting a pickup in spending, with incomes growing more modestly.

Full text:   WALL STREET is still out of control. Seven years ago, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department bailed out the largest financial institutions in this country because they were considered too big to fail. But almost every one is bigger today than it was before the bailout. If any were to fail again, taxpayers could be on the hook for another bailout, perhaps a larger one this time.
To rein in Wall Street, we should begin by reforming the Federal Reserve, which oversees financial institutions and which uses monetary policy to maintain price stability and full employment. Unfortunately, an institution that was created to serve all Americans has been hijacked by the very bankers it regulates.
The recent decision by the Fed to raise interest rates is the latest example of the rigged economic system. Big bankers and their supporters in Congress have been telling us for years that runaway inflation is just around the corner. They have been dead wrong each time. Raising interest rates now is a disaster for small business owners who need loans to hire more workers and Americans who need more jobs and higher wages. As a rule, the Fed should not raise interest rates until unemployment is lower than 4 percent. Raising rates must be done only as a last resort -- not to fight phantom inflation.
What went wrong at the Fed? The chief executives of some of the largest banks in America are allowed to serve on its boards. During the Wall Street crisis of 2007, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive and chairman of JPMorgan Chase, served on the New York Fed's board of directors while his bank received more than $390 billion in financial assistance from the Fed. Next year, four of the 12 presidents at the regional Federal Reserve Banks will be former executives from one firm: Goldman Sachs.
These are clear conflicts of interest, the kind that would not be allowed at other agencies. We would not tolerate the head of Exxon Mobil running the Environmental Protection Agency. We don't allow the Federal Communications Commission to be dominated by Verizon executives. And we should not allow big bank executives to serve on the boards of the main agency in charge of regulating financial institutions.
If I were elected president, the foxes would no longer guard the henhouse. To ensure the safety and soundness of our banking system, we need to fundamentally restructure the Fed's governance system to eliminate conflicts of interest. Board members should be nominated by the president and chosen by the Senate. Banking industry executives must no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and to handpick its members and staff. Board positions should instead include representatives from all walks of life -- including labor, consumers, homeowners, urban residents, farmers and small businesses.
The Fed must also make sure that financial institutions are investing in the productive economy by providing affordable loans to small businesses and consumers that create good jobs. How? First, we should prohibit commercial banks from gambling with the bank deposits of the American people. Second, the Fed must stop providing incentives for banks to keep money out of the economy. Since 2008, the Fed has been paying financial institutions interest on excess reserves parked at the central bank -- reserves that have grown to an unprecedented $2.4 trillion. That is insane. Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that would be used to provide direct loans to small businesses.
Third, as a condition of receiving financial assistance from the Fed, large banks must commit to increasing lending to creditworthy small businesses and consumers, reducing credit card interest rates and fees, and providing help to underwater and struggling homeowners.
We also need transparency. Too much of the Fed's business is conducted in secret, known only to the bankers on its various boards and committees. Full and unredacted transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee must be released to the public within six months, not five years, which is the custom now. If we had made this reform in 2004, the American people would have learned about the housing bubble well in advance of the financial crisis.
In 2010, I inserted an amendment in Dodd-Frank to audit the emergency lending by the Fed during the financial crisis. We need to go further and require the Government Accountability Office to conduct a full and independent audit of the Fed each and every year.
Financial reforms must not stop with the central bank. We must reinstate Glass-Steagall and break up the too-big-to-fail financial institutions that threaten our economy. But we need to start with fundamental change. The sad reality is that the Federal Reserve doesn't regulate Wall Street; Wall Street regulates the Fed. It's time to make banking work for the productive economy and for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. And it begins by making the Federal Reserve a more democratic institution, one that is responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans rather than the billionaires on Wall Street.

Abstract: A series of steady quarter-point rate increases by the Fed between 2004 and 2006 seemed prudent at the time, but in hindsight the central bank has been blamed for moving too slowly, failing to head off the economic catastrophe that followed the implosion of the housing bubble in 2007. In its statement Wednesday about the decision to raise rates, the Fed itself noted there had been a "shortfall" in terms of actual inflation's not measuring up to the central bank's 2 percent goal, which it considers helpful in supporting a more robust economy.

Full text:   Fire or ice?
When expansions end and the economy tips into recession, one or the other is usually to blame.
In the past, the culprit has frequently been fire -- an overheating economy and rising inflation -- that prompted the central bank to push up interest rates until they ultimately choked off growth. Ice is more unusual, at least in the United States, but often more painful, as excess capacity, weak demand and falling prices foster a deflationary slump that can prove difficult to escape.
As the Federal Reserve embarks on a new chapter in monetary policy, having raised rates on Dec. 16 for the first time in nearly a decade, policy makers are acutely aware of the risks posed by either possibility.
"Raising rates the first time may have been the easy part; now comes the challenging part," said Mike Ryan, chief investment strategist for UBS Wealth Management Americas.
Fed officials do not have to look far for real-world examples of what can go wrong.
European central bankers raised rates twice in 2011, killing off a nascent recovery and plunging the eurozone into a double-dip recession that it is still struggling to overcome.
But being too slow to tighten the reins of monetary policy can prove perilous, too.
A series of steady quarter-point rate increases by the Fed between 2004 and 2006 seemed prudent at the time, but in hindsight the central bank has been blamed for moving too slowly, failing to head off the economic catastrophe that followed the implosion of the housing bubble in 2007.
The biggest problem is that higher interest rates do not bite in predictable ways. Not only do they take time to percolate through the real economy, but there is also a difficult-to-foresee threshold at which the impact can suddenly shift from mild to severe.
"I'm sure there is a tipping point," Mr. Ryan said. "It's just hard to know in advance precisely where that is."
At least for now, though, few analysts expect the Fed's initial moves to bring the nation's six-and-a-half-year-old expansion to an abrupt end.
"The rate hike this month and those next year may not really be felt until 2017," said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Evidence from past cycles suggests it could take a year, rather than the next quarter or two."
The Fed's task this time is even more complicated because other central banks are leaning in the opposite direction.
With growth in Europe still sputtering, the European Central Bank has belatedly turned to the tools embraced by the Fed several years ago, buying up securities and pumping money into the financial system. But even with some interest rates there in negative territory, Mario Draghi, president of the E.C.B., is under pressure to loosen monetary policy further.
In Asia, the People's Bank of China is also in easing mode, as officials try to cushion what looks like an increasingly hard landing for the economy there, the world's second-largest. Similarly, Japan's central bank is keeping interest rates at rock-bottom levels to encourage growth.
The combination of lower rates abroad and rising ones at home is making the United States dollar surge against other currencies. While that might be good for American tourists heading overseas, it hurts American manufacturers seeking export markets and makes imported goods more competitive, undermining the country's trade balance.
For now, most economists say the danger of too little inflation outweighs the risk of too much: Ice, in effect, may be more of a worry than fire.
"The risk is skewed toward moving too fast," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. "That's especially true as the strong dollar and lower-priced imports keep inflationary pressures at bay in the United States."
Although Mr. Gapen, like most seers on Wall Street, is generally upbeat about the economy's prospects next year, some of his colleagues elsewhere are less sanguine. David Levy, a longtime private economist, is warning clients that the Fed may be forced to reverse course as weakness in China and emerging markets redounds to the United States.
The Fed's rate increase on Wednesday, Mr. Levy cautioned, "may well mark a high point in economic expectations for 2016."
In its statement Wednesday about the decision to raise rates, the Fed itself noted there had been a "shortfall" in terms of actual inflation's not measuring up to the central bank's 2 percent goal, which it considers helpful in supporting a more robust economy.
Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, believes the reference to stubbornly low inflation is significant. "This is new language," he said. "The doves on monetary policy are saying they will go along with the rate hike now, but want to see some acknowledgment that low inflation is still a concern."
For his part, Mr. Anderson expects the economy to continue to grow at a moderate annual pace of about 2.4 percent in 2016. If that forecast for growth is correct, he predicts the Fed will raise rates three times next year, lifting the benchmark rate to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent by the end of 2016.
"Consumers are cautious but they still have the capacity to spend," Mr. Anderson added. "Jobs and incomes are growing, debt levels are low and gas at about $2 a gallon should help. When people realize the sky isn't falling because the Fed is raising rates, they will go back to their usual spending habits and save the day."
A growth rate of about 2 percent would be in line with the steady, but disappointing, advance that has characterized the current recovery since it began in mid-2009. By contrast, the economy grew by 3.8 percent in 2004 when the last tightening cycle began, and by 4 percent in 1994 when an earlier round of rate hikes got underway.
The comparatively weak recovery, which has left most Americans struggling to maintain their standard of living, is the principal reason the Fed has promised to move more slowly during this tightening cycle than in past ones.
In the mid-2000s, the Fed raised rates by 0.25 percentage point at every meeting between June 2004 and June 2006, 17 straight increases that lifted rates by more than four full percentage points over two years.
The tightening campaign in the 1990s was even steeper, as rates moved up three points in one year. Although that wreaked havoc on the stock and bond markets in 1994, the move may have helped slow growth to a sustainable pace and set the stage for the 1990s expansion to extend for a full decade.
Many analysts say that the current expansion could display that kind of longevity.
"Expansions don't die of old age," Mr. Ryan of UBS said, echoing comments by the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, at her news conference on Wednesday. "They die from exhausted demand, but consumers aren't exhausted."
"And the backdrop of low inflation won't force the Fed into an aggressive stance," he predicted. "This expansion can go on for a while."

Full text:   There is ample evidence that drug prices have been pushed to astronomical heights for no reason other than the desire of drug makers to maximize profits. Prices in many cases far exceed what's needed to cover the costs of research and clinical trials, and some companies have found ways to rake in profits even without shouldering the cost of drug development.
The two worst offenders are bottom feeders that simply buy companies they believe have underpriced their drugs and then quickly raise prices to astronomical levels.
In August, Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired the American marketing rights to a 62-year-old drug to treat a devastating parasitic infection and raised the cost of one pill to $750 from $13.50. That brought the cost of a course of treatment for some patients to hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Turing's founder, Martin Shkreli, was indicted on Thursday on charges of securities fraud involving a hedge fund and another biotechnology firm he started.)
Valeant Pharmaceuticals greatly increased the prices of several drugs it acquired, including two used by hospitals to treat heart conditions. It also protected its high-priced dermatology drugs by urging doctors to send prescriptions to a mail-order pharmacy that would make sure no cheaper alternative was substituted.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group, described Turing and Valeant as essentially investment vehicles "masquerading as pharmaceutical companies."
Yet even some mainstream companies have set high prices that seem hard to justify. Eli Lilly said its new lung cancer drug, Portrazza, would cost about $11,430 a month in the United States, six times the $1,870 price that leading oncologists said in a recent journal article would be a fair reflection of the benefit the drug offers compared with older therapies.
Similarly, Pfizer set the list price for Ibrance, a drug to treat a form of advanced breast cancer, at $9,850 a month, a price that remains high even after the 20 percent discount demanded by insurers. The price was not based on manufacturing costs or research costs, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. Rather, Pfizer set the price as high as it could without causing doctors and insurers to favor an alternative drug.
The pharmaceutical industry often defends its prices by noting that drugs account for only 10 percent of nationwide health spending. But in employer-based health insurance plans, drug benefits account for 19 percent of spending, not much less than spending on inpatient hospital care, according to a recent analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. And surveys have shown that many Americans have difficulty paying for the drugs they need. Major drug companies often increase prices 10 percent or more a year, far faster than inflation, straining the health care system.
Experts have proposed several ways to reduce drug prices, like fostering greater competition among drug companies or allowing the government to negotiate lower prices. Encouraging the development of innovative drugs and setting prices in ways that make lifesaving medicines affordable to all are not mutually exclusive ideas.

Full text:   IT was tea break one afternoon this past May, in a business park in Mumbai, one of the world's most crowded cities. The neighborhood was chockablock with new 35-story skyscrapers adorned with Greek temples on top. On the seventh-floor deck of one building, 20-something techies took turns playing foosball and studying the wooded hillside in back through a brass ship captain's spyglass.
They were looking at a leopard, also on tea break, up a favorite tree where it goes to loaf many afternoons around 4:30. That is, it was a wild leopard living unfenced and apparently well fed in the middle of the city, on a dwindling forest patch roughly the size of Central Park between 59th and 71st Streets. When I hiked the hillside the next day, I found a massive slum just on the other side, heavy construction equipment nibbling at the far end, and a developer's private helipad up top. And yet the leopard seemed to have mastered the art of avoiding people, going out by night to pick off dogs, cats, chickens, pigs, rats and other camp followers of human civilization.
Welcome to the future of urban living. Predators are turning up in cities everywhere, and living among us mostly without incident. Big, scary predators, at that. Wolves now live next door to Rome's main airport, and around Hadrian's Villa, just outside the city. A mountain lion roams the Hollywood Hills and has his own Facebook page. Coyotes have turned all of Chicago into their territory. Great white sharks, attracted by booming seal populations, cruise Cape Cod beaches with renewed frequency. And in a kind of urban predator twofer, a photographer in Vero Beach, Fla., recently snapped a bobcat grabbing a shark out of the surf.
Predators are living among people partly because they have fewer alternatives. The land area consumed by cities and suburbs has increased substantially over the past century and the rate of expansion is accelerating. Worldwide, urban acreage will triple in the first three decades of this century, consuming an additional 500,000 or so square miles of land, much of it in areas that are now critical wildlife habitat in Africa, China and India. That leopard on a hilltop in Mumbai didn't move into the city. The city rose up and engulfed its world.
Many species are also getting used to the idea that humans do not necessarily pose a threat. It helps that we no longer automatically shoot predators on sight, or put a bounty on their heads. Prey species like elk and deer have in many cases also learned to prefer cities and suburbs because the relatively open habitat provides a margin of safety from predators. Predators naturally follow. During moose calving season, for instance, grizzly bears frequent the backyards of Anchorage.
Are humans equally capable of adapting? Stan Gehrt, an Ohio State University biologist who studies Chicago's population of about 4,000 coyotes, says complaints have tapered off as city residents have become accustomed to their new neighbors. The coyotes don't bite or threaten people, though they can be aggressive toward dogs. (When there is a human on the other end of the leash, this can be alarming, he acknowledged. But dogs in Cook County, which includes Chicago, bite about 3,000 people every year.)
The situation in Mumbai is more complicated. The city's 21 million people have encircled and encroached on a national park, where about 35 free-roaming leopards live. Mumbai's leopards can of course kill people and have done so a half-dozen times since 2011. But one man who survived an attack at a village inside the park said his family had no plans to move out to the grim little high-rise flats the city offers as an alternative. It would mean too many bills and too little space: "Where will the chickens go?" Instead, people adapt, he said. "In the night the leopard is the king. He can go anywhere."
The city at large has so far also held to the belief that the leopards should continue living where they always have. In the past when people spotted a leopard in the neighborhood, a wildlife biologist told me, they called park officials demanding its removal. But researchers there have demonstrated that removing and relocating leopards simply leads to more attacks, as the confused animals try to find their way in new territory, and as other leopards with less experience at negotiating human-dominated habitat take over their old territory. Now people phone demanding a workshop on how to coexist safely with leopards. Last month, the park issued a pamphlet of camera trap photos and names for all 35 leopards. (Your new neighbor is named "Mastikhor." It means "mischievous.")
If you are thinking, "Wait, that's just nuts," think again about the nature of risk. We have learned to protect and restore rivers in our cities, says Adrian Treves at the University of Wisconsin, even though floods sometimes destroy homes and drown people. We cherish trees on urban streets and in parks even though branches sometimes fall on our heads. For that matter, we let cars dominate city streets, though they kill more than 4,700 pedestrians in the United States every year (and many times more in India).
Rivers, forests and cars all justify themselves by being useful one way or another to humanity. What good are predators? Clearly, a lot of people struggle with this question, particularly certain philosophical sorts who preach the genuinely nutty idea that we should eradicate predators because they are cruel. But scientific research has repeatedly demonstrated that losing predators leads to a cascade of unintended (and often cruel) effects. Unchecked by predation, herbivores graze the habitat to bare dirt. The water table drops. Species vanish. Ecosystems collapse. Entirely apart from their ecological usefulness, we should value predators for their stealth, their skill, their speed. A world of sheep might sound like someone's idea of heaven. But it would be a deadly dull place to live.
Couldn't we at least keep the excitement out of our cities? That would require preserving large areas of habitat, and habitat corridors, in the countryside, and nobody appears to be willing to pick up that tab.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund, paid for from oil industry royalties, has served for 50 years as the nation's single most effective tool for habitat protection. But Congress allowed it to expire for the past two months, then patted itself on the back for reauthorizing the fund on Friday -- at half the budget Congress allowed in 1965. Make that seven percent of the original budget, adjusting for inflation. We seem to be incapable of leaving existing protected areas intact, especially as the human population quadruples from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 11 billion by the end of this century. Instead of celebrating the protected areas where the world's last major tiger populations survive, for instance, India (population 1.2 billion) now seems intent on running highways through them.
So we should hardly be surprised that predators and people wind up living side by side in cities. Cities have always been the salvation of the homeless, the unwanted, the wretched and the despised. The difference now is that these refugees come to us not just on two legs, but on four.

Full text:   As he came of age in Cuba, José Angel Sánchez enrolled in medical school for the usual reasons: to help the sick and to make a better living than most in his destitute eastern town. But he had another motive, too.
"It was also a way out of Cuba," said Dr. Sánchez, 29, who moved to the United States in September, four years after he graduated as a general practitioner.
Dr. Sánchez's escape route was set up by the United States government, under a 2006 program that offers American residency to Cuban medical workers posted overseas. It is a door through which thousands of Cuban health workers have emigrated -- and one that President Raúl Castro is determined to close.
One year after Cuba and the United States announced their thaw, policies like this, which hail from a more hostile era, show that diplomacy after five decades of tensions will not be as easy as the raising of embassy flags. The number of Cuban medical professionals who defected for residency in the United States reached a record this year, putting a crimp in the newly restored relations between the two countries and forcing Cuba to scramble to stop the exodus.
The Department of Homeland Security fast-tracks residency for Cuban medical professionals who defect, but it has been slowed by the swell of applications, accusations of fraud and delays that left hundreds of people like Dr. Sánchez stranded in Colombia for months this year.
In April, 18 months into his two-year medical posting in Venezuela, Dr. Sánchez traveled to Bogotá, Colombia. There, he applied for the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program at the United States Embassy. But the process, which normally takes four to six weeks, stretched to five months. "I always planned to leave -- somehow," said Dr. Sánchez, now a medical assistant in Paterson, N.J.
Cuba denounced the program in recent weeks as the two nations met to discuss American immigration rules that give Cubans special opportunities to enter the United States and become residents.
With so many Cubans worried that the coveted status will melt away now that diplomatic relations have been established with Havana, there has been a wave of people from all professions leaving the island over the past year.
That has created a migration crisis, the Castro government contends, stranding thousands of Cuban migrants in Central America as they try to make their way over land to the United States.
The issue is a potent reminder, analysts say, of the stubborn differences that continue to divide the two governments despite the thaw. Robert Muse, a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in United States-Cuban law, called the medical workers program an "exploding cigar left over by the Bush administration" that President Obama should eliminate.
"No country is going to welcome engineered defections of its nationals," Mr. Muse said. The United States, he said, was "not acting in the spirit of normalized relations."
Cuba's health system is a source of great international prestige for the government, which provides free training to thousands of Cubans and poor foreign students. The state offers universal, if far from perfect, medical care to its citizens and has won praise -- even from the Obama administration -- for sending medical brigades to help overseas.
Medical diplomacy is also an indispensable source of income: Cuba rents out the services of tens of thousands of doctors, nurses and dentists to other developing countries in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of oil and cash.
Such rewards, though, are won on the backs of medical professionals who work for little money in tough conditions, doctors say.
Dr. Lino Alberto Neira, an orthopedic surgeon who practiced in Cuba for 23 years before he left for Miami in 2013, said that his monthly salary of $25 back home barely lasted four days. He got by with tips from patients who worked in tourism, he said.
"Someone who cleans floors in a hotel is supporting you," said Dr. Neira, speaking from Miami. "That's very humiliating."
Cuba more than doubled some doctors' salaries last year, to about $70 a month. But faced with such small salaries at home, many doctors accept a posting overseas to make extra money.
Still, they earn only a fraction of what the host country pays Cuba for their work.
Dr. Mara Martínez, a dentist who is Dr. Sánchez's fiancée, said she was a staunch supporter of the Cuban revolution but became disillusioned when she arrived in Venezuela to find that she had to work six days a week and sleep three to a room for a salary of $210 a month. Venezuela, she was told by her supervisors, was paying $7,000 per month for her services.
"It's modern-day slavery," said Dr. Martínez, 25, who left Venezuela with Dr. Sánchez.
Many of the doctors in Venezuela are stationed in cramped quarters without air conditioning, overwhelmed by the country's soaring inflation and deteriorating economy. "It was worse than Cuba," said Dr. Dailanis Barbara Martínez Peralta, a general practitioner who after leaving Venezuela waited seven months in Colombia to come to the United States.
More than 7,000 Cubans have been approved for residency since the program began almost a decade ago, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.
According to Homeland Security statistics, 1,663 Cuban medical professionals posted overseas were accepted to enter the United States in the 2015 fiscal year, a 32 percent increase from the year before. The number of doctors admitted to the program has more than tripled since 2011, when 386 people were approved.
Cuban officials have repeatedly assailed the medical parole program as a "reprehensible practice" aimed at "stealing" Cuban talent. A State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the United States "does not recruit Cuban medical professionals," but simply gives them a voluntary route to residency.
In the spring, American approvals of doctors seeking asylum through Colombia slowed considerably, in what analysts took to be a gesture of good will as the United States prepared to open an embassy in Havana. The State Department denied any connection between the delays and warming relations, and said there were no "immediate plans" to scrap the parole program.
The Department of Homeland Security suggested that the delays were the result of the increased number of applicants. Dr. Martínez said that out of a group of 250 or so medical workers who were stranded, along with her and Dr. Sánchez, all but a dozen were eventually given residency.
An American official who was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly said that the program had been held up because some applicants had presented fraudulent credentials, which caused the government to rigorously review documents.
The Cuban government said it raised the issue of the program during migration talks with American officials late last month, but Cuban officials did not respond to emails or calls requesting further comment.
The day after the talks, Cuba announced that starting Dec. 7, specialist doctors would have to get permission to travel abroad, reverting to a restriction lifted two years ago and deeply angering many medical professionals on the island. The move came just three months after the Cuban government issued a call for doctors who had defected to come home, promising them the opportunity to attend conferences and resume their careers.
Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said the decision to restrict travel was "part of the chess game," intended to put pressure on the United States to end the program and revise other regulations that offer residency to almost any Cuban who makes it to a United States border. One surgeon in Havana who asked that his name not be used said that the Cuban government's restrictions had not surprised him because "so many doctors are leaving."
"It's been a long time since you can live off a doctor's salary," he said, adding, "Those who aren't leaving -- it's because they can't get the money together for a plane ticket."
According to the United Nations, Cuba has one of the world's highest rates of physicians per capita. But with so many deployed overseas, medical workers are fewer and less experienced than before the large overseas deployments began in the early 2000s, health workers and ordinary Cubans complain.
Medical professionals from any country who migrate to the United States often find that their credentials are inadequate and that the jobs that are available pay poorly.
In Miami, Dr. Neira is caring for an older Cuban man and studying to be a nurse because his Cuban qualifications are not recognized. In Paterson, Dr. Sánchez, who works on a ragged downtown strip in a job that pays $15 an hour, said he planned to do the same. First, though, Dr. Martínez, his fiancée, will try to get her dentistry license.
There are days, said Dr. Sánchez, especially weekends, when Paterson gets him down. "You start to think about family," he said. "About your neighborhood. About what everyone would be doing on a Sunday. About the baseball game."
Still, he enjoys his freedom and appreciates how Americans mind their own business. He would like to move to Miami, where there is year-round sunshine and a big Cuban population. "We depend on our own efforts, on getting our careers off the ground," he said. "We're going to make it."

Abstract: [...]the risk that wages will continue to stagnate -- as they have for decades for most people -- should be a far more worrisome issue for policy makers than a distant and theoretical risk of inflation.

Full text:   At least for the short run, the Federal Reserve's interest rate increase has created one clear winner: the banks. When the Fed announced on Wednesday that it would raise its benchmark rate to a range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent, banks raised the rates they charge on many loans but not the rates they pay to depositors. That widening spread means higher bank profits.
But it is hard to see how the increase will benefit the economy as a whole. The unemployment rate has held steady recently, at 5 percent, but the underemployment rate -- which includes the unemployed, part-timers who need full-time work and jobless workers who have apparently given up looking -- is still at nearly 10 percent.
One result of those slack conditions is that pay raises for most workers are still few and far between. With no evidence of inflation in wages or in consumer prices, there was simply no need at this time for the Fed to risk slowing the economy by raising rates.
Banks tend to favor higher rates out of fear that an outbreak of inflation will erode the value of loans. For most of the past several decades, Fed policy makers tended to indulge these fears by giving priority to fighting inflation, even when doing so stifled jobs and wages.
But from the end of 2008 until this week, the Fed kept interest rates near zero, even though its low rate policy and other stimulus measures did not benefit the banks directly. This week's interest rate increase, though small, is significant, because it is a sign that the Fed has again let fighting inflation take precedence over pursuing full employment.
There is reason to hope, however, that the Fed will be cautious about future increases. Recent comments by Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, indicate that the increase is more to appease inflation hawks than to definitively change course. And in its statement, the Fed said it wanted to see actual evidence of rising inflation before it raised rates again. It should not just stick to that pledge; it should also explain in greater detail what it would consider to be a troubling level of inflation.
For example, the Fed's inflation target of 2 percent is not a ceiling that inflation cannot surpass. The Fed should be clear that the target is a desired average inflation rate over time. Specifically, wages can rise faster than the inflation target without pulling up prices as long as labor productivity keeps growing apace.
In fact, the risk that wages will continue to stagnate -- as they have for decades for most people -- should be a far more worrisome issue for policy makers than a distant and theoretical risk of inflation.

Full text:   Was "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" the most anticipated movie of all time? It can't quite compare with the hoopla when "Gone With the Wind" arrived in 1939 and an estimated 300,000 fans flooded Atlanta, many in antebellum outfits. Georgia's governor declared a state holiday.
But the droids, rebel fighters and evil overlords of "The Force Awakens" were widely expected to take a hard run at the Hollywood history books, with Americans lining up around the block on Thursday night for the beginning of round-the-clock screenings.
Disney said the film had an estimated $57 million in ticket sales from showings that began on Thursday. An additional $72.7 million in international sales since the film began opening in world markets on Wednesday put the worldwide box-office receipts at about $130 million as the weekend began.
About 47 percent of the domestic sales came from 3-D screens, and about $5.7 million came from large-format IMAX screens.
"I came on opening night because I really, really, really did not want the plot spoiled before I had the chance to see it," said Andrew Toscano, 24, a paralegal who turned up in full Jedi regalia at the AMC Loews Lincoln Square 13 in Manhattan. He was among the more than 500 people lined up outside at 10 p.m. on Thursday.
Nostalgia drove others to brave the crowds. "These are people that occupied our imaginations when we were little," said Matt Quinn, as he left a screening in Key West, Fla., dressed as Princess Leia, hair buns and all. "I felt an obligation."
After the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., "The Force Awakens" arrived amid heightened security concerns, putting a clear damper on the frivolity in some cities. Theaters banned "Star Wars" weaponry. Hundreds of moviegoers were evacuated from the Grove Stadium 14 in Los Angeles after sirens went off as the movie began; it turned out to be a false fire alarm. At least eight police officers and uniformed security guards patrolled the lines at the Regal Cinemas Opry Mills 20 in Nashville, resulting in a line that was eerily calm despite the hundreds of eager fans waiting in it.
"Frankly, it's ridiculous," Allen Troxler, 41, said of the Opry Mills security as he stood in line with his family. "But these are the times we live in."
Jeff Leet, also waiting for "The Force Awakens" to begin in Nashville, seemed more comforted by the security. "You can't predict crazy," said Mr. Leet, who is 36, noting that a co-worker had advised him to stay away from opening night and at least one friend had decided to wait until crowds had diminished to see the film.
That friend could be waiting for a while. Some analysts believe that "The Force Awakens," the first new "Star Wars" movie in a decade, has a chance of becoming the best-selling movie in history. That record is considered to be held by "Avatar," which took in roughly $3.1 billion worldwide in 2009, after adjusting for inflation, according to Rentrak, which compiles ticketing data.
Anthony DiClemente, a media analyst with Nomura, wrote in a research note early Friday after seeing the film: "We have incrementally higher conviction that its broad appeal to all audiences will make the film a box-office juggernaut for weeks to come."
With an estimated $100 million in ticket presales for opening weekend in the United States and Canada, "The Force Awakens" has already broken the Hollywood record for a December release, blowing past "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," which took in about $85 million in 2012.
Every "Star Wars" movie arrives amid deafening hoopla. When "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace" opened in 1999, people camped outside theaters for up to six weeks. Fans from Europe and Asia booked trips to the United States rather than wait for the film to arrive in their countries in the following month. One estimate had two million workers in the United States leaving their jobs to see the movie. "The Phantom Menace" collected roughly $1.5 billion, after accounting for inflation.
One reason "The Force Awakens" could sell double the number of tickets: "The Phantom Menace" was considered to be a terrible movie, receiving a 41 percent positive score from top critics on RottenTomatoes.com, the review-aggregation site. "The Force Awakens" has a 91 percent positive score. As a result, fans may return more often for repeat viewings.
Consider Fhel and Leanne Dimaano of Long Island. They were standing in line on Thursday night at the Lincoln Square theater and had already bought tickets to return the next morning, for an IMAX screening. "I couldn't get an IMAX ticket for tonight, and I heard the movie is so amazing, so I really want to see it on the biggest screen possible," explained Mr. Dimaano, 33.
Mr. Leet said his goal was to see "The Force Awakens" 11 times in theaters.
"I saw 'Phantom Menace' 10 times in the theater, and I got wrapped up in the hype, and that's pretty much the worst movie imaginable, so I can't have that movie hold on to my record," he said.
Still, some of the hype seemed overblown. Some theaters that scheduled screenings in the wee hours of Friday, supposedly to accommodate demand, saw light attendance.
It was quiet, for instance, at Arclight Cinemas in Santa Monica, Calif., as the sun rose on Friday -- no lines, no vigils -- although a few sleepy fans were stumbling out of early-morning screenings. Said and Shahin Maghloui had just seen the film twice, at 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. Their friend, Cristian Luongo, had only caught the 4 o'clock screening.
"There's a lot of stuff to really dig into," Said Maghloui, 17, offered as his review. Shahin Maghloui, 12, said Han Solo is "really awesome," adding that he liked that the character (played by Harrison Ford) doesn't rely on superpowers. All three -- if their school schedules didn't get in the way -- planned to attend a giant lightsaber battle taking place later in downtown Los Angeles.
It may not have received an official state holiday, but "The Force Awakens" did at least garner at least one gubernatorial review. Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, wrote on Twitter Thursday night after viewing the movie, "One word review: WOW."

A Small Step in Japan to Stimulate Spending

Abstract: The central bank, the Bank of Japan, did not change the overall scale of an asset-purchasing program that is its mainstay monetary policy tool.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Japan's central bank announced a small but perhaps symbolically significant change to its stimulus efforts on Friday, earmarking 300 billion yen a year, or $2.4 billion, to buy shares in companies that expand the economy by investing in their factories or by raising workers' pay.
Coming just two days after the United States Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the financial crisis, the move emphasized the growing divergence between tighter monetary policy in the United States and the ultra-accommodative stance of Japan. The bank's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said the timing of the two decisions was merely coincidental.
Mr. Kuroda said the move did not amount to an expansion of monetary policy -- the bank's basic formula for managing the money supply and influencing growth and prices. The central bank, the Bank of Japan, did not change the overall scale of an asset-purchasing program that is its mainstay monetary policy tool.
Instead, Mr. Kuroda said, the bank wants to refine its existing program, which analysts say has beaten back -- but not yet defeated -- the deflation that has haunted Japan for two decades.
"The business environment is favorable, but there are still differences in the way companies have responded," Mr. Kuroda said. "The B.O.J. is doing what it can to support capital spending and investment in human resources."
By focusing on companies that invest in production and workers, Mr. Kuroda was addressing a stubborn obstacle to his efforts to promote consumption and stoke inflation: Many businesses are defensively hoarding cash rather than injecting it back into the economy. That has kept a lid on wages and prices, forcing the bank to postpone a goal of achieving around 2 percent inflation.
"The B.O.J. is sending the message through the market: Please cooperate," said Masamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.
The central bank also on Friday extended the average maturity of the government bonds it buys from a range of seven to 10 years to seven to 12 years, in what Mr. Kuroda called a "technical" adjustment.
Investors seemed unsure what to make of Friday's moves, which were less assertive than others made by Mr. Kuroda since he took over as central bank chief in early 2013. His mandate was to overturn the bank's previously cautious approach and take it into a "new dimension" of aggressive monetary expansion.
The Nikkei 225 average jumped immediately after the announcement on Friday and the yen fell against the dollar, but both moves were soon reversed. Japanese stocks closed nearly 2 percent lower on the day.
The Bank of Japan already buys ¥3 trillion of equities a year under its existing asset-purchasing program, as well as tens of trillions of yen of government bonds and other financial instruments. That is many times more than it set aside with the new stock-buying program that it announced on Friday and said would begin in April.
And unless the bank raises its target for overall monetary expansion by the time the additional buying starts, it will have to reduce its accumulation of other assets to make room, weakening the effect on financial markets.
"The substance is pretty small, really just fine-tuning," said Ayako Sera, a strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. "The bank calls its policy qualitative and quantitative easing, and this time the impression is there was a small alteration on the qualitative side."
Nonetheless, it came as a surprise, Ms. Sera added, because few investors had expected the bank to take any action at all.
The bank has left its policy settings unchanged for months, despite softening prices, to the disappointment of some analysts and investors. Its last major monetary expansion occurred more than a year ago, in October 2014.
Mr. Adachi, of JPMorgan, said that if nothing else, the bank had sent a message that it was still actively looking for new ways to support the economy.
"The B.O.J. doesn't want markets to conclude that it's never going to ease again," he said.
Mr. Kuroda seemed to concede that point at a news conference after the policy announcement. Referring to a view expressed by some critics that the bank had effectively run out of ammunition in its stimulus drive -- it is now buying up a majority of the bonds that the government puts on the market -- he said, "I don't believe that qualitative and quantitative easing will reach a limit anytime soon."
In its announcement, the bank said the new stock-buying initiative would target index funds "composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively making investment in physical and human capital."
The program, it said, would start by buying funds that track the JPX-Nikkei Index 400, a relatively new index made up of Japanese companies that are judged to meet high standards of governance and profitability.

Abstract: [...]those 10 percent increases -- on drugs for common diseases like diabetes, high cholesterol and cancer -- have a far bigger impact on health care spending than the 5,000 percent increase on Turing's drug, Daraprim, which might be used by about 2,000 people a year facing possible brain damage from a parasitic infection called toxoplasmosis. "Because he played the part so well of the evil Wall Street hedge fund guy, Martin really drew attention away from the more serious issues with much bigger dollar impacts," said John Rother, chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, a Washington organization concerned with drug prices.

Full text:   During his three months as a household name, Martin Shkreli has been a walking, talking (incessantly) personification of one of the pharmaceutical industry's worst nightmares -- the greedy drug company executive.
So his arrest Thursday on securities fraud charges might bring some private cheer to pharmaceutical company executives, who blame him for setting off a public uproar over drug prices.
In fact, in some ways, Mr. Shkreli, chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, has taken the heat off other drug companies.
Most drug companies do not increase prices fiftyfold overnight, as Mr. Shkreli did.
But they often increase prices 10 percent or more a year, far faster than inflation. And those 10 percent increases -- on drugs for common diseases like diabetes, high cholesterol and cancer -- have a far bigger impact on health care spending than the 5,000 percent increase on Turing's drug, Daraprim, which might be used by about 2,000 people a year facing possible brain damage from a parasitic infection called toxoplasmosis.
"Because he played the part so well of the evil Wall Street hedge fund guy, Martin really drew attention away from the more serious issues with much bigger dollar impacts," said John Rother, chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, a Washington organization concerned with drug prices. Its members include medical societies, insurers, consumer groups and labor unions.
The arrest and indictment will buttress the efforts of more established pharmaceutical companies to distance themselves from the upstart Mr. Shkreli. They have been arguing that most companies do research to invent innovative new drugs, not merely acquire the rights to old ones and raise their prices.
"He is not us," Kenneth C. Frazier, chief executive of Merck and chairman of the pharmaceutical industry's main trade group, said this month at the Forbes Healthcare Summit this month. Now, pharmaceutical executives can look at the federal indictment and say that Mr. Shkreli is an aberration, a rotten apple.
But his arrest is not likely to make concern about drug prices go away. First of all, Mr. Shkreli was arrested on charges of securities fraud stemming mainly from his time as a hedge fund manager, not for increasing the price of Daraprim to $750 a pill from $13.50. And his professed motivation -- charging high prices to get money to spend on developing new drugs -- is not all that different from that of other pharmaceutical companies.
Just a year ago, the public outrage was over Sovaldi, a new hepatitis C drug being sold by Gilead Sciences for $1,000 a pill, or $84,000 for a course of treatment. The drug was a true innovation, curing the disease in 12 weeks with few side effects. But so many people wanted treatment that the drug racked up sales of $10.3 billion in 2014, shattering the sales record for a first-year drug and straining the budgets of state Medicaid programs, private insurers, prisons and the Veterans Health Administration.
Now, Gilead has been largely shoved out of the news by Turing and other companies with similar practices, most notably Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.
Unlike many other countries, the United States does not control drug prices, making the American market a big source of profits for drug makers worldwide. In the last two decades or so, price increases on existing drugs in the United States accounted for fully half the growth of the entire multinational pharmaceutical industry, said Richard Evans, an analyst at SSR Health, a stock analysis company.
Old drugs for multiple sclerosis, for instance, have gone up in price to more than $60,000 a year from about $10,000 a year in the late 1990s.
There have been concerns for decades about the prices of particular drugs, such as early treatments for H.I.V. But concern has really come to the fore in the last few years with the rise of so-called specialty drugs, which are for less common diseases and can cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
One reason is that doctors have started to pay attention to drug costs. They say their staffs have to spend countless hours trying to arrange reimbursement or financial assistance so patients can afford drugs.
In 2012, doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center wrote an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times about their decision to not use a new cancer drug because it was twice as expensive but no more effective than an existing one. The next year, more than 100 influential cancer specialists wrote an article in a medical journal protesting the prices for drugs such as Gleevec, the Novartis leukemia drug that had tripled in price since its introduction in 2001.
Nowadays, new cancer drugs typically cost over $10,000 a month, and the price is rising.
With new drugs for rare diseases selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, it occurred to some entrepreneurs to search for neglected old drugs for rare diseases and reprice them. This struck many people as more repugnant than charging high prices for an innovative new drug because there was no research involved.
Mr. Shkreli was not the first to do this. In 2008, Congress held hearings about this practice, focusing for instance on Ovation Pharmaceuticals, which acquired a drug to treat a breathing problem in newborns and raised the price to $1,500 per unit from about $100. There was also Questcor Pharmaceuticals, which spent $100,000 to acquire a decades-old drug for infantile spasms and raise its price from about $40 a vial to over $23,000, with the biggest jump occurring overnight in 2007. Valeant has done this type of thing for several drugs.
Still, Mr. Shkreli captured attention in a way few others have. Part of this was timing. His action was seized on by Hillary Clinton, who was about to make drug pricing a campaign issue in the presidential race. But it was also Mr. Shkreli's hedge fund background, and his willingness to keep himself in the news with various outrageous statements and actions, some having to do with music and women, not drugs.
"Instead of a nameless company, there is a sardonically smiling face to attach to all of these issues," said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital who has studied drug pricing issues.
Mr. Shkreli has said in his defense that while Turing did not develop Daraprim, it will use the money from the price increase to develop new drugs for serious diseases. He has said that even with the increase, Daraprim will account for a negligible portion of health care spending. He has also said that for many patients, such as those on Medicaid, the price is far less than $750 a pill. And he has said that Turing offers financial assistance and even free drugs to make sure no one goes without Daraprim.
"If you can afford our drugs with insurance, great," he said in a Twitter post on Wednesday, one of his last before being arrested. "If you can't, you can have it for free. Our system works."
That is not too different from the arguments made by the pharmaceutical industry that disowns him. The industry cites the high cost of developing drugs as a reason that high prices are justified. It says that drugs account for only about 10 percent of overall health care spending and the list prices that make headlines are not what people actually pay, given discounting. And it talks about various patient assistance programs.
Mr. Shkreli has spurred or added momentum to various congressional investigations into drug prices. But some, like one by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, are focused on Turing and Valeant, not on prices of new drugs or the steady price increases of nearly new drugs.
"Some of the companies that have been the focus of our investigation look more like hedge funds than they do traditional pharmaceutical companies," the committee's chairwoman, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said at a hearing on Dec. 9.
That is music to the ears of the more conventional, research-oriented drug companies.

Abstract: [...]the central bank's monetary policy committee, which raised the Fed's benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, said in its statement that it would raise rates further only if it were justified by economic conditions, a message that will soothe Wall Street. Some critics of the Fed's monetary largess have asserted that it stirred up a huge amount of financial activity that may fall off sharply as soon as borrowing costs go up. Since 2008, United States mergers and acquisitions have totaled over $8 trillion, while United States companies have sold over $11 trillion of debt to investors, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

Full text:   The extraordinarily low interest rates of the last seven years have stoked a bull market in stocks, fueled a global boom in commodities, prompted a wave of corporate mergers and led companies to borrow trillions of dollars in the markets.
Now, the moment Wall Street has long dreaded has finally occurred. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate from near zero, a move that will test the resilience of one of the longest booms in the markets.
Longtime Wall Street analysts and traders said that they could never remember a time when an increase in interest rates had gotten so much attention.
"I've never seen the Fed get a bigger spotlight than today," said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of his own investment firm.
Some analysts said the scrutiny was warranted, because, they contended, the Fed may be raising the cost of borrowing too soon.
"It's a very interesting point in history; the Fed has never had to make a decision like this," said Mr. Bernstein, who was working on Wall Street in the early 1980s, when the Fed drove interest rates sharply higher under very different economic conditions.
Investors widely expected the Fed to increase interest rates on Wednesday, and they piled into the market after digesting the comments of Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, at a news conference.
Stocks rose broadly Wednesday afternoon. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a benchmark favored by investment professionals, rose 29.66 points, or 1.45 percent, to 2,073.07, giving it a slight gain for the year. Every sector in the index, but one, energy, advanced. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 224.18 points, to 17,749.09, and the Nasdaq composite closed up 75.78 points, at 5,071.13.
The stock market slumped in the summer in response to fears of a slowdown in global growth. If the S.&P. 500 ends ahead for 2015, it would be its seventh consecutive year of gains, an astonishing run in a time of subpar economic growth.
There was a muted response in bond markets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, rose slightly, to 2.30 percent from 2.27 percent on Tuesday, still low by historical standards.
The belief that the Fed was doing much to stimulate the economy instilled confidence among investors in the difficult years after the financial crisis of 2008. The Fed's support helped mute the volatility of United States markets for long periods. Markets kept rising, and Wall Street kept selling debt and doing deals.
Yet even as markets climbed, investors fretted over the impact of higher interest rates.
Such nervousness first hit stock and bond markets in developing countries, which exploited the low interest rates to borrow heavily. The worries surfaced closer to home in recent weeks, in the market for junk bonds, which has been rocked by a wave of selling. Last week, a mutual fund that invested in risky debt decided to bar investors from withdrawing their money.
Investors are now debating whether rising interest rates -- the Fed is expected to increase them at least a couple more times next year -- will cause turbulence in other markets. A broad pullback on Wall Street could restrict the flow of credit into the economy, potentially slowing hiring and wage growth. A decline in stocks could damage the financial standing of households, whose holdings of stocks have increased in value by over $5 trillion since 2009.
The Fed itself closely watches for signs that disruptions in the markets are spilling into the economy, something Ms. Yellen underscored on Wednesday. If changes in financial conditions affected the Fed's outlook for the economy, she said that "we would, of course, take them into account."
And the central bank's monetary policy committee, which raised the Fed's benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, said in its statement that it would raise rates further only if it were justified by economic conditions, a message that will soothe Wall Street.
"The committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate," the statement said.
Some critics of the Fed's monetary largess have asserted that it stirred up a huge amount of financial activity that may fall off sharply as soon as borrowing costs go up.
Since 2008, United States mergers and acquisitions have totaled over $8 trillion, while United States companies have sold over $11 trillion of debt to investors, according to data from Thomson Reuters. United States stocks, measured by the S.&P. 500 index, have been in a bull market for 81 months, the third-longest since at least the 1930s.
One school of bearish investors says stock valuations are expensive and there is evidence of unsustainable speculation, particularly in Silicon Valley. Such conditions, they say, can leave markets vulnerable to even small increases in the cost of borrowing. The Fed, for instance, increased interest rates steadily in 1999 and 2000, when there was also fervor for technology investments. The stock market then lost nearly half its value.
Other analysts say the conditions that the Fed must now grapple with are in many ways unique.
Inflation shows no signs of reaching levels that would force the Fed to slam on the brakes, a reaction that nearly always roils markets. Yet at the same time, the analysts contend that the economy and corporations appear to lack fundamental strengths that are needed to keep stocks moving higher.
"Yellen is doing this interest-rate hike without any buffer," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management. "That's what makes it so different from other cycles." The concern is that companies will now struggle to meet expected earnings targets, and investors will dump stocks in response.
But Ms. Yellen expressed doubt about the notion that the current expansion is destined to slow the older it gets.
"I think it's a myth that expansions die of old age," she said.

Full text:   Janet Yellen is many things: an economist, a regulator, the chief administrator of a sprawling government agency. Her decision to raise interest rates Wednesday, however, shows her wearing a different hat: risk manager.
The quarter-point increase to the Fed's target for rates may have been as long-awaited, intensively discussed and thoroughly telegraphed a monetary policy action as any in history. So much so that after seven years of having the interest rate target near zero, the quarter-point rise was a little anticlimactic. Ms. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, exuded confidence about the strength of the country's economic expansion, describing the rate rise as a reflection of the economy's having come, in her words, "a long way" as it marches steadily toward full health.
One major risk is that the announcement will turn out to be a "Mission Accomplished" moment for the Fed. Maybe the struggling global economy will hold back the United States more than Ms. Yellen expects, inflation will remain well below the Fed's 2 percent target, and it'll have to reverse course, as have several global counterparts that have raised interest rates prematurely in the last few years.
So one argument is that the Fed should have waited until inflation was more clearly rising before taking its foot off the accelerator of the United States economy.
As the central bank's chief risk manager, Ms. Yellen was persuaded by a different sort of danger.
If the Fed had waited another several months, to the point where the economy was at real risk of overheating, with inflation rising significantly, it may have needed to increase rates sharply to try to head it off. And when moving quickly, there would surely be bigger disruptions to financial markets and greater risk of miscalibration and raising rates too much, choking off the economy altogether.
"Such an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession," Ms. Yellen said Wednesday afternoon.
By tightening the money supply now, the Fed can move more gradually, taking time to see how higher rates affect the expansion and whether inflation really is returning to normal. The baseline scenario, based on communications the Fed published Wednesday, appears to be that the central bank will raise rates another quarter percentage point every other meeting in 2016, getting short-term interest rates to just shy of 1.5 percent a year from now.
But the Yellen Fed is explicitly holding out the possibility of slowing that down if inflation doesn't pick up. "If incoming data led us to call into question the inflation forecast that we have set out," she said in a news conference, "that would certainly give the committee pause."
That's the rate-increase rationale that she's willing to talk about publicly. There are two other dimensions of risk management that lurk in the background.
First, she cannot make decisions unilaterally; she is only the first among equals as chairwoman of the Fed's policy committee. So keeping as many of her colleagues on board with her policies is important in wielding power. Wednesday's action shows her colleagues who have been itching to raise rates for some time -- some of them out of fear that they are fueling financial bubbles -- that she is responsive. It buys some credibility to keep the path of rate rises a shallow one if she believes it is warranted in 2016 and beyond.
Second, while the Fed makes its decisions apart from politics, officials there would rather not make a major policy pivot in the heat of a presidential campaign. By starting a rate increase cycle now, before primary voters start going to the polls, they don't have to pull the trigger for the first time when their actions are more likely to become a political football.
There can be no assurance that the Yellen Fed has made the right move; certainly, smart economists at places like the International Monetary Fund believe that patience would have been rewarded.
There are always economic risks out there. The question for the United States economy is whether, by focusing on the danger of having to raise rates faster later, Ms. Yellen has chosen the right risk to focus on.

Full text:   The $1.1 trillion spending bill for the 2016 fiscal year, agreed to by congressional leaders on Tuesday night, is good for what it does not contain.
In a victory for Democratic leaders, it omits hundreds of ideological and special-interest provisions that House and Senate Republicans hoped to attach to the appropriation measure. Among the rejected "riders" were restrictions on abortion, barriers to refugees, rollbacks of clean water rules and other environmental safeguards, curbs on financial and consumer reforms in the Dodd-Frank reform law as well as constraints on the regulation of health hazards, labor conditions, campaign finance and investment advisers.
Although some House Democrats have voiced opposition to a tax package negotiated along with the spending bill, the entire deal is an acceptable compromise. The deal fulfills a Democratic priority by making permanent the earned-income tax credit and other tax breaks for low-income working families that were scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. It meets a Republican goal by making permanent several temporary business tax breaks, including the research and development credit and bolstered writeoffs for investments by small businesses.
In an unseemly bow to campaign contributors, both parties agreed to postpone taxes that help finance the Affordable Care Act. Democrats supported a two-year delay in the 2018 effective date of the "Cadillac tax" on high-cost, employer-sponsored health care plans because labor unions oppose the tax; Republicans wanted the delay to weaken health reform.
The package also includes a two-year suspension of an excise tax on medical device makers and a one-year delay in an annual fee on health insurers. The delays cannot derail the health care law, but they do indicate that battles over health care reform will continue long after President Obama has left office.
The entire deal, in fact, raises larger issues that will have to be resolved later. Discretionary spending levels for next year, in both defense and nondefense programs, will be somewhat higher than this year, though still below their levels in 2010, after adjusting for inflation and population growth. That shortfall is one of many signs that government spending is not keeping up with the nation's needs.
In addition, some objectionable riders did make it into the spending bill. The Securities and Exchange Commission will be barred from working on rules to require disclosure of political spending by publicly traded companies. The Internal Revenue Service will be barred from developing rules to ensure that social welfare organizations are not used to promote political agendas.
Perhaps most controversial, the final package is coupled with a Republican provision to lift the 40-year-old limit on exporting American crude oil. To help offset the potential negative effect of exporting oil, the deal renews tax credits for wind and solar power and reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses revenue from oil and gas leases to create and protect natural areas.
The deal is not perfect, but it is adequate. And it will let the White House and Congress focus on longstanding problems rather than another budget crisis.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it would raise short-term interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis, a decision it described as a vote of confidence in the American economy even as much of the rest of the world struggles.
The widely anticipated announcement -- that the Fed would raise rates to a range between 0.25 percent and 0.5 percent -- signals the beginning of the end for the central bank's stimulus program. Fed officials emphasized that they intended to raise rates gradually, and only if economic growth continues. Short-term rates will rise by about one percentage point a year for the next three years, Fed officials predicted.
Interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans, and on savings accounts and other kinds of investments, are likely to remain low for years to come.
"The economic recovery has clearly come a long way, although it is not complete," the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said at a news conference after the announcement.
The decision "recognizes the considerable progress that has been made toward restoring jobs, raising incomes and easing the economic hardships that have been endured by millions of ordinary Americans," Ms. Yellen said. The Fed's announcement came exactly seven years to the day after the central bank cut its benchmark rate nearly to zero.
The Fed is trying to tiptoe between two kinds of danger. It wants to raise rates to improve its defenses against future risks, including higher inflation or another economic downturn. But if it moves too quickly, it risks undermining the current recovery.
It faces the additional challenge of increasing domestic rates while other central banks are holding rates down.
The result, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, is a plan for the "loosest tightening" in the Fed's modern history.
Move too quickly, Mr. El-Erian said, and the Fed could "cause severe market volatility, undermining economic conditions."
The decision on Wednesday was the most important and riskiest step the Fed has taken since Ms. Yellen became chairwoman in early 2014. Every other developed nation that has raised rates since the end of the financial crisis has been forced to backtrack as growth slowed.
Financial markets took the news calmly. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1. 5 percent to close at 2,073.07. The yield on two-year Treasuries, closely tied to short-term interest rates, closed above 1 percent for the first time since April 2010.
Ms. Yellen will now face the challenge of maintaining an internal consensus over the pace of rate increases amid considerable economic uncertainty and the political pressures of a presidential election year.
Ms. Yellen won the support of all 10 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, a victory that reflects the Fed's tradition of maintaining the appearance of consensus on major decisions.
Three of those officials had argued in recent months that the economy might not be ready for higher rates, a view shared by some economists and by Democrats who argue that the Fed is prematurely curtailing job and wage growth.
"When millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates is bad news for working families," Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate, said in a statement on Wednesday. "The Fed should act with the same sense of urgency to rebuild the disappearing middle class as it did to bail out Wall Street banks seven years ago."
Some Republicans, meanwhile, bid good riddance to the era of near-zero interest rates.
"Unsustainably low interest rates clearly didn't solve the problem, or else Americans today wouldn't be stuck in the slowest, worst-performing economic recovery of our lifetimes," Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.
The Fed cited strong job growth, and the broader backdrop of a moderate but steady economic expansion, as evidence that the economy no longer needed quite as much of its help.
"The committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise over the medium term to its 2 percent objective," the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting.
The Fed also released economic projections by its senior officials underscoring that they expect slow growth. The officials predicted, on average, that the economy would expand by 2.4 percent next year, while the unemployment rate would drop to 4.7 percent. Even as they forecast joblessness would remain low, they predicted inflation would rise only gradually to the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as most healthy.
Most officials predicted the Fed would once again miss its 2 percent inflation target next year.
At the news conference, Ms. Yellen faced repeated questions about the persistent sluggishness of inflation. She posed the question to herself in her opening statement, "With inflation currently still low, why is the committee raising the federal funds rate target?" Because, she said, inflation was being suppressed temporarily by factors like lower oil prices but would rise as job growth continued. She added that the Fed needed to act because monetary policy works gradually.
"Abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession," Ms. Yellen said.
The Fed's initial rate increase, effective on Thursday, is likely to have a modest impact on the broader economy. JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, announced soon after the Fed's decision that it would raise its prime rate to 3.5 percent, increasing the interest rate on many loans. But the bank said it would not increase the rate it pays on deposits.
Wells Fargo and Bank of America similarly took advantage of the Fed's decision to fatten profit margins rather than pass along the benefits to savers.
As the Fed's benchmark rate rises, mortgage rates and other long-term borrowing costs are likely to rise too, but the relationship is not mechanical. During the housing boom, mortgage rates barely budged as the Fed increased short-term rates because of increased foreign investment. That pattern could recur if investors once again conclude that the United States is the safest place to park money.
Still, some analysts said they expected higher rates would begin to curtail economic activity fairly quickly, pointing for example to the auto market. Cheap loans have spurred car sales to record heights even as home sales have lagged. Higher rates "will hurt borrowers and it will hurt the real economy because that's what's driving the auto industry right now," said William Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Financial markets began the process of adjustment in anticipation of the Fed's announcement, and there, too, some signs of stress were evident. Corporations with questionable credit, for example, are paying more to borrow money. Average yields on junk bonds climbed to 8.86 percent on Tuesday from 6.72 percent in January.
There is considerable uncertainty about the consequences, however. The Fed plans to raise rates in a new way. Usually, it drives up borrowing costs by draining money from the financial system.
But it has pumped so much money into the system as part of its stimulus campaign that drainage is impractical. Instead, beginning Thursday morning, the Fed planned to pay banks and other financial firms not to lend below its new benchmark rate.
To set the new base line, the Fed said it would pay banks a rate of 0.5 percent on unused money, and would borrow up to $2 trillion from other financial firms at a rate of 0.25 percent.
Those measures were stronger than markets had expected, reflecting the Fed's determination.

Full text:   BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Eleven weeks after Moscow launched its first airstrikes in Syria, the scream of Russian warplanes have become so familiar in rebel-held areas that even children recognize them. But the military map of the conflict has changed little, and the Kremlin's forces have become another set of players in a civil war that seems to defy solution.
While the air campaign, begun in a burst of enthusiasm on Sept. 30, has blunted rebel advances, it has had minimal effect on the jihadists of the Islamic State, the declared target, and it has made an already dire humanitarian crisis even worse.
Instead, the campaign's greatest effects may have been on the political fortunes of Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, who has leveraged Russia's intervention to make himself a necessary interlocutor in efforts to end the Syrian civil war.
Yet his gambit in Syria is proving to be a double-edged sword. It has come at great expense: in Russian lives, resources, a dangerous clash with Turkey and other costs that could grow significantly in the months ahead. Russia, like the United States, has found that airpower alone has done relatively little to shift the status quo on the ground, leaving it dependent on the distant hope that a political process can find a way out.
For now, as the United States pushes for new peace talks between the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad and the opposition, everyone involved realizes that Mr. Putin's cooperation has become essential, though not necessarily a guarantee of success.
"With this military escalation, the Russians have put themselves back at the center of the Syrian equation and at the forefront of the diplomatic stage," said Noah Bonsey, a Syria analyst with the International Crisis Group, "But on the ground, returns on their military investment have proven limited and are unlikely to improve."
Frederic C. Hof, a former State Department official for Syria in the Obama administration and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said "what matters is ground power, and that is where we have not seen anything terribly significant in the regime-Russian combination so far."
On Monday, the European Union delayed a decision on whether to renew its sanctions against Russia, as cracks appear in the once-unified support for punitive measures against Mr. Putin. Secretary of State John Kerry was in Moscow on Tuesday, as well, seeking to narrow the gaps with Mr. Putin so that new peace talks on Syria can be scheduled for early next year.
But Mr. Putin has paid a price for this improvement in his diplomatic standing, and is likely to soon feel just as pressured as President Obama and European leaders to find a political solution to the Syrian conflict.
As it struggles economically because of low oil prices and international sanctions, the last thing Russia needs is a quagmire requiring continued investment while possibly souring the mood at home and fraying relations with other countries.
Already, Russia has seen hundreds of citizens killed in the terrorist bombing of an airliner as it left the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, and relations with Turkey were ruptured after Turkish fighter jets shot down a Russian warplane. In addition to the loss of life, the disasters cut the Russian public off from their two favorite and most affordable vacation spots, just as they are beginning to feel the pinch of inflation.
And there remains the possibility of blowback by Russian-speaking jihadists, thousands of whom have joined the ranks of ISIS and could seek to return home to carry out attacks.
So while it remains true that the United States and Europe need Mr. Putin to deal with troubles around the world, in Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, it is becoming increasingly clear that Mr. Putin might need their help, too.
Mr. Kerry met for nearly four hours on Tuesday evening with Mr. Putin in the Kremlin, in talks intended to smooth differences over a planned round of Syria negotiations set to take place in New York on Friday.
Among the issues to be decided in the run-up to the proposed talks is which of the dozens of militias fighting in Syria should speak for the Syrian opposition, and which should be designated terrorist organizations.
The United States, Mr. Kerry said, was not seeking Mr. Assad's ouster per se, but rather considers it unlikely he can preside over a successful settlement.
Moscow said at the start that it was going after the Islamic State, which controls territory in eastern Syria and in Iraq. But instead it has mostly bombed rebel forces in the country's northwest, near the threatened stronghold of Mr. Assad and his Alawite sect, leading many to conclude that its primary goal is to sustain his rule.
In some areas, like near the government-held coastal enclave of Latakia, Russian air support has helped stop rebel advances. And south of Aleppo, Syria's largest city, government forces have gained territory, although most of it is sparsely populated.
Perhaps the government's greatest achievement since the Russian airstrikes began was to break the siege by Islamic State fighters of the Kweiras military air base near Aleppo. But even that is unlikely to greatly affect the course of the wider war.
In rebel-held territory, the Russian campaign has added a new level of terror, creating a fresh wave of civilian refugees and damaging critical infrastructure, according to opposition activists and international monitors.
"The Russian bombing is worse than that by the regime," said Shadi al-Owaini, an anti-government activist in northwestern Syria whose office was recently destroyed by what he thinks was a Russian bomb.
Residents of opposition areas had grown accustomed to attacks by the Syrian government, but the Russian airstrikes have proved to be more accurate and destructive, Mr. Owaini said.
So many have fled that some villages are now nearly empty, and those who stay avoid unnecessary movements. "In the past, I used to drive my car around," he said. "Nowadays, no way, we will be bombed immediately."
Russian jets have also targeted supply lines that connect rebel areas with Turkey and infrastructure like water treatment plants, international monitors say. A strike believed to have been carried out by a Russian warplane took place at a fuel market in Idlib Province on Tuesday, destroying tanker trucks, setting huge fires and killing 16 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict from Britain through contacts in Syria.
Yet for all that, analysts say, the strikes have yet to lead to major shifts in the front lines that divide the country.
Aron Lund, the editor of the Syria in Crisis blog published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Russian strikes could eventually have a cumulative effect by exhausting rebels and damaging their bases and infrastructure.
So far, he said, their concrete effects have been few. "Given the level of investment this represents for the Russians and the fact that you can only cross this boundary once, the regime and the Russians must have hoped for more radical change."
Like the United States in its entanglement with ISIS, Russia is relearning the old lesson that no matter how damaging, airstrikes can accomplish little in the absence of reliable ground forces to take and hold territory.
After nearly five years of conflict, Assad forces are exhausted and lacking the manpower to gain significant ground.
For now, at least, the United States is pressing for Russian cooperation on peace talks. Russia has agreed in principle to push for talks but dismisses most of the Syrian opposition as terrorists, and it remains unclear if Moscow will agree to talks with a new opposition body formed in Saudi Arabia this month. Also unclear is if Russia will agree to the departure of Mr. Assad in some transitional process -- a condition the opposition insists on.
But if there is little change on the battlefield, Mr. Putin's resistance may begin to dwindle.

Abstract: Energy stocks rose as the price of crude oil jumped 3 percent, and banks moved higher a day before an expected rate increase by the Federal Reserve.

Full text:   Stocks posted their biggest gains in more than a week Tuesday, led by rising energy companies and banks.
The market was higher all day, building on a gain late Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose two days in a row for the first time since early November. Energy stocks rose as the price of crude oil jumped 3 percent, and banks moved higher a day before an expected rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 156.41 points, or 0.9 percent, to 17,524.91. The S.&P. 500 increased 21.47 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,043.41. The Nasdaq composite index gained 43.13 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,995.36.
Stocks have been turbulent since a six-week winning streak ended in early November. They dropped sharply in mid-November, then bounced back the next week, but did not build consistently on those gains.
Last week, a plunge in the price of oil set off a sharp drop in energy stocks, which dragged the broader market down to its second-worst weekly performance of 2015. Now with more encouraging economic signs, many expect the Fed to begin returning borrowing costs to normal levels with its first interest rate increase in nine years.
The government said early Tuesday that prices for a variety of goods and services rose last month, including plane tickets and medical care. Overall prices were unchanged from last year because food and energy prices are weak, but "core inflation," which leaves out energy and food, rose 0.2 percent. That is the largest gain in more than a year.
Michelle Girard, chief United States economist for Royal Bank of Scotland, said the reassuring signal on inflation gave the Fed "a green light to take action tomorrow." The Fed's major short-term interest rate has been near zero for seven years.
Energy stocks were the top-performing sector as United States crude rose $1.04, or 2.9 percent, to $37.35 a barrel in New York. That was atop a 2 percent gain on Monday. Oil is still down 30 percent this year and is at its lowest in more than six years. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, rose 53 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $38.45 a barrel in London.
That helped the energy sector, which has struggled this year. Exxon Mobil had its best day since late August. Its shares jumped $3.40, or 4.5 percent, to $79.43. Shares in the offshore drilling company Ensco added $1.21, or 8 percent, to $16.40 and Transocean stock rose 74 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $13.38.
Natural gas continued to tumble, sliding 7.2 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $1.822 per 1,000 cubic feet. That is the lowest price since March 1999, not adjusting for inflation. Industrial demand for natural gas has been weak, and the warm weather means most Americans have not needed as much heat for their homes as they usually do this time of year.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 1.1 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.2444 a gallon and heating oil rose 1.9 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $1.147 a gallon.
Bank stocks climbed as investors anticipated that higher interest rates would help banks become more profitable by charging more for loans. JPMorgan Chase shares rose $1.83, or 2.9 percent, to $66.10 and stock in Wells Fargo gained $1.71, or 3.2 percent, to $54.91.
Investors dipped a toe back into the high-yield bond market after several days of selling.
The iShares high-yield corporate bond ETF rose $1.29, or 1.6 percent, to $80.12 and the SPDR Barclays high-yield bond ETF rose 39 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $33.81.
High-yield bonds have been attractive in recent years because their returns are generous. But investors are becoming worried that more companies could default.
Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said plunging oil prices were a big contributor to the recent decline. He predicts more pain is coming.
"Buyers of high-yield bonds will be, on average, pretty happy five years from now," he said. "But I think they're going to be pretty unhappy in the next three months."
Prices for United States government bonds, which are considered extremely low-risk, fell. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 2.27 percent from 2.23 percent late Monday.
Gold fell $1.80 to $1,062.90 an ounce, while silver gained 7.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $13.77 an ounce. Copper fell 5.5 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.06 per pound.
The euro fell to $1.0919 from $1.0983. The dollar rose to 121.67 yen from 121.00 yen on Monday.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Underlying inflation pressures in the United States rose in November, even as renewed weakness in gasoline prices kept overall consumer prices in check.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its so-called core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, gained 0.2 percent last month. It was the third straight month that the core consumer index increased by that much, and reflected rising rents and airline fares and higher costs for new motor vehicles and health care.
In the 12 months through November, the core C.P.I. rose 2 percent, the largest gain since May 2014, after rising 1.9 percent in October.
Inflation is also seen as heading higher in 2016 as the effects of last year's sharp drop in oil prices fade. The dollar's pace of appreciation is also expected to slow, which could ease some of the pressure on commodity prices.
Other data on Tuesday showed that factory activity in New York State contracted for a fifth straight month in December as the sector continues to reel from dollar strength and continuing efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory bloat.
Homebuilder confidence dipped in December, but remained at levels consistent with a gradual housing market recovery.
"Housing market activity continues to improve at a moderate pace," said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
Last month's increase in the core C.P.I. was offset by falling gasoline prices, leaving the overall index unchanged after a 0.2 percent increase in October. But in the 12 months through November, the index increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since last December.
Energy prices fell 1.3 percent last month. Gasoline prices dropped 2.4 percent, after rising 0.4 percent in October. The cost of electricity, however, increased 0.3 percent. Food prices dipped 0.1 percent, reversing the previous month's gain.
Within the core C.P.I., rents increased 0.2 percent, after rising 0.3 percent in October. They were up 3.6 percent in the 12 months through November, reflecting rising demand for rental accommodation as more Americans shun homeownership.
Health care costs increased broadly; payments for doctor visits rose 1.1 percent. Apparel prices fell for a third straight month, while airline fares increased 1.2 percent. There were also increases in the cost of tobacco, education, communication and motor vehicle insurance.
"We think that the underlying strength of the domestic economy will continue to allow inflation rates to grind higher," said Harm Bandholz, chief economist at UniCredit Research in New York.

Abstract: Around the turn of the century, as the Japanese government failed to reinvigorate economic growth -- watching haplessly as the economy slid into deflation and stagnation despite lowering its short-term interest rate to nearly zero -- many macroeconomists dismissed this as some idiosyncratic Japanese thing.

"There is no question that if you had a higher inflation target, you would be in a situation that hit the zero lower bound less often," said Frederic Mishkin, a former Fed board member now at Columbia University. Because if the economy falls into a recession when inflation is very low, it might be nearly impossible for the Fed to engineer the negative real interest rates -- after accounting for inflation -- needed to jolt the economy back to life.

Full text:   This is going to sound like anathema to all those economists who lived through the inflation of the 1970s, but there's a good case for trying to double the inflation rate.
Remember Japan's "lost decade"? Around the turn of the century, as the Japanese government failed to reinvigorate economic growth -- watching haplessly as the economy slid into deflation and stagnation despite lowering its short-term interest rate to nearly zero -- many macroeconomists dismissed this as some idiosyncratic Japanese thing.
Maybe other countries might briefly suffer from the "zero lower bound" -- in which interest rates could not be lowered any further to stimulate a stagnant economy because they had already hit the floor -- but these episodes would be infrequent and quick to fix, the experts thought.
Well, oops.
Today, much of the industrial world is stuck at this zero bound. Japan has still not emerged from the doldrums. Europe is barely treading water. In the United States, the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate target has been hovering just above zero for seven years. Yet inflation has consistently undershot the Fed's stated goal of 2 percent in the face of persistently weak economic growth.
"We've realized that the zero lower bound on the funds rate is a bigger deal than we thought a decade ago," said Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, put it more gingerly. Reality, he said, has "called into question some of the assumptions that went into previous research."
And that calls into question what the Fed is almost universally expected to do this week: raise interest rates for the first time since 2008, and then keep on raising them at a pace of about a percentage point per year.
True, at this stage, it would probably be a mistake for the Fed not to lift its federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points this week. Its officials have been proclaiming for months that the time was nigh. Not to do so would confuse markets and raise doubts about its messaging and strategy.
Still, the urgency to head off alleged inflationary pressures seems premature, especially given that the Fed and many economists on and off Wall Street have been crying wolf about inflation for years.
Experience with the zero lower bound raises questions that some are now asking Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed. Why not keep interest rates at rock bottom until inflation actually picks up? Indeed, why not aim for higher inflation?
"I don't see anything magical about targeting 2 percent inflation," Ben S. Bernanke, former Fed chairman, wrote on his blog a few months ago.
For that matter, why not 3? Or, as Laurence M. Ball of Johns Hopkins University suggests, why not even 4? "There is no question that if you had a higher inflation target, you would be in a situation that hit the zero lower bound less often," said Frederic Mishkin, a former Fed board member now at Columbia University.
Why does that matter? Because if the economy falls into a recession when inflation is very low, it might be nearly impossible for the Fed to engineer the negative real interest rates -- after accounting for inflation -- needed to jolt the economy back to life.
Some central banks are experimenting with truly negative interest rates -- requiring banks to charge people for holding their money. But in most circumstances, nominal interest rates can't easily go below zero.
"Say you need a real interest rate of minus 3 percent," Professor Mishkin explained. "If your target inflation is 2 percent, you're toast because the lowest real interest rate you can achieve when you are at the zero lower bound is minus 2 percent, but if you have 4 percent inflation, you can achieve minus 3 percent with a 1 percent federal funds rate."
There are other tools at the government's disposal to reinvigorate the economy. Notably fiscal stimulus, but with today's Congress, that's doubtful. The Fed could resort again to quantitative easing: immense purchases of government bonds to depress long-term rates. But that, too, could prove problematic.
At the zero bound, "it turned out that the Fed has less leverage than some thought," Mr. Elmendorf said. "All the trillions in quantitative easing amounted to the equivalent of a small reduction of the funds rate."
The risk of hitting the zero bound has risen, as slow population growth, strong inflows of capital from overseas and other market forces outside the Fed's control have conspired to push interest rates down. That leaves less space to lower rates in response to a recession.
The previous consensus among economists that we would rarely, if ever, reach this floor was based on analysis of the American economy after World War II, a period of mostly robust, stable growth. Extrapolating from that track, Mr. Williams calculated, a nearly two-year contraction like the Great Recession, which shaved 5 percent off economic activity, could be expected only once every 570 years.
The postwar golden age, though, turned out to be atypical. Basing the analysis on broader historical data -- the experience of 17 developed countries since 1870 -- raises the odds to once every 23 years.
"Based on these metrics, recent events would scarcely be considered rare or unprecedented," Mr. Williams wrote. "History teaches us that very large downturns are not only possible -- they are probable."
The question is more important than ever. Five years ago, Olivier Blanchard, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and his colleagues pointed out that the costs of higher inflation must be weighed against the alternative.
"The question remains," they wrote, "whether these costs are outweighed by the potential benefits in terms of avoiding the zero interest rate bound."
So what are the odds the Fed decides higher inflation is the way to escape this quandary? Probably close to zero.
A critical problem with aiming for higher inflation is how to get from here to there. The Fed has spent enormous effort anchoring people's expectations to 2 percent. Even economists sympathetic to a higher target are wary of what such a shift might do to its credibility.
"A perfect world, where you could commit to 4 percent and everybody believed it, would be great," Mr. Mishkin told me. "We are not in a perfect world. Moving much higher than 2 percent raises the risk that expectations become unanchored."
So here is an alternative proposal. If the Fed is too cautious to risk unhinging inflationary expectations, how about just delivering what it has promised? Among economists and investors, the problem with the Fed's 2 percent target is that just about everybody believes it is really a ceiling. That makes it even harder for inflation to rise to that level. The market expects the Fed to act pre-emptively to ensure it never goes over that line -- which is what it seems to be doing now.
If the Fed is not going to aim for higher inflation, the least it could do is re-anchor expectations to the goal it established, allowing inflation to fluctuate above and below a 2 percent average. That alone might help deal with the next economic crisis.
"We haven't fully tested whether we can deal with this kind of crisis with a 2 percent inflation target," said David H. Romer of the University of California, Berkeley. "Central banks have lots of tools. If they say they are willing to keep using them until they get where they want, they can eventually do it."

Full text:   Seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Today that's expected to change. The Fed believes the economy is strong enough that it can withstand the slightly higher rates needed to prevent excessive inflation from breaking out in the future. But what does "raising rates" mean? And how will it affect the economy? It turns out they're actually talking about an intricate series of events that affects everything from how many people have a job to the price of groceries. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine, those incredibly complicated devices built to accomplish a simple task. So we built one to explain what happens when the Fed raises rates. A The Fed is dusting off its old tools and adding new ones to ensure it can make its desired policy happen in practice. B What The Fed wants is to make sure money becomes more expensive for banks and other financial institutions, even those that don't do any transactions with the Fed directly. C When those banks and financial institutions face higher costs, they'll pass those costs on to their customers, in the form of higher short-term and long-term interest rates. D Higher rates will push stocks down, in theory. When rates go up, money tends to flow back into bonds and away from the stock market. But obviously nothing in the stock market is a sure bet, and many other things may cause it to move the other way. E Higher rates will also cause the U.S. dollar to get stronger. When rates go up, U.S. assets become more attractive to foreign investors, but in order to buy them, they're going to have to trade whatever currencies they have for U.S. dollars, raising demand for the dollar. F Higher rates mean life gets a little bit harder for borrowers and a little bit easier for savers. Taking out an auto loan, using a credit card, or buying a house with a mortgage will become more expensive. Those with large savings at the bank will receive higher interest payments. G So borrowers buy less stuff. Rising auto loan, credit card and home mortgage rates will convince some consumers that they might not need to buy those things after all, slowing consumer spending. H When spending slows, some companies will slow down investment and hire fewer workers. I Lower spending from households and lower investment from companies means our economy will grow more slowly. J But with less demand for their products, businesses will feel less comfortable raising prices, and workers will be in a worse position to demand pay raises. K Meaning that, eventually, higher interest rates will have translated into less inflation.

Full text:   After an indecisive day, stocks rallied in the last minutes of trading on Monday and managed to end with modest gains.
Last week, the market had its worst drop since mid-August, and for much of Monday, it looked as if the losses would continue. Near midday the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit a two-month low. But oil prices recovered from last week's rout, and the broader market finished at its highest levels of the day.
The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 103.29 points, or 0.6 percent, to 17,358.50. The S.&P. 500 index gained 9.57 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,021.94. Nine of the 10 sectors on the S.&P. 500 finished higher, though most of the gains were small. The Nasdaq added 18.76 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,952.23.
Early in the day the price of oil fell below $35 a barrel for the first time since early 2009. But oil prices recovered and rose about 2 percent, breaking a streak of six straight losses.
United States crude gained 35 cents to $37.60 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, fell a penny to $37.92 a barrel in London.
The gain sent oil companies broadly higher. Exxon Mobil shares rose $1.69, or 2.3 percent, to $76.03, and Chevron shares added $2.89, or 3.3 percent, to $89.33.
But natural gas prices plunged to their lowest level since September 2001 as warm weather continued to erode demand for home heating. Natural gas fell 9.6 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $1.894 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The falling price hurt natural gas companies. Shares of Range Resources sank 89 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $21.86, and Southwestern Energy shares slumped 57 cents, or 9.7 percent, to $5.33.
Stephen Schork, an independent analyst and trader, said industrial demand for natural gas in the United States and from Canada had tumbled. That means the biggest remaining source of demand are consumers who use gas to heat their homes. But it has been a very warm winter so far.
"This weather's going to persist through the rest of this month," Mr. Schork said. But he said prices would recover if it gets colder in January.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline declined 2.6 cents, or 2 percent, to $1.256 a gallon, and heating oil lost 1.8 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $1.128 a gallon.
In other news affecting the market, the activist investor Daniel S. Loeb challenged the merger of the chemicals makers DuPont and Dow Chemical. Mr. Loeb, who owns a stake in Dow Chemical, questioned the timing of the deal and wants the chief of Dow, Andrew N. Liveris, removed. Dow's board said it stood by the proposal.
On Friday, Dow and DuPont agreed to combine into a $130 billion company and then split up into three smaller businesses. Mr. Loeb has pushed Dow to split its specialty chemical and petrochemical businesses. Another activist investor, Nelson Peltz, has been pushing DuPont to break itself up.
Dow Chemical shares lost $2.08, or 3.9 percent, to $51.29, and DuPont shares slid $2.52, or 3.6 percent, to $67.92.
Mining companies and industrial materials makers declined on Monday, with Dow and DuPont leading the way. The copper mining company Freeport-McMoRan dropped as copper prices continued to slide. Freeport shares lost 44 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $6.46.
The consumer products maker Jarden agreed to be acquired by a competitor, Newell Rubbermaid. The cash and stock deal would create a conglomerate that owns brands like Paper Mate, Sharpie, Elmer's, Rubbermaid and Calphalon.
The deal is worth at least $13.2 billion, or $60 a share. Jarden stock added $1.41, or 2.7 percent, to $54.09. Newell Rubbermaid shares fell $3.13, or 6.9 percent, to $42.15.
The Federal Reserve will start its last meeting of the year on Tuesday, and on Wednesday it is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
Philip J. Orlando, chief equity strategist for Federated Investors, said the Fed was reacting to positive signs like increased hiring and economic growth. While inflation is lower than the Fed would like, Mr. Orlando said the Fed would not wait for inflation to rise further because it will take a long time before the economy feels the full effect of higher interest rates.
"The Fed can't wait," he said. "It'll be 18 months before that change in policy hits the economy," he said.
Mr. Orlando said he thought the rise in interest rates would set off a rally that would take stocks higher for the rest of the year, possibly back to the record levels they set in May. Stocks have wobbled in recent weeks. It has been more than a month since the S.&P. 500 rose for two consecutive days.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.23 percent. The dollar rose to 121.00 yen from 120.86 yen Friday. The euro edged down to $1.0983 from 109.87.
Gold sank $12.20 to $1,064.70 an ounce. Silver declined 18.9 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $13.70 an ounce. The price of copper fell 0.5 cent to $2.11 a pound.

Full text:   The Federal Reserve will most likely raise interest rates this week for the first time in nearly a decade. To understand what it means -- and doesn't mean -- consider a previous year in which interest rates were on the rise.
In 1920, borrowing costs soared to their highest levels since the end of the Civil War. Some people were terrified of what it was doing to the economy. Higher rates "would practically legalize usury," a real estate trade group warned. A Democratic senator complained that "manufacturers, merchants and businessmen are entitled to stability" after a steep rise in rates. The Federal Reserve was "confronted with conditions more or less abnormal," acknowledged a governor of the central bank, William P. G. Harding.
The interest rate that caused this anxiety? A mere 5.4 percent on the 10-year United States Treasury note -- lower than the rates during the entirety of the 1980s and most of the 1990s.
What does this have to do with the Fed's likely move this week? For years, financial commentators have been predicting an imminent rise in rates. After all, goes the theory, the Fed has been engaged in extraordinary interventions to artificially depress the cost of borrowing money. Surely those rates will snap back to their pre-2008 levels, if not rise higher. If that happens, get ready for double-digit mortgage rates and a substantially higher cost to maintain the government debt.
But if you look at the longer arc of history, a much different possibility emerges. Investors have often talked about the global economy since the crisis as reflecting a "new normal" of slow growth and low inflation. But, just maybe, we have really returned to the old normal.
Very low rates have often persisted for decades upon decades, pretty much whenever inflation is quiescent, as it is now. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury note was below 4 percent every year from 1876 to 1919, then again from 1924 to 1958. The record is even clearer in Britain, where long-term rates were under 4 percent for nearly a century straight, from 1820 until the onset of World War I.
The real aberration looks like the 7.3 percent average experienced in the United States from 1970 to 2007.
"We're returning to normal, and it's just taken time for people to realize that," said Bryan Taylor, chief economist of Global Financial Data, which scours old records to calculate historical financial data, including the figures cited here. "I think interest rates are going to stay low for several decades."
If so, it would mean that many predictions through the last several years of ultralow interest rates have misread the situation. "Once the economy gets going, then interest rates are going to take a big leap," said George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager, in a 2013 CNBC interview.
"We can expect rapidly rising prices and much, much higher interest rates over the next four or five years," wrote the economist Arthur B. Laffer in The Wall Street Journal in 2009. In 2014, all 67 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted higher rates six months hence; they fell sharply instead.
Of course, rates could go up. But what that analysis may have missed is that interest rates historically are most closely tied to inflation. How much investors demand as compensation for lending their money is shaped in no small part by how much they think that money will be able to buy when they get it back. And the pressures that normally generate inflation seem to have disappeared in recent years.
The Fed and its counterparts overseas at the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have spent the last few years applying every policy they can think of to get inflation to rise up to their 2 percent target, with limited success. In a world awash in supply of workers, oil and more, financial markets show little sign that investors think that will change anytime soon. Current Treasury bond prices predict annual inflation in the United States of only 1.7 percent a year over the next three decades.
That would imply that we are in an economic era more like the late 19th century, with persistent low inflation or mild deflation, or perhaps like the 1950s, when the economy was growing but inflation was firmly in check.
"If we keep inflation under control, maybe we'll enter a period like the '50s," said Richard Sylla, a financial historian at New York University and co-author of "A History of Interest Rates." "Those were normal rates, and they were accompanied by a slight amount of inflation, 1 or 2 percent. That worried people then, where now it's a target to be reached."
Both financial markets and Federal Reserve officials seem to believe some version of this forecast. To understand why, it helps to start with a bit of the math behind the multitrillion-dollar bond market.
A crucial driver of long-term interest rates (which the Fed doesn't directly control) is what investors think the Fed will do with short-term interest rates (which it does control). If people thought the Fed was going to raise short-term interest rates up to 5 percent soon, no one would lock their money up in a 10-year bond paying only 2.2 percent.
And while the central bank is likely to move that rate up a quarter percentage point at the two-day meeting that ends Wednesday, in their most recent forecasts Fed officials have made clear that they don't expect that rate to rise back to levels that were common before the global financial crisis.
At the onset of the crisis in 2007, the Fed's official target rate was 5.25 percent. Now the officials' median forecast for that rate's longer-term level is a mere 3.5 percent.
In other words, even after they are done with a series of rate increases, Fed officials envision interest rates substantially lower than they were. If anything, financial markets think even this is too optimistic. Thirty-year Treasury bonds are currently yielding 2.9 percent, implying that markets expect the Fed's target rate to be even lower than Fed officials expect over the coming decades.
Markets, and Fed forecasts, can be wrong, of course. Neither in 2007 predicted the sharp downshift in inflation and rates that was to come in the crisis. And our understanding of what shapes inflation and growth dynamics is quite limited.
Still, starting with Japan in the 1990s and now across the advanced world, the predominant problems of the last several years have revolved around weak demand, plenty of supply, low inflation and resulting very low interest rates. The simple fact that the Fed is poised to raise rates a bit above zero doesn't change that.
But the lessons of history do offer this guidance: Whether rates will be high or low a few years from now has very little to do with what the Fed does this week. It has quite a lot to do with what happens to forces deep inside the economy that are poorly understood and extremely hard to forecast. And just because many people are old enough to remember the high inflation and high rates of the 1970s and 1980s doesn't mean that is the normal to which the economy will inevitably revert.

Abstract: South America saw robust growth in the century's first decade, thanks to a historic boom in the value of raw materials and other commodities that are sold to the rest of the world. High prices for oil, natural gas, coal, copper, gold, silver, bauxite, soy beans and other products led to steady growth, a sharp drop in poverty and an expansion of the middle class throughout the region.

Full text:   BARINAS, Venezuela -- As president, Hugo Chávez lavished millions from this country's oil boom on his home state of Barinas. He built a soccer stadium, highways, apartment houses and a hospital. He sang Barinas's songs, danced its folk dances on television and rode with its cowboys over its open plains.
Barinas returned the affection. Mr. Chávez and his party won elections handily here, and his father and later his brother Adán were elected governor. After Mr. Chávez died in 2013, the people of Barinas gave their votes to his handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro.
But boom has turned to bust, the economy is in shambles and the love affair is over.
Last week, in a gut blow for the movement known as Chavismo, Barinas joined the rest of the country in turning raw anger over economic hardship into a landslide victory for the political opposition in crucial legislative elections.
In direct voting for candidates, every Chavista candidate here lost, including one with the golden Chávez name -- another brother of the former president, Argenis. And in proportional voting for parties, the opposition coalition crushed the United Socialist Party that Mr. Chávez founded.
"These guys ruined everything that Chávez left behind," said Pablo Rodríguez, 37, who sells soccer jerseys across the street from the stadium that Mr. Chávez built, several blocks from a house where Mr. Chávez spent part of his childhood. Mr. Rodríguez said he was a loyal Chavista until Dec. 6, when for the first time he cast his ballot for another party. "It's not that I voted for the opposition," he said. "I voted against all of this that's going on. It's like the president said, it was a slap in the face. He understood that much."
A customer buying a baby-size soccer shirt and shorts said that he, too, had voted against the government for the first time. But the customer, Ronald Rivero, 26, said angry voters wanted to see results from the opposition-controlled National Assembly.
"Now these guys have to go to work, and if they don't deliver, we'll vote them out, too," Mr. Rivero said.
Similar sentiments are being heard around the continent, where political dynasties are falling or under intense pressure and where protests and social unrest are on the rise.
In Brazil, legislators have begun an impeachment proceeding against President Dilma Rousseff, as scores of other political leaders have become embroiled in a huge corruption scandal.
In Ecuador, protesters angry at President Rafael Correa have taken to the streets to demonstrate against budget cutbacks necessitated by vanishing oil revenue.
And in Argentina, President Mauricio Macri was inaugurated last week after surging to a surprising win against the candidate of the Peronist party of his predecessor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. His victory ended 12 years during which Mrs. Kirchner or her late husband, Nestor Kirchner, occupied the presidential palace.
"We said, 'Enough,' " said Mariela Baiguera, 42, a store clerk in Buenos Aires who said she had broken with her usual Peronist affiliation to vote for Mr. Macri because she was tired of Mrs. Kirchner's combative style. But she was also wary of Mr. Macri. "He has no room to abandon his promises," she said, vowing to vote against him in the next election if he did so.
The strains are being felt most keenly by leftist governments, but analysts say that something other than ideology is at work here. South America saw robust growth in the century's first decade, thanks to a historic boom in the value of raw materials and other commodities that are sold to the rest of the world.
High prices for oil, natural gas, coal, copper, gold, silver, bauxite, soy beans and other products led to steady growth, a sharp drop in poverty and an expansion of the middle class throughout the region. That growth, in turn, brought political stability, with leaders and parties being repeatedly re-elected. Many of those were on the left, having come to office on a wave of public discontent following a lengthy period of economic stagnation.
Venezuela has had 17 years of Chavismo. The Workers' Party in Brazil has held the presidency for four straight terms. In Ecuador, Mr. Correa has been president since 2007. In Bolivia, President Evo Morales has been in office since 2006.
But change is rolling across the region. The price of oil -- vital to the economies of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador -- has plunged to less than $40 a barrel from more than $100. The prices of copper (a key product in Peru and Chile) and soybeans (staples of Brazil and Argentina) have dropped to less than half of their recent peaks.
"There's been a pretty striking continuity in many countries, in large part thanks to the commodities boom that leaders and parties have been riding," said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialog, a policy analysis group in Washington. "When that's over, voters look elsewhere and for new leaders, but governing is extremely difficult because they no longer have the resources to meet the high expectations that have been generated during the commodities boom."
From 2005 to 2012, poverty decreased throughout Latin America to 28 percent of the population from 39 percent, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. A World Bank study published in 2013 found that the size of the middle class in the region grew by 50 percent from 2003 to 2009, to 152 million from 103 million. Many countries helped spread the wealth through innovative social programs, and for the first time, the middle class and the poor accounted for roughly the same share of the population.
Brian Winter, vice president of policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, an educational and business group, said that even many conservative politicians who hope to replace the long-running leftist governments in the region acknowledged the need to continue such policies because of lasting concerns over inequality.
"Predictions of the left's demise in Latin America are exaggerated," Mr. Winter said.
Yet few countries saved much from the boom. And now governments are grappling with a regionwide economic slowdown. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that growth in the region this year will be minus-0.3 percent and that next year it will be less than 1 percent.
In Venezuela, the monetary fund estimates that inflation this year will be 159 percent and that the economy will contract by 10 percent, both figures the worst among the countries the organization measures worldwide. Many economists point to disastrous economic policies of Mr. Maduro's government, including strict controls on prices and foreign exchange. But the government is hamstrung by the sudden drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly all of the country's export income.
Many of the policies that Mr. Maduro has stuck with were inherited from Mr. Chávez, who had benefited from the bonanza of oil money.
Here in Barinas, the state capital, Mr. Chávez had, by many accounts, more misses than hits. The soccer stadium, though in use, remains incomplete -- some parts of the roof were never finished. A cancer hospital sits unfinished, the work suspended for more than a year. A costly new sugar mill failed.
And yet the steady flow of oil money helped obscure many errors and excesses. That is less of an option for Mr. Maduro, who has presided over a depletion of reserves that has the country's bondholders worrying about a possible default.
"Chávez covered up problems with money," said Miguel Aguín, a Barinas policeman who became disillusioned with Chavismo years ago. "He didn't think about the future. He just gave out handouts to get through today."
His adherents often shrugged off Mr. Chávez's failings during the boom years, but the elections last week showed that in lean times they are less forgiving.
While the election result was a direct response to the economic crisis, the future of politics here and elsewhere in the region may have taken on a different tone as new members of the middle class seek to hold onto their gains and make new demands of their leaders.
And as some families fall back into poverty, protests and unrest will grow.
"Expectations have increased not only in the middle class but in all levels of society in Venezuela and across the region," said Luis Vicente León, a pollster in Caracas. "It's a generational change. Millennials are a digital generation, better informed and better connected, even in the lower classes. They are more demanding."
In Barinas, Freddy Garcés, 50, a farmhand who takes care of a herd of skinny cattle in a formerly rock-solid Chavista hamlet called El Corozo, said he hoped the victorious opposition lawmakers could quickly produce economic improvements.
"If they don't deliver," he said, "then the people are going to pay them with the same coin they paid these guys."

Full text:   AURORA, Colo. -- William Harris tapped his retirement savings to open A-Town Pizza, a Neapolitan pizzeria, in this Denver suburb three years ago. He borrowed $200,000 to open a second location this year and now employs 60 people. On a good Friday, his shops sell 1,200 pies.
In such stories, the Federal Reserve finds evidence that its seven-year campaign to reboot the American economy is succeeding. So on Wednesday, the Fed, which has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, will most likely announce that it will start nudging rates upward, slowly ending what has amounted to a once-in-a-lifetime sale on money.
Mr. Harris, for one, is not ready. "It's scary when you hear that the government is planning to slow things down," the wiry 39-year-old said as he folded menus. "We live on people's extra money. That's the money they spend on pizza. And it still feels very fragile."
Monetary policy is conducted in a language of bloodless abstraction, and most Americans pay little, if any, attention. But the Fed is about to make a big bet, and the decisions it makes in Washington have large consequences, here in Colorado and across the nation.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, and her colleagues have concluded that the economy is finally strong enough to grow with a little less help from the central bank. Indeed, they worry inflation will rise too quickly if they do not start raising interest rates. The first rate increase will be small, then the Fed expects to raise rates about one percentage point a year for the next few years.
The Fed's move is coming in the face of worries about the health of the stock market and falling commodities prices. Still, by itself, the increase probably will not matter much. The Fed is expected to set short-term rates in a range from 0.25 to 0.5 percent, a small jump from the current range of zero to 0.25 percent.
It is what follows that will make the difference.
Denver seems ready for higher rates. The area's economy has enjoyed one of the nation's strongest rebounds from the recession. The local unemployment rate fell to 3.1 percent in October. There are new skyscrapers downtown and new subdivisions in every direction. The former oil town is now at the center of one of the nation's largest booms of technology start-ups.
Yet the local mood is fragile. Housing prices have climbed 24 percent above the precrisis peak, but whereas that once would have encouraged economic optimism, now people fret that home prices are due for a fall.
Optimists say that the economic expansion is just gaining steam and that modestly higher rates will probably not slow the region's growth.
Pessimists see evidence of fragility in the same facts. Josh Downey, president of the Denver Area Labor Federation, says the resurgence of development has created construction jobs for a new generation of workers. They need cars to reach their jobs, and jobs to pay for their cars. "If those buildings stop going up in Denver, they're going to be out of a job and a car," he said.
Mark McKissick, director of fixed-income research at Denver Investments, says he is waiting to see how quickly the Fed raises rates before he adjusts the firm's investment holdings. The economy, he says, does not seem strong enough to handle higher rates, and he expects the Fed to reach the same conclusion. Otherwise, he worries it could push the economy back into recession.
"The Fed threw a bunch of money into the financial system, but it hasn't stimulated growth or inflation the way it might have in earlier periods," he said.
Builders, for example, will start construction on about 9,000 single-family homes in the Denver metropolitan area this year, according to Metrostudy, a real estate research firm. That is up 14 percent from last year -- but less than half the 20,000 home starts in the Denver area at the peak of the bubble in 2005.
Some workers will be getting raises. Bakery and deli clerks at King Soopers, a grocery chain, will earn a minimum wage of $10.50, an increase of as much as $2 an hour, under the terms of a new contract negotiated by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. The previous four-year deal held wages steady.
Others, however, are still waiting for prosperity to affect them.
Ethel Ayo's landlord raised her rent this year by $400 a month, to $1,126. Ms. Ayo has a part-time job as a home-care worker and her son, a college student, works at Enterprise Rent-a-Car. Together they can barely afford the rent -- and then only because the landlord does not require full payment at the beginning of the month. "And you didn't hear me talk about food," Ms. Ayo said. "After I work two or three days, I buy $50 of food and make it last two or three weeks."
Mr. Harris, the restaurateur, says Denver's growth feels nothing like the boom he lived through in Southern California a decade ago. He is struggling to repay his start-up costs, particularly during the holidays, when people eat less pizza. The Fed will most likely raise rates before his risks have paid off. If it has overestimated the recovery and moves too fast, people will have less money to spend, and Mr. Harris said he could lose his restaurants and his retirement savings.
On South Broadway, a commercial strip south of downtown lined with dilapidated auto dealerships and freshly painted marijuana shops, those worries seem far away. Khalid Sarway, sales manager at Famous Motors, says he is selling about 25 used cars a month, and he does not think higher rates will bother his customers.
"The people, they don't care about the rate," said Mr. Sarway, who added that he was making more money now than in the best years before the recession. "They just want a vehicle. They just want to be able to get back and forth between their jobs and school, or whatever their lifestyle is."
North of downtown, Denver's tech entrepreneurs also see little immediate danger from higher rates.
Steve Adams, the 62-year-old chief executive of Leo Technologies, runs a start-up, his sixth, in a former produce warehouse that has been renamed Industry, where the nearest thing to manual labor occurs when people play table tennis in the atrium.
Uber has its Denver office in one corner of the sprawling building.
Mr. Adams is trying to raise $500,000 to test a biometric device that uses blood pressure readings to measure hydration levels -- data that he says could help athletes as well as people with medical conditions, like those on dialysis.
Like many of his peers, Mr. Adams thinks low rates have made it easier for young companies to raise money from investors seeking higher returns. Denver is also a technology frontier town, reliant on coastal capital, so it may be more vulnerable if the availability of funding begins to recede.
But Mr. Adams said he expected the money to keep flowing even as rates on safer investments like corporate bonds start to rise. "The people I'm pitching want to get in early and make a big multiple," he said.
Some in the real estate business similarly insist that the local market will probably remain hot. Greg Geller, the owner of Vision Real Estate, says builders are struggling to keep pace with population growth because it takes years to find land, obtain permits and train replacements for workers laid off during the recession.
Others are less sanguine. Mitchell Goldman, the owner of Apex Homes, said customers rushed to buy houses in recent years because they worried prices would climb. Now people are holding back, wondering if prices will fall.
"I've been getting asked the question a lot, 'Should we wait?"' he said.
Mr. Goldman said he expected that higher rates would also push some buyers out of the market. The math, after all, is inexorable. If mortgage rates increase by one percentage point, the monthly cost of a $300,000 mortgage increases by $177.
He added that he was looking for land to build a home for his own family. They have moved several times in recent years, but with higher interest rates on the horizon, he wants to build "a more permanent forever home."
"I'm a little more anxious," Mr. Goldman said. "Interest rates are never going to be what they were when I was growing up, but every little bit makes a difference."

Full text:   Johannesburg -- NOT long after I moved from the United States to South Africa six years ago, I took a walk in a city called Bloemfontein. The scale of the downtown is huge, reflecting the ambitions of South Africa's white settlers. The avenues feel as wide as highways, the department stores soar. Statues of military leaders and politicians from South Africa's white-ruled past keep watch over the street corners.
But the top-floor windows of the department stores were dark. When apartheid ended in South Africa in 1994, the formerly whites-only downtown rapidly became black-dominated. The department stores ceded to African hair salons, storefront churches and tailors selling the colorful dresses favored by Bloemfontein's liberated black majority. These sellers prefer to be seen at street level.
The shops reminded me of flowers sprouting out of the hull of a shipwreck. Above them loomed the hulks of the dreams of an earlier era, one in which Cecil John Rhodes, the famous British colonialist, could write in 1877 that "we" -- the Anglo-Saxons -- "are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race."
I felt awed by the way South Africa's black majority, barred from the country's centers of power for many years by racial segregation, had adapted, apparently very quickly, to the infrastructure that was already there. They had adjusted it to their particular, vibrant uses. But I also wondered what it felt like to live in the buildings devised by your former oppressors, among the statues of their heroes.
How long could they look at those statues and not want to tear them down?
Not that long, it turned out. South Africa has been convulsed this year by protests on this very issue: how to live as free people in the physical infrastructure of the past. The conflict is also metaphorical. In March, students at the University of Cape Town demanded that a statue of Rhodes be removed from campus, and in April it came down. Young people called for the removal of other statues of colonial heroes in Cape Town and the capital, Pretoria. In October, after tuition increases, university students around the country boycotted their classes, saying that the higher fees would harm poor, mostly black students, and moreover that their campuses still prioritized the history, the literature and the emotional needs of white students rather than black ones.
These protests are remarkably similar to those now occurring in the United States. Students in South Africa alleged that the older generation of activists had betrayed them. At the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, tearful black students surrounded a top administrator, himself a person of color -- just as anguished students at Yale surrounded Jonathan Holloway, the school's first African-American dean, on the main quad.
At Stellenbosch University outside Cape Town, students occupied an administration building, just as two dozen black students at Towson University in Maryland did in November. The debate over whether Princeton's buildings named for Woodrow Wilson cause black students pain perfectly echoes the University of Cape Town's conversation over its statue of Rhodes.
In America, people have been talking about student protests as if they were a particularly American phenomenon -- either a result of the distinctive legacy of American racism or, as the critics would have it, a byproduct of helicopter parenting, of grade inflation, of our cultural obsession with affirmation. We coddle our kids, the theory goes, and now they're demanding a feeling of safety from any kind of danger because they're fragile.
But how could helicopter parenting explain the same phenomenon occurring halfway across the world in a society known for its absent parents, not its overprotective ones?
In fact, all of these students, whether they are in America or South Africa, are making their demands because they're feeling more powerful. In South Africa, black students now make up the majority on most university campuses. They're now willing to criticize their universities, asking for an administration attentive to their financial and emotional priorities and for the statuary and the building names on campus not to honor people associated with a history of black dispossession. They're no longer happy to see one campus African studies center devoted to black intellectual thought, reminding them that black thought is still considered by academia to be a counterpoint and an accessory to thought itself.
They make these critiques in the form of what can seem like very insistent demands that brook no compromise. That aggressiveness captures a yearning: to be the deciders in their world and no longer the petitioners.
In America, we've been focused on the first word in the phrase "safe space." We should be focused on the second. These student protests are about space and who wields power within it.
They're a subset of a bigger range of protests now erupting all over the world. In the Netherlands, protesters have demonstrated against Zwarte Piet, the blackface jester who's a feature of the country's Christmas parades. Zwarte Piet's defenders argue that the figure's origins were not racist. The protesters' rejoinder has been: Who are you to decide? In Australia, people in Melbourne demonstrated against racially discriminatory random visa checks. In Brazil, a new civil rights movement has emerged to give land to descendants of former slaves. The students who object to Princeton's buildings named for Wilson represent merely a corner of a second, global anti-racism movement, one probably still in its infancy. This movement takes on not who has the right to have access to our public squares, as the first civil rights movements did, but who owns them.
In South Africa, there's an idea that has hovered at the fringes of the national consciousness ever since the establishment of Nelson Mandela's first democratic government in 1994: the "second transition," also called the "second revolution." South Africans weren't exactly sure what it would entail, only that another great political, economic, social, even psychological and moral upheaval felt bound to happen. For many, even some black architects of liberation, it was a frightening concept, best filed away to the unopened cabinet at the back of the mind. The first revolution, after all, had been so painful to achieve.
And yet the dissonance engendered by daily life in the post-apartheid country was too uncomfortable to ignore. On their way to and from the Cape Town train station, black workers pass through a gantlet of 19th-century white military heroes. South Africa's secondary school curriculum is now under review, but throughout the 2000s, black students studied a history curriculum that began in the 15th century, as if places came into being only with European contact. To be taken seriously, young black professionals feel pressure to "twang," or speak with a "whiter" accent, on work calls. In 1994, black people achieved their freedom, yet they still lived in a society that communicated that white people's history and habits were the ones to respect. But everybody knew that sooner or later many features of the society itself would have to be renegotiated.
For some 50 years, since our civil rights movement, we've held up the idea that equality in the form of tolerance and integration is the pinnacle of justice. I sometimes wonder if that derived, in part, from exhaustion after all the grinding conflicts of the 20th century. We wanted to believe we could have a society without power struggles. This was naïve. It pretends there's no such thing as a public culture, no such thing as territory, and no such thing as the desire to see ourselves commensurately represented within it.
As American demographics changed, as people we once consigned to minority status became more and more prominent in public life, we were never going to avoid having our own version of the "second transition."
Even in South Africa, there's the sense that the country is still at the beginning of its upheaval -- one that could be dangerous. It threatens to both erase a culture and to sow anger and division among black and white people who still, in myriad ways, rely on and need one another.
But Bloemfontein, where I walked soon after I arrived in South Africa, contains a clue to how this cultural renegotiation might be managed. At the University of the Free State, there's a dormitory called Karee, named for a South African desert tree. In the late 2000s, the dormitory's student council began a project to debate and reconsider every element of the dormitory culture, from the pictures on the wall to the way festive days were handled to the tea ceremony each afternoon.
Before this project began, people thought it would be joyless. And for some students, it was. But for others, including some who didn't expect to enjoy it, it was thrilling. These were the ones, both black and white, who brought an attitude of curiosity to the endeavor -- about themselves and about the other people who inhabited their dormitory. It was listening that made the difference. Why is this painting important to me? Why is that ritual valuable to you? What roots and dreams do we share?

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- United States consumers showed some muscle in November at the start of the holiday shopping season, suggesting enough momentum in the economy for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next week for the first time in nearly a decade.
The outlook for consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, received a lift from other data on Friday showing consumer sentiment nudged up in early December.
"It dismisses any concerns of a potential slump in household spending after some weakness in the last few months. Not that there is much doubt any more, but this supports the case for a rate hike by the Fed next week," said Steve Murphy, United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services increased 0.6 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in October, the Commerce Department said. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Overall retail sales, however, gained only 0.2 percent as automobile sales fell and cheaper gasoline weighed on receipts at service stations. Retail sales rose 0.1 percent in October.
Consumer spending slowed in September and October, despite a tightening labor market, which is lifting household income.
Better income prospects are helping to prop up consumer sentiment. In a separate report, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 91.8 early this month from a reading of 91.3 in November.
Consumers' attitudes toward purchases of major household items were the strongest since 2005, though they were less enthusiastic about buying automobiles than in November.
"That speaks well of the current consumer mind-set and bodes well for stronger consumer spending in the coming quarters," said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich.
The increase last month in discretionary spending suggested a fairly busy start to the holiday shopping season. It supports expectations that the Fed will raise its benchmark overnight interest rate from near zero when policy makers conclude a two-day meeting next Wednesday, despite weak inflation. The central bank has not raised rates since June 2006.
Financial markets were little moved by the data as investors kept a wary eye on crude oil prices, which hit a seven-year low. Stocks were trading lower, while prices for government debt rose. The dollar was lower against a basket of currencies.
In another report, the Commerce Department said retail inventories excluding autos increased 0.4 percent in October, suggesting inventories could be less of a drag on fourth-quarter growth than previously thought. That, however, implies inventories could weigh on output in early 2016.
The strong gain in core retail sales last month and October's rise in retail inventories excluding autos prompted economists to raise their fourth-quarter growth estimates by as much as three-tenths of a percentage point to as high as a 2.1 percent annual rate.
The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the third quarter. However, a report on Thursday showed less spending on services and software than had been assumed, suggesting the third-quarter G.D.P. growth estimate could be lowered when the government publishes its second revision later this month.
In a fourth report, the Labor Department said its producer price index advanced 0.3 percent last month after falling 0.4 percent in October. But the index declined 1.1 percent in the 12 months through November after sliding 1.6 percent in October.
November marked the 10th consecutive 12-month decrease in the index. Dollar strength and continued declines in oil prices amid a glut and slowing global growth have eased price pressures, leaving inflation running persistently below the Fed's 2 percent target.
"We maintain our conviction that dollar appreciation will weigh on the prices of core goods through the middle of next year," said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays in New York.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- China's central bank said Friday night that it would start tracking the value of the country's currency against a basket of many other currencies and not just the dollar. The move is likely to reignite speculation about the possibility of another devaluation by Beijing and could fan trade tensions.
The People's Bank of China posted a commentary on its website saying it would calculate and release the value of the renminbi based on a basket of foreign currencies, after many years of relying overwhelmingly on calculations based on the renminbi's value in dollars.
The Chinese central bank did not say when it might make such a move, which could rock global financial markets.
The last change in the central bank's method for determining the renminbi's exchange rate occurred in August and accompanied an immediate 2 percent devaluation. That was followed by a further slide in the renminbi in the next couple of days of trading, before the Chinese central bank intervened heavily to keep the currency from tumbling further.
With the American economy expanding while Europe, Japan and many emerging markets languish, the dollar has rallied strongly for the last couple of years, and many economists expect that to continue. Basing the renminbi's value on a group of currencies would cause it to fall against the dollar if the dollar's strength persisted in the coming months.
"Managing the renminbi's value relative to a basket of currencies rather than just the U.S. dollar would allow China to make a smoother transition to a more market-determined exchange rate," said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist who used to be the head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. "One consequence of such a shift, given the prospects of further dollar strength in the coming months, would be a further depreciation of the renminbi relative to the dollar."
Mr. Prasad added that "this would certainly be helpful for the Chinese economy, although at best marginally, at a time of slowing growth and weak exports."
The possibility of further devaluation of the renminbi also complicates the Federal Reserve's decision next week on whether to begin raising short-term interest rates. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, and other top Fed officials strongly hinted last week that they would start pushing rates higher, anticipating that the general price level in the United States would start rising if they left rates near zero.
But a weaker renminbi relative to the dollar would make Chinese goods even cheaper in the United States, helping to forestall inflation. Prices in the United States for imported goods have fallen nearly 10 percent in the last year, although partly because of falling commodity prices.
The People's Bank, China's central bank, clearly pegged the renminbi to the dollar until July 2005. It then allowed a one-time appreciation in the renminbi and said it was starting to peg the renminbi to a basket of currencies. But many statistical analyses by Western economists have shown that the People's Bank essentially adopted a program of very gradual appreciation to the dollar, with the renminbi showing little correlation with other currencies.
As the dollar has strengthened, and as wages in China have risen by double-digit annual percentages, China has found its export competitiveness beginning to weaken. The People's Bank said in its statement on Friday evening that the renminbi appreciated 2.9 percent against the central bank's new index during the first 11 months of this year, even as the renminbi weakened slightly against the dollar.
As a result, the central bank said, the renminbi "is still a strong currency."
The International Monetary Fund last week added the renminbi to the fund's special drawing rights, essentially anointing it as one of the world's leading reserve currencies alongside the dollar, euro, yen and British pound. China had intervened heavily to preserve the value of the renminbi through its many months of campaigning for accession to the special drawing rights, and the I.M.F.'s decision may have reduced the need for Beijing to continue intervening.
China has the world's largest overall trade surplus and consistently runs extremely large trade surpluses with the United States, exporting $4 worth of goods to the United States for every $1 of American goods that it imports. The Commerce Department released trade data last week showing that the American trade deficit in goods rose to $306 billion in the first 10 months of this year, compared with $282.9 billion during the same period last year.
That was roughly half the overall American trade deficit in goods. American banks and other service providers have been asking Beijing for greater regulatory permission to do business in mainland China, which could someday begin to narrow the deficit.
China needs to run very large trade surpluses because it has considerable overcapacity in many industrial sectors, and domestic consumption has been growing but not fast enough. Investment in China has been weak.
Many Chinese families and companies have also been moving huge sums of money overseas, often to invest in real estate. This has tended to weaken the renminbi and has made China more dependent on large trade surpluses to bring in foreign currency and balance the outflow of investment.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. CARACAS, Venezuela -- Now comes the hard part. The political opposition here rode discontent over a failing economy to an overwhelming majority in legislative elections on Sunday, but after years of sniping from the sidelines, members have to get down to the difficult task of delivering on promises to fix the country's many ills.
The opposition, under the banner of the Democratic Unity coalition, won 112 of the 167 seats in the National Assembly, which will be sworn in Jan. 5, according to electoral authorities. The government's United Socialist Party will now have 55 seats.
The victory broke the United Socialist Party's absolute hold on government institutions and it represents the first time since its founder, the leftist Hugo Chávez, first took office as president in 1999 that the opposition has taken control of the legislature.
It also sets up a power struggle between the Assembly and President Nicolás Maduro, Mr. Chávez's disciple and successor.
The newly elected legislators say that their first act will be to pass an amnesty law freeing political prisoners, including Leopoldo López, the leader of the Popular Will party, who was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison for his role in leading antigovernment protests last year. His trial was widely criticized over a lack of due process, and one of the lead prosecutors later fled the country, accusing the government of using trumped-up evidence to convict Mr. López.
Next, the lawmakers say, they will confront the country's deep economic problems, including triple-digit inflation, a two-year recession and chronic shortages of basic goods.
"The biggest problem is the economy," said Henrique Capriles, a state governor and the leader of the Justice First party, which won more than 30 Assembly seats, more than any other party in the opposition coalition. He called Venezuela's economic plight the worst crisis in its history, and said that now that voters have expressed their desire for change, they expect results.
"Everything should be aimed at finding a solution to the crisis and toward actions that allow Venezuela to recover economically," he said.
The problem is that the principal economic levers remain in the hands of the president, and there are only limited steps the legislature can take on its own.
José Guerra, a former central bank economist who won election in a formerly pro-government part of Caracas, said that he envisioned laws to create incentives for economic production, to give pensions to older Venezuelans who are not included in the current pension system, and to recover money stolen through corruption.
Yet some essential steps, like repairing a crippled, three-tier exchange rate system, require cooperation with the executive branch. Others, including raising the price of gasoline and eliminating or loosening price controls, may be too politically sensitive for the Assembly to want to take on by itself.
"The Assembly doesn't set economic policy," said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Think about the basic things that have to be done in Venezuela, they're related to the need to carry out a macroeconomic stabilization, and that's done by the government, by the Finance Ministry that controls the government budget and by the central bank that controls exchange rate and monetary policy. These are really executive decisions."
There are however, ways that the Assembly could pressure Mr. Maduro to shift course economically. It can remove cabinet ministers, like the finance minister, and it can vote to remove the directors of the central bank.
An alternative would be for the Assembly and Mr. Maduro to find a way to work together, particularly on economic policy, perhaps even with the president appointing some opposition members to his cabinet.
So far, Mr. Maduro has given no indication that he is open to that approach. He quickly accepted the opposition victory after results were released early Monday morning, but he also blamed what he called an economic war for his party's defeat, a war that he said was being waged against his government and the country by shadowy capitalist forces.
The ability of the two sides to cooperate may also have a lot to do with how the current, socialist-dominated Assembly carries out the transition over the next three weeks.
Many expect that it will move to appoint a group of new Supreme Court justices to replace several whose terms expire next year and maintain the governing party's influence over the courts. It could also pass a law giving Mr. Maduro broad powers to create laws by decree.
There are many risks a period of divided government brings. The first is that the Assembly and Mr. Maduro could become caught in a lengthy battle that plunges the country into a constitutional crisis.
In contrast to the system in the United States, bills passed by the Assembly become law even if they are not signed by the president. But the Supreme Court, which for years has backed the leftist government, could reject laws as unconstitutional.
Most in the opposition say their goal is ultimately to remove Mr. Maduro from office, making way for new elections. But there is disagreement over how to go about it.
Henry Ramos, a leader of the Democratic Unity coalition who was elected to the Assembly on Sunday, predicted that the elections had begun a transition period that would end with Mr. Maduro's early exit well before his term ends in 2019.
"The elections have left the government very weak, and with the internal problems and the economic crisis I don't see it reaching the end of its normal term," Mr. Ramos said on election night.
Opponents say that they will act within the bounds of the Constitution and that Mr. Maduro could be hastened out the door through a recall election, a constitutional amendment that cuts his term short or a more complete constitutional overhaul. Or he could be somehow forced to resign.
But some analysts say that the opposition has a problem that may upset those plans.
If opposition leaders cooperate with Mr. Maduro and are successful, the public's anger over inflation and shortages could ease. "If Maduro fixes the economy he might win the recall referendum," Mr. Rodríguez said.
Some in the opposition, most notably Mr. Capriles, have argued that any discussion of removing Mr. Maduro should come only after the country's economic problems have been addressed.
"People are not asking you to get rid of Maduro or to change the government, and they're not desperate for a recall referendum," said Luis Vicente León, a pollster, speaking in a television interview on Tuesday. "People today want them to sit down and see how they can solve the problem that there aren't any eggs or there isn't sugar or car parts or, even worse, medicine."
Correction: January 9, 2016, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 9 about challenges awaiting the political opposition in Venezuela, which rode discontent over a failing economy to an overwhelming majority in legislative elections, referred incorrectly to Henry Ramos, a leader of the opposition Democratic Unity coalition. He was elected -- not re-elected -- to the National Assembly.

Full text:   Many Fed watchers have warned about the upsetting effect Ben S. Bernanke's aggressive central bank actions have had on emerging markets around the globe.
But when the recently retired chairman of the Federal Reserve came to the International Monetary Fund last month to deliver a vigorous defense of how his bond-buying spree played out abroad, Mr. Bernanke directed his remarks not at prominent critics in Brazil and India but at a 45-year-old French economist living in London.
Hélène Rey, a professor at the London Business School, contends that the impact of Fed policies on global markets has become so potent that emerging markets have become largely powerless in terms of coping with the large investment flows that pour into and out of their economies.
Mr. Bernanke's speech largely focused on his own legacy, but the issue of how mindful the Fed should be regarding the effect that rate changes have on other countries has become critically important.
This fall, Fed governors surprised many by deciding not to raise rates; one of the factors cited was the impact that China's currency devaluation would have on already fragile emerging markets. Many economists have been warning that a rate increase combined with uncertain exchange rates in China and other countries would weaken global growth.
Now, with all indications pointing to a rate increase this month -- the first in more than nine years -- the fear remains that emerging markets will get hit by another round of capital volatility and currency devaluations as investors exit risky assets in favor of higher yielding prospects in the United States.
All of which makes Ms. Rey's research particularly relevant, not least her recommendation that policy makers in the United States and abroad put in place regulations that reduce the intensity and speculative fervor of these flows. That could mean capital controls in emerging markets or new rules for investment funds that would punish short-term trading by investors.
"Hélène has pushed the notion that there is a global financial cycle and that countries are exposed to it independently from the exchange rate regime they use," Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the I.M.F., said in an introduction to a lecture Ms. Rey gave at the fund in 2014. "And she has suggested that the only way to deal with it is through capital controls. This is quite a different position and likely to be quite influential."
In a widely discussed paper that she presented two years ago at a central bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Ms. Rey described what she called a global financial cycle whereby financial firms, often using borrowed money, swoop into Malaysian, Brazilian and Turkish markets when rates in the United States are low and swoop out when rates rise -- frequently leaving wreckage in their wake.
Ms. Rey is not the first economist to propose that volatile capital flows, especially those that cause real estate bubbles, may be harmful for countries that absorb them.
Hyun Song Shin, a former Princeton professor who is the head of research at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, has been talking for a number of years about how Fed policies have spurred speculative investment flows globally.
But by highlighting how new exchange rate policies intended to help countries handle these money streams have not worked, Ms. Rey's research offers a provocative new twist.
In previous emerging market crises, most countries got into trouble because their exchange rates were tied to the dollar, making them vulnerable to the ups and downs of interest rate policies in the United States.
To better insulate themselves from these external policy shocks, the I.M.F. and most economists advised these countries to let their exchange rates float freely, which most have done.
What Ms. Rey found, however, was that countries like Brazil, Turkey and South Africa were just as exposed to the whipsaw effect of rate-driven capital flows with flexible rates as they were when currencies were pegged to the dollar.
This conclusion suggests that what ails countries like Turkey and Brazil is less their troubled economies (high inflation and lots of debt) and more the volatile investment flows coming into their countries.
And it questioned what has long been seen as a core principle for emerging economies: that the free flow of capital into and out of these markets is a force for good that should be encouraged.
"There is no doubt that Hélène's work carries with it important policy implications," said Mr. Shin, the economist at the Bank for International Settlements, whose work on global capital flows Ms. Rey has drawn upon.
Ms. Rey's paper, delivered in the summer of 2013, could not have been better timed. Just months earlier, global markets had been roiled by the so-called taper tantrum when global investors pulled billions of dollars out of emerging economies based on the news that the Fed would taper its bond purchasing program.
Suddenly, she was very much in demand -- fielding calls from central bankers, policy makers and global investors alike, all of whom were searching for a framework to help them analyze this sudden bout of market volatility.
"It has been a nice surprise -- life has definitely gotten busier," Ms. Rey said in a telephone interview from Santiago, Chile, where she was talking to the central bank there about how best to respond to capital flows. "This is an important debate. We have to decide which flows are beneficial and which are speculative."
Her ascent has been rapid. A gift for crunching numbers lifted her from the small town of Brioude in central France to a Grande École in Paris, a scholarship at Stanford University and a doctorate from the London School of Economics.
In 2000, she was recruited to Princeton University by none other than Mr. Bernanke, who was the chairman of the university's economics department at the time.
She is married to Richard Portes, a prominent economist also at the London Business School.
Ms. Rey has been the co-author of several papers of note, but it has been her work on capital flows that has drawn attention. In 2014, she was asked to deliver the Mundell-Fleming lecture at the I.M.F., one of the most prestigious invitations available to an internationally minded economist.
Indeed, it would be from this very platform that Mr. Bernanke would offer up his deconstruction of Ms. Rey's thesis one year later.
To be sure, he took care to laud the quality of her work, but there was also a hint of defensiveness in his remarks. After all, Mr. Bernanke was the one holding the monetary reins during this period and he questioned whether Ms. Rey's definition of a swarm of investors chasing risky assets when rates in the United States are low might not be overly simplistic.
And wasn't it also true that those experiencing the most turbulent capital flows -- Turkey, Brazil and South Africa, for example -- were already on edge as a result of their own economic problems?
"These were countries that were vulnerable," Mr. Bernanke said in his speech. "Their policies made them riskier."
Unlike many rising economists, Ms. Rey has a humble air about her, and she takes pains to say that her research is not meant to be critical of Mr. Bernanke's time at the Fed.
But she stands firmly by her claim that the Fed's propensity to spur speculative -- and at times damaging -- investment flows remains underappreciated and that more aggressive steps need to be taken to mitigate them.
"I think Ben has a very good point, even if we do recognize a global financial cycle, how do we know it is excessive," she said. "Still, my evidence points to additional risk-taking -- not only in emerging markets but Europe as well."

Abstract: Leaders of the Democratic Unity coalition, as the agglomeration of disparate parties is known, said its candidates had won at least 112 seats in the 167-member National Assembly that will be sworn in Jan. 5, giving it a two-thirds majority needed to call a constitutional convention, remove Supreme Court justices or carry out other important measures that could exert enormous pressure on the leftist government of President Nicolás Maduro.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- There were ear-to-ear smiles and a heady buzz in the hotel meeting room as the opposition leaders gathered here on Monday to discuss their stunning election victory. They had finally handed the government a major setback and they planned to announce that they had not only won a majority, but also a landslide of two-thirds of the seats in the legislature.
But as reporters waited for the event to start, a curious image flickered on a television mounted on the wall: one of the opposition's most prominent members, its two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, was holding a separate news conference across town.
It was an early and telling indication of the challenges facing Venezuela's long-fractured opposition, which has struggled for years to overcome its divisions. While the fragile coalition managed to come together to achieve victory over the Chavista government on Sunday, it now faces the test of trying to stick together and use its newly won congressional authority to address the country's deep economic problems and political rifts.
Leaders of the Democratic Unity coalition, as the agglomeration of disparate parties is known, said its candidates had won at least 112 seats in the 167-member National Assembly that will be sworn in Jan. 5, giving it a two-thirds majority needed to call a constitutional convention, remove Supreme Court justices or carry out other important measures that could exert enormous pressure on the leftist government of President Nicolás Maduro.
The officials said that Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party had received at least 51 seats and that the winners in four races had not yet been determined.
Even with a smaller majority, the opposition legislators can remove the vice president, cabinet members and the directors of the Central Bank, and press ahead with investigations of corruption.
Enrique Márquez, an opposition legislator who won re-election, accused the government of deliberately withholding some election results Sunday night to hide the depth of its loss.
Chavismo, as the movement started by Mr. Maduro's charismatic predecessor, President Hugo Chávez, is known, was wiped out in some of its traditional strongholds. The opposition said that it won both congressional districts in Barinas, Mr. Chávez's home state, where one of the government candidates was a brother of the former president, Argenis Chávez.
"The victory was overwhelming," Mr. Márquez said.
The anti-Chavista forces also won all the districts in Caracas, the capital, including areas that were once fervent government bastions. Mr. Maduro had dispatched many of the government's best known officials to run for office around the country and in many cases those candidates lost.
In some states, the opposition got more than double the vote of the government party, opposition officials said.
The election was dominated by widespread weariness with the Maduro government and a growing economic crisis that has people shouldering the burden of triple-digit inflation, product shortages and long lines at stores with empty shelves.
While there are many different parties and leaders in the opposition, they generally agree on basic economic principles like the promotion of private enterprise and foreign investment.
"At least compared to Chavismo and Maduro they have very similar views on how to run the country and in that sense I don't think the differences between them are huge," said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who predicted last April that the opposition could win a two-thirds majority. "But I do think there is no single, consolidated leadership and therefore these differences are going to arise and are going to continue to be prominent. And obviously, also when there's a victory like this one, different political leaders will try to take advantage of it and to claim credit for it, and that's normal."
Colette Capriles, a political scientist, said that opposition leaders like Mr. Capriles were keenly aware that if Mr. Maduro was forced out in the coming months -- a goal voiced by many in the opposition -- there would probably be a new election to succeed him. Several of those leaders consider themselves contenders. "These are all chess moves," said Ms. Capriles, a distant relative of Mr. Capriles's. She said that she was surprised to see Mr. Capriles hold a solo news conference. "It's like they are saying, 'Here I am, I'm still politically important. I'm going to continue to cultivate my own political space.' "
The most telling split in the opposition is between a radical wing, led most prominently by Leopoldo López, a former mayor, and a more moderate wing, led primarily by Mr. Capriles.
Mr. López last year led a campaign of street protests to push for Mr. Maduro's ouster, a strategy that Mr. Capriles resisted. The protests often turned violent or were met with aggressive actions by security forces to put them down. Mr. López was recently sentenced to more than 13 years in prison for his role in leading those protests, although his conviction was criticized internationally for the lack of due process.
But Mr. Capriles and Mr. López have long been rivals within the opposition movement, and Mr. López's leadership of the more aggressive anti-government strategy only highlighted the rift between them.
One of the star attendees at the coalition news conference that Mr. Capriles skipped on Monday was Mr. López's wife, Lilian Tintori, who has campaigned around the world for him to be released from prison.
"It's not important," Mr. Capriles, a state governor, said in a telephone interview, adding that it was normal for him to hold a news conference after an election. "They had their press conference and I had mine. There is no competition here."
Yet he also said he wanted to make it clear that his more moderate approach had been vindicated.
"It wasn't just Venezuela that won yesterday," he said. "A policy won and that policy was ours."
And he acknowledged that there was a fundamental division within the opposition over how to proceed. He said that it was urgent to focus first on economic issues.
But many opposition leaders talked forcefully after the landslide victory of moving quickly to seek Mr. Maduro's removal from office -- perhaps through a recall election, changes to the Constitution or by forcing him to resign.
"Given the seriousness of the crisis obviously we have to stay united," Mr. Capriles said. But he added that the group's unity had been affected in the past by "individual projects, by egos, and a misunderstanding of the reality that people were living."
Freddy Guevara, a senior member of the Popular Will party led by Mr. López, who was at the coalition news conference, said that he was not troubled by Mr. Capriles holding his own session with the media, saying that it was his right as a leader and a state governor.
In the wake of the election it was not just the opposition that was thinking about potential strains on its unity.
Chavismo has been riven by increasingly deep divisions since the death of Mr. Chávez in 2013 and those will only be exacerbated by the election debacle. In the coming months, many analysts believe, there could well be pressure within Chavismo to cut a deal with the opposition, possibly putting pressure on Mr. Maduro to step down, which would trigger new elections. The knives were already out for the president on Monday. A popular Chavista blog featured a column calling for his resignation and that of the National Assembly leader, Diosdado Cabello.
The writer, Javier Antonio Vivas, said that the people had sent Mr. Maduro a message that his administration was "dreadful, sectarian, corrupt and vulgar." He accused the politicians of murdering Mr. Chávez's revolution and said that if they did not quit, the people would kick them out "before Chávez is erased from the historical, political and social thinking" of Venezuelans.

Full text:   According to the economist Kevin O'Rourke, who has been doing a running comparison between the Great Depression that began in 1929 and the Great Recession that began almost eight years ago, the world has just passed a sad landmark. While the initial slump this time around wasn't nearly as bad as the collapse from 1929 to 1933, the recovery has been much weaker -- and at this point world industrial production is doing worse than it did at the same point in the 1930s. A remarkable achievement!
But the bad news is unevenly distributed. In particular, Europe has done very badly, while America has done relatively well. True, U.S. performance looks good only if you grade on a curve. Still, unemployment has been cut in half, and the Federal Reserve is getting ready to raise interest rates at a time when its counterpart, the European Central Bank, is still desperately seeking ways to boost spending.
Now, I believe that the Fed is making a mistake. But the fact that hiking rates is even halfway defensible is a sign that the U.S. economy isn't doing too badly. So what did we do right?
The answer, basically, is that the Fed and the White House have mostly worried about the right things. (Congress, not so much.) Their actions fell far short of what should have been done; unemployment should have come down much faster than it did. But at least they avoided taking destructive steps to fight phantoms.
Start with the Fed. In his recent book "The Courage to Act," Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, celebrates his institution's willingness to step in and rescue the financial system, which was indeed the right thing to do. But everyone did that.
The real profile in courage was the Fed's behavior in 2010-11, when it stood fast in the face of demands that it tighten policy despite high unemployment. The pressure was intense, with leading Republicans including Paul Ryan, now the speaker of the House, accusing Mr. Bernanke of "debasing" the dollar and suggesting that he was corruptly aiding President Obama. Hard-money advocates seized on a rise in headline consumer prices, claiming that it was a harbinger of high inflation to come.
But the Fed stuck to its, um, printing presses, arguing that the rise in inflation was a one-time blip driven mainly by oil prices -- and it was proved right.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the European Central Bank gave in to inflation panic, raising interest rates twice in 2011 -- and in so doing helped push the euro area into a double-dip recession.
What about the White House? Some of us warned from the beginning that the 2009 stimulus was too small and would fade out too fast, a warning vindicated by events. But it was much better than nothing, and was enacted over scorched-earth opposition from Republicans claiming that it would cause soaring interest rates and a fiscal crisis. Again, this is in strong contrast to Europe, which never did much stimulus and turned quickly to savage austerity in debtor nations.
Unfortunately, the U.S. ended up doing a fair bit of austerity too, partly driven by conservative state governments, partly imposed by Republicans in Congress via blackmail over the federal debt ceiling. But the Obama administration at least tried to limit the damage.
The result of these not-so-bad policies is today's not-so-bad economy. It's not a great economy, by any measure: Unemployment is low, but that has a lot to do with a decline in the fraction of the population looking for work, and the weakness of wages ensures that it doesn't feel like prosperity. Still, things could be worse.
And they may indeed get worse, which is why the Fed's likely rate hike will be a mistake.
Fed officials believe that the solid job growth of the past couple of years -- which happened, by the way, as Obamacare, which conservatives assured us would be a job killer, went into full effect -- will continue even if rates go up. I'm among those who believe that America is facing growing drag from the weakness of other economies, especially because a rising dollar is making U.S. manufacturing less competitive. But those officials could be right, in which case waiting to raise rates could mean some acceleration of inflation.
On the other hand, they could be wrong, in which case a rate hike could end the run of good economic news. And this would be much more serious than a modest uptick in inflation, because it's not at all clear what the Fed could do to fix its mistake.
I'm not sure why this argument, which a number of economists are making, isn't getting much traction at the Fed. I suspect, however, that officials have been worn down by incessant criticism of their policies, and want to throw the critics a bone.
But those critics have been wrong every step of the way. Why start taking them seriously now?

Full text:   To the Editor:
"Thai Economy Is Sagging, and So Are Thai Spirits" (Memo From Thailand, Nov. 30) did not include facts that contradict this critical portrayal of Thailand's economy.
The fundamentals of the Thai economy are still strong. The Fitch Ratings last month said the Thai economy "has shown resilience." The country's foreign reserves are $157 billion, while short-term foreign debt is only $55 billion and the public debt to gross domestic product ratio is 43 percent -- much lower than that of the United States, Britain and Japan. Inflation is negligible and the unemployment rate is 0.9 percent -- much lower than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average.
The Thai economy is fast recovering with a steady growth trajectory despite a weak global environment. Consumer and industrial confidence indexes are picking up, thanks to the stimulus measures by the government. The growth rate for the third quarter this year is 2.9 percent, a significant improvement from 0.9 percent in the third quarter of 2014. Various international and domestic agencies have forecast 3 to 4 percent growth in 2016.
Major reforms are underway to rebalance the Thai economy to make it more competitive as the country moves toward more sustainable and inclusive growth. The American Chamber of Commerce in Thailand has voiced support for these reforms and maintained its confidence in Thailand as an attractive investment destination.

Abstract: First produced in 1899, Mr. Gillette's "Sherlock Holmes" toured the English-speaking world and was repeatedly revived. "Thunderball" (1965), based on Ian Fleming's eighth Bond novel, starring Sean Connery (and reissued by 20th Century Fox in a 50th anniversary Steelbook Blu-ray), was the fourth Bond movie and, adjusted for inflation, most likely the series' greatest international success.

Full text:   Created by Arthur Conan Doyle, the detective Sherlock Holmes belongs to us all. As noted by the historian Michael Saler in "As If," his account of literary imaginary worlds, the great detective was modern fiction's "first virtual reality character" -- given that part of his readership chose to believe that he was an actual person. The 1916 movie "Sherlock Holmes" (newly restored and released by Flicker Alley in a dual Blu-ray/DVD edition) grounds that character's virtual reality in a corporeal presence, namely that of the tall, craggy American actor William Gillette (1853-1937).
Mr. Gillette, the son of a United States senator from Connecticut, was Holmes's contemporary. It was during the hiatus between the fictional character's apparent demise in a struggle with Professor Moriarty and his return to life by popular demand that Mr. Gillette got the opportunity to take the title role in a revision of Conan Doyle's unproduced Holmes play.
First produced in 1899, Mr. Gillette's "Sherlock Holmes" toured the English-speaking world and was repeatedly revived. Although he played Holmes as an American, Gillette was totally identified with his part. Only the illustrator Sidney Paget did more to create Holmes's distinctive accessories, the deerstalker, the cape coat and the curved pipe. Mr. Gillette was even credited with improving the detective's demeanor: An anonymous New York Times theater critic noted in 1915 that "the skillful, gracious, gentle, winning Mr. Gillette has added a charm that was beyond the author's somewhat limited power to bestow."
In 1916, Mr. Gillette played Holmes in a feature-length movie produced by the Essanay Company in Chicago. The film was long assumed to be lost, but, because it had been released in France in 1919 as a four-part serial, a nearly intact version, mislabeled for decades, was discovered in the French Cinémathèque in 2014. Perhaps no film could live up to the drama of this back story, but the impeccable restoration -- the sole record of Mr. Gillette's characterization -- comes close.
Hewing closely to the play, "Sherlock Holmes" draws on several stories, mainly "A Scandal in Bohemia." Dr. Watson is minimized, but Holmes enjoys a romance with the Irene Adler figure, Alice Faulkner (a 17-year-old Marjorie Kay, later a World War I poster girl for the Red Cross). Holmes has been hired to recover some incriminating letters written to Alice's late sister. A criminal couple also covet them; to further their cause, they recruit Holmes's archenemy, Moriarty (Ernest Maupain). Drawing-room intrigue gives way to more gangsterly stuff, but Holmes is regularly shown in his study, hoisting a test tube.
Despite a few bleak Chicago locations, "Sherlock Holmes" is unavoidably theatrical. Still, the stage director Arthur Berthelet, making his first feature, keeps the acting restrained and the action fluid. No threat to D. W. Griffith, Mr. Berthelet nevertheless demonstrates better film chops than, for example, Frank Powell, who directed Theda Bara in the star-making sensation of 1915, "A Fool There Was."
"Sherlock Holmes" was likely a good investment for Essanay, then absorbing the loss of its greatest attraction, Charlie Chaplin, to greener pastures. It's a historical footnote that the teenage Chaplin once played opposite Mr. Gillette in a London revival of "Sherlock Holmes." In another coincidence, Flicker Alley has recently released a boxed set, with Blu-ray and DVD, of the two-reel comedies Chaplin made for Essanay in 1915.
It was with these 15 remastered films that Chaplin conquered the world. "Work" is still notable in its anarchic assault on middle-class propriety, and "The Bank" is the movie in which Chaplin perfected his persona. If, as Mr. Saler writes, Holmes was "one of the first characters to become ubiquitous through the new mass media," another, no less universal, was Chaplin's Little Tramp.
'Thunderball'
Although not quite Holmes or Chaplin, James Bond is one more seemingly indestructible mass-media titan.
"Thunderball" (1965), based on Ian Fleming's eighth Bond novel, starring Sean Connery (and reissued by 20th Century Fox in a 50th anniversary Steelbook Blu-ray), was the fourth Bond movie and, adjusted for inflation, most likely the series' greatest international success. Released for Christmas, it marked the apex of Bondmania, with Agent 007's license to kill more than equaled by United Artists' license to license 007 paraphernalia.
Publicity promised "the Biggest Bond of All!" Directed, like "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love," by Terence Young, "Thunderball" was the most capacious Bond adventure to date; it was filmed in Panavision, ran over two hours and was markedly less taut than its predecessors. Insouciance rules: From 007's opening-scene jet-pack escape to a late exercise in color-coordinated underwater hand-to-hand combat, the movie ambles from impromptu boudoir to exotic battlefield against a backbeat of world-historical crisis as two NATO nuclear weapons are hijacked by the terrorist cabal Spectre.
With the nukes stashed in Spectre's Caribbean retreat, "Thunderball" wends its way to the Bahamas. Nassau (where the Beatles had just completed shooting scenes for "Help!") is conceived as a giant Club Med. The hairy-chested Mr. Connery spends half of his time in cabana wear or skin-diving gear. The villain (Adolfo Celi) keeps a swimming pool stocked with hungry predators, contributing to the sense that "Thunderball" may have been the most shark-obsessed blockbuster before "Jaws."
The real shark, of course, is 007, a sleek, highly functional and remorseless killer, who was often seen as the embodiment of Cold War moral relativism. The international tensions were such that by 1965 "Thunderball" was taken as a comedy. (The Times critic Bosley Crowther compared it to Mack Sennett slapstick.)
Bond circa 1965 was also -- as argued by Alexis Albion in the essay "Wanting to Be James Bond" (part of the collection "Ian Fleming & James Bond: The Cultural Politics of 007") -- an ego-ideal for both men and women throughout the Western world and thus something of a virtual reality character as well.
Newly Released
BRITISH NOIR The five titles in this set of British thrillers from the 1940s and 1950s, produced by the Rank Organization, are largely unknown here and extremely entertaining -- none more so than "The Golden Salamander" (1950) which, directed by Ronald Neame on location in Tunisia, stars Trevor Howard as a two-fisted archaeologist and a very young, very beautiful Anouk Aimée as a damsel in distress. (Kino Classics)
FIVE FILMS BY PATRICIO GUZMÁN The dean of Latin American political filmmakers, Mr. Guzmán has also been the custodian of Chile's historical memory. This sturdy eight-DVD box includes "The Battle of Chile," his three-part chronicle of the military coup that brought down President Salvador Allende, and his more recent poetic essay "Nostalgia for the Light," as well as three other documentaries and five short films. (Icarus Films)
FORBIDDEN HOLLYWOOD VOLUME 9 For anyone, like me, who regards the early, pre-Production Code 1930s as Hollywood's most fertile period, this series has been a reliable source of pleasure. The latest, with five films on four DVDs, is among the best -- notable not only for the Broadway pizazz of "Big City Blues" (1932) but also two examples of Depression-era muckraking, the chain-gang drama "Hell's Highway" and the sharecropper melodrama "The Cabin in the Cotton," both released in 1932. (Warner Archive)
THE RANDOLPH SCOTT ROUND-UP This set has five of the seven classic westerns that Scott made with Budd Boetticher in the 1950s, plus "A Lawless Street" (1955), directed by the extremely credible B-movie auteur Joseph H. Lewis. The price is right, but the color transfers are only fair, and the six films are crammed on two DVDs, which in my experience proved a bit glitchy. (Mill Creek)
W. C. FIELDS COMEDY ESSENTIALS COLLECTION It's a gift, if a bit pricey. These 18 films, spread over five DVDs, include Fields's classic features like the hitherto scarce "Million Dollar Legs" (1932) and "The Bank Dick" (1940), as well as several noteworthy Paramount releases in which he's part of the ensemble, like "International House" and "Alice in Wonderland" (both 1933). No ancillary material apart from an appreciation by the 1960s comedy team Wayne & Shuster. (Universal)

Full text:   The dollar lost a bit of its exalted status last week and the Chinese renminbi gained some luster. That was the straightforward meaning of an announcement in Washington by the International Monetary Fund, which decided to admit the renminbi to an exclusive group of elite currencies.
But global markets told quite a different story: The renminbi remained no more than a promising but relatively inconsequential currency, while the euro weakened and the dollar remained at the center of world events, with effects that rippled through the world economy.
To make sense of these apparently conflicting pictures, first examine the I.M.F. decision on the renminbi. It was long awaited and, in some ways, portentous, signaling China's growing political clout, if not the ascendance of its currency.
The international organization decided that for the first time, the Chinese currency would join the dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound in a prestigious, if obscure, club: The big four currencies together form a global reserve asset known as the I.M.F.'s Special Drawing Rights (S.D.R.) basket. Next October, the renminbi will become the fifth member.
S.D.R.s aren't a currency, but they can be used as a claim on currencies in the basket, indirectly bolstering the role of the renminbi as a potential reserve currency. While this doesn't have much day-to-day significance right now, it certifies that China's currency, which could barely be traded on world markets only a few decades ago, has already come a long way. In order to qualify for inclusion, an S.D.R. member needs to be the currency of a major exporter, and the renminbi certainly is that.
The other main qualification is ticklish: A currency needs to be "freely usable." Using a strictly technical definition, the I.M.F. declared that the renminbi meets that test, even though its price doesn't move freely in currency markets and it isn't traded or held nearly as much as the other major currencies.
The I.M.F. acknowledged that "challenges" remained for the renminbi and stressed "the importance of continuing and deepening" the financial and economic reforms that have taken place in China. These reservations are substantial.
Nonetheless, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said quite correctly that the I.M.F. decision amounted to "landmark recognition" of China's growing economic power. In order to make room for the renminbi in its S.D.R. basket, the I.M.F. shrank the other four currencies, especially the euro. The dollar lost a little of its stature.
But if the renminbi's rise in status signaled the incipient decline of the dollar, you wouldn't have known it from the action in the foreign currency markets, or from any other major markets last week. The dollar did fall against the euro on Thursday, after the European Central Bank issued policy guidance that surprised some traders. But if anything, the almighty dollar, as Washington Irving once called the greenback, retained every bit of its global importance.
It was striking that on the very day of the I.M.F.'s announcement about the renminbi, the dollar actually rose to an 11-year high against major currencies, according to Bloomberg trade-weighted data. And on Wednesday, the value of the dollar reached new heights.
It was bolstered by comments from Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, suggesting that the Fed would soon raise short-term interest rates after holding them close to zero for nearly seven years. Ms. Yellen's testimony before Congress on Thursday added to that general conviction in the markets, though the dollar briefly gave up ground against the euro after the European Central Bank in Frankfurt loosened monetary policy less than had been expected.
Still, the market consensus remains that diverging policies in Europe and the United States will solidify a trend that has been underway for many months: The euro will weaken further and the dollar will grow ever stronger.
What's more, the rising dollar over the last year has already had profound effects. It has helped account for the drop in commodity values, which are commonly priced in dollars. The soaring greenback has also pummeled producers of coffee, cotton, copper, zinc, oil and gold, and it has punished many commodity-producing nations, like Brazil, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Canada.
At the same time, the dollar has helped put a lid on inflation in the United States, the Federal Reserve said last week in the periodic survey of American economic conditions known as the beige book. "The strong dollar put downward pressure on prices," the Fed said. It also concluded that the dollar had hurt the competitiveness of American exporters and contributed to weakening global economic demand.
And in earnings calls with financial analysts, a range of American companies reported that the dollar had created significant headwinds for their businesses, and was likely to do so in 2016. As Goldman Sachs reported in its most recent beige book -- a survey of corporate America that it periodically performs: "A strong U.S. dollar continued to weigh on earnings, particularly for companies with significant international exposure."
Those effects are widely expected to strengthen, not weaken, in the months ahead. The dollar remains the main currency in which the world does business. It accounted for more than 43 percent of foreign currency turnover in 2013, the most recent I.M.F. figure, compared with less than 17 percent for the euro, the second-most-widely-used currency. At 1.1 percent, the renminbi barely showed up on the radar.
Still, the renminbi is being traded frequently in Asia, the I.M.F. found, if not much in Europe or North America. And because China is already among the world's biggest exporters -- it is the biggest, by some measures -- it has leverage to shift commerce toward the renminbi rather than the dollar.
China has already demonstrated that a small shift in the value of the renminbi can have major effects on global markets. In August, it announced that it would allow the renminbi to float in a broader range -- a shift that helped China receive the benediction of the I.M.F. last week -- but when the currency briefly lurched downward, world currency, stock and commodities markets fell sharply.
In Beijing last week, Yi Gang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, said the bank intended to "keep the renminbi's exchange rate stable at a reasonable level," yet would also gradually allow the currency to move more freely. Those goals may prove to be difficult to achieve simultaneously. Having disrupted the markets only recently, China could do so again.
But China's rising status at the I.M.F. could have a calming effect. It will lead to a small rebalancing of global reserves at central banks, which are likely to begin to modestly increase their renminbi holdings. Eventually, the renminbi could become a haven in times of trouble, a place where investors seek security, not a currency from which people flee, as has recently been the case.
In order to achieve that transformation, the renminbi will have to become much more freely and dependably usable than it already is. It is becoming more important and will undoubtedly grow in stature. But the dollar remains at the fulcrum of world trade and global economics.

Full text:   After seven years of keeping United States interest rates at rock bottom, the Federal Reserve has signaled that Dec. 16 could be D-Day for a long-awaited increase. That was the message Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, conveyed in two public presentations last week.
With a 0.25 percent rise in the Fed's main tool for influencing interest rates a near certainty, investors are already beginning to focus on rate increases that may lie ahead. Will they be gradual, as Ms. Yellen has suggested? Or will economic developments push the Fed to be more aggressive?
Answering these questions requires a crystal ball, which no one has. But they are worth exploring, given the market dislocations that can occur when policy moves take investors by surprise.
Ms. Yellen alluded to this challenge both in her speech on Wednesday and in congressional testimony on Thursday. Waiting too long to raise rates, she said, could force the Fed to "tighten policy relatively abruptly" and risk "disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession."
A slow and gradual approach to rate increases is what the Fed has telegraphed and is very much what investors expect and desire. But this may not be what they get.
That's the view of Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Investors who think the Fed's rate increases will be modest and come over a prolonged period may be incorrectly assessing three elements of the economy, he contends. These errors could be fostering a more negative outlook about economic growth than is justified, reinforcing the view that rate increases will be few and far between.
The first mistake investors are making relates to their excessive fears about the slowdown in domestic manufacturing and the oil industry. While these downturns are genuine and painful -- and the spending drop in these arenas have been huge -- their negative impact over all is limited, Mr. Shepherdson said.
The entire manufacturing sector generates 12 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, but the oil sector and related manufacturing accounts for less than 5 percent.
Moreover, the beneficiaries of this collapse far outnumber its victims. "What's happened over the last 13 months is a giant transfer of resources from oil producers to consumers," Mr. Shepherdson said. "Consumers are much more important to the U.S. economy, and the very things that have hurt manufacturing and oil have given consumers a great boost."
The second assumption that investors may be wrong about involves inflation and their belief that a stronger dollar will keep it in check in the United States. Such a situation would help put a lid on rate increases.
A rising dollar certainly makes imported goods less expensive for American buyers. But only 15 percent of the core Consumer Price Index is dollar-sensitive, Mr. Shepherdson said.
Rents make up 41 percent of the index, for example, while 34 percent consists of services, including medical costs, leisure and education. Expenditures on some of these items -- especially rents and health care -- are rising faster than other prices.
Wage increases pose another wild card on inflation, Mr. Shepherdson said. Labor compensation has grown only modestly in recent years, Ms. Yellen pointed out in her speech, at annual rates of 2 to 2.5 percent. Now that may be changing.
"We have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of average hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business sector," she said.
If inflation heats up, it will represent a big shift. Core inflation is running at 1.25 percent for the 12 months that ended in October, the Fed said, well below its 2 percent inflation objective.
Friday's healthy jobs report -- 211,000 workers hired in November, more than forecast -- showed only a modest increase in compensation last month, but it suggested that rising wages may become even more of a factor as the job market continues to tighten. "If nominal wages accelerate, then the Fed's fervently held belief in gradual rate increases will come under pressure," Mr. Shepherdson said.
Finally, investors seem convinced that retail sales, a major economic bellwether, are in trouble. This may not be the case.
It's true that growth in nominal retail sales, those measured in current dollars, is declining. But, Mr. Shepherdson said, if you look at retail sales in real terms, which are not adjusted for price changes, the growth is impressive. In the latter part of 2014, such sales were registering a 4 percent gain. Today, it's trending at about 5.5 percent, suggesting that the American consumer is better off than many investors think.
If Mr. Shepherdson is right, that means that tens of millions of Americans will be seeing substantial improvement in their own financial well-being. That's worth celebrating, but it may unnerve many on Wall Street.
Each economic data release has the potential to roil the market if it appears to counter the prevailing view of a more modest recovery. Investors who play down healthy trends in the economy are likely to be caught offsides if the Fed becomes more proactive.
Right now, the market is forecasting only a 50-50 chance of a second rate increase by April. Mr. Shepherdson is predicting such a move in March, as unemployment continues to fall and wage gains pick up further.
By raising rates, the Fed clearly signals its belief that the economy has recovered from the devastation of 2008. That, too, is great news. But the policy shift will also require investors to make a fairly significant attitude adjustment, so don't be surprised if the ride gets bumpy.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told Congress on Thursday that she regarded domestic economic conditions as sufficiently strong to start raising the Fed's benchmark interest rate later this month.
Ms. Yellen, making her final public remarks before the Fed's policy-making committee meets Dec. 15 and 16, did nothing to diminish expectations that the Fed is about to end a seven-year stretch of near-zero rates.
She affirmed the Fed's inclination to press ahead even as the European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would cut rates and extend its stimulus. The Bank of Japan also continues to press for stronger growth.
The divergence among the world's major central banks is creating a significant drag on the American economy. The dollar has gained strength as investors seeking higher returns invest in the United States. That has reduced demand for American exports, weighing on manufacturing and other sectors.
But Ms. Yellen said increased spending by American consumers continued to drive a domestic economic expansion. While problems in the rest of the world may induce the Fed to raise rates more slowly, it is unlikely to wait.
"Domestic spending is on a solid course," Ms. Yellen told the Joint Economic Committee. "It's been growing around 3 percent. Over all, on balance that's led -- and I think it will continue to lead -- to growth that is somewhat above trend."
The Fed has held rates near zero since December 2008 as the main force of its measures to stimulate the economy. Low rates encourage lenders to take larger risks, and businesses and consumers to borrow more money. As the Fed begins to raise rates, those incentives will fade. The Fed's hope is that the economy is now strong enough to continue growing without quite so much help.
The Fed's march toward an increase still is drawing resistance from some Democrats and liberal groups. Inflation remains sluggish, the share of Americans with jobs remains lower than before the recession, and they argue there is little harm in pressing on.
Ms. Yellen, pressed by Democrats on Thursday about any lingering hesitations, said the Fed continued to look at new economic data, and would pay particular attention to the government's first estimate of November job growth.
But she added that the impact of any single economic report was limited, and that an accumulation of evidence suggested that the economy had gained strength.
"I think we've seen some welcome hints" of wage increases, Ms. Yellen said, although she cautioned, "it's tentative evidence; we don't know if it will last."
Her testimony repeated portions of a speech she gave on Wednesday, laying out in greater detail her reasons for economic optimism. Both closed on the same note, referring to raising rates as "a day that I expect we all are looking forward to."
Ms. Yellen said, however, that the Fed is likely to raise rates slowly once it started, in part because of the different paths of the world's major central banks.
"That difference in expectations about monetary policy has led to a substantial appreciation of the dollar," Ms. Yellen said. "A combination of weak foreign growth and a stronger dollar, both of those things have depressed export growth."
Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, asked whether raising rates would worsen that trend, causing the dollar to rise further. Ms. Yellen responded that investors already had priced in much of the divergence, but she declined to forecast where the dollar was headed.

Abstract: The European Central Bank announced a slight cut in one of its key interest rates in an attempt to stimulate lending and help a modest economic recovery.

Full text:   Global markets sank on Thursday after the European Central Bank announced stimulus plans that fell short of what investors had forecast. The bond market was especially roiled by the central bank's move, with bond prices in the United States and Europe falling sharply, and yields jumping.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 252.01 points, or 1.4 percent, to 17,477.67. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 29.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,049.62, and the Nasdaq composite fell 85.70 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,037.53. The selling pushed the S.&P. 500 back into the red for 2015.
The European Central Bank announced a slight cut in one of its key interest rates in an attempt to stimulate lending and help a modest economic recovery. Investors had expected the bank to step up its monthly purchases of bonds as well.
"Financial markets were expecting the E.C.B. to do 'whatever it takes' to stimulate inflation, and instead the E.C.B. did 'maybe what it'll take' to stimulate inflation," said Guy LeBas, head of fixed-income strategy at Janney Montgomery Scott.
Europe's economy has lagged that of the United States since the financial crisis, and policy makers have struggled to keep the 19 countries that use the euro from falling into deflation or an economic contraction. But the president of the bank, Mario Draghi, has been far more aggressive than his predecessors in trying new ways to push the economy, including its current program of negative interest rates and bond-buying. Expectations were high for this week's meeting.
After the announcement, European stocks had one of their worst days in months. Germany's DAX plunged 3.6 percent, its biggest drop since September. France's CAC-40 index lost 3.6 percent, and Britain's FTSE lost 2.3 percent.
European bond prices fell sharply, sending yields higher. If the central bank had announced more stimulus, it would have had the effect of putting downward pressure on interest rates. The yield on the 10-year German government bond gained 0.20 percentage point to 0.67 percent, a huge move in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year French government bond rose 0.20 percentage point to 0.99 percent, also a substantial move.
The sell-off in the dollar also hit American bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.32 percent, up sharply from 2.18 percent the day before.
Investors now turn back to the United States. While the European Central Bank is easing policy, the Federal Reserve looks set to raise interest rates this month for the first time in nine years. In comments Wednesday, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, gave an upbeat assessment of the economy's progress since the bank's last meeting in October, describing the economy's behavior as in line with the Fed's expectations for the labor market and inflation. She also was careful to point out the need to review coming data, including the November jobs report, coming Friday.
Economists forecast that employers created 200,000 jobs in November, and the jobless rate was steady at 5 percent.
In other markets, benchmark United States crude oil jumped $1.14, or 2.9 percent, to settle at $41.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to set prices for international oils, climbed $1.35, or 3.2 percent, to $43.84 a barrel in London.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has been regarded as a master of the dark art of managing market expectations.
But the reaction to stimulus measures the central bank announced on Thursday -- steps more timid than had been widely expected -- suggested that Mr. Draghi somehow miscommunicated with the traders, pundits and prognosticators who set the course of financial markets.
Around Europe, stock prices fell on Thursday after the central bank said it would extend its program of buying bonds and other assets by six months but would not raise the amount of monthly purchases. The central bank also changed a key interest rate to encourage banks to lend more, but did not cut key borrowing rates.
Based on recent statements by Mr. Draghi and other top officials at the European Central Bank, investors had thought there would be much, much more.
"He typically has underpromised and overdelivered," said Mujtaba Rahman, practice head for Europe at the consultancy firm Eurasia Group. "That is not the case this time around. What we've got is the bare minimum of what people were expecting."
It was either a rare case of Mr. Draghi failing to send clear enough signals, or a sign that his proposals had met unexpected resistance among the 25 members of European Central Bank's Governing Council, which met in Frankfurt on Thursday morning. At a news conference explaining the new steps, Mr. Draghi would say only that the moves had been approved by a "very large majority" of the Governing Council.
The central bank is trying to give the lumbering eurozone economy a shove at the same time the Federal Reserve is getting ready to risk slowing down the United States economy by raising interest rates.
The eurozone economy grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the third quarter -- compared with a 2.1 percent rate in the United States. And unemployment across the 19-country euro currency union is 10.7 percent -- more than double the United States's jobless figure.
Mr. Draghi rebutted reporters' questions about why the new measures seemed more limited than what the economy might need. He described the steps as a recalibration of the central bank's stimulus program, which he said had been a success since it began in March.
"We are doing more because it works, not because it fails," he said. "We want to consolidate something that has been a success."
But some analysts said that Mr. Draghi had probably been unable to win over members of the Governing Council who think more stimulus is unnecessary, or who want to keep some monetary weapons in reserve in case the economic situation gets worse. Mr. Draghi acknowledged that terrorist attacks in Paris, along with the European influx of migrants from Syria, presented risks to the eurozone economy that are not yet possible to gauge.
"Draghi is now evidently coming up against more opposition," Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients. Mr. Draghi "does not have sufficient support within the E.C.B. Council to act on a grand scale," Mr. Krämer said.
The Governing Council did decide to extend monthly purchases of government bonds and other assets, a way of pumping money into the economy, at least through March 2017.
The bank also said it would increase the penalty it charges banks to keep money in its vaults as a way of pressuring them to lend more. Banks will pay interest of 0.3 percent to keep money at the central bank, compared with the previous rate of 0.2 percent.
And the central bank expanded its purchases of bonds to include debt issued by regional and local governments.
But the central bank did not announce an outright increase in its monthly spending on bonds beyond the current level of 60 billion euros, or about $63.6 billion, as many analysts had expected. And though it said it would be spending more as it reinvests repayments of principal from the bonds and other assets it acquires, the central bank provided no estimate of how big those receipts might be.
Nor did it take other steps on interest rates that might encourage commercial banks to increase lending that might help revive the nearly dormant eurozone economy. Some analysts had expected a cut in the rate that banks pay to borrow short-term funds from the central bank. Their hope had been that the rate would drop to zero from its current 0.05 percent.
The bond-buying program was originally planned to run at least through September 2016. Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that it could be extended beyond March 2017, "if necessary."
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone equities, a key indicator, began falling even as Mr. Draghi was still speaking and ended the day off 3.6 percent. The euro rose more than 2 percent against the dollar, to $1.09, as investors raised their expectations of the returns they are likely to receive on money kept in European assets.
A stronger euro is generally negative for the eurozone economy because it makes exports from the region more expensive for foreign customers. In addition, the central bank is trying to make market interest rates go down. A stronger euro means investors expect the rates to go up.
Mr. Draghi had signaled in recent months that he was dissatisfied with the performance of the eurozone economy and that the central bank would intensify its already significant efforts to energize the economy and raise the region's worrisomely low inflation to a healthier level. Whether the measures announced on Thursday will make a difference remains to be seen.
Eurozone inflation, at an annual rate of only 0.1 percent in November, is far below the European Central Bank's official target of just below 2 percent. Mr. Draghi and other members of the bank's governing council had all but promised that more stimulus measures would be coming on Thursday unless there was a substantial improvement in economic data.
To skeptical questions from reporters on why the central bank was not doing more, in light of the recent data, Mr. Draghi defended the measures and the effects of the stimulus program so far.
He said that eurozone government bond yields, a measure of governments' borrowing costs, had fallen since the stimulus program began, and that commercial bank lending rates were also lower.
Economists are skeptical that the bank's stimulus measures so far have had a substantial effect on increasing the availability of credit in the eurozone, which is one of the program's goals. Many banks have other problems, like large numbers of troubled loans, that are keeping them from lending, no matter how cheaply they can borrow from the central bank.
But on Thursday, Mr. Draghi could only urge the skeptics to wait and see.
"All these measures have had an effect on the economy," Mr. Draghi said. "I don't think our communication was wrong," he said. "These measures need time to be fully appreciated."

Abstract: Standing near a pedestrian bridge across from one of this city's sprawling markets, they try to reel in customers who want to trade in their old francs, wrinkled, sweaty and dirty, for new ones that have become status symbols to give as gifts at weddings and other celebrations. Guineans are keen on the new 20,000 franc bill, with its indigo and green tones and backside portrait of the nation's new Chinese-financed hydroelectric dam in Kaleta, about 60 miles north of the capital, and several electric transmission towers.

Full text:   CONAKRY, Guinea -- The euro is slipping, the American dollar is holding steady and the world's new digital currency, Bitcoin, is trying to find its foothold. But on a recent sunny afternoon along a main thoroughfare in this busy capital city, the market for stiff new Guinean francs was hopping.
"Hello, Madame!" a group of men cried out as they stood along a busy roadway with large stacks of shrink-wrapped Guinean francs tucked under their armpits and stuffed into their back pockets.
Guineans like their francs crisp and clean for handing out on special occasions, and that has created demand for new paper money that a cadre of young men, who would otherwise probably be jobless, are eager to serve. Ibrahim Kamera, 29, and his friends make a living selling brand new bills.
Standing near a pedestrian bridge across from one of this city's sprawling markets, they try to reel in customers who want to trade in their old francs, wrinkled, sweaty and dirty, for new ones that have become status symbols to give as gifts at weddings and other celebrations.
In much of West Africa, where credit card machines and A.T.M. s are sparse, cash is king.
But here in Conakry, freshly printed Guinean francs rule. And that has created opportunities in a nation where unemployment is a serious problem, especially for young people -- some government estimates say that as many as 60 percent of youth in the nation are jobless.
The employment situation has worsened as Guinea has struggled to rid itself of Ebola and its economy has plummeted.
The lucky young men find jobs driving taxis or pushing wheelbarrows at construction sites. Others adopt more unsavory professions, on evidence at the local pickpockets' market, where the day's catch of mobile phones, leather wallets and stolen items is on display.
And then there are these men, most in their 20s but some as young as 15, gathered under the bridge.
"Our life is in this," said Ishmael Isho Kamera, 23, one of the money-changers and no relation to Ibrahim Kamera, as he patted his stacks of brand new francs. "We don't have anything else to do."
Across the globe, the legal market for money is huge. Numismatists collect old coins and trade them for hundreds or thousands of times their original face value. The foreign exchange market, where currencies are traded for a profit, is estimated to be a $5.3 trillion-a-day operation.
And in some parts of the world, the illegal market for money also is thriving.
"In many countries there's a black market for currencies that is very lucrative for some people," said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company in New York.
Here in Conakry, Ibrahim Kamera, who like his friends wears a soccer jersey and flip-flops, considers it a good day if he earns 200,000 francs a day, the equivalent of about $26. Typically, a day may bring in half that much. That is still considerably more than the average daily income in Guinea, which in 2014 was less than a dollar and a half.
Americans fixated over new state-themed quarters when they were released into circulation in the United States. Guineans are keen on the new 20,000 franc bill, with its indigo and green tones and backside portrait of the nation's new Chinese-financed hydroelectric dam in Kaleta, about 60 miles north of the capital, and several electric transmission towers.
The dam increased energy generation to a nation plagued by blackouts and has been one of President Alpha Condé's crowning achievements. The denomination was issued in July, curiously timed to Mr. Condé's campaign for re-election in the fall.
The money-changers under the bridge have learned to be good businessmen. Years ago, they found an original investor, a friend who gave them some starting capital. Now, they earn about 50,000 francs in profits -- about $6.50 -- on every 1,000,000 francs they sell.
Potential customers are easy to pick out, especially the women, who usually are on their way to a wedding, carrying umbrellas and large bags for toting the paper money.
Most clients buy large stacks of bills; they have to if they want their cash gifts to be meaningful. In Guinea, where inflation has taken a toll in past years, a typical lunch of fish, rice and plantains at a restaurant costs about 114,000 francs. One loyal customer buys 15 million francs at a time.
The young men have also honed their sales skills. Mr. Kamera gives discounts to repeat customers. Sometimes he sings to clients, to entertain them so maybe they will buy just a little more money than intended. When Mr. Kamera learns that a customer shares his last name, a common one in parts of West Africa, he makes a scene, pretending to be related for the sake of improving customer relations.
Mr. Kamera and his crew compete with one another, jostling to be first to get to an approaching customer. But it is just part of the job, and all is generally forgiven in a matter of minutes. The men possess a charm and cheerful spirit that belies the danger of their trade and the seeming hopelessness of their lot in life.
Mr. Kamera and his friends are refugees who fled violence in Sierra Leone in the late 2000s. They take turns delivering part of their proceeds to their families, who are scraping by in an abandoned refugee camp in Boreah in the north of Guinea, some 15 hours away by car.
The police occasionally swarm the area by the pedestrian bridge, beating the men, confiscating their stacks of money and jailing them, sometimes for days. After all, their work is illegal.
"This job," said Desmond Conte, 27, in slow, deliberate words, "is not safe."
When it comes to sales of new francs, the competition is real. A group of young Guinean-born men plies the same trade on the other side of the bridge no more than 30 feet from the turf Mr. Kamera and his friends have staked out. The groups mostly ignore each other, except for exchanging dirty looks.
For both groups of men, business has been slow because fears of violence around the October presidential election made people wary of scheduling weddings and other events in the city.
One day shortly after the election, it was probably the presence of two American journalists that kept customers away from Mr. Kamera and his friends.
Business was better for the competition on the other side of the bridge, where a woman in a red and gold head scarf and yellow gown dug into her large bag as she approached to conduct business. The woman was buying new francs to hand out to children as gifts, she said before scurrying away without offering her name.
Mr. Kamera and his friends often think about another way of life. Most said they wanted one day to become soccer superstars. If that did not pan out, some said they would like to own a business. Others wanted to become soldiers.
"Our future belongs to God," Mr. Kamera said, "but for now there are no new opportunities."
Mr. Kamera was forced to end his education when he was 12 years old to flee Sierra Leone. He would like to finish school then try for his dream job.
"I want to be an American Marine," he said.

Full text:   When Federal Reserve officials meet in two weeks to decide whether to raise interest rates, they will probably eat catered food at their Foggy Bottom headquarters. If they want to get some fresh air, though, they might consider heading to the nearest Shake Shack, where they could find both tasty burgers and insight that will make their decision smarter.
That's because the latest forecasts from Shake Shack and several other restaurant chains suggest that a mainstay of economic thought -- that higher wages for workers will quickly translate into higher prices for consumers -- may not apply as strongly as traditional economic theory suggests.
Chain restaurants present a particularly useful window into the ways that an improving economy is, or isn't, transforming into broad-based price inflation. And inflation is the core issue facing the Fed as it considers a rate increase to prevent the economy from overheating.
Why restaurants? Labor costs represent a larger portion of their total costs than in many other types of companies, and so any wage increases are more likely to flow through to higher prices for consumers. That sensitivity -- combined with the ubiquity of the sector -- makes it an interesting bellwether for the economy. And conveniently, because worker compensation and pricing are such crucial components of the companies' financial performance, restaurant chain executives often talk about what they are seeing in conference calls with investors.
Shake Shack executives, for example, talked to Wall Street analysts on Nov. 5 of their plans for 2016. Labor costs are going up -- in part because of local minimum wage increases, in part because of the company's emphasis on attracting good, loyal workers. "Washington, D.C., at $12 an hour, we're paying $11 an hour in Texas, well above minimum wage, and we're going to continue to think about that," said Randall Garutti, the company's chief executive. "We haven't decided on the dates, but we do know that we'll be increasing our wages. We want to get the best team, we want to have the best people, driving sales and driving our restaurants."
But the price increase the company envisions is small. "Our plan in early 2016 in January is to take just a small menu price increase, just 1 percent to 2 percent, which will not completely offset those increases in labor that we've been talking about," said the chief financial officer Jeffrey Uttz at a Morgan Stanley retail conference on Nov. 17. (That does come after a 3 percent price increase this past January. Average the two years out, and Shake Shack is doing its part to keep consumer prices rising at roughly the 2 percent annual rate the Fed aims for.)
Other restaurant chains present a similar impression: Labor costs are going up, but it's just one more thing to manage through, not an excuse to raise prices substantially. And it's not just in the cheeseburger business.
"We have a lot of great franchisees out there that really don't look for excuses," said Jeffrey Lawrence, chief financial officer of Domino's Pizza, in an earnings call in October. "They're really focused on managing. And whether it's food cost or labor line item, they're going to manage through it. So we're not overly concerned about wages at the moment."
The same idea applies if you favor a high-end steak place instead. "On a wage rate, in certain parts of the country, we are seeing some pressures there," said Thomas Pennison Jr., chief financial officer of Del Frisco's, adding that the company was "adjusting our operations as best we can to counteract that."
What kind of price increases does that translate to? "We're under 1 percent right now year over year," he said, though it's above 2 percent in certain markets. "Most of our pricing that we've been doing right now is specific to markets where we've dealt with minimum wage or some of the labor impacts."
What about fast-casual burritos? "Yeah, we don't have any plans right now for any kind of national price increase to deal with wage pressure," said Chipotle's chief financial officer, John Hartung, though there may be some price increases in "isolated markets."
Prefer some baby back ribs? With barbecue sauce? They should remain affordable. "Well, Tom's talking about a 3 percent increase in wages, and we're talking about a 2 percent price increase," said Wyman Roberts, the chief executive of Chili's restaurant chain, referring to the company's C.F.O., Thomas Edwards Jr.
Others say they do intend to raise prices to keep up with wages -- but just can't do so yet. Panera Bread's prices are up 2.1 percent over a year earlier. "This price increase is not quite enough to cover structural wage benefit and food inflation in the quarter, but going forward, our plan is to do just that," said Ronald M. Shaich, the company's chairman, in late October.
None of this means that inflation will remain calm forever. Food prices are stable right now, reflecting a global commodity glut. Other chains may do as Panera intends to, and try to raise prices to reflect higher worker pay gradually.
But there's also this: The last seven years have featured flat wages in inflation-adjusted terms, combined with rising corporate profit margins, two phenomena that aren't completely unrelated. The behavior we're seeing out of major restaurant chains may just be a sign that this is reversing, and that worker compensation will gain at the expense of corporate profits. If that's the case, worker pay has some room to run before consumer price inflation is a real problem.
A few earnings calls from just one sector of the economy certainly don't prove that's happening, but the possibility may be enough to justify that Janet Yellen and her colleagues get out for lunch once in a while.

Full text:   Stocks sank on Wednesday as a sharp drop in the price of oil dragged down energy companies. Benchmark United States crude settled below $40 a barrel for the first time since August.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 158.67 points, or 0.9 percent, to 17,729.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 23.12 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,079.51, and the Nasdaq composite lost 33.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,123.22.
Oil and gas stocks fell far more than the rest of the market: Energy stocks in the S.&P. 500 sank 3.1 percent versus 1.1 percent in the broader market.
The price of oil was lower all day, and the losses accelerated in the afternoon after the Energy Department reported that United States crude inventories rose by 1.2 million barrels last week; analysts had expected a decline.
Benchmark United States crude dropped $1.91, or 4.6 percent, to $39.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell $1.95, or 4.4 percent, to $42.49 a barrel in London.
Exxon Mobil shares fell $2.34, or 3 percent, to $79.55; Chevron stock lost $2.23, or 2.4 percent, to $90.25; and shares in the drilling rig operator Transocean fell 37 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $13.83.
In other trading, Yahoo shares jumped $1.94, or nearly 6 percent, to $35.65 after reports that the company was considering selling its core Internet businesses in order to avoid a big tax bill on the eventual sale of its stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Yahoo has struggled for years to re-energize itself.
Investors remained focused on what the world's central banks plan to do at their coming policy meetings.
The consensus among investors was that the Fed would raise rates at its meeting on Dec. 15 and 16. That view was reinforced on Wednesday, when the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, indicated that the American economy was on track for an interest rate increase this month, though she was careful to point out that the Fed would need to review any coming data before making a decision.
Government bond prices fell after Ms. Yellen's comments. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.18 percent from 2.15 percent.
The data Ms. Yellen was referring to include the November jobs report, which comes out on Friday. Economists forecast that employers created 200,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate remained steady at 5 percent.
"It's becoming more and more likely that the Fed is going to raise rates," said Kristina Hooper, head of United States investment strategies at Allianz Global Investors.
Unless the November employment figures are extraordinarily weak, investors believe the Fed will raise interest rates this month, from record low levels, for the first time since the financial crisis. Some preliminary jobs data out on Wednesday supported the forecast that the American jobs market continued to improve last month. The payroll processor ADP said the private sector created 217,000 jobs in November.
In Europe, investors expected the European Central Bank to move in the opposite direction and expand its stimulus program when policy makers meet on Thursday, either by expanding its bond purchases or by cutting interest rates further. Mario Draghi, the bank's president, signaled that the action was coming this week as the E.C.B. seeks to support growth and push inflation higher.
The dollar strengthened to 123.22 yen from 122.84 yen. The euro slipped to $1.0613 from $1.0630.
In other energy futures trading in New York, wholesale gasoline fell 7 cents, or 5.1 percent, to close $1.293 a gallon; heating oil fell 6.4 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $1.305 a gallon; and natural gas declined 6.6 cents, or 3 percent, to $2.165 a gallon.
In metals, gold fell $9.60, or 1 percent, to $1,054.20 an ounce, silver fell seven cents to $14.01 an ounce and copper fell four cents to $2.033 a pound.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Republicans unhappy with the Federal Reserve are circulating an idea that long ago lost currency with most economists: a gold standard.
In an election season shaken by terrorism fears, immigration politics and economic anxiety, a shiny precious metal might seem like an odd fixation, but Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican presidential hopeful, said recently that the dollar should have a fixed value in gold, and some rivals for the Republican nomination said a return to the old standard was worth studying.
The rhetoric is rooted in concern that the Fed's efforts to revive economic growth have loosened its hold on inflation. A gold standard, proponents argue, would limit the Fed's ability to create money, thus ensuring prices remain stable.
But economic historians describe this as nostalgia for a time that never was. Proponents of the gold standard generally overstate the benefits of putting golden handcuffs on a central bank, historians say, and the costs of that reduced flexibility are considerable.
In 2012, the University of Chicago asked 40 leading economists whether a gold standard would improve the lives of average Americans. All 40 said no.
"You can do a lot better than a gold standard," said Michael Bordo, an economist and director of the Center for Monetary and Financial History at Rutgers University. He described the political interest in the precious metal as "pretty crazy."
The gold standard was invented to constrain government spending. Nations that agreed to exchange money for gold thought twice before printing more money. And lately, Republicans have found themselves yearning for such restraint.
After the 2008 recession, the Fed began a campaign to stimulate economic growth. It has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, and it put further pressure on long-term rates by creating trillions of dollars to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds. Both measures aimed to spur risk-taking by investors and borrowing by businesses and consumers.
Republicans have warned since the outset that the Fed was losing control of inflation. During the 2012 campaign, Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas and a Republican presidential candidate, called the Fed's policies "treasonous" and warned that if Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, came to Texas, "we would treat him pretty ugly." The party added a plank to its platform calling for a commission "to investigate possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar," reviving language last seen in 1984.
Instead, four years later, inflation remains unusually sluggish. Some economists and Fed officials argue the economy would benefit from a little more. But the language of the Fed's critics remains heated.
"Instead of adjusting monetary policy according to whims and getting it wrong over and over again and causing booms and busts, what the Fed should be doing is, No. 1, keeping our money tied to a stable level of gold," Mr. Cruz said last month during a Republican presidential debate.
Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, agreed that the Fed "destroys the value of the currency" by allowing too much inflation. Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor, both agreed that the value of the dollar should be tied to something.
"If it's not going to be gold, make it the commodity basket," Mr. Huckabee said.
Economists generally regard a gold standard as a crude and outdated method of inflation control. There is nothing inherently stable about the value of gold. It fluctuates, like the value of everything else, as more is extracted from the ground and as demand waxes and wanes.
The bigger problem, however, is that economic conditions are unstable. And during recessions, printing money can help revive economic activity. Nations began to rebound from the Great Depression when they began to abandon gold. Most developed nations now ask central banks to strike a balance between stabilizing broad measures of price inflation and encouraging economic growth, and then leave it to the technocrats to decide how much money to print.
"The real world is a complex place," Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in a recent defense of the need for human judgment in making monetary policy. "Driverless cars would veer from side to side and cause crashes if their guidance algorithm was limited to just maintaining the distance from the car in front of them, instead of assimilating more information as they went. The U.S. economy cannot be safely run on autopilot either."
Barry Eichengreen, an economic historian at the University of California, Berkeley, said life under the gold standard, during its heyday around the turn of the last century, more closely resembled modern central banking than is commonly recognized. The Bank of England held extra gold so it could print extra money if necessary, for example, and nations frequently suspended their standards during periods of extreme duress.
But Mr. Eichengreen emphasized that these leniencies proved insufficient, and that policy makers had made "steady and significant progress" in the intervening decades toward improving the management of monetary policy.
"There is a long history in the United States, going back to Andrew Jackson, of deep skepticism of the power of anonymous financial technocrats," Mr. Eichengreen said. "This wish to substitute simple rules partly reflects a strain of political ideology that thinks government intervention only causes problems and never solves them. And partly it reflects a lack of careful understanding of how these earlier regimes work."
In fact, the gold standard did not even work during periods of calm. What is often described as an era of stable prices was more like a roller-coaster ride that ended back where it began, after bursts of inflation and deflation.
Mr. Bordo has calculated that economic volatility in the United States was significantly greater during the gold standard years, and the nation's unemployment rate, on average, was almost a full percentage point higher.
"When people look back and say the gold standard was wonderful, they forget about the short-run swings," he said.
Even economists who want to remove human judgment from monetary policy tend to look down on the gold standard. Milton Friedman, a conservative economic icon, suggested that monetary policy should not be determined by people or by gold, but instead by a computer program.
The last few years have served as a reminder that steering straight ahead is not necessarily the best policy during a storm. After the financial crisis, the Fed has embraced responsibility not just for inflation but also for economic and financial stability, and other central banks have followed its path.
And congressional Republicans, while levying many of the same criticisms against the Fed as the party's presidential candidates, have proved unwilling to impose a rigid rule.
The House of Representatives last month passed legislation requiring the Fed to choose its own rule for setting interest-rate levels -- a Fed standard -- and explain any deviations. The legislation includes a suggested rule, known as the Taylor Rule, which tries to formalize a balance between economic growth and inflation, effectively allowing some amount of extra money printing during recessions.
A similar Senate bill would not require the Fed to pick a rule, but instead to compare its conduct of monetary policy with several reference rules in regular reports to Congress.
"We will not fully realize robust economic growth until the Fed changes the conduct of its monetary policy," Representative Bill Huizenga, the Michigan Republican who wrote the House bill, said during the final debate on the House floor. He then emphasized that the legislation would leave the Fed free to "develop what it believes is the best course of action on monetary policy."

Retail Shares Dip on Weak Holiday Reports

Abstract: While the European Central Bank moves toward increasing stimulus, the Federal Reserve is getting ready to start raising interest rates for the first time since June 2006.

Full text:   Stocks closed modestly lower on Monday, as traders focused on early signs from the holiday shopping season and potential moves from the American and European central banks.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 78.57 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,719.92. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 9.70 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,080.41 and the Nasdaq composite lost 18.86 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,108.67.
Consumer discretionary stocks were among the biggest decliners, including the big department stores like Macy's, Kohl's, Walmart and Target. Initial data from the first holiday shopping weekend showed shoppers were not going to stores as much as last year.
Preliminary data from ShopperTrak showed in-store sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday were $12.1 billion, down from $12.3 billion a year earlier. Yet the economic climate is relatively strong for shopping, including lower gas prices from a year ago and an improving job market.
"We believe Black Friday has gone from a period of management excitement to one of anguish," the Nomura retail analysts Simeon Siegel, Gene Vladimirov and Julie Kim wrote in a note to investors.
Investment bank analysts have said that department stores had to do deep discounting to attract shoppers to their stores. But data from research firms like ChannelAdvisor showed strong growth in sales online, which could suggest consumers decided to spend online instead of in brick-and-mortar shops.
Consumer discretionary stocks fell 1 percent, compared with the 0.5 percent drop in the S.&P. 500. Some of the more notable decliners were Macy's, which fell 90 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $39.09, Walmart, which fell $1.04, or 1.7 percent, to $58.87 and Urban Outfitters, which fell $1.25, or 5.3 percent, to $22.40. Even the online retail giant Amazon dropped $8.46, or 1.3 percent, to $664.80.
"While it's too early to make the call about how 2015 holiday revenues (and margins) will unfold, our survey results for the Black Friday weekend don't add a lot of confidence for the broad retail landscape," Dave Weiner and Sindhu Chitturi, retail analysts for Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note to investors.
More broadly, investors are also focused on this week's European Central Bank meeting and the release of American jobs data.
The European Central Bank is widely expected to give the region's economy another dose of stimulus as it tries to keep a recovery going and get inflation closer to 2 percent. The stimulus is likely to include increasing the amount banks have to pay to park money at the central bank, giving them an incentive to lend it instead.
While the European Central Bank moves toward increasing stimulus, the Federal Reserve is getting ready to start raising interest rates for the first time since June 2006. A series of American economic reports this week, culminating with Friday's jobs survey for November, could cement investors' expectations for a rate hike at the Fed's next policy meeting in mid-December.
"Unless this report is a total disaster, I think it's very, very likely the Fed is going to raise in December," said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
The policy divergence between the two central banks has weighed on the euro and sent the dollar higher. On Monday the euro fell to $1.0572, its lowest level since April. It traded at $1.0591 late Friday.
Major American stock indexes ended November with slight gains. The S.&P. 500 rose less than 0.1 percent and the Dow gained 0.3 percent.
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index rose 0.2 percent, to 107.7, last month. The index has increased 3.9 percent over the last 12 months.
The figures add to evidence that the housing market has lost some of its momentum after rapid sales growth this year. Healthy job gains and low mortgage rates lifted sales for much of the year. But rising home values and limited inventories have curtailed further growth in the closing months of 2015.
Benchmark United States crude fell 6 cents, to $41.65 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, lost 25 cents to close at $44.61 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 3.2 cents, to $1.359 a gallon; heating oil fell 1.6 cents, to $1.337 a gallon; and natural gas rose 2.3 cents, to $2.235 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Government bond prices did not move much. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.21 percent. The dollar rose to 123.12 yen from 122.85 yen late Friday.
Gold rose $9.60 to $1,065.80 an ounce. Silver edged up 4 cents, to $14.05 an ounce, and copper edged down half a penny, to $2.04 a pound.

Full text:   Three times a month, Mohammad al-Kirayfawai hands $300 to fighters from the Islamic State for the privilege of driving his refrigerated truck full of ice cream and other perishables from Jordan to a part of Iraq where the militants are firmly in charge.
The fighters who man the border post treat the payment as an import duty, not a bribe. They even provide a stamped receipt, with the logo and seal of the Islamic State, that Mr. Kirayfawai, 38, needs for passing through other checkpoints on his delivery route.
Refuse to pay and the facade of normality quickly falls away. "If I do not," Mr. Kirayfawai explained, "they either arrest me or burn my truck."
Across wide expanses of Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State, with the goal of building a credible government, has set up a predatory and violent bureaucracy that wrings every last American dollar, Iraqi dinar and Syrian pound it can from those who live under its control or pass through its territory.
Interviews with more than a dozen people living inside or recently escaped from the Islamic State-controlled territory, and Western and Middle Eastern officials who track the militants' finances, describe the group as exacting tolls and traffic tickets; rent for government buildings; utility bills for water and electricity; taxes on income, crops and cattle; and fines for smoking or wearing the wrong clothes.
The earnings from these practices that mimic a traditional state total tens of millions of dollars a month, approaching $1 billion a year, according to some estimates by American and European officials. And that is a revenue stream that has so far proved largely impervious to sanctions and air raids.
"They fight in the morning and they tax in the afternoon," said Louise Shelley, the director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University.
The better known of the Islamic State's revenue sources -- smuggling oil, plundering bank vaults, looting antiquities, ransoming kidnapped foreigners and drumming up donations from wealthy supporters in the Persian Gulf -- have all helped make the group arguably the world's richest militant organization. But as Western and Middle Eastern officials have gained a better understanding of the Islamic State's finances over the past year, a broad consensus has emerged that its biggest source of cash appears to be the people it rules, and the businesses it controls.
In the aftermath of the attacks in Paris this month, the United States has more aggressively targeted the militants' oil production and smuggling operations, which it had held off from doing for fear of inflicting long-term damage to the Iraqi and Syrian economies. American aircraft this month struck a convoy of oil tanker trucks in eastern Syria, destroying 116 vehicles.
Ultimately, though, many officials and experts said the Islamic State would probably be able to cover its costs even without oil revenue, and that so long as it controls large stretches of Iraq and Syria, including major cities, bankrupting the group would take a lot more than blowing up oil tankers
"These are all going to be little pinpricks into Islamic State financing unless you can take their revenue bases away from them, and that means the territory they control," said Seth Jones, a terrorism expert at the RAND Corporation.
Inside that territory, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has taken over the legitimate revenue collection operations of the governments it has usurped. And it has used the ever-present threat of violence to extract as much as it can from the people, businesses and property it now controls.
In the Bab al-Tob neighborhood of Mosul, Iraq, for instance, the militants turned a police station that dated to the 19th-century Ottoman era into a market, with 60 shops selling fruits and vegetables. The annual rent for a market stall is 2.8 million Iraqi dinars, or roughly $2,500.
In Raqqa, the Syrian city that is now the de facto capital of the Islamic State, a department called Diwan al-Khadamat, or the Office of Services, sends officials through the city markets to collect a cleaning tax -- 2,500 to 5,000 Syrian pounds, or about $7 to $14, per month depending on the size of the shop. Residents go to collection points to pay their monthly electricity and water bills, 800 Syrian pounds, or roughly $2.50 for electricity and 400 pounds, about $1.20, for water.
Another Islamic State department, the Diwan al-Rikaz, or the Office of Resources, oversees oil production and smuggling, the looting of antiquities and a long list of other businesses now controlled by the militants. It operates water-bottling and soft-drink plants, textile and furniture workshops, and mobile phone companies, as well as tile, cement and chemical factories, skimming revenues from all of them.
The Islamic State also demands a cut of the revenues earned by small businesses. "We either pay in olive oil or cash, it depends on the production," said Tarek, a Syrian in Beirut who supports the government of President Bashar al-Assad. He asked to be identified by only his first name because his parents are still living and working on the family farm in Al Bab, an area controlled by the Islamic State, outside the city of Aleppo.
Officials of the so-called caliphate dislike the term "tax," preferring the Islamic term "zakat," which refers to the alms Muslims are required to pay. Although the norm would be 2.5 percent of a person's wealth under typical interpretations of Islamic law, the militants are taking 10 percent, justifying the high rate by saying they are a "nation in a time of war," according to a citizen journalist in Raqqa who asked for his safety to be identified only as Abu Mouaz.
The group has taken over the collection of car-registration fees, and made students pay for textbooks. It has even fined people for driving with broken taillights, a practice that is nearly unheard-of on the unruly roads of the Middle East.
Fines are also included in the punishments meted out for breaking the strict living rules imposed by the Islamic State. Smoking is strictly forbidden, for example, and Mohammad Hamid, 29, said that when he was caught smoking a cigar in his shop in Mosul in late August, "ISIS not only whipped me 15 times in public but forced me to pay a fine of 50,000 dinar," or about $40 at the time. He soon after fled to a Kurdish area of Iraq.
In all, some officials estimate that the Islamic State is extracting as much as $800 or $900 million, possibly more, from residents or businessmen inside the territory it controls.
That is on top of revenues from oil smuggling, which are estimated to bring an additional $500 million. The group also earns tens of millions of dollars more from other revenue sources, such as kidnapping. And it looted roughly $1 billion from banks in the towns and cities it took over -- including $675 million in Mosul alone -- though that was a one-time source of revenue.
But intelligence gleaned from defectors, communication intercepts and on raids has yielded only so much information about the relatively complex financial structure inside its territory.
"There is nothing that would let me suspect that we have a complete sense of the central bookkeeping operations," said a European official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified intelligence.
After oil and taxes, "everything else is a rounding error," said Daniel Benjamin, who was the top counterterrorism official at the State Department and is now a scholar at Dartmouth College.
Mr. Benjamin said that given the group's scope and ambition it could not be "judged by the standards of other terrorist groups." Only the "pseudo-state" of Colombia's FARC, which once controlled territory the size of Switzerland, came close. But he said the Islamic State's economic model would be hard to maintain in the long run.
In the short term, American and European officials are struggling to cut the group's revenues. But the old strategy for stopping the flow of money to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, which was largely based on cutting them off from donors in the Persian Gulf upon which they depend, does not apply to the Islamic State.
"They derive so much of their resources internally, that more traditional counterterror finance tools we would apply, say in the case of Al Qaeda, to cut off a terror organization from its income sources are not applicable in this case," said Daniel L. Glaser, the assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing. "They don't rely on donors."
Instead, the United States and its allies have concentrated their efforts on trying "to stop them from getting access to the financial system," he said.
That has also proved to be difficult. The Islamic State trades with individuals and businesses in the countries it is fighting, selling oil at cut-rate prices to Kurds in Iraq and the government of Mr. Assad, among others.
The Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on nearly three dozen people linked to the Islamic State's finances, and last week expanded those to include a Syrian construction executive who it charged is helping Mr. Assad buy oil from the Islamic State, and Kirsan N. Ilyumzhinov, the Russian businessman who heads the World Chess Federation and was accused of "materially assisting" top Syrian officials and bankers.
Officials assume that the Islamic State must be circulating the money it collects back out into the regional and global financial system since there have not been signs of the kind of rampant inflation that could result from a large influx of currency into a relatively small economy closed off from the surrounding markets.
Money-changing and transfer businesses in southern Turkey are another particular concern because they are believed to be helping the militants launder money, the European official said.
In a reflection of the growing frustration with Turkey, the State Department pointedly mentioned the use of the city of Gaziantep as a transit point for fighters heading to the Islamic State when it recently announced a $5 million reward for a senior militant figure.
The militant, Tirad al-Jarba, better known by his nom de guerre Abu-Muhammad al-Shimali, is the Islamic State's border chief, and runs one of the group's logistics committees that coordinates "smuggling activities, financial transfers, and the movement of supplies into Syria and Iraq," according to the State Department.
But in the long run, according to American officials, the surest way to significantly restrict the group's finances will be to retake territory it controls, something that has been painstakingly slow so far, despite thousands of airstrikes.
"The only one sure way to take away their wealth, their revenue base," one senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, "is going to be through military force."

Abstract: According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the number of active borrowers enrolled in college has declined to roughly nine million today from about 12 million in 2010. Students can take out federal loans to pay for the full cost of attending graduate school, including both tuition and living expenses such as food, rent, transportation and child care.

Full text:   The American student loan crisis is often seen as a problem of profligacy and predation. Wasteful colleges raise tuition every year, we are told, even as middle-class wages stagnate and unscrupulous for-profit colleges bilk the unwary. The result is mounting unmanageable debt.
There is much truth in this diagnosis. But it does not explain the plight of Liz Kelley, a Missouri high school teacher and mother of four who made a series of unremarkable decisions about college and borrowing. She now owes the federal government $410,000, and counting.
This is a staggering and unusual sum. The average undergraduate who borrows leaves school with about $30,000 in debt. But Ms. Kelley's circumstances are not unique. Of the 43.3 million borrowers with outstanding federal student loans, 1.8 percent, or 779,000 people, owe $150,000 or more. And 346,000 owe more than $200,000.
Ms. Kelley's debt woes are also mostly a matter of interest, not principal, a growing problem for the nation's student debtors. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the number of active borrowers enrolled in college has declined to roughly nine million today from about 12 million in 2010. Yet the total amount of outstanding debt continues to increase, because many borrowers are not paying back their older loans.
This is partly a function of continuing economic hardship. But it also reflects how the federal government has become the biggest, nicest and meanest student lender in the world.
Ms. Kelley, 48, first enrolled in college in 1990 at Maryville University, a private school near St. Louis. She was a nontraditional student, already married with children. She took out loans to help pay tuition, and by the time she graduated with a degree in English in 1994, the total was $26,278, which is the inflation-adjusted equivalent of about $42,000 in 2015. This is not an unusual sum. The typical private college graduate who borrows holds $32,600 in debt.
Then as now, the job market was not clamoring for English majors. Practicing law and teaching seemed like the best options, and Ms. Kelley chose the former. Entering law school also allowed her to delay repaying her undergraduate student loans. She again borrowed for tuition, $37,000 for the first three semesters, which is also a fairly typical amount. Law school graduates today often have six-figure loans.
Adding Up to $68,518
But then Ms. Kelley experienced her first real piece of bad luck. She became ill with a life-threatening autoimmune disease, requiring a lengthy hospitalization. She dropped out of law school and ultimately chose not to return. But she still owed the money, in addition to her undergraduate loans, which had been accumulating interest. She rolled the two loans together, which now added up to $68,518, at an annual interest rate of 8.25 percent.
Ms. Kelley decided to go into teaching, which meant graduate school back at Maryville. She had four children and a husband who worked, so in addition to borrowing for tuition, she took out extra loans to pay for child care. This is a legal and common practice. Students can take out federal loans to pay for the full cost of attending graduate school, including both tuition and living expenses such as food, rent, transportation and child care. Ms. Kelley's husband was also a borrowing student at the time, but she took out all the child care loans.
Ms. Kelley found work as a teacher at a public school. To be eligible for the highest possible salary, she needed additional graduate work, which she borrowed to complete. By staying enrolled in graduate school from 1999 to 2004, she was able to again put off repaying her older loans. But the interest charges continued, compounding every year. Graduate school and child care added $60,700 to the principal.
Reaching $194,603
For those keeping track, the loans totaled $194,603 by April 2005.
Ms. Kelley's husband worked in the construction industry. In 2005, the family moved to Laredo, Tex., following the great American housing boom. The Great Recession was devastating. Facing home foreclosure, Ms. Kelley cashed out her public teacher retirement funds, despite the stiff penalty. But it wasn't enough. In 2008, she and her husband lost their home, and they divorced.
Ms. Kelley was now several years out of graduate school, and the loans were due. But the federal government allows a borrower to defer payments for up to three years in the case of an economic hardship, which Ms. Kelley certainly had. She consolidated her loan balance, which had grown to $260,000, at slightly more than 7 percent interest.
By this time, Ms. Kelley's children were reaching college age. One received a financial aid package that included $12,000 in Parent PLUS loans, a federal program that allows parents to borrow money for their children's college education after the children have reached the maximum on loans of their own. She agreed, hoping to minimize her children's debt. She briefly enrolled in an education Ph.D. program at Texas A&M before withdrawing, but not fast enough to avoid an additional $7,458 in loans.
Eventually, Ms. Kelley moved back to Missouri, where she found work as a high school teacher in a parochial school. After resolving a long, contentious child care fight with her ex-husband, she finally felt financially stable enough to tackle the pile of student loan documents that had been accumulating. After her loan deferment ended, she enrolled in another, similar federal program called forbearance, also because of an economic hardship. The hardship this time was the loans themselves.
A representative from Ms. Kelley's loan servicer called this September, explaining that her final forbearance would expire in 16 months. After that, Ms. Kelley said, they told her they would "come after her," garnishing her wages and eventually her Social Security. She had taken out her first student loan 25 years earlier and had yet to make a single payment.
She also had not come to grips with how much it had added up to in the end.
A Stunning $410,000
The $410,000 total shocked her. The accumulated interest was more than twice the original principal. She was in a new relationship, but remarriage was impossible -- who would attach themselves to that much debt? Because she had stayed home with her children for many years, she had contributed relatively little to Social Security. Her public teacher retirement fund was gone, along with the equity in her lost home. She, not her ex-husband, had borrowed for child care.
At age 48, she wanted to begin saving for retirement. But the monthly loan payments of $2,750 stretched for 30 years, far more than she could afford and long past retirement age.
Over the next 11 months, Ms. Kelley will accumulate more in interest charges than she borrowed for her entire undergraduate degree. She would like to go bankrupt, but federal law all but precludes that method of discharging student loans.
"I am not a victim," said Ms. Kelley, who shared her loan documents with me. "I made choices."
But her story is more complicated than that. It reveals the deep contradictions in the federal government's approach to student loans.
People have always had a difficult relationship with debt. Access to capital is the fuel of a modern economy. Borrowing for college is often a good idea, because it represents an investment in human potential in a time when brainpower is the most valuable asset most people own. But there's a reason debt is often grouped with sins and frailties in ancient moral codes. Borrowing is risky, financial decisions are not always rational, and people often do a poor job of properly weighing the interests of their present and future selves.
The private enterprise system is built to limit overborrowing by sharing risk between lenders and borrowers. Lenders examine credit and income histories and ask for collateral that can be repossessed in case of default. They charge more interest when they take on more risk. Because most loans can be discharged in bankruptcy, lenders share the cost of default. It's likely that Ms. Kelley's mortgage lender lost money on her 2008 foreclosure, for example.
But the federal student loan program doesn't work that way. Those ads that run on bus stop signs and on late-night television -- "No Cash? No Credit? No Problem!" -- are essentially the Department of Education's official policy on student loans.
On the front end, the department is the world's nicest, most accommodating lender. Interest rates are set by Congress and are lower than banks charge in the private market. Borrowing for college is essentially an entitlement -- as long as you're enrolled in an accredited college and aren't in arrears on a previous student loan, it doesn't matter how much debt you have or how little money you make. Undergraduate loans are capped to contain borrowing and college costs, but graduate loans are bound only by the vague limits of "living expenses."
Private lenders also don't let people defer making payments for years or decades at a time.
A private sector lender approached by a potential borrower with no assets, a modest income and $350,000 in debt who had never made a payment on that loan in over 20 years would not, presumably, lend that person an additional $7,800. But that's exactly what the Department of Education did for Ms. Kelley in 2011. Legally, it could do nothing else.
Our culture also encourages a great deal of trust in colleges. When people walk onto a used-car lot, they generally understand that promises of easy credit are just another tool for a slick salesman to close a deal. The local university and the Department of Education, by contrast, are assumed to have students' best interests in mind.
Pro-student organizations support low interest rates, no credit checks and lengthy deferment options, as do colleges that can't stay solvent without debt-financed tuition. Individually, these policies have merit, just as not repaying a student loan is often a perfectly rational choice in the short term, right up until the point when the short term becomes long. For some people, it hardly seems like debt at all.
When the loan bill finally comes due, the federal government transforms into a heartless loan collector. You don't need burly men with brass knuckles to enforce debts when you have the Internal Revenue Service. It is both difficult and illegal to hide money from the federal government, which can and will follow you as long as you live.
The government acts this way because the federal student loan program has been removed from the norms and values of prudent lending. Because the Department of Education doesn't consider risk, it takes no responsibility. If life, luck and bad choices leave you $410,000 in the hole, it's all on you.
Ms. Kelley has one possible escape route: a federal loan forgiveness program that caps her payments as a percentage of her income and erases her debts if she logs 10 years of service in the public or nonprofit sector. (For today's students, income-based repayment systems are helping lift the burden of debt.) But that would still mean a decade of what she describes as "futile" payments that won't even cover her monthly interest expenses, leaving nothing to put away for retirement. President Obama has proposed capping the amount of debt that can be forgiven at an amount far below Ms. Kelley's outstanding balance, which would cut off future debtors in her situation from full relief.
Most college students don't end up like Ms. Kelley. They pay back their loans and enjoy the fruits of their degrees. But most pack-a-day smokers don't die of lung cancer. And most people who bought cars with Takata airbags from 2002 to 2008 weren't killed by shrapnel from explosions. Nevertheless, we still regard small risks of catastrophic outcomes as problems to be solved.
In the meantime, Ms. Kelley feels hopeless. She understands how she got here. But, she says, "there ought to be a way out."

Full text:   SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- Luis Stuhlberger's Brazilian hedge fund has had an astonishing run -- even in the face of his country's sinking economy.
But he has grown increasingly bearish about the economic outlook for Brazil, and he is no longer placing most of his bets here, deciding to look elsewhere for investment opportunities.
"Brazil is going to get much worse before it gets better," he said.
Given his record, when Mr. Stuhlberger talks, Brazil watchers pay attention. His flagship fund Verde, known for its big-picture calls on economic trends, has returned an average of 29 percent a year, after fees, since it was founded in 1997.
Brazil's stock market returned 10 percent a year, on average, and its main bond market benchmark returned 16 percent a year over the same period.
And while Brazil has been practically synonymous with economic volatility, Verde has had only one down year ever -- 2008, during the global financial crisis, when it lost a modest 6 percent.
These numbers are in Brazil's currency, the real, in which Mr. Stuhlberger's fund is priced, and most of his clients are Brazilian retail investors. But even in dollars, Verde's average annual return has been over 20 percent.
A foreign investor who had given Mr. Stuhlberger $35,000 in 1997 would now have over a million dollars, even after the recent collapse of Brazil's currency.
A Brazilian who had given him 35,000 reais, the cost of a sport utility vehicle at the time, would now have 4 million reais, enough for a couple to retire in comfort.
"He has the best long-term track record in Brazil," said Armínio Fraga, head of the Brazilian asset manager Gávea Investimentos, and former managing director of the investor George Soros's firm. "Like all great investors, Luis thinks big and he thinks creatively, without dogma or formulas."
Global players have taken note. Credit Suisse bought Mr. Stuhlberger's firm, Hedging-Griffo, in 2006. When his noncompete clause ended last year and Mr. Stuhlberger became independent again, the Swiss bank bought a minority stake in his new firm, Verde Asset Management.
"He's a legend here, so we benefit from being able to offer our clients meetings with him and early access to his views," said José Olympio Pereira, chief executive of Credit Suisse Brazil.
The hedge fund giant Blackstone recently allocated part of its $3 billion Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund to Mr. Stuhlberger, alongside names such as Goldman Sachs and Cerberus.
Mr. Stuhlberger is not a stock picker, and he rarely holds a big position in a single company. Instead he tries to identify economic trends, to allocate funds among asset classes to get ahead of these trends, and to use hedging strategies to smooth out the ride while he waits for his bets to pay off.
"Most of the time I do nothing except read and study," he said. "Sometimes I go the whole year without changing allocations. Then I make a big change and wait."
He got a little too far ahead of local trends early last year, as his decision to exit Brazil's stock market, short its currency and keep his bond holdings conservative kept Verde slightly in the red for most of 2014.
But in September 2014 markets came around to his bearishness, and Verde ended the year up 9 percent. So far this year, it is up 24 percent.
Such returns were below the fund's historical average, but Alberto Jacobsen, chief executive of Risk Office, a São Paulo investment consultancy for institutional investors, said Mr. Stuhlberger's performance was "highly impressive" given the country's environment. "It's a lot harder to make money when the stock market is falling and interest rates are rising. Many other hedge funds here lost money."
Big losses in Brazil were reportedly one of the reasons the United States-based Fortress Investment Group decided to liquidate its flagship hedge fund.
But despite his past success, Mr. Stuhlberger concluded last year that there were too few opportunities in Brazil for a fund of Verde's size to be fully invested. So he has begun to return, in installments, 40 percent of its 14 billion reais ($3.8 billion) to investors.
"It's much too early to buy the stock market here. My clients don't pay me to hold cash for them," he said.
Verde is required by regulations to keep 80 percent of its assets inside Brazil. But Mr. Stuhlberger, long unusual among fund managers here for investing globally -- he bet big on German real estate in 2011 -- opened a new fund this year that is available only to qualified investors, and therefore has no limit on how much it can invest abroad.
His main bets in this go-anywhere fund, called Horizonte, are that developed-country equity markets and the dollar are not done rising; China will devalue its currency; and emerging markets will stay in the doldrums as low interest rates, low commodity prices and slow growth persist for the foreseeable future.
Some are cautious about his new venture. "He's brilliant, but we're not certain that he'll have the same competitive advantage outside Brazil that he does at home," Mr. Jacobsen said.
At home, Mr. Stuhlberger sees problems deeper than a political crisis and low prices for commodity exports.
"The country isn't financially viable," he said. "The government has tried to build a European social democracy in the third world. The numbers don't add up."
Despite high taxes -- at 36 percent of the country's gross domestic product, Brazil's tax burden is about the same as Germany's -- the country is running a gaping budget deficit, in part because Brazilians retire with a government pension at an average age of 54.
"There will have to be a major crisis before the population accepts cuts in social spending," Mr. Stuhlberger said.
And though outrage at the way some of that spending is diverted has led to a groundbreaking investigation into corruption, Mr. Stuhlberger said the corruption was so endemic he feared that no new, clean political institutions existed to replace the old ones.
While he waits for the crisis to deepen, his Brazilian allocation is mostly in local inflation-protected bonds. He also holds currency derivatives that will profit if the real falls further, and has a small position long on Petrobras bonds and short on the stock.
For both the government and Petrobras, the energy giant, he said, "Default is not a risk, for now."
Mr. Stuhlberger came late to the hedge fund business. Planning to work in his father's construction company, he studied civil engineering, but found that math interested him more.
In 1980 he started to work in a small brokerage house trading first coffee, then gold, at a time when many Brazilians sought the precious metal as a defense against hyperinflation, since the government forbade holding foreign currency as an investment.
When Brazil lifted most capital and currency controls in 1990, Mr. Stuhlberger began to trade stocks and bonds on the newly important futures exchanges.
He was 42 years old when he opened Verde in 1997. He started with under a million dollars. Success quickly brought clients, and he closed the fund to new investors in 2002.
For all his gloom about Brazil's economy, Mr. Stuhlberger, now 60, says he loves life here.
"The people are incredibly talented, and the Brazilian way is to help each other out. There's not the ruthlessness that you see in the U.S. Here you can be friends with your competitors."
He said work left him little time for socializing or hobbies, though he and his wife of 36 years have a passion for movies from Argentina.
He now spends several months a year traveling internationally, and some members of his team are abroad more often than they are at home.
"It's where we're looking for investments now," Mr. Stuhlberger said. "Outside of Brazil."

Abstract: Mr. Xi told senior military officers this week that he wanted to "build a robust national defense and a strong military that corresponds to our country's international stature, and is adapted to our national security and developmental interests," the Xinhua news agency reported.

Full text:   BEIJING -- China announced on Thursday that it would establish its first overseas military outpost and unveiled a sweeping plan to reorganize its military into a more agile force capable of projecting power abroad.
The outpost, in the East African nation of Djibouti, breaks with Beijing's longstanding policy against emulating the United States in building military facilities abroad.
The Foreign Ministry refrained from describing the new installation as a military base, saying it would be used to resupply Chinese Navy ships that have been participating in United Nations antipiracy missions.
Yet by establishing an outpost in the Horn of Africa -- more than 4,800 miles away from Beijing and near some of the world's most volatile regions -- President Xi Jinping is leading the military beyond its historical focus on protecting the nation's borders.
Together with the plan for new command systems to integrate and rebalance the armed forces, the two announcements highlight the breadth of change that Mr. Xi is pushing on the People's Liberation Army, which for decades has served primarily as a lumbering guardian of Communist Party rule.
Mr. Xi told senior military officers this week that he wanted to "build a robust national defense and a strong military that corresponds to our country's international stature, and is adapted to our national security and developmental interests," the Xinhua news agency reported.
A presence in Djibouti would be China's first overseas logistics facility to service its military vessels since the Communists took power, said David Finkelstein, director of China studies at CNA, an independent research institute in Arlington, Va.
"In the grand sweep of post-1949 Chinese history, this announcement is yet another indicator that Chinese policy is trying to catch up with national interests that have expanded faster than the capacity of the People's Republic of China to service them," Mr. Finkelstein said.
The new facility would enable the navy to live up to a strategy laid down this year by the Communist Party in a major defense document, known as a white paper, that outlined its ambitions to become a global maritime power.
The United States maintains its only military base on the African continent in Djibouti, which it uses as a staging ground for counterterrorism operations in Africa and the Middle East. Last year, President Obama renewed the lease on that base for 20 more years.
China has invested heavily in Djibouti's infrastructure, including hundreds of millions of dollars spent upgrading the country's undersize port. It has also financed a railroad extending from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to Djibouti, a project that cost billions of dollars. The country has a population of about 900,000, many of whom live in poverty.
Strategically, Djibouti offers an excellent place from which to protect oil imports from the Middle East that traverse the Indian Ocean on their way to China, military experts say. From Djibouti, China gains greater access to the Arabian Peninsula.
The news on Thursday of broad changes to the Chinese military signaled a major step forward in Mr. Xi's program to shift its focus from traditional land armies to a more flexible, cohesive set of forces. China's military planning and spending have increasingly focused on territorial disputes in the South China Sea and in waters near Japan.
Mr. Xi told a gathering of more than 200 senior military officers that the planned changes would take years and were essential to ensuring that the People's Liberation Army could shoulder its increasingly complex and broad responsibilities, the official Xinhua news agency said Thursday.
But until now, efforts to revamp the way the military is run have stumbled because of the entrenched power of land forces that have dominated seven military regions, as well as the sheer complexity of reorganizing a force of over two million.
Enactment of the military reforms would be a political victory for Mr. Xi, who since coming to power in November 2012 has enforced an intense campaign against corruption that took down dozens of senior military officers. They have included two former vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, Gens. Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou.
That military graft was lubricated by rapidly rising defense budgets. In the decade up to 2014, China's official military budget grew an average of 9.5 percent annually, after taking inflation into account, according to a recent Congressional Research Service study. That budget is set to grow an additional 10 percent this year, reaching about $145 billion. But many foreign analysts say China's real military spending is higher.
Despite Beijing's traditional rejection of what it calls American imperialism and hegemony, some Chinese experts believe that it is time to reconsider the need for overseas military facilities.
Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, who has argued that China should develop bases commensurate with its growing military power, said on Thursday that in doing so, China would only be doing what America had done.
"The United States has been expanding its business all around the world and sending its military away to protect those interests for 150 years," Mr. Shen said. "Now, what the United States has done in the past, China will do again."
Mr. Shen, who referred to the planned facility in Djibouti as a "base," said it was necessary because "we need to safeguard our own navigational freedom."
He added, "If whoever -- pirates, ISIS or the U.S. -- wants to shut down the passage, we need to be able to reopen it."
The head of the United States Africa Command, Gen. David M. Rodriguez, said in Washington last week that China planned "to build a base in Djibouti" and had reached a 10-year agreement with the country's government to do so. He said the installation would serve as a logistics hub and would enable the Chinese to "extend their reach."
The United States military has praised China's participation in the international antipiracy operations, which protect vital commercial shipping in a volatile part of the world.
But some American military experts, concerned about Beijing's growing military capacity, have expressed unease about China having a land facility in Djibouti so close to Camp Lemonnier, a major American base where 4,000 service members, including Special Forces, and civilians train and carry out counterterrorism operations.
Hong Lei, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, offered few details about the Djibouti facility, but said it would provide Chinese ships with reliable supplies and enable crews to rest. "These facilities will help Chinese vessels to better carry out Chinese missions like escort and humanitarian operations," he said.
Such statements suggest a far more modest facility than the sprawling American base at Camp Lemonnier. Washington announced in 2013 that $1.4 billion would be spent on expanding the base, from which drone operations over Somalia and Yemen are conducted.
France also maintains a base in Djibouti, which is a former French colony. Japan, which also participates in the United Nations antipiracy operations, keeps surveillance aircraft and several hundred personnel there.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer spending in the United States barely rose in October as households took advantage of rising incomes to bolster savings to their highest level in nearly three years, pointing to moderate economic growth in the fourth quarter.
Other data on Wednesday showed a surge in business spending plans in October and a drop in new applications for unemployment benefits last week.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after a similar increase in September. That suggests consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity, has slowed from the third quarter's brisk pace.
The tepid rise in consumer spending could combine with an anticipated drag from a continuing inventory reduction to hold the economy to around a 2 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter.
But the economy, which expanded at a 2.1 percent rate in the third quarter, could get support from business spending.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 1.3 percent last month, after rising 0.4 percent in September.
Coming on the heels of data this month showing a solid increase in manufacturing output in October, it suggested the worst of the pullback from a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy companies was over.
"The surge in core capital goods orders could be a crucial signal that this important sector of the economy may be at a turning point," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief United States economist at TD Securities in New York.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has been slammed by the strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector. The dollar has appreciated 18.1 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.
The pace of appreciation, however, is gradually slowing. Economists also believe that the bulk of spending cuts by oil field companies like Schlumberger in response to lower crude prices have already been carried out.
Economists speculate that rising rents are diverting money from discretionary spending. While consumer sentiment increased in November from October, households continued to fret over their financial prospects, another report showed.
But as the labor market continues to tighten, there is optimism that wage growth will pick up and encourage consumers to loosen their purse strings and lift spending.
A fourth report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 260,000 for the week ended Nov. 21.
Claims have now held below the 300,000 threshold for 38 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch in years, and remain close to levels last seen in the early 1970s.
Strengthening labor market conditions are gradually lifting income. The Commerce Department said personal income increased 0.4 percent last month, following a 0.2 percent gain in September. Wages and salaries shot up 0.6 percent, the largest increase since May.
Savings increased to $761.9 billion last month, the highest level since December 2012, from $722.9 billion in September. Higher savings could over time buoy consumer spending.
There was still no sign of inflation, which has persistently run below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
A price index for consumer spending rose 0.2 percent in the 12 months through October after a similar rise in September. Excluding food and energy, the personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 1.3 percent for the 10th straight month.
In another report, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes jumped 10.7 percent in October, which could allay concerns of a significant slowdown in housing.

Economic Growth for 3rd Quarter Is Revised Up, to a 2.1% Clip

Abstract: With the unemployment rate falling to 5 percent in October and employers bolstering payrolls by 271,000, Fed officials are likely to conclude when they meet next month that the economy is strong enough to handle the first increase in interest rates in nearly a decade. Since the October jobs report, several Fed officials have signaled they see a rate increase coming very soon. Most economists expect the pace of interest rate increases by the Fed to be gradual and predict steady gains to continue for the housing market in the next 12 months, especially if the recent uptick in wages gathers strength and the stock market remains buoyant.

Full text:   The American economy turned in a better performance last quarter than first thought, expanding at a 2.1 percent rate, the government said on Tuesday.
Nearly all of the improvement was because of revised data on inventories, which showed businesses restocking shelves at a faster pace than the government first estimated. The improvement in inventory levels was offset by a slight downward revision in consumer spending last quarter.
Although well below the 3.9 percent pace of growth recorded in the spring, the economy's advance was better than the initial 1.5 percent rate for the third quarter that the Commerce Department reported late last month.
Wall Street economists had been expecting the upward revision for gross domestic product, which is the second of three estimates for growth that the government will release. The final set of numbers will come out on Dec. 22.
For all of 2015, the rate of economic growth is expected to be about 2.5 percent, not much different from the 2.4 percent rate in 2014.
The tepid pace prompted Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, to call this the "tortoise recovery" in a recent note to clients. But that sobriquet does not mean the economy has been uniformly lackluster.
"While this expansion may go uncelebrated, growth in fact has been good enough to achieve a great deal of cumulative progress in the labor market," he added. "We now expect that the U.S. economy will reach full employment within the next 12 months -- the 'tortoise recovery' looks to be approaching the finishing line."
As for the third quarter, the more refined inventory numbers provided a lift to growth, but they are likely to slow down reported economic activity in the current fourth quarter as manufacturers and retailers cut back on restocking of warehouses and backroom stores.
"The inventory revision was even bigger than we expected," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
One mildly downbeat note on Tuesday was an unexpected drop in consumer sentiment this month, with the Conference Board reporting that its index for consumer confidence fell to 90.4 from 99.1 in October. Despite a strong advance in hiring last month, consumers expressed more caution about the job market and future economic conditions in the most recent survey.
Consumer attitudes in the United States should rebound. "U.S. consumers are cash-rich and increasingly secure in their jobs," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "Confidence won't remain at the soft November level."
Nothing in the latest data is expected to derail plans by Federal Reserve policy makers to raise their benchmark interest rate at their meeting next month. The Fed's key lever for influencing the economy has been stuck at close to zero since December 2008.
With the unemployment rate falling to 5 percent in October and employers bolstering payrolls by 271,000, Fed officials are likely to conclude when they meet next month that the economy is strong enough to handle the first increase in interest rates in nearly a decade.
Since the October jobs report, several Fed officials have signaled they see a rate increase coming very soon. On Saturday, the president of the San Francisco Fed, John Williams, echoed that view.
"The data, I think, have been overall encouraging, especially on the labor market," he said. "If that continues to happen, there's a strong case to be made in December to raise rates."
In a separate report on Tuesday, the release of the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September showed a seasonally adjusted gain of 0.6 percent in home prices around the country, double the 0.3 percent increase economists were expecting and the biggest monthly gain since March.
Of the 20 cities surveyed in the index, prices were up in 19 in September; the Detroit area was unchanged. On a yearly basis, home prices in 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index are up 5.5 percent.
Some cities, especially tech hot spots, are posting even larger gains. Home prices in San Francisco are up 11.2 percent over the last 12 months, and Portland registered a 10.1 percent jump.
Most economists expect the pace of interest rate increases by the Fed to be gradual and predict steady gains to continue for the housing market in the next 12 months, especially if the recent uptick in wages gathers strength and the stock market remains buoyant.
As the unemployment rate has fallen, there are signs that wages are finally beginning to pick up as well. That should help overall economic growth next year, especially if consumers who did not see gains earlier in the recovery finally have more disposable income.
While still relatively modest, the pace of growth last quarter was in some ways better than the numbers might suggest. Revised down to 3 percent from 3.2 percent in the initial estimate for the third quarter, consumer spending remained healthy, with an especially strong performance from the auto sector.
Consumption during the current fourth quarter, including the holiday shopping season, is expected to increase at an annualized rate of about 3 percent. But the overall economic growth rate for the months of October, November and December is forecast by many analysts to be closer to the third-quarter figure.
The final big economic clue before the Fed meets on Dec. 15 and 16 is scheduled for Friday, Dec. 4, when the Labor Department reports data on unemployment and hiring in November.
On Tuesday, Barclays predicted November's data would show a healthy gain of 200,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent, breaking the 5 percent threshold that many economists consider close to full employment.
"Although a far weaker-than-expected outcome for this employment report could still cause the Fed to push rate hikes past year-end," Barclays said in a note to clients, "we view such a scenario as a low probability event."

Abstract: The Conference Board, a business research group, said consumer confidence in the United States sank this month to its lowest in a year as Americans worried about the job market. The sector was also battered by a global travel warning from the State Department and the drop in consumer confidence, which suggests that Americans might become nervous about spending money on vacations.

Full text:   Stocks overcame an early stumble Tuesday and finished modestly higher as investors shook off concerns about heightened tensions in the Middle East and a drop in consumer confidence.
The price of oil spiked after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane that Turkey said had violated its airspace and ignored warnings. Energy stocks moved higher along with the price of oil. Travel-related stocks slumped.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 19.51 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,812.19. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 2.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,089.14. The Nasdaq inched up 0.33 point to 5,102.81.
The downing of the Russian plane added new complexity to the crisis in Syria. Russia denied its jets had violated Turkish airspace, said it had been betrayed by Turkey, and warned of severe consequences. NATO worked to reduce tensions at an extraordinary meeting.
The Conference Board, a business research group, said consumer confidence in the United States sank this month to its lowest in a year as Americans worried about the job market. That was a surprise after strong job gains in October. Consumer discretionary stocks including Netflix and Amazon slipped.
Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Research, said the confidence report was a surprise because consumers had a lot of reasons to feel good right now. Employers are hiring and Americans have more money to spend because inflation and gas prices are low. There is also evidence that wages are increasing.
"It's hard to explain," he said, adding that he thought consumer confidence would improve in December.
Crude oil rose $1.12, or 2.7 percent, to $42.87 a barrel in New York. Before that, the price of United States crude had fallen to its lowest since August. Brent crude rose $1.29, or 2.9 percent, to $46.12 a barrel in London.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline climbed 7.7 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $1.39 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2.5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $1.40 a gallon. Natural gas missed out on the rally, down 1 cent to $2.20 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Energy stocks rose 2.1 percent, by far the largest gain in the S.&P. 500 index. Exxon Mobil rose $1.60, or 2 percent, to $81.88 and Chevron gained $1.34, or 1.5 percent, to close at $91.35.
The rising price of oil was one of several pieces of bad news for travel stocks like booking sites and airlines. Higher oil prices mean increased fuel costs, and they also leave consumers with less money for travel. The sector was also battered by a global travel warning from the State Department and the drop in consumer confidence, which suggests that Americans might become nervous about spending money on vacations.
The State Department advised travelers that groups including the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Boko Haram continue to plan terrorist attacks, and Americans should be particularly alert around the holidays. Helane Becker, an analyst for Cowen & Company, said bookings might slump after that warning, but any dip probably would not last long.
"There's usually a decline in bookings in the short term," she said. "I suspect that people who have planned their vacations around the holidays will continue to go, but perhaps people who are booking will stay stateside or not go at all."
Priceline sank $24.14, or 1.9 percent, to $1,240.18 and a competitor, Expedia, shed $3.65, or 3.7 percent, to close at $121.27. Among airlines, United fell $1.76, or 3 percent, to $56.80 and Southwest dropped $1.24, or 2.6 percent, to $46.23. Royal Caribbean lost $2.91, or 3.1 percent, to close at $92.02 and Carnival fell $1, or 2 percent, to $50.39.
Quarterly earnings reports continued to roll in. Signet, the jewelry company whose brands include Kay Jewelers, Jared and Zale, reported profit and revenue that were lower than expected. Its stock dropped $5.76, or 4.1 percent, to $134.89.
Campbell Soup and Hormel both rose after releasing their results. Campbell Soup shares picked up $1.54, or 3.1 percent, to $51.33, and Hormel rose $2.06, or 3 percent, to $71.32.
Metals prices, which have tumbled to six-year lows, made gains. Gold rebounded $7.50, or 0.7 percent, to $1,074.30 an ounce. Silver rose for only the third time in November, by 12.7 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $14.159 an ounce. Copper rose 3.4 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.055 a pound.
The euro rose to $1.0644 from $1.0624. The dollar fell to 122.45 yen from 122.86 yen. Bond prices did not move much. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 2.24 percent.

Full text:   BUENOS AIRES -- Argentine voters handed a victory to Mauricio Macri in the country's presidential election on Sunday, delivering a mandate to an opposition political figure seeking to roll back some of the protectionist economic measures of the departing president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.
With votes from 99 percent of polling places counted, Mr. Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires and a former president of Boca Juniors, one of Argentina's most popular soccer teams, was leading with 51.4 percent of the vote, according to election officials, against 48.5 percent for Daniel Scioli, a former speedboat racer and vice president under former President Néstor Kirchner, who died in 2010. Mr. Scioli conceded defeat on national television on Sunday night.
Running a largely nonconfrontational campaign in a society that has grown increasingly polarized under Mrs. Kirchner, who succeeded her husband in 2007, Mr. Macri, 56, stunned the political establishment in October by forcing the race into a runoff and maintaining his surge in recent weeks. He ran to the right of his rivals, blending plans to overhaul the economy and promote the tolerance of various points of view on social issues.
Mr. Macri's relatively narrow victory revealed deep fissures in Argentina after 12 years of governance by Mrs. Kirchner and her husband, with many voters expressing concern over the direction of the economy and frustration with Mrs. Kirchner's blistering attacks on critics in the news media, business establishments and rival political parties.
"Cristina divided the country and destroyed it morally," said Dimitri Javakhishvili, 67, an immigrant from Georgia who works as a doorman at a building here in the neighborhood of Recoleta. Mr. Javakhishvili acknowledged that Mr. Macri could face challenges in trying to govern when Mrs. Kirchner's political movement moves into the opposition.
Still, Mr. Javakhishvili said, "At least he's something new; he's something fresh."
Not everyone here shares such views. Graffiti and posters have appeared across Buenos Aires demonizing Mr. Macri, outnumbering on many streets the campaign posters expressing support for Mr. Scioli, who balanced lukewarm support from Mrs. Kirchner's loyal followers with claims that social spending could be sustained despite galloping inflation and declining private investment.
One example of anti-Macri sentiment, alluding to fears that he will govern for a privileged few, simply says "Macrisis."
Mr. Macri, the scion of a wealthy family, has tried to combat perceptions that he would reverse the government's leftist policies, saying he will keep the nationalized companies like Aerolíneas Argentinas and YPF, Argentina's largest oil company, under state control. His economic advisers have also sought to tamp down fears around contentious economic issues like a potential currency devaluation.
In addition to grappling with inflation and currency controls aimed at curbing capital flight, Mr. Macri will now face the challenge of governing with much of his opposition under the sway of Peronism, the ideologically diverse political grouping that has dominated Argentine politics for decades.
Yet while Mrs. Kirchner's leftist faction has emerged as a dominant group within Peronism, with the president herself signaling that she planned to remain politically active after stepping down in December, Mr. Macri's margin of victory will help him in the months ahead, analysts said.
"He will be able to start to work with authority," said Juan Cruz Díaz, a director at the Cefeidas Group, a political risk analysis firm. But he added that Mr. Scioli's performance still demonstrated the underlying strength of the Peronist political movement. "It's not a devastating margin of difference," Mr. Díaz said. "With a fatigued government and an erratic campaign, it's a good performance. They are far from dead."
Many political analysts in Argentina doubted that Mr. Macri would make it this far, with skepticism abounding when he began assembling his movement to the right of many rivals more than a decade ago.
He ventured into a part of Argentina's political spectrum that had previously been associated with conservative Peronists or disgraced figures in the military establishment.
But over time, he honed his negotiating skills as the mayor of Buenos Aires, while insisting during this year's campaign that he did not plan to roll back popular social programs introduced during the Kirchners' presidencies, like cash subsidies for poor families and "Soccer for Everybody," a government initiative that covers soccer broadcasting fees so people can watch matches free.
Mr. Macri seemed to gain the upper hand after mounting a door-to-door campaign that helped his supporters win important provincial and local races in October, including the prized post of the governor of Buenos Aires Province, now held by Mr. Scioli but won by María Eugenia Vidal, a top adviser to Mr. Macri and deputy mayor who focused largely on antipoverty programs in the municipal government.
Many voters have also expressed fatigue with Mrs. Kirchner's governing style and reports of corruption among her prominent supporters.
Signaling that she may not plan to remain subdued after leaving office, Mrs. Kirchner issued a torrent of messages on Twitter on Sunday celebrating her foreign and domestic policies. One message even seemed like a warning to Mr. Macri, who has vowed to improve Argentina's strained ties with the United States and review a contentious deal with China to build a nuclear reactor.
"The person with the responsibility of leading the homeland should know the right place of the Argentine republic in a multipolar world," Mrs. Kirchner wrote.
Mr. Macri's "wager wasn't an easy one," the Argentine writer Martín Caparrós wrote in the Spanish newspaper El País. But Mr. Macri's ambitions were aided, Mr. Caparrós said, by "12 years of rule by a couple that spoke as if from the left but acted in their own interests."
Some voters, however, said that their fears over the threats to the government's antipoverty programs outweighed criticism of the Kirchners or concerns that Mr. Scioli, viewed as friendlier to the business establishment, was not as radical as they had hoped.
"I'm voting for the lesser of two evils," said Teo Levín, 25, a medical student who explained that he was voting for Mr. Scioli with gritted teeth. "I understand that Scioli will adopt come conservative economic policies, but he won't destroy the political model. Macri will. He's the worst thing in the world."

Museum of the City of New York: 'The New York City Marathon: The Great Race' (through March 8) At the beginning of the month, more than 50,000 runners made their way through all five boroughs of New York, starting on Staten Island and ending in Central Park. This annual race -- a spectacle for anyone watching along the course -- began modestly in 1970, with 127 people running laps around Central Park. City Museum's timely exhibition tells the story of how the New York City Marathon became the world-class race it is today, including photos from amateurs and professionals on display. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, 212-534-1672, mcny.org.
Museum of the Moving Image: 'How Cats Took Over the Internet' (through Jan. 31) Even people who hate cats can't easily get through an hour of browsing online without coming across some kind of feline clickbait.

New York Hall of Science: 'Gingerbread Lane' (through Jan. 9) In recent years, the chef Jon Lovitch has worked every holiday season to break his own record for the world's largest gingerbread village. He locked in Guinness World Records in 2013 and 2014. He's back to do it again: 500 edible square feet with more than 1,050 houses and structures including a department store and a double-decker carousel. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, 718-699-0005, nysci.org; closed on Thanksgiving.
New-York Historical Society: 'Holiday Express: Toys and Trains From the Jerni Collection' (through Feb. 28) Toys of yore are on view in a mountainous landscape for trains and scene-setting trinkets pegged to the holiday season. This massive display also incorporates theatrical lighting and soundscapes, including a multimedia installation designed to make it feel like the museum's 77th Street entrance is in the midst of passing trains. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org.
New-York Historical Society: 'Superheroes in Gotham' (through Feb. 21) New York is safe as long as its long roster of comic-book heroes stick around. It's been this way for nearly a century as these characters have defended the city in books, TV shows, movies, video games -- even the Broadway stage. New-York Historical Society's latest exhibition tells the story of how super heroes became a cultural staple for all ages and media. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org.
New York Public Library: '100 Years of the Picture Collection: From Abacus to Zoology' (through May 15) The library celebrates the centennial of its Picture Collection with a sort of greatest-hits exhibition chosen from nearly 1.5 million images.

Subjects in the collection are organized alphabetically and number about 12,000. Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, 917-275-6975, nypl.org/locations/schwarzman; free; closed on Thanksgiving Day.
New York Transit Museum: 'Bringing Back the City' (continuing) This new exhibition comes three years after Hurricane Sandy took a swipe at the city's infrastructure. But what of the people who put the pieces back together? "Bringing Back the City" tells the stories of everyday services -- like electricity and mass transit -- that become extraordinary in times of crisis. Boerum Place, at Schermerhorn Street, Downtown Brooklyn, 718-694-1600, bringingbackthecity.com.
Rubin Museum of Art: 'Sacred Spaces' (continuing) This exhibition's premise is a question: What is a sacred space? It could be the museum's Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room, an immersive look at a traditional space for prayer and meditation. Or it could be a panoramic vista among the Himalayas. It could even be a video installation about Jain devotional rituals. All are on view in this exploration of veneration and its venues. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org.
'Sea Level: Five Boroughs at Water's Edge' (through Dec. 31) In its first pop-up exhibition for the Seaport Culture District, the American Institute of Architects presents a water's eye view of the city through photos by Elizabeth Felicella and accompanying essays by Robert Sullivan. The panoramic view of New York starts at New York Harbor and makes its way along the East River, showing the shore of each borough along the way. Center @ the Seaport, 181 Front Street, South Street Seaport, Lower Manhattan, 212-683-0023, cfa.aiany.org.
Trinity Wall Street: 'Blood Mirror' (through Dec. 1) After decades of banning gay and bisexual men from donating blood, the Food and Drug Administration updated its policy earlier this year to allow them to donate, but only after a year of celibacy, regardless of marital status. In response, the artist Jordan Eagles has gathered nine gay, bisexual and transgender men to donate a pint of blood each for this exhibit: a reflective, 7-foot-tall monolith that cases and preserves their blood in resin. Among the donors is the Rev. John Moody, who has been involved with Trinity for more than 40 years. Broadway at Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, 212-602-0800, trinitywallstreet.org/bloodmirror; free.

Spoken Word
Louis Begley (Tuesday) Mr. Begley -- the author, lawyer and member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters -- discusses his latest novel, "Killer, Come Hither," which was released in April. He is known as a thriller-minded observer of New York's upper crust. His new book follows that tradition, with an international twist: scenes in Sag Harbor and the rural western plains of Brazil in a search to solve a mysterious death. At 8 p.m. , National Arts Club, 15 Gramercy Park South, between Park Avenue South and Irving Place, Gramercy Park, 212-475-3424, nationalartsclub.org; free.
Rick Moody (Tuesday) "Hotels of North America," Mr. Moody's latest novel, is "a close examination of the middle-aged American male in sexual, emotional and financial free fall," the critic Dwight Garner wrote in The New York Times. The author, most famous for "The Ice Storm" (1994), will read from and discuss the new book, written as a series of fictional reviews.

For his next trick, he has written a children's book -- but, as the title "The Book With No Pictures" suggests, with no art. The point is to read the book aloud, as Mr. Novak will, which makes for a silly experience when parents inevitably come across words like "glibbity globbity." At 2 p.m., Strand Book Store, 828 Broadway, at 12th Street, 212-473-1452, strandbooks.com.
Walking Tours

At 1:30 p.m., 212-209-3370, bqetours.com.
Bushwick Brooklyn Gallery Tour (Saturday) Bushwick's art galleries are more scattered than, say, those in West Chelsea. But its exhibition spaces are growing in number as well as in prominence. Among the stops on this survey of seven of them is a Moroccan artist's video-sculpture hybrids and a talk with the artist Linda Griggs. At 2 p.m., beginning at 260 Johnson Avenue, near Bushwick Place, Williambsurg, Brooklyn, 212-946-1548, nygallerytours.com.

This three-mile tour, led by Angel Hernandez of the Bronx County Historical Society, covers the areas the author explored in his strolls from his cottage to the bridge. The tour meets at 11 a.m. at his home in Poe Park, at Grand Concourse and East Kingsbridge Road, Fordham Manor, Bronx, 718-881-8900, bronxhistoricalsociety.org.

Little Ireland, Chinatown and Little Italy History and Tasting Tour (Saturday) Think of this tour as an amuse-bouche for Thanksgiving, as well as a celebration of the cuisine brought to New York by immigrants who settled on the Lower East Side. The stops include tastings (of the likes of cannoli, spring rolls and dumplings) and landmarks like the site of Five Points. At 2 p.m. The meeting location is available upon making reservations, which can be arranged by calling NYC Discovery Walking Tours at 212-465-3331.
Save the Village (Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday) Last year the Steven Kasher Gallery in Chelsea put on an exhibition with the photography of Fred W. McDarrah, who documented the changing scene of Greenwich Village since the 1960s. Now, the spirit of that show has taken the form of this walking tour, which includes stops at the places McDarrah captured on film: locales like Washington Square Park and the Stonewall Inn. At 10 a.m.; the tour meets at Christopher Park, Stonewall Place, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, savethevillagetours.com.
A Taste of Jewish New York: Borough Park Tour (Sunday) Participants in this tour will get an insider's look at the customs of the Hasidic residents of Borough Park, Brooklyn. Highlights include a stop at a lively shopping area and the chance to try a variety of traditional foods. Modest attire is requested -- no shorts, low necklines or sleeveless clothing. The tour meets at 9:10 a.m. at Fort Hamilton Parkway and 44th Street; 718-339-2302, timelinetouring.com.
Union Square: Crossroads of New York (Saturday) Sponsored by the Union Square Partnership, this free year-round tour focuses on the area's political and social histories. The walk, led by guides from Big Onion Walking Tours, meets at 2 p.m. by the statue of Lincoln in Union Square Park, near the 16th Street transverse. 212-517-1826, unionsquarenyc.org.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, setting aside its habitual reticence, is issuing increasingly explicit warnings that it is likely to start raising its benchmark interest rate in December.
Most Fed officials say they think the economy will be ready for higher rates by year's end, the Fed revealed on Wednesday in an official account of its October policy-making meeting.
"While no decision had been made, it may well become appropriate to initiate the normalization process at the next meeting," the October meeting minutes said in the latest signal of the Fed's intentions.
The account cautioned that the Fed might still be deterred by "unanticipated shocks" or disappointing economic data, but such warnings sound increasingly pro forma. After the strong October jobs report, investors and analysts are convinced that a rate increase is imminent. Borrowing costs are rising, and Fed officials are encouraging the solidification of expectations.
"I am comfortable with moving off zero soon, conditioned on no marked deterioration in economic conditions," Dennis P. Lockhart, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president and a reliable monetary policy bellwether, said on Wednesday at a conference in New York.
The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008 as the major element in its campaign to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. By raising interest rates, it will reduce that encouragement, although Fed officials have emphasized that they plan to raise rates gradually because the economy remains relatively weak.
"We continue to expect a December liftoff," Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Bank, wrote in an analysis after the release of the minutes on Wednesday. "Having said that, we expect the Fed to increasingly emphasize the gradual, or even glacial, pace of hikes thereafter, likely assuaging fears and containing any unwarranted tightening in financial markets."
Fed officials at the October meeting expressed confidence in the health of the domestic economy despite disappointing job growth in August and September. The ranks of people unsuccessfully seeking work have gradually dwindled, and most Fed officials saw labor market conditions as nearly normal. Additionally, most continued to predict that inflation would rebound after several years of sluggishness.
"Participants were encouraged by the solid pace of consumption growth in the third quarter and generally expected consumer spending to rise moderately going forward," the account said.
It also noted that markets had settled after a period of volatility that contributed to the Fed's decision not to raise rates in September. "The U.S. financial system appeared to have weathered the turbulence in global financial markets without any sign of systemic stress," it said.
The Fed said in a statement after the October meeting that it would consider raising rates in December. Since then, the data has remained strong -- including the reported addition of 271,000 jobs in October -- and Fed officials have sounded increasingly confident.
The minutes published on Wednesday appeared to have little impact on financial markets, which in recent weeks had already raised the odds of a December rate increase to about 66 percent.
William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who has emphasized the importance of preparing financial markets for liftoff, said on Wednesday before the publication of the minutes that it appeared investors were ready for the Fed to start raising rates.
"The good news is that this is probably the most well-advertised, discussed, thought-about, mused-over prospect of beginning a normalization of monetary policy in history," said Mr. Dudley, who spoke at the same conference as Mr. Lockhart. "I'm not looking for a big reaction."
Some officials still argued at the Fed's October meeting that it was too soon to start raising rates. Their case focused less on current conditions than on the risk the economy would suffer a setback.
These officials warned that a global downturn could cause "a potential loss of momentum in the economy and the associated possibility that inflation might fail to increase as expected."
Others Fed officials, however, counseled against delay. They argued that the Fed would only confuse financial markets by delaying, and it risked undermining economic confidence.

Market Rallies on Rate Hints From Fed

Abstract: A string of rate increases can eventually weigh on stock markets, but investors have mostly become prepared for the Fed to act next month and do not anticipate that an initial rate increase will derail the bull market.

Full text:   Stocks in the United States recorded their best day in nearly four weeks on Wednesday as investors welcomed new hints pointing to an increase in interest rates in the coming weeks. Traders were also encouraged by more corporate deal news.
The rally pushed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index back into positive territory for the year.
ConAgra Foods jumped 4 percent on news the company is spinning off its frozen potatoes business. Railroad operator Norfolk Southern rose 6.4 percent after receiving an unsolicited takeover offer from Canadian Pacific.
Stocks in financial companies, which tend to benefit from rising interest rates, were among the biggest gainers, after traders digested the minutes from the October policy meeting of the Federal Reserve. The minutes showed that central bank officials believed that the economy could improve enough to justify a rate increase at the central bank's meeting next month.
"The market today is just reinforcing the view that most likely the Fed is going to move in December, and that's not necessarily a bad thing for either the economy" or the stock market, said Jeremy Zirin, chief equities strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 247.66 points, or 1.4 percent, to 17,737.16. The S.&P. 500 index gained 33.14 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,083.58 -- its best gain since Oct. 22. The Nasdaq added 89.19 points, or 1.8 percent, to 5,075.20.
The Fed meeting minutes showed that Fed officials believed the job market in the United States would continue to improve and that inflation would begin to move toward their 2 percent annual target by the time the group meets next month. They also took note of the American economy's resilience through a summer of financial market turbulence and felt that global threats had "diminished."
The Fed has kept its benchmark for short-term rates near zero since late 2008. A string of rate increases can eventually weigh on stock markets, but investors have mostly become prepared for the Fed to act next month and do not anticipate that an initial rate increase will derail the bull market.
Major stock indexes headed higher as trading began early Wednesday and maintained the momentum throughout the day.
The government's latest tally of home construction in the United States didn't slow the rally, despite delivering news that builders had broken ground on fewer houses and apartments in October.
Investors began bidding up shares in ConAgra and Norfolk Southern early on. ConAgra added $1.57, to $40.93, while Norfolk Southern rose $5.52, to $92.49.
All 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 rose, led by health care stocks, which rose 2 percent. The sector is up 5.1 percent this year. Financial stocks rose 1.8 percent; the sector is down 0.8 percent for the year.
Among individual bank stocks, JPMorgan Chase gained $1.32, or 2 percent, to $67.45, and Bank of America climbed 42 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $17.84.
Not all stocks had a good day.
Target slumped 4.3 percent after the retailer reported that its sales at established locations had increased in the third quarter at a slower rate than in the previous quarter. The stock shed $3.13, to $69.78.
Citrix Systems slid 10 percent on news that the computing company will slash about 1,000 jobs and spin off its GoToMeeting business into a separate company as it seeks to cut costs. The stock fell $7.88, or 10 percent, to $70.54.
The DAX in Germany dipped 0.1 percent, while the CAC-40 in France lost 0.6 percent. The British FTSE 100 edged up 0.2 percent.
Benchmark United States crude rose 24 cents to close at $41.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It briefly dipped below $40 a barrel for the first time since August. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 57 cents to close at $44.14 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline rose 2.8 cents, to $1.266 a gallon, heating oil rose 1.2 cents, to $1.38 a gallon, and natural gas fell 2.4 cents, to $2.347 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Precious and industrial metals prices were mixed. Gold rose 10 cents, to $1,068.70 an ounce, silver declined 9 cents, to $14.08 an ounce, and copper lost 3 cents, to close at $2.08 a pound.
Government bond prices held steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed at 2.27 percent. The dollar edged up to 123.52 yen from Tuesday's 123.38 yen.

Stocks Little Changed After a Late Slump

Publication info: New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]18 Nov 2015: B.2.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1733832076?accountid=11752

Abstract: The small increase in inflation could make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will begin raising short-term interest rates from historical lows next month, said David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management. "Historically, hiking interest rates would not be good for the stock market, but at this point it's a psychological boost that the economy is self-sustaining enough that the Fed could get off the zero interest rate policy," Mr. Chalupnik said.

Full text:   Stocks ended little changed on Tuesday after a late-afternoon slump wiped out much of the day's gains.
Investors weighed mixed results from Walmart, Home Depot and other big American retailers, and new data on inflation. Energy stocks were among the biggest decliners as oil prices closed lower.
"You saw oil prices come down, and the market has been following oil prices," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "The market moved up handsomely yesterday, so we're not losing all of the gains."
The Dow Jones industrial average added 6.49 points, or 0.04 percent, to close at 17,489.50. Earlier Tuesday, it was up more than 116 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,050.44, after briefly moving into positive territory for the year. The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.40 points, or 0.03 percent, to 4,986.02.
Major stock indexes wavered for much of the morning as investors sorted through the latest company earnings and economic reports. Traders pushed stocks higher by noon and for much of the afternoon until the final hour of trading, when the rally evaporated.
Investors, who have been worried that sales could be weak this holiday season, sold retailers that reported disappointing quarterly results.
Urban Outfitters fell 3.8 percent after its latest quarterly sales fell short. The stock dropped 87 cents to $21.80. Dick's Sporting Goods slumped 9.4 percent after reporting worse-than-expected results and giving a weak outlook. The stock fell $3.85 to $36.96.
Other big retailers fared better.
Walmart shares rose 3.5 percent after the company reported improved customer traffic and an increase in an important sales figure for the third quarter, even as a stronger dollar hurt its performance overseas. The company, the world's largest retailer, also issued a forecast for the holiday shopping season that largely beat Wall Street expectations. The stock rose $2.05 to $59.92.
Stock in Home Depot climbed 4.4 percent after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue, and delivered an upbeat fiscal outlook. The stock rose $5.34 to $126.18.
Traders also watched economic reports. The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in October after falling in August and September.
The small increase in inflation could make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will begin raising short-term interest rates from historical lows next month, said David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management.
"Historically, hiking interest rates would not be good for the stock market, but at this point it's a psychological boost that the economy is self-sustaining enough that the Fed could get off the zero interest rate policy," Mr. Chalupnik said.
The energy sector shed 1.2 percent, extending its losses this year to 15.9 percent. The sector, which is the S.&P. 500 index's biggest decliner for the year, has been hurt by the protracted slide in oil prices.
That decline resumed on Tuesday. Benchmark United States crude oil dropped $1.08 to settle at $41.71 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 99 cents to $43.57 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.238 a gallon, heating oil fell 1.7 cents to $1.368 a gallon and natural gas fell 1.4 cents to $2.371 per 1,000 cubic feet.
European indexes moved higher, partly because of a report showing that business optimism in Germany rose more than analysts had expected this month, thanks to strong domestic demand and a weaker euro. Germany's DAX rose 2.4 percent, while France's CAC 40 jumped 2.8 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 2 percent.
Gold fell $15 to $1,068.70 an ounce, silver declined 5 cents to $14.17 an ounce and copper gave up 1 cent to close at $2.10 a pound.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.27 percent, unchanged from Monday. The dollar rose to 123.38 yen from 123.17 yen, while the euro fell to $1.0645 from $1.0683.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices in the United States increased in October after two consecutive months of declines, as the cost of health care and other services rose. The economic outlook also received a lift from other data on Tuesday showing a fairly solid increase in manufacturing output in October.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month, reversing a 0.2 percent drop in September. In the 12 months through October, the index advanced 0.2 percent; it was unchanged in September.
Signs of stabilization in prices after a recent downturn are likely to be welcomed by Federal Reserve officials and give them some confidence that inflation will gradually move toward the central bank's 2 percent target.
A report from the Fed showed that manufacturing production increased 0.4 percent as the output of long-lasting and nondurable goods rose. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the American economy, declined in August and September. Manufacturers have been hobbled by a strong dollar, spending cuts by energy companies and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut.
Further declines in mining output and a weather-related drop in utilities production weighed on overall industrial production last month. Still, the increase in manufacturing output was another indication that economic growth would accelerate in the fourth quarter after braking to a 1.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter.
"The healthy rise in manufacturing sector production is a welcome sign that the headwinds to this sector are beginning to ease," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. "The outlook for the industrial sector is becoming incrementally more favorable."
In October, the so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, gained 0.2 percent after a similar rise the previous month. Rents and medical costs accounted for much of the increase in the core index last month. The rental index increased 0.3 percent after rising 0.4 percent in September. Medical care costs rose 0.7 percent, the largest increase since April.
In the 12 months through October, the core C.P.I. increased 1.9 percent after rising by the same margin in September.
The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, which is running below the core C.P.I. The dollar's 18 percent rise against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014 has made imports like apparel and automobiles less expensive. Inflation could get a lift next year as the weak readings from late 2014 and this year drop out of the calculation.
Energy prices, including gasoline and electricity, rose last month. While food prices rose marginally, four of the six major grocery store food group indexes increased, with cereals and bakery products posting the largest increase since August 2011.
Hospital costs increased 2 percent in October and airline fares rose 1.5 percent, ending a string of three consecutive declines.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   PARIS -- The Christmas market and festive lights had just gone up on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, and merchants were hoping for a strong retail season, when the weekend's brutal terrorist attacks cast a pall on Paris.
On Monday, a gray and windy day here, there was not the usual long line outside the Abercrombie & Fitch store. Instead a guard beckoned in the occasional customer. Nearby, dozens of stalls in the Christmas market remained closed by official order, leaving the small merchants unable to sell their spiced wine, beer and sausages, or wares like clothes and ornaments.
Though holiday shopping might seem a minor consideration compared with the loss of life, activity in the coming days on the French capital's most famous shopping street could be an indicator of whether the attacks have dealt a blow to the city's commerce and the country's effort to achieve a sustained economic recovery.
European leaders, along with President Obama, have identified the threat from the Islamic State group as broader than a French risk, raising concern of a wider economic impact if fear keeps people from wanting to travel or to gather in holiday crowds. It is already a bad time for the eurozone economy, which has been plagued for years by slow growth and high unemployment.
How lasting the effect will be on the Paris economy or beyond, once the initial shock has faded, is difficult to predict. Typically, economists say, the commercial impact of terrorist attacks tends to be minor and temporary. That was the case after attacks in London in 2005, in Madrid in 2004, and even in New York in 2001.
"So probably we'll see the same in France," said Philippe Waechter, research director at Natixis Asset Management. "Maybe in the first few weeks, when you go to shopping malls and things like that, maybe we'll find that people are a little shy," he said. "But after that, people will go through a sort of normalization."
Yet, because this is also the start of what is traditionally a significant tourist season for Paris and other parts of France and Europe, much will depend not only on local psychology but also on the willingness of visitors to set worries aside.
"If people don't come, if the tourists are too scared, there will be big economic repercussions for everyone," said a Frenchwoman named Mauricette, who declined to give her last name as she directed workmen repairing her shuttered stall in the Christmas market. "At this point, I'm just hoping to cover my costs, never mind making a profit."
In the short term, the terrorism in Paris has chilled consumer spending in the French capital, essentially shutting down much of the city's retail business for most of the weekend. Disneyland Paris remained closed and was not set to reopen until Wednesday. The Louvre and the Eiffel Tower reopened to the public Monday afternoon after being closed for two days because of security measures.
Several concerts scheduled to take place in Paris were canceled after terrorists stormed the Bataclan concert hall and slaughtered 89 people who were listening to a rock band. Performances by the bands Marilyn Manson and Papa Roach scheduled for Monday night were called off, and the musician Prince suspended his planned European tour and a Paris concert in December. Producers have also temporarily halted performances of a French comedy musical, "Résiste."
On Monday, the French culture minister, Fleur Pellerin, announced plans for a special government fund to help theaters cope with financial losses stemming from the impact of the terrorist attacks and the costs of increased security.
"Everything will be done so that music remains alive in our country," Ms. Pellerin said. "Culture is our greatest shield, and our artists are our best weapon."
Although European stock markets opened lower on Monday, led down by the main French index, the CAC 40 in Paris, by late afternoon, the European indexes were all flat or in slightly positive territory.
French companies catering to travel and tourism were taking a hit, though. Shares of Air France-KLM were down about 6 percent through the late afternoon, and the French group AccorHotel's stock was off by more than 5 percent.
Luxury-hotel executives and a French trade association of hotels and restaurants on Monday reported a wave of reservation cancellations. The Regional Tourism Committee for Paris announced a plan to convene a conference on Wednesday to assess the potential economic impact with representatives from museums, hotels, amusement parks and department stores.
Worried about a drop in customers, a trade union of hotels and restaurants is calling on Parisians to head to their neighborhood haunts Tuesday night to observe a minute of silence for the victims and then to support local merchants with a campaign called "Tous au Bistrot!" -- meaning "everybody to the bistro!"
Tourism represents about 8 percent of the French economy. If fear of additional attacks keeps foreign visitors away and makes households reluctant to spend, those sectors and the tens of thousands of jobs related to them will suffer.
On Monday, the European Union's statistics agency said that the annual rate of inflation in the eurozone in October was 0.1 percent, a sign of a weak economy -- even if the number was higher than in September, when consumer prices fell at an annual rate of 0.1 percent.
In terms of growth, the eurozone economy expanded at a meager annual rate of 1.2 percent during the third quarter, and total economic output is still lower than it was in 2007, before the beginning of the financial crisis.
Expectations that the European Central Bank will step up its stimulus to the eurozone economy when it meets next month have been further solidified by the Paris attacks.
"It compounds all the problems that we were already facing," Vitor Constâncio, vice president of the European Central Bank, said on Monday after a speech in Frankfurt. The attacks could have a psychological effect, he said, adding that would depend on any further consequences.
It might be too much to expect François Hollande, the French president, to mimic former President George W. Bush, who after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States famously called on Americans to "go out shopping more." But Mr. Waechter, at Natixis Asset Management, predicted that Parisians, who have been living with the risk of terrorist attacks since at least the 1980s, would prove as resilient as New Yorkers.
Paris has been hit by two murderous rampages this year. The first was a series of attacks in January, with the assault on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which had mocked Islam along with most other religions; the killing of a police officer in a Paris suburb; and an assault on a Jewish kosher supermarket. Vicious and hate-fueled as those assaults were, with attackers killing 17 people, they might nonetheless have left many Parisians feeling that they were not targets.
The weekend attacks, though, killing more than 100, seemed aimed at making no one feel safe anywhere -- at a sporting event, at a rock concert, at a cafe. That factor could make the near-term consumer psychology harder to predict, not only in Paris, but also across Europe.
One barometer may be the outdoor Christmas markets, a tradition throughout Europe. Such markets in German cities like Nuremberg and Dresden, which have two of the oldest, attract huge crowds to drink mulled wine or browse among stands selling items like wooden tree ornaments or handmade mittens.
The markets have been threatened by terrorists in the past but still drew crowds, said Werner Hammerschmidt, executive director of a group that represents businesses that sell food and gifts at Christmas markets.
"There have been threats for years," Mr. Hammerschmidt said. "People have shown they won't let their lives be influenced by terrorists. I suspect that will be the case this time."
At least one French celebrity, the singer Shy'm, insisted this week that the show must go on. She has concerts scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday nights in Paris, at the AccorHotels Arena, an indoor sports venue and concert hall. The hall is in the 12th arrondissement, not far from where at least five of Friday night's attacks took place and where the Charlie Hebdo massacre occurred in January.
"After much reflection, doubt and fear, but above all a powerful and profound need to respond, to respond to fear, I decided to go on stage," she wrote in a post on her Facebook page on Sunday evening. "What has happened to France and humanity is unspeakable and unbearable, but it is out of the question to hole up and stay silent."

Abstract: Beginning in the early 1970s, as a professor at Columbia Law School, its first tenured woman, and as a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project, she successfully argued five cases before the Supreme Court, focusing on laws and government policies built on gender stereotypes. Justice Ginsburg was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1980.

Full text:   The room went still when the women hugged. All of the staff, bustling in preparation just moments before, paused when Ruth Bader Ginsburg emerged quietly from her private chambers at the Supreme Court last month and embraced her old friend Gloria Steinem.
And just as quickly, life resumed. Justice Ginsburg, 82, led Ms. Steinem, 81, into her wood-paneled chambers, with its stately traditional furniture and blue-chip modern art by Mark Rothko and Josef Albers (on loan from the National Gallery of Art and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden). "What a magical place, Ruth," Ms. Steinem said.
Justice Ginsburg gestured to an immaculately set table in the corner, tucked beside shelves of mementos and personal photographs -- including one of the two women together. She offered tea, cookies and chocolates she had brought back from a recent trip to Zurich.
These women have a history. Long before she was crowned "Notorious R.B.G." -- a nod to the tough-guy rapper Notorious B.I.G. -- for her fierce intellect, Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazing litigator for women's rights. Beginning in the early 1970s, as a professor at Columbia Law School, its first tenured woman, and as a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project, she successfully argued five cases before the Supreme Court, focusing on laws and government policies built on gender stereotypes.
At about the same time, Ms. Steinem founded Ms. magazine with some feminist colleagues, after a decade as a journalist in which she tried, and mostly failed, by her account, to interest editors in serious articles on women's rights. Still, she published seminal articles, like one detailing her stint as a Playboy bunny to highlight the sexist treatment of women at Playboy Clubs, and a pioneering work in 1969, "After Black Power, Women's Liberation."
Justice Ginsburg was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1980. In 1993, President Bill Clinton elevated her to the Supreme Court, making her the court's second female justice, following Sandra Day O'Connor. (Justice Ginsburg is the subject of a tribute biography, "Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg," by Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik.)
Meanwhile, Ms. Steinem was an editor at Ms. for nearly 20 years, becoming the public face of the women's movement. (She continues at the magazine as an adviser.) She has traveled extensively, speaking out for women's and human rights, winning numerous awards for her work in media and advocacy, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. Her new book, "My Life on the Road," was published last month.
For nearly 90 minutes, the old friends reminisced about their parallel careers and experiences as women, and the work that has made them part of history.
Philip Galanes: Let's start with a glaring inequity. Only one of you has a rap name.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I like the way mine began. A second-year law student at N.Y.U. was outraged by the court's decision in the voting rights case. But instead of just venting her anger, she took up my dissent.
PG: Happily, there are rap-name generators online.
Gloria Steinem: They have those?
PG: Yours, if you want it, is GlowStick.
GS: We may need to work on that.
PG: Rap names aside, your careers unfolded side by side at the forefront of the women's movement. When did you meet?
GS: When Ruth was at the A.C.L.U. What comes to mind are these cases in which young African-American women were being sterilized without their permission.
RBG: There was an irony. We couldn't get abortions. But there was this notorious obstetrician, and if it was a woman's third child, he would automatically sterilize her.
GS: The A.C.L.U. would not have taken up that case if it hadn't been for Ruth.
PG: Were you a Ms. reader?
RBG: I certainly was. From the first issue. I thought it was wonderful.
GS: And I knew from other women that Ruth was our champion and teacher.
PG: When you were young, women couldn't rent apartments or get credit cards without men. Did you buy into that?
RBG: Gloria went to Smith; I went to Cornell. It was the school for parents who wanted to make sure their girl would find a man. Four guys for every woman. If you came out without a husband, you were hopeless.
PG: Was Smith more enlightened in the early '50s?
GS: It was a women's college, but the emphasis was on marriage. Even the Smith president of the era said, "We are educating women because to have educated children, we must have educated mothers." The idea that women would do something other than produce children was not out there.
PG: Time for galling stories: Will you tell us more about that dinner of brand-new Harvard law women, when the dean invited all nine of you, from a class of 500, and asked, "How do you justify taking a spot from a qualified man?"
RBG: I was so embarrassed. The dean had each of the women escorted by a distinguished professor. Mine looked more like God than any man I ever met. He was also a chain smoker, so we were sharing an ashtray on my lap. When I stood to speak, the cigarette butts fell on the living-room floor. But I gave him the answer he expected: "My husband is a second-year law student, and it's important for a woman to understand her husband's work."
PG: Did you really think that?
RBG: Of course not!
GS: That's called "Aunt Tom-ing," I think.
RBG: The only thing that really bothered me is they had given me a generous scholarship. We had to take two years off when [my husband] Marty was in the service. And when I applied for readmission, they said, "Submit your father-in-law's financial statement."
GS: You can't make this up.
RBG: They shouldn't give scholarship funds to a person with family money, but you can be sure they never asked a guy to submit his father-in-law's statement.
GS: Or his mother-in-law's.
PG: Now, Gloria's turn: Early in your career, you're sitting in the back of a cab, between Gay Talese and Saul Bellow, and Gay says: "Every year a pretty girl comes to New York and pretends to be a writer. This year, it's Gloria." Any desire to push him out the door?
GS: I had just interviewed Saul Bellow in Chicago, but it wasn't published yet. My first response was, "Oh, he's going to be regretful that he gave an interview to someone who's not really a writer." It wasn't until we were out of the taxi that I got angry. And it wasn't until years later that I got really angry.
PG: But your first thought was to doubt yourself.
GS: And in a weird way, to be fair to Gay Talese, he thought it was a compliment. He didn't see that I wanted to be a serious writer.
PG: Let's take a step back to your mothers, very different women. R.B.G.'s pushes her; Gloria's is seriously depressed. Yet these different women raised such independent daughters.
GS: Perhaps we were living out the unlived lives of our mothers. Mine wanted to be a writer and was a journalist long before I was born. First as a reporter, then an editor at a Toledo newspaper.
RBG: My mother was a powerful influence. She made me toe the line. If I didn't have a perfect report card, she showed her disappointment.
PG: Had she been a "perfect report card" kind of girl?
RBG: She told a story about bringing home a report card with all A's to her father. But it didn't mean anything. She was a girl. My mother graduated from high school at 15 and went to work to support the family because the eldest son went to college.
GS: So you were receiving her dreams. She was saying the opposite to you: not that your report card didn't count, but that it did.
RBG: She wanted me to be independent. And what she meant was becoming a high school history teacher because she never dreamed there would be other opportunities.
PG: Did you?
RBG: Not at the time.
PG: Choosing law and political reporting was uncommon for women in the '50s. Did you have mentors helping you?
GS: In a word, no. For me, writing was a way of staying invisible because I felt invisible, only a little seen through words. I didn't yet have the courage to speak up.
PG: Was your family supportive?
GS: My mother worried about me economically. But my father had inadvertently prepared me well to be a freelance writer by being such a free spirit and never having a regular job.
RBG: My mother was dead by then, and my father was very worried because he couldn't support me. Then I married Marty the month I graduated from college, and it was all fine. I could go off to law school. If nobody hired me, I had a man to support me.
PG: Weirdly, he was right. No one hired the woman who graduated No. 1 in her class.
RBG: There were many firms who put up sign-up sheets that said, "Men Only." And I had three strikes against me. First, I was Jewish, and the Wall Street firms were just beginning to accept Jews. Then I was a woman. But the killer was my daughter Jane, who was 4 by then.
PG: They didn't even hide why they were rejecting you?
GS: No. I tried to get a much less prestigious job, at Time magazine. And they made it very clear that women researched, and men wrote. No exceptions, in spite of Clare Boothe Luce.
PG: You remind me of my grandmother's line: Rejection is the best thing that can happen. It pushes us. There might not be a Ms. magazine or Notorious R.B.G. without it.
GS: But there might not be a need for a woman's magazine, and there might be a court that actually looks like the country. There's no virtue in injustice.
RBG: Justice O'Connor once said: "Suppose there had been no discrimination when we finished law school. We'd be retired partners from large law firms today." She got her first job working for free for a county attorney, and she was very high in her class at Stanford.
GS: The great thing about obstacles is that they cause you to identify with other groups of people who are facing obstacles.
PG: When did you start thinking seriously about women's equality?
RBG: When I was working on a book about civil procedure in Sweden, in 1962 and '63.
GS: For which she learned Swedish. Is that not incredible?
RBG: Between 20 and 25 percent of the law students in Sweden were women. And there were women on the bench. I went to one proceeding in Stockholm where the presiding judge was eight months pregnant. There was also a journalist who wrote a column in the Swedish daily paper: "Why should women have two jobs, and men only one?" Inflation was high, and two incomes were often needed. But it was the woman who was expected to buy the kids new shoes and have dinner on the table at 7. I remember listening to those conversations. It was that same summer I read "The Second Sex."
GS: For me, an important point came when I was living in India, because of the Gandhian movement and the role of women in it. But I was slow to see how it applied here. I couldn't quite bridge that gap until the late '60s.
PG: How did people respond when you first raised concerns about equality for women?
GS: They were either disinterested or said it was impossible. My classic experience was an editor who said, "O.K., you can publish an article saying women are equal." But right next to it, he would publish an article that said that they weren't -- to be objective.
RBG: The concern was that if a woman was doing gender equality, her chances of making it to tenure in the law school were diminished. It was considered frivolous.
GS: I remember covering a hearing in Albany about liberalizing the abortion laws. This was before Roe v. Wade. And they invited to testify 14 men and one nun. A group of women said: "Wait a minute. Let's have our own testimony from women who had this experience." That was my epiphany. But when I wrote about it, my friends at New York magazine, good people, took me aside and said: "You've worked so hard to be taken seriously. Don't get involved with these crazy women."
RBG: The thing that disturbed me was when people would say: "What are those women doing? They're just riding the coattails of the civil rights movement." Yet this change was occurring all over the world, even in homogeneous places, like Sweden, where there were no racial differences. Of course, there was tremendous inspiration from the civil rights movement, and for me, particularly the way Thurgood Marshall led that campaign.
GS: It's important to say that the women's movement was disproportionately pioneered by black women. These are not two different movements; they are profoundly connected. If you are going to continue racism, you have to control reproduction. And that means controlling women. A group called Feminist.com made these baby bead bracelets. On one, they spell "Imagine," and on the other, they asked us to write what we want. I went with "Imagine" and "We are linked, not ranked."
RBG: It's a facet of the gay rights movement that people don't think about enough. Why suddenly marriage equality? Because it wasn't until 1981 that the court struck down Louisiana's "head and master rule," that the husband was head and master of the house. Marriage was a relationship between the dominant, breadwinning husband and the subordinate, child-rearing wife. What lesbian or gay man would want that?
GS: Exactly. Marriage had to change before it could apply to more equal relationships.
PG: What made you enter an institution like that?
RBG: Marty was an extraordinary man. He was so secure in himself that he never regarded me as any kind of threat. He was my biggest booster.
PG: And a brilliant tax lawyer.
RBG: We decided when we met -- I was 17, he was 18 -- that we were going to be together, whether it was in medicine ----
PG: Wait! You decided that you would go into the same profession?
RBG: Right. But Marty had a consuming interest in golf and played on the Cornell golf team. So medicine was out because chemistry labs were in the afternoon. For some reason, he wanted to go to Harvard, and the business school wasn't taking women. So that left law.
GS: It's such an important point for young people, who often think life has to be all planned out. It's not that way.
PG: Did you decide marriage wasn't for you?
GS: Absolutely not. I assumed I had to get married. Everybody did. If you didn't, you were crazy. But I kept putting it off: "I'm going to do it, but not right now." Until I was in my late 30s and the women's movement came along, and I realized: I'm happy. Not everyone has to live the same way.
RBG: I just read Anne-Marie Slaughter's book. She talked about "we don't have it all." Who does? I've had it all in the course of my life, but at different times.
GS: And the implication for women having it all is doing it all. But you can't. We're still far away from the idea of truly shared parenting.
PG: One of the cleverest things you did as a litigator was demonstrate how rigid gender roles harm men as much as women.
RBG: There was an interesting case this court decided in the first year Justice O'Connor was on the bench, about a man who wanted to go to the best nursing school in his area, but it was women-only. You could read between the lines what she understood: There was no better way to raise pay for women in nursing than to get men to do it.
GS: Equal pay for women would be the biggest economic stimulus this country could ever have. Big-time profits are being made from gender roles as they exist. It would also be win-win because female-headed households are where children are most likely to be poor.
PG: Last subject: You are both bridge builders. Justice Ginsburg on the court; and Gloria, with a sea of men and women over the years. Any advice for getting along with people who disagree with us to the core -- like Justice Scalia?
RBG: Last night, my daughter and I got a prize from a women's intellectual property group, and Nino [Scalia] was in the video, saying his nice things about me. He's a very funny man. We both love opera. And we care about writing. His style is spicy, but we care about how we say it.
GS: I think Ruth is better at getting along with people with whom we profoundly disagree. I feel invisible in their presence because I'm being treated as invisible. But what we want in the future will only happen if we do it every day. So, kindness matters enormously. And empathy. Finding some point of connection.
RBG: Sometimes not listening helps, too. Do you know about this opera "Scalia/Ginsburg" by a talented musician who went to law school? Scalia's opening aria is: "The Justices are blind. How can they possibly spout this? The Constitution says nothing about this." And I answer: "You are searching in vain for a bright-line solution for a problem that isn't so easy to solve. But the beautiful thing about our Constitution is that, like our society, it can evolve." Then she goes into a jazzy part. Let it grow.

Abstract: Concerns about retail sales and skidding commodities prices have eroded the gains from October's big stock market rally. The price of oil fell again after the International Energy Agency said commercial inventories reached almost three billion barrels at the end of September, a record.

Full text:   The stock market slumped to its second-biggest weekly loss of the year on Friday, breaking six consecutive weeks of gains. Fears that the holiday shopping season will be weak drove down retail stocks.
Retailers as varied as department stores and dollar stores plunged after Nordstrom posted disappointing third-quarter results, just as Macy's had done earlier this week.
The price of oil fell further on evidence that global supplies are still rising. The dollar could grow stronger still, further pressuring oil and other commodities and affecting mining and energy companies.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 202.83 points, or 1.2 percent, to 17,245.24. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 22.93 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,023.04. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 77.20 points, or 1.5 percent, to 4,927.88.
Concerns about retail sales and skidding commodities prices have eroded the gains from October's big stock market rally. Stocks have now lost ground seven of the last eight days. Over all, the S.&P. 500 is down almost 2 percent for the year.
Nordstrom's shares sank $9.51, or 15 percent, to $53.96 after reporting weaker sales. The company also cut its forecast for the year. Macy's did the same on Wednesday.
Holiday shopping will unofficially begin on Black Friday in two weeks, and investors are becoming worried that the latest reports are signaling that sales will be weak during the season, which is a crucial moneymaker for retailers. Macy's and Nordstrom each hit two-year lows on Friday. Consumer discretionary stocks were by far the worst performing group in the S.&P. 500.
J. C. Penney's results were about equal to analyst projections, but its stock lost $1.35, or 15.4 percent, to $7.44. The video game retailer GameStop sank $7.35, or 16.5 percent, to $37.18. The watchmaker Fossil Group plunged $18.62, or 36.5 percent, to $32.39. Fossil posted disappointing earnings on Thursday afternoon and also said it would buy the activity tracker maker Misfit for $260 million. Its shares hit their lowest level in five years.
Compounding those worries was a government report showing that United States retail spending rose just 0.1 percent in October, a bit less than analysts had expected. Prices charged by farmers, manufacturers and other producers fell in October. The figures show there is little sign of inflation in the United States economy. When inflation is higher, consumers have an incentive to spend more money.
Richard Jaffe, a Stifel Nicolaus analyst, suggested the widespread selling was an overreaction. Shoppers will spend plenty of money this holiday season, he said, and while they're spending more money on smartphones and TVs and other big items than they used to, there will still be plenty of socks and sweaters given as gifts, too.
"Christmas is boxed gifts," Mr. Jaffe said. "There will be a lot of gift giving, a lot of apparel sales."
He noted that American shopping habits had changed a lot over the last few years. Consumers are spending more on homes, cars and vacations. Aging baby boomers don't buy clothes as often as they used to, and younger shoppers are more interested in technology.
The price of oil fell again after the International Energy Agency said commercial inventories reached almost three billion barrels at the end of September, a record.
The agency also said growth in global demand would slow next year. Oil prices have dropped because demand cannot keep up with ever-increasing supplies. The strong dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities costlier to buyers using yen, euro and other currencies.
United States crude oil slumped $1.02, or 2.4 percent, to $40.73 a barrel in New York. It has dropped about 13 percent this month and is at its lowest price since late August. Brent crude lost 45 cents, or 1 percent, to $43.61 a barrel in London.
Jim Ritterbusch of the oil trading firm Ritterbusch & Associates said crude could fall an additional $3 to $4 a barrel. It has gone as low as $37.75 this year.
In other energy trading, heating oil fell 2.5 cents to $1.381 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline dipped 3.4 cents to $1.239 a gallon. Natural gas rose 10.1 cents to $2.361 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The price of gold fell 10 cents to $1,080.90 an ounce. Silver fell for the 10th day in a row, losing 2.1 cents to $14.20 an ounce. Copper dipped slightly to just under $2.17 a pound. All three metals are at their lowest levels in six years.
The generic drug maker Mylan climbed after a long pursuit of the Irish drug maker Perrigo came to an end. Perrigo's shareholders rejected a $26 billion offer from Mylan, an offer Perrigo had called inadequate. Mylan logged the biggest gain on the S.&P. 500, adding $5.58, or 12.9 percent, to $48.78. Perrigo fell $9.65, or 6.2 percent, to $146.90.
United States government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.28 percent from 2.31 percent.

Abstract: Chris Brightman, a financial adviser at Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., highlighted in a recent report how cheap emerging markets are relative to others and to their own history. The latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of global fund managers found them to be shunning emerging markets more than any other asset class, relative to their average allocation.

Full text:   There are times when a cautious investor can take risks that a rough-and-ready speculator cannot.
When the price of an asset has plunged so far, so fast that it seems to get cheaper by the day, it can be imprudent for a short-term trader to bet that the trend will change. An investor planning for the long haul can be confident, however, that what seems like a bargain will pay off eventually.
Certain depressed assets -- notably stocks in emerging markets or those related to energy and other commodities, or the commodities themselves -- fit the bill, investment advisers say. They could offer excellent returns in coming years, even if they are risky propositions in coming weeks.
"Valuation is a very important consideration for long-term returns, but it's a terrible mechanism to time when to buy and sell things," said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at the fund-management firm BlackRock. He finds good values available but advises, "Don't kid yourself that you're going to get in at the low."
Among the beaten-down groups of investments, Mr. Koesterich prefers emerging markets. "It's a universally hated asset class" that "has underperformed for years," he said.
He cautioned that while emerging markets in general are cheap, there is great variation in prospects among individual countries. The best long-term bets, in his view, include India and Mexico.
Chris Brightman, a financial adviser at Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., highlighted in a recent report how cheap emerging markets are relative to others and to their own history. They were trading at less than half the valuation of American stocks, based on a measure that compares prices with an average of companies' long-term earnings, a way to compensate for business-cycle fluctuations, and at less than 60 percent of their own average valuation over the last 20 years.
The discrepancies have led him to calculate that emerging markets will return 7.9 percent a year for the next decade, net of inflation, compared with 1.1 percent for their American counterparts. He makes no claim about any shorter horizon.
"Speculators in equities ask how I can be sure that equity prices in emerging markets will rise more than equity prices in the United States over the coming year," Mr. Brightman wrote. "I respond that I have no clue about the prospects for short-term price changes. I am not speculating on price changes, I explain. I am investing to build long-term wealth."
On Wall Street, by contrast, analysts and money managers are judged on how well they do in a given year or even quarter. That can cause people to overemphasize the importance of recent performance when judging prospective investments. As strategists at HSBC note, recent history in developing markets is unpleasant.
The developing world "appears to have inherited a bad legacy from the developed world, namely low growth and high debt," they said in a report last month. They go on to say that the "bleak fundamental outlook makes us remain cautious" and that "current valuations offer only limited opportunities on a very selective basis."
HSBC recommends owning stocks in China, India, Mexico and Taiwan and avoiding Brazil, Malaysia, South Africa and Thailand.
The HSBC strategists are not alone in their disdain. The latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of global fund managers found them to be shunning emerging markets more than any other asset class, relative to their average allocation.
Energy ranks a close second. Oil is trading at roughly half its price in the summer of 2014. Natural gas and other energy commodities have been pounded too, as have the stocks of companies that produce them.
James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, expects that to change. Weak commodity prices will stimulate economic growth, he predicts, raising risks of inflation and higher interest rates. That, in turn, should lead commodity prices to recover, helping shares of commodity producers at the expense of those of consumer-oriented businesses as well as the broad market.
"I think leadership is going to change," he predicted. There has been "a massive tax cut in the form of a halving of commodity prices. Long term, that is hugely stimulative because 95 percent of the world is commodity consumers, not producers."
Anticipating a recovery in commodities, he encouraged investors essentially to focus on the other 5 percent by buying stocks in economies where commodity production plays a big role, such as Canada and Australia. Foreign markets are generally cheap and so are commodities, so investments that can benefit from recoveries in both could be particularly rewarding, he said.
Mr. Koesterich agreed that energy and mining stocks were cheap and "represent long-term value," but he was less certain how much value was available in commodities themselves, the main driver of producers' stocks. That is why he would rather own emerging markets, while being in no hurry to cash in.
"It's the type of thing to buy and put away for 10 years," he said. "You can't time the low, but you know you're getting in at a fairly cheap price."

Abstract: Unlike the crisis of a milestone birthday, where fear subsides into resignation, Mr. Reining decided to change his cubicle fate and set a goal of having $1 million in his brokerage account by the time he was 35. Given that two-thirds of Americans report having little savings for retirement -- and half of married couples and three-quarters of single people in retirement count on Social Security for half or more of their income -- saving is a problem and supersavers have something to teach the rest of America.

Full text:   During the 2007-8 financial crisis, Chris Reining said, he panicked. His state of anxiety wasn't brought on by the collapse of the United States stock market or the global economic crisis that followed. It was prompted by his office mates in Madison, Wis.
"I was living the 9-to-5 life, and I would look at other people at work and see that they were 30, 40 years older than me and still living the cubical lifestyle," Mr. Reining, 36, said of his 29-year-old self. "I didn't want to be living that life. It was this feeling of being trapped and not being in control, being enslaved to a job, being enslaved to my possessions."
Unlike the crisis of a milestone birthday, where fear subsides into resignation, Mr. Reining decided to change his cubicle fate and set a goal of having $1 million in his brokerage account by the time he was 35. Given that he was making about $75,000 a year working in information technology, he knew the goal would take considerable discipline.
Mr. Reining is part of a small group of supersavers who commit to a number that they say will support their lifestyle in retirement and never stray from achieving that goal. They are the financial equivalent of people who go on a diet, lose the weight and actually keep it off.
"Very few have the discipline and fortitude to set a plan, a budget, and stick with it," said Jason M. Katz, a managing director at UBS Wealth Management Americas. "The people who are the supersaver freaks, who actually do it, go through an exercise of mental accounting. They designate certain pools of money for certain goals."
Given that two-thirds of Americans report having little savings for retirement -- and half of married couples and three-quarters of single people in retirement count on Social Security for half or more of their income -- saving is a problem and supersavers have something to teach the rest of America.
Mr. Reining was determined not to be like everyone else. "I needed to get a handle on my money," he said. "I had no idea how much I was saving beyond the 4 percent I was allocating to my 401(k). I had succumbed to lifestyle inflation."
So he cut out the things he didn't need -- like the $1,000 a month he was spending on flying lessons and flight time -- and also curtailed his shopping trips to Whole Foods Market and his nights out.
He began saving more: 10 percent at first, then increasing the amount to more than 50 percent. He made as much as he could automatic, to ensure that money from his paycheck flowed immediately from his checking account to his brokerage account and then into index funds. That eliminated the temptation to divert money to the things 30-year-olds might want to buy.
At 35 he crossed the $1 million threshold. He now has about $1.2 million in his brokerage account, he said, and has detailed the process on a blog that he set up to motivate himself.
For any supersaver, it all starts with prioritizing. Diets sometimes fail because they are too restrictive; these supersavers realize that all saving and no fun is not sustainable.
Mr. Reining and his girlfriend go on an overseas vacation each year, last year to England and Italy, the year before to Argentina. They are planning a safari in Tanzania in January.
"These are not inexpensive trips," he said, though he added: "We're not staying in $300-a-night hotels. We stay in a small, clean budget hotel and spend more time at museums or spending that money on a tour."
Darlene Orlov, a lifelong New Yorker who started planning when she was 30 to retire at 50, was a supersaver, but she still spent money on going to the theater and taking her parents on vacations, to places like Palm Beach, Fla., and Atlantic City.
She considered these necessary rewards from her business as a consultant and expert witness to human resource departments, where she prided herself on being available to clients whenever they needed her.
While she would not disclose the goal she set, she said it was always a stretch to reach it. She credited her accountant with keeping her on track with what she earned, saved and spent.
"Without those three components, your goal is going nowhere," she said. "It's not fairy dust. It's producing in good times and bad."
She ended up retiring at 52, not because she had strayed from her plan, she said, but because it took her longer to wind down her business. That was 14 years ago.
Michael Roumell was working as a litigator in a Chicago law firm with a goal many corporate lawyers harbor: not being a corporate lawyer. He set 50 as his mark and invested all his spare money in real estate, in rental homes on the edges of the nicer neighborhoods in Chicago.
His goal was to create a stream of income from rental properties. He succeeded and got the added boost of real estate appreciation as the neighborhoods became more desirable.
"I realized I could make a lot of money without doing very much," he said. "I could buy these houses and fix them up and get pretty good rent, so I started doing that."
In 2005, at 50, he moved to southeast Florida and started playing golf.
Supersavers have some behaviors beyond their ability to save that others might find distinctive.
Ms. Orlov, who has been married for three decades, has never talked about money to her husband, who was married previously, nor does he to her. She sees nothing strange in this.
"We don't share that information, and happily so," she said. "That's the way I do things. You kind of pilot your own ship. It may sound crazy, but it works just fine. I've never had an argument in 30 years."
(Pressed about how they divide shared expenses, like their home, she declined to give specifics. She also said she was not worried that her husband, a retired business executive, would spend through his money.)
Mr. Reining, who has been dating his girlfriend for three years, has done some calculations around the cost of children that parents might find a tad low. He thinks they could raise a child from birth through high school on $85,000.
"It won't go very far in New York or San Francisco, but if you live in flyover country like I do, $85,000 goes a long way," he said.
Yet being a supersaver is not the preserve of just consultants, professionals and millennials without family demands.
Ann Houston has weathered a divorce and nearly a decade of working without a raise as a state employee in Oklahoma. Yet she has stayed on track to reach a retirement goal she set in the 1990s. To do this, she thought small when it came to spending on houses and cars, and calculated precisely when it came to saving.
"Every dollar I have has a name," she said. "I do the savings part first. It's taken out automatically. Then I put so much in for food, for entertainment, for travel, for gifts -- automatically. It's an envelope system."
While she never remarried, she has had a partner for more than a decade. They keep their finances separate except for shared expenses like food or a vacation. This has allowed her to stay on track to retire in two years, at 66, having paid off her house and her car and even buying a weekend home on a lake.
David Houston, her brother and adviser, who works at Northwestern Mutual, said his clients who had become supersavers had a trait in common: They were coachable.
"What you find is, someone who has had a bad experience or seen someone have bad experiences is much more coachable, because they don't want to fall into that ditch," Mr. Houston said. "Then you take someone for whom life has been easy -- they get out of college and they don't get on a track."
This is a fairly broad generalization, but it makes the point that having a plan and listening to someone knowledgeable may keep you from fooling yourself.
"It's about measuring things to a favorable outcome and not how many assets you have," he said. "We tell people, if you don't give us a budget to evaluate your plan, there is no way to know if we've been successful."
The Chartered Financial Analyst Institute, which administers the C.F.A. designation that indicates investment proficiency, recently put out a list of 20 mistakes people make with investing. The top one was expecting too much or using someone else's expectations in retirement -- or, in other words, not having a sense of what you want to achieve.
"First and foremost, the people who achieved their goals set a goal," said Robert Stammers, director of investor education at the C.F.A. Institute. "Those goals drive everything from portfolio design to risk management to security selection. If you don't have that plan, you will not achieve them."
Mr. Stammers said that often, people who find friends with similar investment goals did better. They are like supersaver clusters, where peer pressure works the same way it does with people who overextend themselves to match what their neighbors have.
"People who stick to their exercise regimens are really, really passionate about reaching their exercise goals," he said. "For a lot of people, they think these finance concepts are above their abilities and they're really not. It's not being taught these concepts in school and not having any formal training."
For Mr. Reining, the hardest part is not maintaining day to day the financial diet he has put himself on. His solutions to that are "just automation" and "pretending like you don't have that money anymore." Then there's the part about turning down friends.
"Sometimes people ask us to go out for the night, and you have to say no," he said. "Sometimes you have to suggest doing something else other than going out to a fancy restaurant and spending a few hundred dollars. You have to be cognizant of that alignment of your spending with your values."
He added, "I would like to travel more, but I know I can't justify that."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. MOSCOW -- The sweeping accusations that a Kremlin-backed program facilitated doping by elite Russian track-and-field athletes in the Olympics and other top sports events earned a collective shrug Tuesday from the Russian public and even, to some extent, from the officials who oversaw the debacle.
Was there public outrage over the destruction of positive drug tests, the intimidation of laboratory technicians by secret agents and the extortion of the athletes by the officials in charge who wanted to cover up the test results? Almost none. Were there questions about the capability of President Vladimir V. Putin to run a clean, competent administration? Even fewer.
And this was just the latest in a series of nasty shocks to Russia, some of them direct results of Mr. Putin's actions.
Choked by low oil prices and Western sanctions imposed after the invasions of Crimea and Ukraine, the economy is shrinking. The ruble has lost more than half its value, inflation is at 11.2 percent, and a much-vaunted national project to create local substitutes for banned Western imports seems to have produced mostly stuff like dubious cheese made from palm oil.
And last week, a Russian charter flight plummeted into the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, killing all 224 people on board, in what British and American intelligence agencies suspect was a terrorist attack in response to the Kremlin's military intervention in Syria.
Yet the basic reaction is to shrug and point a finger elsewhere, preferably at the West.
"The West is envious that our athletes achieve good results, so they pushed forward the doping claims," Boris Ivanov, a rail-thin retired construction engineer, said without a trace of irony. "Everybody takes dope! Americans and other nations, all of them!"
Russia was singled out, he said, because the Americans run most such organizations and "they want to attack Russia."
As in Soviet times, sports remains a government affair and another facet of global prestige, so any blow to the image of the athletes is also a blow to the Kremlin. Mr. Putin announced that he would meet with senior athletic officials on Wednesday.
After initial outrage over the accusations, the official Russian reaction was somewhat more circumspect, with officials promising to investigate and to take steps to correct the situation (something they promised back in 2013, before the Sochi Olympics, where the Russian antidoping agency was the lead tester).
Grigory Rodchenkov, the director of the Moscow lab accused of malfeasance, whom the report suggested be replaced, resigned. But Russian officials still minimized the import of what experts call one of the most damning public reports in the history of sports -- "worse than we thought," said a co-author and doping expert, Dick Pound.
"Believe me, there are many similar doping scandals all over the world," Vitaly Mutko, Russia's sports minister, said in his initial public reaction, arguing that doping should be considered an international issue, since elite Russian athletes spend 10 months of the year abroad competing. "Doping is not a problem of Russia."
A number of factors contribute to Russians' readiness to accept such explanations, the primary being the survival instinct. Most of the 140 million Russians struggle just to get by, and do not involve themselves too deeply in larger issues.
Traditionally, though, the first line of defense against any problem is stoicism. This is especially true since Mr. Putin has painted any current problems as the side effects of a national effort to "pull Russia off its knees," where the West is said to have shoved it in the first place.
"We have had more difficult times before," said Viktoria Troschanskaya, a middle-aged Russian lawyer wandering through a Moscow park.
"Russia is a country that is ready to tolerate pain for the sake of national greatness," said Natalya V. Zubarevich, a professor who specializes in Russian demographics. "The simple rational explanation -- the economy went down, people must be angry -- does not work in Russia."
Second, when they look for answers, state-run television tells them exactly what to think. Ever since the March 2014 annexation of Crimea, the mantra has been that Mr. Putin seeks to restore Russia as a great power, a goal the West is determined to thwart. It is a circular argument that magnifies any gains and explains away any setbacks.
Given that 90 percent of Russians rely on state-run television as their primary news source, and that for at least 18 months there has been a steady drumbeat of anti-Americanism across all news programs, many people react automatically.
What the West considers a doping scandal in Russia will most likely "be stretched to be understood as something done for the public good," said Andrey Babitsky, a former editor of Russian Esquire and the new editor in chief of a libertarian website, InLiberty.ru.
"We are in a kind of competition, not to say a war with the West," said Mr. Babitsky, explaining the general reaction, not endorsing it. "Everybody knows that everybody cheats, and if we were caught red-handed, it just means that they cheat better than we do."
Finally, Russian officials face little accountability, and Mr. Putin in particular has sought to insulate his loyalists from any public rebuke. There is a dark historical precedent at play. Since czarist times, Russians have been told that their leader will always protect their best interests and they have been conditioned across centuries never to question that fact.
As with doping, so with the catastrophic crash of the charter jet.
Russian officials, starting with Mr. Putin, expressed dismay that Western governments were quick to point to a terrorist bomb as the likely cause. When Britain canceled all flights to and from Sharm el Sheikh, the Egyptian departure point, and began an emergency airlift home, the initial Russian reaction was that the West was trying to put pressure on Russia over its policy of deploying warplanes in Syria since the end of September to bolster the fortunes of its ally -- and Western bête noire -- President Bashar al-Assad.
No Russian officials acknowledged that Prime Minister David Cameron might face domestic political problems if British citizens were harmed just months after 30 were shot dead in a terrorist attack on a Tunisian beach. Instead, Dmitry Kiselyov, the television anchor who uses his Sunday night news show to set the agenda for the Kremlin, questioned whether the United States and other Western nations might have bought off the terrorist groups so they would attack a Russian jet.
"It is well known that the Americans easily agree with terrorists about their security," he said. "They pay or they bargain: We close our eyes on something and you don't touch us. This is a common practice with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Why wouldn't this practice be replicated with the Islamic State?"
Calling it "just a theory," he said, "Isn't the explosion on our plane that the Egyptians say is 90 percent certain a product of an agreement not to touch civilian planes of the Western coalition?"
The Russian reaction to moral questions is complicated by their association of national greatness with Stalin, who oversaw Russia's industrialization and victory in World War II, but also the death of millions in prisons, forced collectivization, purges and mass deportations.
Russia tends to avoid confronting the crimes committed in tandem with its 20th-century climb to greatness, analysts said, especially since it is trying to regain the same stature. In defending Russian history, given that the government plays down what Stalin did, a doping scandal appears fairly minor in comparison.
Just last week, Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church defended Stalin's legacy without naming him. "Achievements of one or another state leader who stood at the roots of the country's revival and modernization should not be called into question, even if that leader is known for villainies," he said at an opening of a museum exhibition on Russia's 20th century history that also showed how Stalin decimated the ranks of the clergy.
At the deepest levels, analysts say, the idea of morality in public policy died out decades ago, if not centuries, under the weight of government repression.
"It is not that Russian people are bad," Mr. Babitsky said. "It is just that for 100 years they have not seen a politician who lives by any moral standards. When you bring up a moral argument, everybody looks at you as a kind of crazy person, like those people on Times Square shouting about the end of the world."
Correction: November 13, 2015, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the lack of public outrage in Russia over accusations that a Kremlin-backed program facilitated doping by Russian track-and-field athletes in the Olympics and other top sports events referred incorrectly to Andrey Babitsky, who said the doping would probably "be stretched to be understood as something done for the public good." He is a former editor of Russian Esquire and new editor in chief of InLiberty.ru, a libertarian website, not its founder.

Import Prices Fall on Weakness in Oil, and Wholesale Inventories Show Gains

Full text:   The price of imports in the United States fell in October as the cost of petroleum and a range of goods declined, indicating that a strong dollar and soft global demand continued to exert downward pressure on imported inflation.
Other data on Tuesday showed a surprise increase in wholesale inventories in September, suggesting that the slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter was not as abrupt as initially believed.
The Labor Department said import prices dropped 0.5 percent last month after declining 0.6 percent in September.
Import prices have now fallen in 14 of the last 16 months. Imported petroleum prices fell 2.1 percent after slipping 6 percent in September.
"We believe that weakness in emerging Asia, especially China, is likely to push down import prices over and above any effect from the appreciation of the dollar," said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays.
In the 12 months through October, prices of imports tumbled 10.5 percent. The robust dollar and a sharp decline in oil prices have weighed on overall inflation, which is persistently running below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
Weak inflation pressures, however, are unlikely to deter the Fed from raising its benchmark interest rate next month after job growth surged in October and the unemployment rate fell to a seven-and-a-half-year low of 5 percent.
A tightening labor market could give Fed officials confidence that inflation would gradually move toward its target.
A Reuters survey of over 80 leading economists published on Tuesday showed a 70 percent median chance the Fed would raise its benchmark overnight interest rate at its Dec. 15-16 policy meeting.
The dollar has gained 16.6 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014. Its impact on inflation was underscored by a 0.4 percent drop in import prices excluding petroleum last month, the largest decrease since January.
On Tuesday, the dollar rose to a fresh seven-month high against a basket of currencies as traders anticipated the first interest rate increase from the Fed in nearly a decade.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0.5 percent as increases in automobiles, furniture, farm products and apparel offset declines in machinery, petroleum and a range of other goods.
Wholesale stocks rose 0.3 percent in August.
Inventories are a crucial component of revisions in the gross domestic product. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of G.D.P. -- wholesale stocks excluding autos -- increased 0.5 percent.
That is more than the government estimated in its advance G.D.P. estimate, which showed that inventories sliced off 1.44 percentage points from growth in the third quarter, leaving output expanding at a 1.5 percent annual rate.
As result, economists expect that third-quarter growth could be revised up to as high as a 1.9 percent rate later this month.
"The third-quarter inventory correction now looks less severe than we had previously believed," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.

Full text:   As the James Bond theme thundered -- ba-da, ba-daaaa! -- and 50 camera crews clamored for a better view, a white Suburban with tinted windows rolled up to the Americas premiere of "Spectre" on Monday in Mexico City. Swarming fans, many wearing Day of the Dead makeup, had been waiting for hours. Had the superspy himself finally arrived?
When an anxious-looking woman and an older man in a lumpy suit stepped out, the look-who-it-isn't letdown was palpable. Well, maybe the next S.U.V. would carry Daniel Craig, the current Bond, James Bond. Fans went back to their chant -- Dan-iel, Dan-iel -- as the mystery man and woman disappeared up a set of red-carpeted stairs.
If the crowd only knew. The fate of moviedom's longest-running franchise, which again finds itself at a critical juncture, is in those little-known hands.
For the last 20 years, ever since their father handed over the keys to the series, the ferociously private Barbara Broccoli, 55, and her half brother, Michael G. Wilson, 73, have micromanaged Bond's every move. While moviemaking is a collaborative process, Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson have final say over every line of dialogue, every casting decision, every stunt sequence, every marketing tie-in, every TV ad, poster and billboard.
In particular, it is the steely-eyed Ms. Broccoli who runs the Bond franchise. She was the one who decided to recast the central character in 2005, giving the job to Mr. Craig, whom she had spotted in an indie drama called "Layer Cake." She was the one who, with "Spectre" hanging in the balance after the on-set injury of Mr. Craig early this year, figured out how to keep the $300 million production on track.
Yes, a woman is in charge of the world's most aspirational male brand.
Although she almost never speaks in public and keeps an absurdly low profile in Hollywood -- born in Los Angeles, she now lives and works in London -- Ms. Broccoli has an iron-fisted reputation.
"Barbara scares the hell out of people," Mr. Wilson said in a rare sit-down interview at the St. Regis Hotel in Mexico City a few hours before the premiere of "Spectre," which opened in the United States on Friday. "Everyone is frightened to death of her."
"Good!" shouted Ms. Broccoli, who was seated beside him. She laughed.
"I mean it," Mr. Wilson continued, as she shot him an O.K.-that's-enough look. "They all know I'm a big pushover so they don't care about me."
It may take all of her mettle to get James Bond through his next set of challenges. After a four-film period of stability and prosperity -- the last Bond movie, "Skyfall," took in $1.1 billion worldwide and "Spectre" has already been outselling it in many European markets -- the spy series finds itself most definitely stirred if not outright shaken.
The complicated Mr. Craig, 47, has professed a desire to move on before, but this time he seems to really mean it. ("I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists," he told a British magazine in October when asked if he wanted to continue playing the character.) Moreover, the final scenes of "Spectre" seem designed to set up the departure of this particular 007, or at least close a chapter.
The Bond contract is also expiring for Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has distributed the last four movies. At least three studios -- Sony, Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox -- are expected to battle for the right to take Bond into the future.
"My main concern is what happens to the franchise next," Sam Mendes, who directed "Spectre" and "Skyfall," said in a phone interview, noting Mr. Wilson's age. "Can one of them do it without the other? Does its management go to another generation? I don't know the answer to those questions, and I don't think they know."
While Ms. Broccoli is the more aggressive partner, according to studio executives who have worked on Bond, she operates in lock step with Mr. Wilson, who got his producing start in 1977 when he helped rig underwater bombs in the Bahamas for "The Spy Who Loved Me." Mr. Wilson brushed aside any notion that there would be big changes in how the franchise was managed. "We're in it for the long haul, whatever that may be," he said.
As for Mr. Craig's future, Ms. Broccoli shut down that question. "Maybe I'm in denial, but I don't want to think about another Bond," she said evenly. "Until he definitely says otherwise, I'm not going to give it another thought."
Bond's future studio home is another issue, and it's complicated.
"We're really not in the frame of mind to be wooed at the moment," Ms. Broccoli said. "We're focused on getting this picture out."
She added: "The future is a little uncertain, but whether we stay at Sony or go somewhere else, we'll make it work. We are very, very protective of Bond. Bond is our baby."
Bond is unlike any other Hollywood franchise. For starters, it is gargantuan: The 24 movies have taken in more than $5 billion at the domestic box office, after adjusting for inflation, according to Box Office Mojo. The series -- the first to go after a global audience -- has generated billions more in overseas ticket sales, home entertainment revenue, television reruns, marketing partnerships (Omega watches, Aston Martin cars, Gillette razors) and video games.
The franchise's complicated ownership structure is also unique.
Back in the 1930s, Albert R. Broccoli, the son of immigrant farmers (family lore holds that the family is descended from Italians who crossed cauliflower with rapini to create broccoli), set out to make a name for himself in Hollywood. He eventually formed a business partnership with a producer named Harry Saltzman; together, they came to control the film rights to Ian Fleming's sex-drenched James Bond novels.
They made a financing deal with the independent studio United Artists. In the 1970s, Mr. Saltzman -- facing mounting personal debt -- sold his 50 percent stake in Bond to that studio. Over the coming decades, as United Artists was absorbed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was in turn sold and resold a half-dozen times, Mr. Broccoli, who was known as Cubby, maintained creative control over Bond.
In 1995, he handed operations at the family company, Eon Productions, over to Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson. Cubby Broccoli died in 1996, after the release of "GoldenEye." By that time, Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson, who had long been involved in the making of the films, were in position to take over custody of the franchise uncontested.
"They've managed to keep in their family, through passion and pride and unbelievable effort, the greatest movie franchise out there," said Gary Barber, MGM's chief executive. "It's pretty damn amazing."
(Although MGM and Eon, which stands for Everything or Nothing, have had knockout fights over the decades, Ms. Broccoli emphatically praised Mr. Barber, who rescued MGM from bankruptcy in 2010, and Jonathan Glickman, president of the motion picture group at MGM.)
Because MGM no longer distributes its own movies, the last four Bond pictures have been released through Sony. But Sony's contract expires with "Spectre," and MGM is expected to begin actively shopping the distribution rights next year. If Bond moves to a new distributor, Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson will have their grit tested once more: New studio executives, particularly marketers, tend to want to put their stamp on Bond.
"If we get the wrong partners, there are liable to be conflicts," Mr. Wilson said.
Eon and MGM have no contractual obligation to consider Sony first, but Michael Lynton, the chief executive of Sony Entertainment, very much wants to sign a new deal. Sony lacks blockbuster franchises of its own, and Bond delivers both profits and clout.
"Absolutely. Without question," Mr. Lynton said in a phone interview. "It's a spectacular franchise, and Barbara, Michael and the MGM team are a pleasure to work with."
Still, Sony also finds itself at a crossroads. After enduring a battle with the activist investor Daniel S. Loeb and a devastating attack by hackers, the studio shook up its movie division this year, bringing in a new movie chairman, Thomas E. Rothman, who has a track record of financial discipline. Sony can't exactly back up a Brink's truck to keep Bond while preaching austerity to the rest of Hollywood.
And the expiring deal is lavish, requiring Sony to pay 50 percent of the "Spectre" production costs -- which total some $250 million after accounting for government incentives -- for only 25 percent of certain profits, once costs are recouped. Sony also shoulders tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs.
In an email stolen by hackers and widely published online, Andrew Gumpert, who oversees business affairs for Sony, figured that the studio would realize about $38 million in profit if "Spectre" performed as "Skyfall" did. (Sony earned about $57 million from "Skyfall," which was less expensive to make, while MGM collected roughly $175 million and Eon's share amounted to $109 million.)
There is one other factor working against Sony. Mr. Lynton this year pushed out the studio's longtime movie chief, Amy Pascal, and she was the Sony executive with the strongest relationship with Ms. Broccoli. Was Ms. Broccoli upset by Ms. Pascal's exit?
"Yes," she said. "Amy has been a big part of the success of these movies, and we adore her." Asked which Sony executive they are closest to now, Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson struggled for an answer. Ms. Broccoli ultimately offered that Josh Greenstein, Sony's relatively new head of marketing, "does fantastic work."
Ms. Broccoli thought James Bond was a real person until she was 6 or 7. She was a toddler on the set of "Dr. No" in Jamaica in 1962. In 1967, while in Japan on the set of "You Only Live Twice," she had a serious case of tonsillitis and recuperated in Sean Connery's suite, which was the best appointed.
If her father was larger than life, Ms. Broccoli tends to disappear, at least in public. At the Mexico City premiere, Mr. Wilson stood onstage and greeted the 5,000 attendees while she struck a silent pose off to the side. When they were honored last year by the Producers Guild of America, they walked together to the podium, but only he spoke.
In an interview, she was friendly and warm, if guarded. At times, she laughed mightily. Friends say an even more charismatic woman emerges in private. "She is vivacious and funny and smart and extremely warmhearted and the most loyal person you will ever meet," Mr. Mendes said. "But she is absolutely old school. She wants all of the attention to be on the movie. She hates it when producers try to make it about them."
It may be the ultimate sign of power in Hollywood: She has nothing to prove, and does not need to curry favor with studios. Although a skilled producer of theater -- "Once," which she produced with her ex-husband, Frederick M. Zollo, won the 2012 Tony Award for best musical -- she does not make movies outside the Bond universe.
Ms. Broccoli attended Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where she studied motion picture and television communications. But her real training came at her father's elbow. She was an assistant on "Octopussy" in 1983. As a third assistant director on "A View to a Kill" in 1985, she directed traffic on a walkie-talkie. In 1989, while working on "Licence to Kill," she oversaw the climactic tanker truck sequence.
Mr. Wilson, a writer and producer of "Licence to Kill," came up in a different way. He joined the family as a teenager when his mother, Dana, became Cubby's third wife (Cubby and Dana then had Barbara). He graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 1963 with a degree in electrical engineering, later studying law at Stanford University. After nine years in independent practice, he joined Eon in the 1970s to help with a legal tangle. Down to earth -- he wandered around the St. Regis Hotel here in hiking shoes -- Mr. Wilson eventually started writing and producing alongside Cubby Broccoli.
Since there are no more Fleming books to adapt outright, each new Bond movie starts with Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson rereading the old novels, they said. "We really like to kind of saturate ourselves in the world he created," she said. Then, working in their stately London offices near the Hyde Park end of Piccadilly, they try to channel the fears and insecurities of the global moviegoing audience.
"We think, 'What is the world afraid of? Where are we headed?' Then we try to create a villain that is the physical embodiment of that fear," Mr. Wilson said. With "Spectre," they zeroed in on government surveillance.
"Spectre" was a particularly arduous shoot. It did not snow in Austria until the last minute. They faced bad weather in Italy. And Mr. Craig injured his knee while performing a stunt. Although he continued working, Mr. Craig eventually had to undergo surgery, which threw the carefully calibrated schedule into disarray.
Ms. Broccoli, who personally went with Mr. Craig to visit doctors at one point, "was nothing less than heroic," Mr. Mendes said. "There is no way we would have completed the film on time without the way Barbara managed Daniel and Daniel's injury."
Asked about her handling of the incident, Ms. Broccoli seemed to grow uncomfortable. "It was Daniel who handled it," she said. "He decided that he would carry on, and he did the rest of the picture with some really serious issues."
Mr. Wilson sighed and interrupted.
"What Sam meant is that Barbara sat down with her production team and immediately figured out how to shoot the picture in a way that gave Daniel some therapy and time. She completely reorganized everything -- filming overseas, major stunt and action sequences -- and she did that, like, over a weekend."
Ms. Broccoli still would not concede that she did anything special. "We have an amazing team," she said quietly.
At that point, a Sony operative arrived and put Ms. Broccoli out of her misery, insisting that an agreed-upon hourlong interview had to end early. But a reporter had (at least) one more question: Does Ms. Broccoli consider herself a feminist and, if so, does she look back on some of the "Bond girls" and wince?
"I am absolutely a feminist," she said. "If you think about the women in the recent films, they're far more interesting and complex than they once were. Bond has changed, too, in how he deals with women."
She added: "Women still have a long way to go. There are not enough women in positions of power in the film industry. And now there are all these questions about women in Hollywood not being paid equally. When that happens, it's outrageous."
Mr. Wilson gave her a sideways glance. "That doesn't happen with us," he said.
"No it doesn't," Ms. Broccoli said with a smile.

Full text:   Hiring at American companies shifted into higher gear in October, helping to lift wages and clearing the path for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.
The 271,000 jump in payrolls reported by the Labor Department on Friday was much more robust than expected and suggested that economic growth had enough momentum to allow the central bank to begin its move away from the ultralow, crisis-level interest-rate policy it has been following for seven years.
Along with altering the landscape for policy makers in Washington and traders on Wall Street, the strength in the labor market, if it persists, is expected to shift the political debate as the 2016 presidential campaign heats up.
While there is still a possibility the Fed could hold back, the underlying solidity evident in the latest jobs report will strengthen the hand of monetary policy hawks who have long favored an increase in short-term rates. At the same time, it should reassure Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and a majority of her colleagues at the central bank that the economy can handle modestly higher borrowing costs without stress.
"It was pretty much everything you could ask for in a jobs report," said Michelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Not only was the headline number strong, but there were upward revisions for prior months, the unemployment rate fell and wage growth accelerated."
A healthy, improving economy tends to favor the incumbent party in the White House, and it could blunt Republican attacks on President Obama's economic record, a mainstay of the Republican candidates' message.
After the release of the employment data, economists lined up to predict that a rate increase is now nearly a lock at the Fed's mid-December meeting.
"The report was so strong and broad-based that it will be difficult to deter them from raising rates," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. Until Friday, Barclays had been predicting the Fed would wait until March 2016 to act, but moved that up to next month after Friday's announcement. "I think the odds are about 80 to 85 percent that they will move," Mr. Gapen said.
The unemployment rate dipped to 5 percent, from 5.1 percent in September. Average hourly earnings also bounced back, rising 0.4 percent in October after showing no increase in September. That lifted the gain to 2.5 percent over the last 12 months, the healthiest pace since 2009.
Still, most workers will need bigger raises for some time to come to make up for ground lost after a long period of wage stagnation. What's more, many Americans remain on the sidelines of the job market, discouraged by years of lackluster hiring after the Great Recession.
The proportion of Americans who are in the labor force, which fell to a 38-year low of 62.4 percent in September, was unchanged last month.
Still, at 5 percent, the official unemployment rate is very close to the threshold that the Fed and many private economists consider consistent with stable prices over the long term. The slack that built up in the labor market after the recession, however, has changed traditional calculations of how far unemployment can fall before the job market tightens and the risk of inflation rises.
An additional jobs report for November will be in hand by the time the Open Market Committee gathers for its last meeting of the year, on Dec. 15 and 16.
In light of the strong October figures, though, economists are already beginning to look to the question of how fast the Fed will have to make subsequent rate increases if the labor market continues to improve.
Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, had long advocated waiting until 2016, but he said on Friday that he expected internal debate to start shifting toward the timing of subsequent rate increases.
"I think what we're likely to get into discussing before too long is what's the path of the rate increases," Mr. Evans said in an interview with CNBC. "That's what's going to dictate how accommodative or restrictive our policy is. And so I think we need to have communications which indicate that the path is going to be gradual."
But some analysts said the Fed would be forced to move faster than it currently plans.
"Regardless of the exact timing of the first rate hike, we still believe that the big story next year will be an unexpectedly strong pickup in wage growth and price inflation," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. This trend, he predicted, "will force the Fed into a much more aggressive policy-tightening cycle than the Fed's projections currently suggest."
Mr. Evans is among Fed officials who do not want the central bank to move too quickly, before there is clear evidence of inflationary pressure. Prices have increased slowly in recent years, rising just 0.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, well below the 2 percent pace that the Fed regards as optimal.
At the same time, many workers are still working fewer hours than they would like, or taking jobs that pay much less than they would like.
The Labor Department's broadest measure of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take part-time jobs because full-time work is unavailable, fell to 9.8 percent in October from 10 percent in September. A year ago, it was over 11.1 percent.
The picture of labor market strength evident in the data sent bond yields surging as traders rapidly adjusted for the likelihood of a December move. Stocks were mixed in trading Friday, as investors weighed the risks that higher rates pose to earnings and company valuations.
In a separate report on Friday, the Federal Reserve said consumer borrowing surged by $28.9 billion in September, the biggest monthly jump since the start of data collection in 1941. Student debt and car loans posted big increases.
As has been the case for several months, there was a feast-or-famine quality to the job report. Sectors tied to commodities and exports treaded water while domestically focused areas of the economy performed well.
The pattern persisted in October: Factory jobs were unchanged, while mining and logging lost 4,000 positions. Professional and business services recorded a huge 78,000 increase in jobs. Health care hiring was also robust, with a 56,700 increase.
White-collar employers like Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting giant, have been on something of a hiring binge. Over the course of the company's 2016 fiscal year, which began in July, Ernst & Young plans to hire just over 17,000 new employees in the United States, roughly 10,000 joining straight out of college.
In July, August and September, the firm added 2,500 more experienced accountants and consultants, said Dan Black, director of recruiting for the Americas. "Whether it's dealing with taxes, regulations or technology, our clients want help," Mr. Black said.
Nearly all the positions, whether entry-level or for more experienced workers, require at least a bachelor's degree, underscoring how crucial credentials and specialized skills have become in today's job market.
"For experienced talent, it's a dogfight," Mr. Black said. "In 2008 and 2009, as companies cut back, we had our pick of the litter. Now it's much more competitive."

Abstract: [...]of the slowdown in health care inflation, the Congressional Budget Office keeps reducing its projections of the future cost of federal health programs like Medicare.

Full text:   It really matters who the next president is. But there are other things that matter just as much to the nation's future prosperity. One of them is: What is happening to health care costs?
If health care costs start to rise again the way they did before, then health care spending will swallow the economy and bankrupt the federal government. If they are contained, then suddenly there's a lot more money for everything else, like schools, antipoverty efforts and wages.
The good news is that recently health care inflation has been at historic lows. As Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, put it in a speech to the Hamilton Project last month, "Health care prices have grown at an annual rate of 1.6 percent since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in March 2010, the slowest rate for such a period in five decades, and those prices have grown at an even slower 1.1 percent rate over the 12 months ending in August 2015."
As a result of the slowdown in health care inflation, the Congressional Budget Office keeps reducing its projections of the future cost of federal health programs like Medicare. As of October, projections for federal health care spending in the year 2020 were $175 billion lower than the projections made in August 2010. That would be a huge budget improvement.
The big question is whether these trends will continue. Many people believe that health care inflation came down for entirely temporary reasons and that over the long run we're still doomed.
One group in this camp emphasizes that the economy went into the tank, so of course people went to the doctor less often. As history demonstrates, it can take up to six years for a recession's impact to work its way through the system; then health care costs shoot up just as before.
Another group emphasizes that health care inflation is down because general inflation is down, and once general inflation is back to normal, health care costs will shoot upward.
A third group argues that we've recently had a decline in technological innovation. Not many useful but costly new drugs or machines have come on the market over the past few years, but if innovation resumes then so will rising costs.
But other experts say the reduction in health care inflation is partly structural and therefore more longstanding. Some point out that health care inflation really began trending downward in 2003 or 2004, during George W. Bush's first term and long before the recession hit. Second, the reduction in health care cost growth seems to be global. Health cost growth has slowed in just about every high-income country since 2000, possibly as efficiencies are passed from place to place.
Members of the Obama administration like to argue that Obamacare has pushed things along. For example, the Affordable Care Act pushed providers into Accountable Care Organizations. Instead of getting paid for doing more tests and procedures, providers have a greater incentive to just keep people healthy.
The law also encouraged bundling. If you go in to get a hip replacement, the government makes a single payment for all services associated with that episode of care. The law also penalizes hospitals when patients have to be readmitted. There's been a significant drop in readmissions.
There's still a lot of uncertainty about which side of the debate is right. The most recent numbers have indicated a scary surge in health care prices, and some firms are projecting 6.5 percent inflation for 2016. While parts of the law reduce spending, other parts may lead to more spending, especially as the industry gets more concentrated.
And yet the weight of the evidence suggests that part of the change is permanent. Moving away from the bad old fee-for-service system has got to be a good thing. The greater pressures providers feel to reduce costs have got to be a good thing, at least fiscally.
Last March, Jonathan Rauch wrote a report for the Brookings Institution, arguing that the health care market is more open to normal business model innovation than ever before. The quality of health care data and analytics is improving exponentially. Pressures to reduce costs are ratcheting up. Profitable niches are growing for efficiency improving products.
In the past, most innovation involved improving quality of care at high cost. Rauch described many entrepreneurs who are providing innovations that maintain current quality of care but at lower cost.
We seem to be making at least some incremental progress toward a structural reduction in health care inflation. Many Americans are feeling gloomy about accomplishing anything these days, but progress is possible. We haven't whipped health care inflation, or defeated our intractable budget issues. But the evidence suggests we're landing a few serious blows.

Abstract: The bill, however, still fails to address a chronic shortfall in financing for the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which pays for such projects, and has been the subject of a fierce long-running disagreement over federal tax policy. Hard-line conservative Republicans were infuriated by the provision to restart the Export-Import Bank, but their opposition seemed futile given that a huge bipartisan majority in the House had voted to approve a separate measure that would also reopen the bank.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The House on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a multiyear highway bill that includes more than $300 billion in transportation and infrastructure programs to address the nation's deteriorating roads and bridges.
The bill, however, still fails to address a chronic shortfall in financing for the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which pays for such projects, and has been the subject of a fierce long-running disagreement over federal tax policy.
The House measure must now be reconciled with a Senate version adopted earlier this year. Like the House bill, the Senate measure included six years of policy prescriptions but only provided about three years' worth of financing.
The vote in the House was 363 to 64. Most of the "no" votes came from hard-line conservative Republicans who were angered that the bill was not fully paid for and that it included a provision to reopen the federal Export-Import Bank.
Some transportation experts also criticized the measure, which they said was too small to address the nation's widespread, and worsening, infrastructure problems. President Obama, in his budget, had called for a larger, $478 billion program.
Still, authors of the House bill said that it would improve the nation's infrastructure as well as transportation safety. House Republicans also said that the two and a half days of freewheeling floor debate, and consideration of more than 100 amendments, demonstrated Speaker Paul D. Ryan's commitment to running a more inclusive legislative process.
Mr. Ryan, at a news conference in the Capitol, hailed the passage of the bill.
"We just completed the work on a bipartisan highway bill," he said. "It cuts waste. It prioritizes good infrastructure. It will help create good-paying jobs. And it is the result of a more open process.
"Over these last four days, the House has debated more amendments than in the last four months combined," Mr. Ryan said, adding, "This is a good start. It's a glimpse of how we should be doing the people's business."
Still, critics said the insufficient financing in the bill represented a longstanding failure by Congress and recent administrations to maintain the nation's transportation systems, and to invest in much-needed enhancements.
The shortage of financing reflects a continuing disagreement in Washington over how to replenish the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded largely by a federal gas tax. The tax was last increased in 1993 and is not indexed to inflation.
That, together with greater fuel efficiency of modern cars, has led to shortfalls of more than $70 billion since 2008, which Congress has covered with general funds.
And while the House did engage in far more open debate than it has been in recent years, Republican leaders blocked amendments that would have increased the gas tax -- a move they oppose but many business groups support.
The debate on the floor was managed by Representative Bill Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, following the footsteps of his father, former Representative Bud Shuster, who was chairman of the same committee from 1995 to 2001.
In a statement, the younger Mr. Shuster praised the House for approving his bill. "Today the House voted to give our infrastructure and our economy a much-needed shot in the arm," he said.
Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the committee, also praised the outcome but expressed concern about the insufficient financing.
"I am very pleased, that after 10 years of short-term Band-Aids and extensions, the House finally passed a bipartisan, six-year transportation bill," Mr. DeFazio said in a statement. "This legislation isn't perfect. Unfortunately, it doesn't provide the level of investment needed to repair or rebuild our aging 1950s-era system of roads, bridges and public transit systems."
Still, Mr. DeFazio said the bill provides a framework that would make good use of additional money if Congress and the president provide it.
Others saw deeper shortcomings. "I see it as a huge missed opportunity," said Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy group in Washington.
He said the bill failed to provide money for passenger rail capital projects and also fell short by not encouraging a more modern, efficient freight policy.
Hard-line conservative Republicans were infuriated by the provision to restart the Export-Import Bank, but their opposition seemed futile given that a huge bipartisan majority in the House had voted to approve a separate measure that would also reopen the bank.
Still, the conservatives pushed a number of amendments aimed at weakening the bank should it reopen. Those amendments were rejected.
Separately on Thursday, the House voted again to approve the annual military policy bill, which President Obama vetoed last month in a fight with congressional Republicans over spending.
The spending fight was ultimately resolved in a budget agreement that Mr. Obama signed on Monday. But there are still points of disagreement in the military bill, particularly a Republican provision that keeps in place a ban on bringing prisoners from the detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, into the United States, even for prosecution or continued detention in another prison. It also would tighten restrictions on transferring detainees to other countries.
Mr. Obama's plan to close the prison, an unfulfilled promise of his presidency, calls for transferring 53 of the remaining detainees and bringing the other 61 to a prison on domestic soil.
The White House on Wednesday declined to say whether Mr. Obama would veto a second version of the military policy bill over Guantánamo, which he has objected to in past years but ultimately signed into law.
Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that the provisions were "a really bad idea," but added: "We'll have to take a look at exactly what passes Congress before making a determination about what the president will sign."
The Senate is also expected to readopt the military measure, though a vote is not yet scheduled.
Also on Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked Republicans from taking up the annual military appropriations bill. Some Democrats fear that despite the recent budget agreement, Republicans would gladly approve increased military spending but then refuse to carry out other aspects of the budget accord.

Full text:   Stocks retreated modestly on Wednesday after comments from Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve's chairwoman, implied that Fed policy makers were still considering raising interest rates in December.
Ms. Yellen's comments pushed the dollar higher. That had a secondary impact of causing oil to fall, which affected oil, gas and energy stocks. Government bond prices also fell.
Media and entertainment stocks were pummeled after worrisome comments from the media conglomerate Time Warner.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 50.57 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,867.58. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.48 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,102.31, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.65 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,142.48.
During testimony before Congress, Ms. Yellen said that an interest rate increase in December would be a "live possibility" if the economy stayed on track. She stressed that no decision had been made yet, and a move in December would depend on how the economy fared until then.
At its Dec. 15-16 meeting, the Fed will consider raising a benchmark interest rate from a record low of near zero if the economy continues to grow at a pace strong enough to keep adding jobs and push annual inflation toward the Fed's 2 percent target, Ms. Yellen said.
Once considered unlikely, a December rate increase seems more likely by the day.
Stocks have recovered nearly all of their losses from the summer, financial markets have calmed in China and elsewhere, and the United States economy continues to slowly improve.
Securities that allow investors to bet on which way the Fed will move interest rates are now pricing in a roughly 60 percent chance of the Fed raising rates next month, according to data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
"Everyone is so focused on the world's central banks at the moment, they don't seem to care about anything else," said Colleen S. Supran of the wealth management firm Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough.
Investors will closely parse the October jobs report, which is due out on Friday. Investors expect that United States employers added 185,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.1 percent.
Oil and gas stocks were among the shares affected the most, inadvertently, by Ms. Yellen's comments. Her remarks caused the dollar to strengthen and oil prices to decline sharply.
Crude oil fell $1.58, or 3.3 percent, to $46.32 a barrel, reversing after two days of gains. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell $1.96, or 4 percent, to $48.58 a barrel.
"Today's sell-off was easily definable by some hawkish comments" by Ms. Yellen, Jim Ritterbusch, of the oil trading firm Ritterbusch & Associates, wrote in a note.
Some of the biggest gainers on Monday and Tuesday were among the biggest decliners on Wednesday. The oil field servicing company Baker Hughes fell $2.90, or 5.3 percent, to $51.56. Newfield Exploration lost $1.84, or 4.6 percent, to $38.30.
Media companies were another weak spot in the market. They fell sharply after Time Warner gave a worrisome earnings forecast for 2016. The company cited concerns about "cord cutting," a phenomenon that has been increasing in recent years in which longtime cable TV subscribers have canceled or substantially curtailed their subscriptions, opting for cheaper services like HBO Go and Netflix.
Time Warner fell $5.10, or 6.6 percent, to $72.20; Viacom fell $3.37, or 6.6 percent, to $47.92; and 21st Century Fox lost $1.63, or 5.2 percent, to $29.65.
Netflix gained $4.31, or 4 percent, to $114.05.
Bond prices fell, mostly as a result of Ms. Yellen's comments. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.23 percent from 2.22 percent the day before.
Precious and industrial metals futures closed lower. Gold fell $7.70, to $1,106.20 an ounce; silver lost 18 cents, to $15.06 an ounce; and copper edged down less than a penny, to $2.32 a pound.
In the rest of the energy market, wholesale gasoline fell 5.4 cents, to $1.392 a gallon in New York; heating oil fell 6.3 cents, to $1.504 a gallon; and natural gas rose 0.9 cents, to $2.262 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Death Among Middle-Aged Whites

Full text:   Two Princeton economists startled other Americans -- and themselves -- when they uncovered a trend that had escaped the medical and scientific world: Between 1999 and 2013, white middle-aged men and women in the United States, especially those with only a high school education, began dying at a sharply increased rate, largely a result of problems with legal and illegal drugs, alcohol-related liver disease and suicide. The health and financial implications are disturbing for the country, and for what the two economists called a "lost generation."
The discovery was made by Angus Deaton, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science this year, and his wife, Anne Case. In a paper published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they said the finding nearly blew them off their chairs.
Death rates have continued to decline in every other age group and racial or ethnic group in the United States, and this particular group had shown no unusual problems in the preceding years. (Middle-aged blacks still have a higher mortality rate than middle-aged whites but the gap is closing. Middle-aged Hispanics have a far lower mortality rate than whites.)
When the economists sliced and diced the data, they found that the mortality rate for all white Americans from 45 to 54 years, which fell by 2 percent a year between 1978 and 1998, began rising at an annual rate of 0.5 percent beginning in 1999. The toll was especially high for the less educated. Death rates rose by 22 percent for people with a high school education or less, while they continued to decline for those with a college education or better.
The Princeton economists attributed the increase in death rates to suicides and drug and alcohol poisonings, problems that may have been exacerbated by the economic downturn. After the 2008 recession and slow recovery, the inflation-adjusted income for households headed by a person with only a high school degree fell by 19 percent, according to experts at Dartmouth who were asked to comment on the paper.
Other rich nations suffered similar or even worse economic slowdowns without a change in mortality rates, and blacks and Hispanics in the United States were harmed more than whites by the recession but did not experience an increase in mortality rates. Even so, the economic effects were potent.
The Princeton economists detected signs of growing distress among middle-aged whites, who express pessimism about their futures and report declines in their physical and mental health and ability to function. They also report increases in chronic pain, which many alleviate with prescription opioids and heroin.
If sickness and death rates continue to rise in this age group, an influx of chronically ill people will strain Medicare, Medicaid and the Social Security disability insurance program. There is no single remedy. A real plan for action is not easy to achieve. Economic growth that creates more high-paying jobs would solve some of the problem. Policies to promote affordable college educations and universal access to mental health clinics and addiction treatment centers could help.
If nothing is done, those now in midlife can expect trouble, and the next generation to hit that age could suffer a similar fate. We must not let that happen.

The Bill That Would Make Roads Less Safe

Abstract: The bill before the House, for example, would raise $9.1 billion by selling oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, $5.7 billion by increasing customs fees and $17.1 billion by cutting a dividend that the Federal Reserve pays banks that are required to buy stock in the Fed's regional reserve banks.

Full text:   When it comes to America's transportation system, Congress seems determined, year after year, to do the wrong thing. The House will vote on a bill as early as Wednesday that does not dedicate enough money to improving the quality of deteriorating highways and mass transit systems, but does include policies that will make American roads less safe.
The legislation would authorize federal spending on transportation projects for six years but provide only enough money to last the first three years, or $325 billion. That's because members of Congress do not want to raise the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax. That tax has not changed since 1993 and, as a result, revenue has not kept pace with inflation. That in turn makes it harder for the government to pay for things like road repairs, bridge construction and upgrades to subway and bus systems.
To make up for the shortfall in revenue, the Republicans who control Congress are resorting to various budgeting gimmicks. The bill before the House, for example, would raise $9.1 billion by selling oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, $5.7 billion by increasing customs fees and $17.1 billion by cutting a dividend that the Federal Reserve pays banks that are required to buy stock in the Fed's regional reserve banks. Another $2.4 billion would come from telling the Treasury secretary to use private debt collectors to collect unpaid back taxes.
Strategies like these have almost nothing to do with transportation. Compared to reliable, long-term funding sources like the gas tax, they are mostly short-term, one-shot measures. And they do not make sense, fiscally speaking. Why, for instance, sell oil from the petroleum reserve at a time when oil prices have fallen sharply? Private tax collection was tried unsuccessfully in the 1990s and 2000s when it lost money and led to abusive practices.
The House bill also contains provisions that would undoubtedly lead to more deadly accidents. One would prevent the Department of Transportation from publishing the safety ratings of trucking and bus companies. Another would make it harder for the department to raise the minimum insurance requirements for trucks and buses that were last set in 1985.
The bill would also allow people as young as 19 years, 6 months old to drive trucks across state lines, down from 21 now. Given the higher accident rates of teenage drivers, this change makes no sense.
Unfortunately, there is a good chance that this bill or a version that closely resembles it will become law. The Senate passed an earlier version in July. And Republicans are betting that they can get Democrats in Congress and President Obama to go along because nobody wants to jeopardize funding for the transportation system, especially ahead of an election year.
Few members of Congress have the courage to push for a bigger gas tax. Short of doing something meaningful like that, Democratic lawmakers and Mr. Obama must do everything they can to improve this bill.

Full text:   As the plight of low-wage retail workers has gained national attention, HEB, a regional grocery chain and one of Texas' largest private employers, is giving 55,000 employees an equity stake in the company.
The Butt family, which founded the San Antonio-based grocer 110 years ago, is handing an estimated 15 percent of the company's shares to employees over 21 years old who have worked at least a year at the retailer and clocked at least 1,000 hours in a calendar year.
Managers at the retailer, which runs 370 stores in Texas and Mexico and had $23 billion in net sales this year, started informing employees who qualify on Monday, according to the company.
The plan is intended to recognize workers' contributions and foster loyalty to the company, and enhance their long-term financial stability, said Craig Boyan, HEB's president and chief operating officer. Under the plan, workers are able to cash out when they leave or retire from the company, and will also receive dividends based on the retailer's earnings.
"So many in retail are competing in the race to the bottom, and people are the largest cost. So it seems logical to cut people, and lots of folks are doing it," Mr. Boyan said. "We think that's a trap. We believe the race for the bottom cheapens the American experience. It's bad for the country and bad for companies."
Mr. Boyan continued: "We think there is great benefit in a more empowered, inspired, proud, trained work force."
HEB, started by Florence Butt as a tiny grocery store in Kerrville, Tex., would not be the first supermarket to experiment with employee ownership. Publix Super Markets, based in Lakeland, Fla., and WinCo Foods, based in Boise, Idaho, both attracted attention for their majority employee-owned status, as well as their rapid growth, which have earned them the moniker "Walmart slayers."
But HEB's outright gifting of shares to a wide swath of employees is unusual. Starting in January, eligible workers -- the retailer calls its workers "partners" -- are set to receive a grant of nonvoting shares valued at 3 percent of their salary, as well as $100 in stock for each year of continuous service.
"It's exciting. It's free money, pretty much," said Veronica Solis, 39, who joined HEB in high school, bagging groceries, and now handles payroll at a San Antonio store. "I'm going to retire from here. I'm not going anywhere."
The retailer said it would continue to make yearly contributions to the stock plan, based on company performance. About 55,000 of the chain's 86,000 full- and part-time employees are expected to receive shares. Employees in Mexico are not eligible, for now, because federal laws that set standards for pension and health plans do not apply there.
HEB is now run by Charles Butt, grandson of Ms. Butt, and he and his family are ranked as the 44th-richest in the United States, worth an estimated $10.7 billion.
Labor groups across the country are stepping up demands for higher wages and more stable working hours in the retail and service industries. Activists have long denounced big-box retailers like Walmart for employing low-wage, part-time workers.
Partly in response to those pressures, Walmart, which is the nation's largest private employer, announced in February that all of its United States workers would earn at least $9 an hour by April, and at least $10 an hour by February 2016. Some labor advocates, however, who are demanding $15 an hour for service workers, have called the plan inadequate.
HEB says the minimum starting pay for its cashiers is already $10.25, and that wage level is set to rise again next year to account for inflation. The retailer also offers health care coverage to employees who work more than 28 hours a week, as well as a company-matched 401(k) plan, which will be unaffected by the new stock ownership plan.
Mr. Butt, HEB's chairman and chief executive, declined to comment on the push for a $15 hourly wage. Still, he said by email, technological advances in sourcing and distribution should allow retailers to pay their workers more.
"Pay and the price of food in our stores are of course inextricably linked. It's a trade-off with which I have struggled all my business life," Mr. Butt said. "Nothing is more price-sensitive than food. Nevertheless, we don't see the conflict as immutable."

Full text:   Something startling is happening to middle-aged white Americans. Unlike every other age group, unlike every other racial and ethnic group, unlike their counterparts in other rich countries, death rates in this group have been rising, not falling.
That finding was reported Monday by two Princeton economists, Angus Deaton, who last month won the 2015 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, and Anne Case. Analyzing health and mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from other sources, they concluded that rising annual death rates among this group are being driven not by the big killers like heart disease and diabetes but by an epidemic of suicides and afflictions stemming from substance abuse: alcoholic liver disease and overdoses of heroin and prescription opioids.
The analysis by Dr. Deaton and Dr. Case may offer the most rigorous evidence to date of both the causes and implications of a development that has been puzzling demographers in recent years: the declining health and fortunes of poorly educated American whites. In middle age, they are dying at such a high rate that they are increasing the death rate for the entire group of middle-aged white Americans, Dr. Deaton and Dr. Case found.
The mortality rate for whites 45 to 54 years old with no more than a high school education increased by 134 deaths per 100,000 people from 1999 to 2014.
"It is difficult to find modern settings with survival losses of this magnitude," wrote two Dartmouth economists, Ellen Meara and Jonathan S. Skinner, in a commentary to the Deaton-Case analysis that was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
"Wow," said Samuel Preston, a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on mortality trends and the health of populations, who was not involved in the research. "This is a vivid indication that something is awry in these American households."
Dr. Deaton had but one parallel. "Only H.I.V./AIDS in contemporary times has done anything like this," he said.
In contrast, the death rate for middle-aged blacks and Hispanics continued to decline during the same period, as did death rates for younger and older people of all races and ethnic groups.
Middle-aged blacks still have a higher mortality rate than whites -- 581 per 100,000, compared with 415 for whites -- but the gap is closing, and the rate for middle-aged Hispanics is far lower than for middle-aged whites at 262 per 100,000.
David M. Cutler, a Harvard health care economist, said that although it was known that people were dying from causes like opioid addiction, the thought was that those deaths were just blips in the health care statistics and that over all everyone's health was improving. The new paper, he said, "shows those blips are more like incoming missiles."
Dr. Deaton and Dr. Case (who are husband and wife) say they stumbled on their finding by accident, looking at a variety of national data sets on mortality rates and federal surveys that asked people about their levels of pain, disability and general ill health.
Dr. Deaton was looking at statistics on suicide and happiness, skeptical about whether states with a high happiness level have a low suicide rate. (They do not, he discovered; in fact, the opposite is true.) Dr. Case was interested in poor health, including chronic pain because she has suffered for 12 years from disabling and untreatable lower back pain.
Dr. Deaton noticed in national data sets that middle-aged whites were committing suicide at an unprecedented rate and that the all-cause mortality in this group was rising. But suicides alone, he and Dr. Case realized, were not enough to push up overall death rates, so they began looking at other causes of death. That led them to the discovery that deaths from drug and alcohol poisoning also increased in this group.
They concluded that taken together, suicides, drugs and alcohol explained the overall increase in deaths. The effect was largely confined to people with a high school education or less. In that group, death rates rose by 22 percent while they actually fell for those with a college education.
It is not clear why only middle-aged whites had such a rise in their mortality rates. Dr. Meara and Dr. Skinner, in their commentary, considered a variety of explanations -- including a pronounced racial difference in the prescription of opioid drugs and their misuse, and a more pessimistic outlook among whites about their financial futures -- but say they cannot fully account for the effect.
Dr. Case, investigating indicators of poor health, discovered that middle-aged people, unlike the young and unlike the elderly, were reporting more pain in recent years than in the past. A third in this group reported they had chronic joint pain over the years 2011 to 2013, and one in seven said they had sciatica. Those with the least education reported the most pain and the worst general health.
The least educated also had the most financial distress, Dr. Meara and Dr. Skinner noted in their commentary. In the period examined by Dr. Deaton and Dr. Case, the inflation-adjusted income for households headed by a high school graduate fell by 19 percent.
Dr. Case found that the number of whites with mental illnesses and the number reporting they had difficulty socializing increased in tandem. Along with that, increasing numbers of middle-aged whites said they were unable to work. She also saw matching increases in the numbers reporting pain and the numbers reporting difficulty socializing, difficulty shopping, difficulty walking for two blocks.
With the pain and mental distress data, Dr. Deaton said, "we had the two halves of the story." Increases in mortality rates in middle-aged whites rose in parallel with their increasing reports of pain, poor health and distress, he explained. They provided a rationale for the increase in deaths from substance abuse and suicides.
Dr. Preston of the University of Pennsylvania noted that the National Academy of Sciences had published two monographs reporting that the United States had fallen behind other rich countries in improvements in life expectancy. One was on mortality below age 50 and the other on mortality above age 50. He coedited one of those reports. But, he said, because of the age divisions, the researchers analyzing the data missed what Dr. Deaton and Dr. Case found hiding in plain sight.
"We didn't pick it up," Dr. Preston said, referring to the increasing mortality rates among middle-aged whites.
Ronald D. Lee, professor of economics, professor of demography and director of the Center on Economics and Demography of Aging at the University of California, Berkeley, was among those taken aback by what Dr. Deaton and Dr. Case discovered.
"Seldom have I felt as affected by a paper," he said. "It seems so sad."

Full text:   More European Banks' Earnings
It's another busy week for earnings reports in Europe as several of the region's biggest banks plan to report their third-quarter results, including the British lenders HSBC and Standard Chartered, the Swiss bank UBS and the French lenders Société Générale and Crédit Agricole.
Uncertainty in the financial markets in the third quarter weighed on the results of several lenders that had already reported, particularly in bond and fixed-income trading. Several European lenders this year have hired new chief executives as they seek to reshape their businesses in a tighter regulatory environment, which includes requirements that they hold more capital. Both Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have announced plans to greatly reduce costs and shrink their operations under their new chief executives. --Chad Bray
Web Summit in Dublin
Senior executives from Google and Facebook will be among the 30,000 participants expected to gather in Dublin for one of Europe's largest technology conferences, Web Summit, which starts on Tuesday. The annual event is likely to highlight Ireland's role as a low-tax haven for many of the world's largest tech companies, which has put it under increasing pressure. Some other European countries, along with some further away, think that Ireland has used its low corporate tax rate to unfairly attract global companies. --Mark Scott
Media Giants' Earnings
A pack of media giants will report earnings this week, shedding light on whether the industry is out of the woods yet. The companies reporting results include Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Time Warner, CBS and Discovery Communications.
Last quarter, the industry suffered a mass sell-off on the stock market because of fears of cord-cutting, when people cancel their cable subscriptions for cheaper streaming alternatives. The concerns were amplified by steep ratings declines and weak advertising sales. While shares in media companies have mostly recovered since then, executives will still probably face questions about how they are preparing themselves for the digital future of the television business. --Emily Steel
Largest I.P.O. This Year Is Expected
Japan Post, the network of post offices that doubles as one of the world's largest banking and insurance groups, is set to make its stock market debut on Wednesday in a $12 billion listing that is the largest initial public offering globally this year. The Japanese government is selling 11 percent of Japan Post in three separate stock offerings for the parent company -- which operates the mail-delivery system -- the savings bank and the insurance businesses. It is the largest new stock offering in Japan since 1987.
The privatization is the culmination of a 10-year political battle. The Japan Post Bank controls more than 200 trillion yen, or about $1.7 trillion, of savings from Japanese households. Much of it is used to finance government projects, and critics have called the system a source of wasteful, politically motivated spending. --Jonathan Soble
U.S. Trade Balance Data
Wednesday morning, the Commerce Department will report new data on the nation's trade balance in September. Economists are expecting a net trade deficit of $41 billion, a significant improvement from the $48.3 billion gap in August. The improvement is somewhat surprising, given weakness in China and the headwinds created for domestic companies by the strong dollar. If the experts are wrong, and the gap is wider than expected, it would not bode well for economic growth in the third and fourth quarters. --Nelson D. Schwartz
Facebook's Third-Quarter Earnings
Facebook reports its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, and analysts expect another blockbuster quarter of roughly $4.3 billion in revenue, and earnings per share of about 52 cents. As always, Wall Street will be looking at the growth in the number of Facebook users, which is approaching 1.5 billion, as well as the amount of time people spend using the platform. Keep an ear out for any new statistics on video advertising, one of the company's largest financial priorities. --Mike Isaac
Yellen to Testify
Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, will testify on Wednesday about regulatory issues before the House Financial Services Committee. The Fed is supposed to have a vice chairman for regulation, who would make regular visits to Capitol Hill. But the position has been vacant since it was created five years ago, and Congressional Republicans pressed Ms. Yellen to appear instead. The hearing will probably focus on the overhaul of financial regulations since the 2008 crisis. --Binyamin Appelbaum
Deadline for InBev Deal
Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, has until Wednesday to make a formal offer for its closest rival, SABMiller, under British takeover rules. The maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, Anheuser-Busch InBev struck an agreement in principle in October to acquire SABMiller for about $104 billion, and British regulators extended the deadline to complete a deal until this week.
Anheuser-Busch InBev said last week that it had completed its "due diligence review" and confirmed that "facilities which will allow AB InBev to provide certain funds in support of the cash components of the possible offer have been negotiated and can be executed at short notice."
The deal, if consummated, would create a behemoth in the beer industry with annual revenue of about $64 billion. And it is expected to attract extensive regulatory scrutiny given the size of the combined company and its potential dominance in several markets worldwide, including the United States. --Chad Bray
Bank of England's Interest Rate Decision
The Bank of England will announce its monthly decision on whether to raise a crucial interest rate on Thursday. The Monetary Policy Committee is expected to leave the benchmark rate steady at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. At its October meeting, eight of the committee members voted to keep the rate unchanged, finding "the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate," according to committee's minutes. Ian McCafferty was the sole dissenter, arguing that rates should be increased to 0.75 percent to keep inflation from overshooting the bank's medium-term targets, according to the minutes. --Chad Bray
October Jobs Report
Friday morning, the Labor Department will report the latest figures on hiring and unemployment in October. The monthly jobs report is a major economic indicator, but this one is especially important because it will figure heavily in whether the Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates when its policy makers meet in mid-December. Wall Street is expecting an increase of 180,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to remain flat at 5.1 percent. Anything above 200,000 would significantly increase the odds of a December rate increase, although the Fed will also have the employment report for November to consider by the time it meets. --Nelson D. Schwartz
Berkshire Earnings
Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett that owns businesses ranging from the railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe to Fruit of the Loom underwear, is scheduled to report earnings on Friday. The company missed earnings expectations last quarter because of weakness in its core insurance operations, but its portfolio of noninsurance divisions has shown strong performance. --Michael J. de la Merced

Full text:   Global Chill, Local Impact
"A Global Chill Hits Home" (Oct. 25) looked at the effects across the country of a global slump in demand for commodities like oil, steel and soybeans. This downturn followed 20 years of a "supercycle" largely driven by China's appetite for raw materials.
The article drew 143 comments to nytimes.com. The following have been edited and condensed.
>
These industries are cyclical -- that is not news. Layoffs are not uncommon when the orders don't come in and there is too much capacity. I'm sorry for the people who are affected, but that's the reality.
Mistr Knucklz, Washington
Caterpillar cutting jobs is the best news possible -- not for its workers, of course, but for the planet. Same with the slowdown. Phew.
Miriam, San Rafael, Calif.
What we need to do now is rebuild America. That would create demand for all kinds of commodities, especially all of the steel that's needed to rebuild highways, bridges, railroads and transit systems. Too bad Congress would rather shut down family-planning clinics than invest in the nation's people.
Paul, Albany
This is not only an American story; it is a Canadian story, a Brazilian story, a Nigerian story, an Australian story. The world reacts faster than ever, and change in commodities is no longer slow and incremental but swift and devastating. There are no easy solutions, but restoring our own infrastructure could mitigate a lot of problems, put people to work and create demand.
Stephen, Windsor, Ontario
It seems like the emerging markets are done emerging. This might be good for the long run. If people consume fewer resources, we might just save the planet from catastrophic climate change.
Neildsmith, Kansas City
Where the Curve Leads
A 57-year-old chart, the Phillips curve, was the subject of "A Guiding Principle That May Lead the Fed Astray" (The Upshot, Oct. 25). The Phillips curve purports to show the relationship between unemployment and inflation, in particular, that inflation is prone to rise when unemployment falls below a certain "natural rate."
The problem is that the curve, which helps guide the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and many of her colleagues in determining whether to raise interest rates, hasn't worked well in recent decades in the United States.
The article attracted 124 comments.
>
Why does anyone think that raising rates to rational levels -- that provide a reasonable return on capital -- is going to cause an economic downturn?
Ross Salinger, Carlsbad, Calif.
Every religion has its dogma to which many will continue to cling despite evidence to the contrary.
RMayer, Cincinnati
The reason we are faced with this "paradox" over inflation and employment is the obtuse way in which we measure employment: Not only do we not count discouraged workers and workers who would like more hours, but we focus only on job growth, not the quality of said jobs.
Vanadias, Maine
The Phillips curve depends on an assumption: that employers will actually pay higher wages for labor when unemployment is low.
Phillips conceived of the curve in an utterly different world with no Internet, no smartphones and little mobile skilled labor outside of the U.S. and Western economies. This has all changed, and these new factors need to be included in the formula.
William O. Beeman, Minneapolis
If Janet Yellen and the Fed rely on something that I learned out of a Macroeconomic 101 textbook 40 years ago, God help us all.

Full text:   AMID the global economic turmoil and seesawing markets, millions of Americans have one overriding question: When will my pay increase arrive? The nation's unemployment rate has fallen substantially since the end of the Great Recession, sliding to 5.1 percent from 10 percent in 2009, but wages haven't accelerated upward, as many had expected.
In fact, the labor market is a lot softer than a 5.1 percent jobless rate would indicate. For one thing, the percentage of Americans who are working has fallen considerably since the recession began. This disappearance of several million workers -- as labor force dropouts they are not factored into the jobless rate -- has meant continued labor market weakness, which goes far to explain why wage increases remain so elusive. End of story, many economists say.
But work force experts assert that economists ignore many other factors that help explain America's stubborn wage stagnation. Outsourcing, offshoring and imports exert a steady downward tug on wages. Labor unions have lost considerable muscle. Many employers have embraced pay-for-performance policies that often mean nice bonuses for the few instead of across-the-board raises for the many.
Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School of Business, noted, for instance, that many retailers give managers bonuses based on whether they keep their labor budgets below a designated ceiling. "They're punished to the extent they go over those budgets," Professor Cappelli said. "If you're a local manager and you're thinking, 'Should we bump up wages,' it could really hit your bonus. Companies have done this in order to increase the incentive to hang tough on budgets, and it works."
In recent years, wage increases, before factoring in inflation, have averaged about 2 percent annually. But real, after-inflation wages have remained dismayingly flat since 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even though real wages did bump up last fall when the drop in oil prices pulled down inflation. (In a minority view, the Heritage Foundation and some other conservative groups say the bureau has underestimated wage increases.)
Many economists don't expect real wages to pick up until the job market tightens further. Federal Reserve officials hoped wages would begin rising at today's 5.1 percent, but economists are increasingly saying the rate might need to fall to 4.9 percent or lower to push wages higher (although some fear that inflation will climb if the jobless rate is that low). The only time in the past four decades when after-inflation wages bounded upward was from 1998 to 2001, when the jobless rate fell below 4.5 percent.
Even as business executives urge the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to prevent inflation, a move that might increase unemployment, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, says she might want to let the jobless rate fall below 5 percent. The reason: Only then might hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers or the long-term unemployed finally find jobs.
Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, voiced frustration that while wages regularly rose faster than inflation in the 1950s and '60s, that's no longer the case. "Why is there this assumption that wages are only going to rise faster than inflation at very low unemployment?" he asked. "Where does that come from?"
Ever since the Great Recession battered corporate revenues and profits, many companies have been far tougher in containing fixed costs, including labor expenses. "With the stock market's wild behavior and what we've seen in China, companies continue to hold on to huge amounts of cash and are reluctant to increase their costs in the form of increasing wages," said Kerry Chou, a senior practice specialist at WorldatWork, a nonprofit human resources association.
Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., put it another way: "There's this pervasive norm" among employers "that labor costs must be held down at all costs because maximizing profits is the be-all and end-all."
He added that the "atomization" of the American workplace -- with the use of more temps, subcontractors, part-timers and on-call workers -- had reduced companies' costs and workers' bargaining power.
As a result of all these trends, the share of corporate income going to workers has sunk to its lowest level since 1951. The Economic Policy Institute found that the decline in labor's share of corporate income since 2000 costs workers $535 billion annually, or $3,770 per worker.
"The labor share has declined more than you would think in light of the tightening of the labor market," said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard labor economist. "It suggests we're seeing a decline in worker bargaining power."
Another important trend depressing pay is that more than ever, companies are paying top dollar to star performers -- whether marketing wizards or software programmers -- while skimping on paying the many workers without special skills.
"Right now the labor market is good if you're a new graduate of Harvard or Stanford in computer science or a new economics Ph.D. or if you're coming out with a specialized skill in some health occupation," Professor Katz said. "The upper 10 percent are probably doing O.K. in the labor market, but typical workers are still facing a lot of difficulties."
As part of this embrace of pay for performance, many companies are giving raises or one-time bonuses only to their best performers, thus helping retain and attract top talent while subtly showing the door to less stellar workers.
"The higher performers are attracted to and will stay with organizations that differentiate higher performers," said Ken Abosch, North American compensation practice leader for Aon Hewitt, a consulting firm. "Low performers are uncomfortable working in environments that emphasize higher performance so they will sort themselves out."
In a study of 1,200 American companies, Aon Hewitt found that 25 percent overwhelmingly emphasize rewards to high performers and give far less or nothing in raises or bonuses to average or poor performers. "Those 25 percent say, 'We're going to give 6 percent to the top performers, 1.5 percent to average performers and we're not going to give anything to below average,' " Mr. Abosch said.
Just 10 percent of companies give equal raises spread across the board, Mr. Abosch said. And the remaining companies do something in between -- giving somewhat higher raises to top performers and somewhat less to everybody else.
Notwithstanding the overall decline in worker leverage, labor efforts like the Fight for 15 and Our Walmart have succeeded in pushing employers to lift some wages. McDonald's has raised wages at its company-owned restaurants, and Walmart and Target will increase minimum pay to $10 an hour in February. Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles have adopted a $15 minimum wage, while Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has ordered a $15 minimum wage for New York's fast-food workers.
Such efforts offer hope to those who are eager to lift wages for everyone. "If you increase the bargaining power of workers, they might say, 'No, we don't want you just to give more pay just to the top layer,' " said Linda Barrington, executive director of the Institute for Compensation Studies at Cornell University. "We want you to share the rewards more evenly."
