Full text:   YANGON, Myanmar -- When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi visited the United States in 2012, she was celebrated as Myanmar's newly free opposition leader, after years of detention under house arrest.
Since then her National League for Democracy has won a sweeping election victory, and the military seems to be retreating from political life. For Washington, she stands as a gleaming example of a successful policy of constructive engagement.
But on Wednesday, as she begins her first trip to the United States as Myanmar's leader, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi will be accountable for what her government has accomplished, and what it has not, since she took office six months ago.
An immediate question for Obama administration officials during her visit is whether the time has come to lift the remaining sanctions on Myanmar, and to encourage military-to-military cooperation and development aid.
The decision is not just a matter of promoting American businesses in Myanmar. It also involves an assessment of her short record in power, as well as a measure of how Myanmar fits in Washington's "pivot to Asia" strategy and its efforts to offset China's influence in the region.
In addition to nurturing relations with Washington and other Western governments, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has rekindled relations with the Chinese government, and made a recent high-level visit to Beijing.
"China is our neighbor," said U Zaw Htay, a spokesman for the state counselor's office (Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is state counselor and foreign minister). "We cannot choose our neighbors," he added. "China is our most important trade partner and a key partner in security and peace issues. So she went to China before going to America."
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is also encouraging continued assistance from Japan, maintaining military relations with Russia and seeking more engagement with fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. She has embraced a classic nonalignment policy -- "which is at the very core of Myanmar's foreign policy DNA," said Thant Myint-U, a historian.
In part, the goal of that strategy is to draw in foreign investment. Myanmar's gross domestic product is growing at one of the highest rates in Southeast Asia, but the country is coming from very far behind. Some 20 million people, out of a total population of more than 54 million, lack proper road access, according to the Asian Development Bank. Power cutoffs are common, even in the commercial capital, Yangon. Inflation is high. Rice production has dropped below levels in colonial times.
Washington's remaining sanctions on Myanmar are narrowly targeted: They apply to the trade in jade and precious stones, and to doing business with some military officials or their affiliates. In theory they should not be a major impediment to American investment there.
But "any sanctions brand the country as being a risky place," Sean Turnell, an economic adviser to the Myanmar government, said. "And so lifting them would have an effect on corporate psychology." There are no Western banks or American airlines currently operating in Myanmar, he said.
Others think it's too soon to loosen the restrictions.
"I don't see the N.L.D. government having a proper policy for handling crony capitalism or rehabilitating the cronies," said U Yan Myo Thein, a political analyst in Yangon, referring to the National League for Democracy. "Some of them have even increased their fortunes in the few months the N.L.D. has been in government by getting more licenses."
Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch said: "The Burmese government doesn't deserve a wide-scale lifting of sanctions. Its record on human rights has really been mixed."
Mr. Robertson acknowledged the release of political prisoners, but cited the continued arrests of civil society activists, as well as the government's failure to repeal laws limiting free speech and the rights of religious minorities and its indifference to the plight of the Rohingyas.
Various governments and rights groups in the West, as well as the United Nations, have criticized Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's administration for doing too little to alleviate the suffering of the Rohingyas, a group of about one million Muslims living in western Myanmar, most of them stateless.
Since an outbreak of violence in 2012 with ethnic Rakhine -- themselves among the poorest people in the country -- Myanmar's Rohingyas have lived in camps or confined to designated areas, with limited freedom of movement or access to education and health services.
But now Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi seems to have adopted the issue as a priority, placing herself in charge of a special committee and nominating Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, to another independent commission that made its first visit to Rakhine last week.
These appointments are in keeping with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's apparent preference for initiatives over policies. She has taken on marquee issues that are fiendishly complicated and may take years to resolve, such as ethnic conflict and minority rights, rather than more urgent humanitarian or economic matters. Yet while reaching for symbolic gestures, she has often fallen back on pragmatism.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi recently convened a major peace conference in Naypyidaw, the capital, to tackle the country's decades-long ethnic conflicts. For all the pomp of the occasion, though, she was mostly following the lead of the previous government, which had held a peace conference earlier this year, as the first in a series of meetings.
By the end of the gathering, she also seemed to accept the importance of a national cease-fire agreement that both the previous government and the armed forces treated as a steppingstone for broader talks about peace, federalism and constitutional reform.
"Aung San Suu Kyi is not pursuing things which threaten the military's essential interests," said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based political analyst. "Her sense is that she should use her huge political mandate to push the peace process forward, transcending some of the issues that bogged it down before -- and this fits with the military's approach."
Abroad, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is seen as a symbol of democracy and resistance to military oppression. But in Myanmar she also personifies the Burmese-Buddhist majority and, as the daughter of a general and independence hero, a rarefied class. That pedigree plays well with the majority, also Burmese and Buddhist, and acts as a bridge to her former foes in the military establishment.
In fact, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's efforts to redefine the military's relations with civilian authorities sometimes looks more like a power bargain between elites than fundamental democratic reform.
When she created the state counselor position, securing greater influence over both the executive and the legislative branches, military members of Parliament called the move unconstitutional. But she was also setting a dangerous precedent.
The trickiest challenge of her administration may be managing relations with the military while pushing liberalization along.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 71, has personalized power, but she has not groomed successors. She promotes confidants, while some veterans of the 88 Generation democracy movement, especially those who have displayed political ambitions, have been sidelined. She cultivates loyalty and discipline within the N.L.D. -- requiring, for example, that all parliamentarians in her party live together in the same compound of run-down communal government guesthouses in Naypyidaw.
During an impromptu dinner in one of those dorm rooms recently, with a handful of N.L.D. members and local journalists, one senior representative expressed his concern about further democratization given Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's all-important role.
"Reforms to place the military under civilian control must happen in the next few years, under Daw Suu," he said. "Otherwise, they may never happen at all."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Americans last year reaped the largest economic gains in nearly a generation as poverty fell, health insurance coverage spread and incomes rose sharply for households on every rung of the economic ladder, ending years of stagnation.
The median household's income in 2015 was $56,500, up 5.2 percent from the previous year -- the largest single-year increase since record-keeping began in 1967, the Census Bureau said on Tuesday. The share of Americans living in poverty also posted the sharpest decline in decades.
The gains were an important milestone for the economic expansion that began in 2009. For the first time in recent years, the benefits of renewed prosperity are spreading broadly.
The data was released into a heated presidential race, where Democrats seized on the statistics to promote Hillary Clinton's candidacy and undercut Donald J. Trump's dark assessment of the nation's well-being.
"It has been a long slog from the depths of the Great Recession, but things are finally starting to improve for many American households," said Chris G. Christopher Jr., director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight. He said the gains had continued this year.
The economic recovery, however, remains incomplete. The median household income was still 1.6 percent lower than in 2007, adjusting for inflation. It also remained 2.4 percent lower than the peak reached during the boom of the late 1990s. The number of people living in poverty also remained elevated, although it shrank last year by about 3.5 million, or roughly 8 percent.
Mark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University in St. Louis, said the new data "is obviously good news." But he noted that poverty and income inequality in the United States remained more extreme than in most developed countries. "It would take a lot to move that needle," he said.
The Census Bureau also reported that the share of Americans with health insurance continued to increase. It said that only 9.1 percent of the population had no health insurance last year.
Several states, including Alaska, Indiana and Pennsylvania, expanded their Medicaid programs in 2015, taking advantage of increased federal funding under the Affordable Care Act. Private sector coverage also increased as companies hired more workers and offered them better benefits.
With the presidential election looming in less than two months, the annual report provided immediate fodder.
"We lifted three and a half million people out of poverty, the largest one-year drop in poverty since 1968," President Obama said on Tuesday at a rally in Philadelphia for Mrs. Clinton. "The uninsured rate is the lowest since they began keeping records. The pay gap between men and women shrank to the lowest level on record," he said, adding, "Thanks, Obama."
Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, has repeatedly cited the stagnation of household income as evidence of a broader economic malaise. He did not address the new report directly at a rally in Clive, Iowa, but he said the Obama administration's economic policies had failed.
"Poverty is beyond belief," Mr. Trump said. "It's time to break up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation."
The Census Bureau's annual report, based on a survey of 95,000 households, is the latest evidence that 2015 was a good year for the economy. Employers added more than three million jobs as the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent. Hourly pay increased by 2 percent, adjusting for inflation. Americans drove more miles in their cars. Even housing showed some signs of a revival.
The details of the bureau's report revealed that the gains last year were both broad and deep. Notably, lower-income households saw the largest income gains in percentage terms. Real household incomes rose 7.9 percent for households in the 10th percentile and 6.3 percent for those in the 20th percentile. By contrast, the increase was only 2.9 percent for those households in the 90th percentile.
"You know the old saying, 'When the economy sniffles, the least advantaged catch pneumonia?"' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research organization, and a former adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. "Well, that works the other way, too. The benefits of closing in on full employment disproportionately flow to the least advantaged."
The increase in median income outpaced average income, which rose 4.5 percent to $79,263. The median income is the amount that divides households evenly between those that make less and those that make more. Average income is generally higher because some households make a lot more.
The gains, however, came mostly from job growth rather than wage growth. More people are working, but many of them are still struggling to maintain their standard of living.
Jeff Labruzzo, 56, said he was still earning significantly less than before the recession. Mr. Labruzzo, who lives in southwest Louisiana, treats building sites for termites before concrete is poured. The construction business remains soft, and Mr. Labruzzo said he faced increased competition from firms that employ illegal immigrants. He had five workers, but he recently let two of them go.
"Things are to the point where I'm thinking about just closing up the business and letting my income drop," Mr. Labruzzo said. As a veteran, he said he could then qualify for government health benefits.
Last year's income gains do not fundamentally alter the economy's long-term trajectory. Growth remains slow despite the Federal Reserve's campaign to stimulate the economy. Predictions of faster growth, followed a few months later by disappointment, have become an annual ritual.
Both Fed officials and outside economists argue that stronger growth requires action by fiscal policy makers. But Democrats and Republicans are at loggerheads over the best steps, and there is little suggestion that a breakthrough is in the offing.
"It is encouraging that our economic recovery is lifting Americans out of poverty and boosting wages," said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. "But instead of building on this progress, Washington Republicans want to turn back the clock."
Republicans responded in kind, presenting the data as evidence Democrats should step aside.
"Today's report is another disappointing confirmation that too many Americans are still struggling to provide for their families and reach their full potential," said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. "The federal government invests billions of dollars each year in programs to help low-income Americans, but more than 43 million people continue to live in poverty."
The distribution of income in the United States remains tilted toward the affluent. Last year's gains by lower-income households were not enough to shift measures of income inequality.
The data also was a mixed bag for minority groups. Poverty rates fell most sharply for African-American and Hispanic households, but their income gains were smaller than for white households.
"One good year does not reverse decades of stagnation," Mr. Bernstein said. "Middle- and low-income households need a lot more than one good year. We need to keep this going."

Abstract: A strong president dopes up his Summer and Winter Olympic teams for multiple Games. Since Putin invaded Ukraine to shore up his faltering domestic popularity, and then got hit with Western economic sanctions, the dollar-ruble exchange rate has gone from around 36 rubles to the dollar to 65 rubles to the dollar.

Full text:   When it comes to rebutting Donald Trump's idiotic observation that Vladimir Putin is a strong leader -- "far more than our president has been a leader" -- it is hard to top the assessment of Russian-born Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion, which The Times's Andrew Higgins quoted in his story from Moscow: "Vladimir Putin is a strong leader in the same way that arsenic is a strong drink. Praising a brutal K.G.B. dictator, especially as preferable to a democratically elected U.S. president, whether you like Obama or hate him, is despicable and dangerous."
Indeed, Kasparov's point cuts to the core of what is so scary about a Trump presidency: Trump is what The Economist has called "the leading exponent of 'post-truth' politics -- a reliance on assertions that 'feel true' but have no basis in fact," and, sadly, "his brazenness is not punished, but taken as evidence of his willingness to stand up to elite power." When politics becomes "like pro-wrestling," society pays a huge cost, The Economist added, because any complex explanation of any problem is dismissed as experts just trying "to bamboozle everyone else."
So Trump just skips from blaming Mexican immigrants for high murder rates, to President Obama for inventing ISIS, to China for creating the concept of global warming, to thousands of Muslims in New Jersey for celebrating 9/11, to Obama for really having been born in Kenya, to an I.R.S. audit for preventing him from showing us his tax returns -- which would probably show that he paid no taxes.
Every word of it is a lie that most in his own party won't call out. Can you imagine the damage Trump could do to the fabric of our democracy if he had the White House pulpit from which to preach his post-truth politics -- how it would filter down into public discourse at large and infect every policy debate?
"Donald Trump has not only brought haters into the mainstream, he has normalized hate for a much broader swathe of the population who were perhaps already disaffected but had their grievances and latent prejudices held in check by social norms," observed Josh Marshall, publisher of TalkingPointsMemo.com, in his blog on Saturday. "This isn't some minor point or critique. It's a fundamental part of what is at stake in this election, what makes it different from Obama v. Romney. ... This election has become a battle to combat the moral and civic cancer Trump has [been] injecting into the body politic."
Think about the ridiculous trope Trump has been peddling, that if only Obama were as "strong" as Putin. Well, if he were, here are some of the benefits America would enjoy:
A 2015 report in The Moscow Times noted that "life expectancy in Russia has been growing several times slower than in the rest of the world for the past 20 years, according to a research by the U.S.-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation." That coincides almost exactly with Putin's leadership of the country. The article explained, "During the period of 1990-2013 [life expectancy] only grew by 1.8 years in Russia, while the global average number increased by 6.2 years, pushing Russia out of the top 100 countries with the highest life expectancy and placing it in 108th position -- between Iraq and North Korea."
Why don't we have a leader strong enough to slow gains in the life expectancy of an entire nation?
An investigation by the World Anti-Doping Agency released last summer found that Putin's Russia was operating a state-sponsored doping scheme for four years across the "vast majority" of Summer and Winter Olympic sports. According to a July 18, 2016, BBC report on the investigation, "Russia's sports ministry 'directed, controlled and oversaw' manipulation of urine samples provided by its athletes." Scores of Russian athletes were barred from the Rio Olympics as a result.
I get it: A weak president doesn't dare tamper with his Olympic athletes. A strong president dopes up his Summer and Winter Olympic teams for multiple Games.
Since Putin invaded Ukraine to shore up his faltering domestic popularity, and then got hit with Western economic sanctions, the dollar-ruble exchange rate has gone from around 36 rubles to the dollar to 65 rubles to the dollar. Russia's economic growth fell 3.7 percent in 2015, and the I.M.F. predicts it will fall 1 percent in 2016. Inflation in Russia doubled to 15.4 percent in 2015, compared with 7.8 percent in 2014. A World Bank report quoted by the BBC in April said "the number of Russians living below the poverty line will grow at its fastest pace in more than 17 years in 2016."
It takes a strong leader to shrink his currency by 50 percent, double inflation and vastly accelerate poverty in just two years. A weak leader could never do that.
Putin is a leader who is always looking for dignity in all the wrong places -- by investing in bullying wars, not in his own people; by jailing and likely poisoning his opponents; and by being so insecure that he just shut Russia's last independent polling firm after it indicated that many Russians may not vote in the coming parliamentary elections because, among other things, they think they're "rigged."
This is the man Donald Trump admires more than our own president.

Abstract: A global decline in market interest rates means that the force of the Fed's stimulus campaign has been reduced even without a rate increase. [...]she noted that the weakness of the global economy continued to weigh on the United States, contributing to an environment of persistently low growth and low inflation. [...]she said that she remained more concerned about moving too quickly than waiting too long.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor and a leading proponent of the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy, said in a speech on Monday that she still favored "prudence" in raising interest rates despite recent signs of economic progress.
The remarks reinforce expectations that the Fed will not raise its benchmark interest rate when its policy-making committee meets on Sept. 20 and 21, and investors celebrated accordingly. Stocks rose and interest rates fell, reversing much of the market movement on Friday, when investors worried the Fed might move toward a rate increase.
But pressure continues to build for a rate increase before the end of the year. A few hours before Ms. Brainard spoke, Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, joined a growing list of Fed officials arguing that the economy was strong enough to justify an increase in borrowing costs. He called for a "serious discussion" at the September meeting.
The Fed also faced new pressure from Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who said on Monday on CNBC that the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, was keeping rates low "because she's obviously political and doing what Obama wants her to do."
Ms. Yellen "should be ashamed of herself," he added.
Mr. Trump's criticism of Ms. Yellen and the Fed breaks with the general practice of presidents and presidential candidates in recent decades to refrain from criticizing the Fed's conduct of monetary policy. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, castigated Mr. Trump last week for similar remarks.
"Words have consequences," Mrs. Clinton told reporters. "Words move markets. Words can be misinterpreted. Words can have effects on people's 401(k)'s, their pension funds, their stock portfolios."
"He should not be adding the Fed onto his long list of institutions and individuals that he is maligning," she added.
Fed officials insist they will not consider the political consequences of increasing rates. They may, however, hesitate to act before the November election out of concern for the economic consequences of political turbulence, the same way they hesitated before Britain's referendum in June on its membership in the European Union.
Ms. Yellen, presiding over an increasingly fractious group of policy makers, has sought to emphasize their common ground. She said in an August speech that the case for raising rates had become stronger in recent months, but she stopped short of saying that it was time to raise rates.
Ms. Brainard's speech Monday was the last before the Fed's pre-meeting blackout period, effectively giving her the last word in the public debate among Fed officials ahead of the September meeting.
Ms. Brainard agreed reluctantly to support the Fed's first post-recession rate increase in December, but she has stiffened in her concerns. Since then, she has made a habit of laying down markers before important Fed meetings, making the case for patience in March and again in June. On Monday, she once again seized the spotlight to explain why she is still not ready to raise interest rates.
Ms. Brainard said recent economic data raised some questions about the strength of growth, and there was certainly no sign of resurgent inflation. "In the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market," she told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.
She added that the context in which the Fed operates had also changed. A global decline in market interest rates means that the force of the Fed's stimulus campaign has been reduced even without a rate increase. Moreover, she noted that the weakness of the global economy continued to weigh on the United States, contributing to an environment of persistently low growth and low inflation.
Finally, she said that she remained more concerned about moving too quickly than waiting too long. The Fed has few tools to ward off fresh weakness in the economy, while it can easily respond to an inflationary resurgence.
"This asymmetry in risk management in today's new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation," Ms. Brainard said. "I believe that this approach has served us well."
Daniel Tarullo, another Fed governor, said in a CNBC interview on Friday that he too favored patience. Mr. Tarullo described himself as a member of the "'show-me' camp" that wants to see evidence of stronger inflation before raising rates. So far, he said, there is not enough. "From my personal perspective, I think we have an opportunity to continue to get employment gains," Mr. Tarullo said.
Other officials argue that inflation always follows stronger growth; if the Fed waits for the inevitable increase, they warn, the Fed may need to raise rates more sharply, causing a recession.
Mr. Tarullo said in the interview, however, that officials who took this view should still have hesitations about the outlook for growth. He described the recent economic data as a mixed bag.
A growing number of Fed officials argue that this caution is misdirected. Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in a speech on Friday that raising rates in the near term could actually help extend the economic expansion, now in its eighth year. The Fed may now be providing too much stimulus, he said, and overheating could end up forcing sharper rate increases.
"If we want to ensure that we remain at full employment, gradual tightening is likely to be appropriate," Mr. Rosengren said in Quincy, Mass. "A failure to continue on the path of gradual removal of accommodation could shorten, rather than lengthen, the duration of this recovery."
Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City -- and, like Mr. Rosengren, one of the 10 Fed officials with a policy vote this year -- has expressed concern that low rates are encouraging excessive speculation, birthing future financial crises.
Ms. George is the only Fed official to vote to raise rates this year.
Fed officials still could coalesce around a late-year rate increase, as they did last year. After September, the Fed has two more meetings on the calendar, in November and December.
Asked what it would take to win her vote, Ms. Brainard said she would like to see more inflation. She also noted recent weakness in some economic measures like corporate profits and investment.
"It would be important, I think, to see some of those spending indicators starting to really move in a more positive direction going into the third and fourth quarter," Ms. Brainard said.

Full text:   A SEVEN-BEDROOM HOUSE IN CHILE'S WINE COUNTRY
$4.5 MILLION
This 99-acre property with a 13,000-square-foot house and 67 acres of vineyards is in the Casablanca Valley, about a 45-minute drive from Santiago, the capital of Chile. The estate is on a country road about five miles off Route 68, the main highway linking Santiago to the coastal cities of Viña del Mar and Valparaiso.
The current owner of this estate is growing primarily sauvignon blanc, with smaller plots for pinot noir and merlot.
The one-story, U-shaped colonial house, with seven bedrooms and five and a half baths, was built in 2009. The living room, dining room and kitchen are in the center of the house; the bedrooms are in the wings. The double-height ceilings are made from bamboo, in a traditional style, supported by hardwood beams. There is terra-cotta tile flooring throughout the house. The walls are reinforced concrete.
The long, rectangular dining room is large enough for a 10-chair table. The kitchen is described as "country-style," with silestone countertops and space for a dining table. There is a 300-square-foot wine cellar, in addition to a laundry area, a maid's room and a large office. The furniture is not included in the price, but is available for sale, according to Matt Ridgway, the owner of Chile Investments, a consultancy marketing the property.
There are four bedrooms and three bathrooms in the north wing, and three bedrooms and two bathrooms in the south wing. There is also a half-bath off the living room. Two master bedrooms, one at the end of each wing, have en-suite bathrooms and walk-in closets, Mr. Ridgway said.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court. The backyard has a large lawn and a grove of olive trees. Two small homes are on the outskirts of the property for staff. The sale price includes subterranean water rights, which are essential for agricultural land, Mr. Ridgway said.
It is rare for this type of property to be offered for sale publicly, Mr. Ridgway said. "Properties within this market and price range typically don't come onto the market, but change hands privately," he said.
The town of Casablanca, population around 25,000, with shops and restaurants, is about a 15-minute drive from the property. There are also several excellent restaurants in the wineries in the area, Mr. Ridgway said. The Santiago International Airport is about 40 minutes away.
MARKET OVERVIEW
The Chilean economy has slowed in recent years, partly because of a steep drop in the price of copper, a key industry for Chile. After hitting a high in 2013, the gross domestic product has been declining since.
Demand has remained strong for high-end properties, but sales have slumped for mid- and lower-priced homes, agents said. This year the government also imposed stricter lending requirements, capping loans at 80 percent of the value of a home, which has dampened the domestic market, agents said.
"What we're seeing now is a market trending toward more of a rental market than a sales market," said Jorge Mira Olivos, the head of real estate at Engel & Völkers Chile, the property agency.
In 2016, rentals handled by the Engel & Völkers office have increased 30 percent from a year earlier, while the number of sales has dropped more than 5 percent, Mr. Olivos said.
Sales in Santiago are down as much as 30 percent to 40 percent, Mr. Ridgway said. "But there's still demand for good, well-located properties," he said.
Despite the recent slowdown , the market is "stable," says Víctor Danús, general manager of ProUrbe Chile, a real estate company.
Over all in Santiago, the average price of an apartment is about $203 a square foot ($2,183 per square meter), and for a house it is about $152 a square foot ($1,637 per square meter), he said. But prices can rise to more than $300 a square foot for a house in more exclusive communities at the foot of the Andes, such as Vitacura or Lo Barnechea.
A new law imposing value-added tax on the sale of new properties has made older properties more attractive, he said. The new VAT, which went into effect on Jan. 1, can add from 4 percent to 11 percent to the price of a new property, he said.
Wine country properties are hard to value, Mr. Ridgway said. There are few large properties for sale, and few of the larger vineyards have homes comparable to this property, he said.
WHO BUYS IN AND AROUND SANTIAGO
In Santiago, foreign buyers are rare, agents said. But in wine country, where this house is, foreign buyers account for as much of 80 percent of sales, Mr. Danús said. Most of the foreign buyers come from Brazil, Argentina and the United States.
Wine country also attracts retirees, drawn by the mild climate, Chile's diverse recreational activities and home prices that are lower than those in some other South American countries. The vineyard properties are often converted into boutique hotels or bed-and-breakfasts, agents said.
The weakening of the peso against the dollar has made Chilean real estate more affordable for United States citizens, Mr. Ridgway said. While the 10-year average is about 550 pesos to the dollar, the current rate is closer to 670 pesos, and earlier this year it reached 730 pesos to the dollar, a recent high.
BUYING BASICS
Real estate prices are typically listed in Unidad de Fomento (UF), a form of currency tied to the Chilean peso, but adjusted for inflation to provide more consistent prices.
There are no restrictions on foreigners owning property, except in border areas. But it is almost impossible for a nonresident to obtain a mortgage; most foreigners buy in cash, agents said.
Over all, it is "a really simple process," Mr. Olivos said. But agents recommend hiring a lawyer to track the process and ensure the property is free of debts or liens. Agents are also unregulated, making it important to find one with a proven track record, Mr. Danús said.
A notary handles the bulk of the transaction details. Once the seller and buyer agree on the price and title is confirmed, the full purchase price is held in the form of escrow until approved by the government property registration agency, the Conservador de Bienes Raices, Mr. Ridgway said.

TAXES AND FEES
Closing costs for buyers usually total about 4 percent to 5 percent of the purchase price, Mr. Ridgway said. Those costs include 2 percent to 3 percent for agent fees, the notary's fee and a registration fee of about $350 to $800.
Property tax on this property is less than $3,000 a year, Mr. Ridgway said.

Full text:   Shares fell on Friday as investor nervousness increased after a nuclear test by North Korea, and comments from officials at the Federal Reserve led investors to think that interest rates might be raised sooner.
North Korea conducted its fifth and biggest nuclear test and said it had mastered the ability to mount a warhead on a ballistic missile, increasing a threat to its rivals.
Stocks on Wall Street were also hit after Eric Rosengren, the Boston Federal Reserve president, said the central bank faced increasing risks if it waited too much longer to raise interest rates. He indicated that while a slowdown overseas remained a concern, the United States economy had proved resilient and could even overheat if Fed policy remained unchanged for too much longer.
The tone was softened by Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor, who said he wanted to see more evidence of sustained growth in inflation before raising rates.
Still, the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 400 points, or 2.13 percent, to 18,085.45. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 53.49 points, or 2.45 percent, to 2,127.81 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 133.58 points, or 2.54 percent, to 5,125.91.
It was the second-largest weekly drop for the Dow this year, and the largest for the S.&P. 500 since early February.
"There are lots of reasons for people to get nervous, particularly with the market at all-time highs. There's enough negative to tip things over to people taking some profits there," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corporation in Chicago.
The Fed holds its two-day policy meeting on Sept. 20-21. The perceived chances of a September rate increased climbed to 24 percent after the Fed comments, according to CME's FedWatch tool, from 18 percent the previous day.
The dollar rose after Mr. Rosengren's remarks raised expectations of a near-term increase in interest rates. The dollar index, which tracks the United States currency against a basket of six other currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 95.31. The euro fell 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.12.
"This is more about central banks than anything else; there's a rising expectation of inflation as well as what seems to be a modest shift within central banks for a little bit steeper yield curve," said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia.
Kroger was the latest grocery chain to give a disappointing outlook, though its shares pared losses late in the day to end up 0.6 percent. Outlooks from Sprouts Farmers Market and Supervalu this week also disappointed investors.
Utilities were down 3.8 percent and telecommunications shares fell more than 3.4 percent. The sectors have been strong performers on the year as investors have been drawn to their high dividends because of low interest rates.
German exports fell sharply in July, shrinking the overall trade surplus for the fourth consecutive month -- something not seen since 1992 in the eurozone's largest economy.
The yield on benchmark German debt turned positive for the first time since July 22 and ended at 0.02 percent.
Oil prices pulled back after surging more than 4 percent on Thursday. Brent crude oil fell 4.4 percent to $47.80 a barrel, still up 2 percent this week, and American crude retreated 4.2 percent to $45.63.
Gold, at $1,327 an ounce, was down 0.8 percent for the day.

Abstract: More than a decade ago, in 2004, federal agents, search warrants in hand, swooped into the company's offices in eight states, closing schools briefly as they hunted for evidence of fraud related to student recruitment, enrollment, dropout rates, grade inflation, loans, and reported job placements and salaries. For-profit colleges were a magnet for billions of dollars in federal student loans and grants to low-income students.

Full text:   Doors were bolted shut and parking lots emptied at ITT Technical Institutes around the country this week after the chain of for-profit colleges announced it was closing for good.
At some campuses, though, this was not the first time students and employees found themselves locked out. More than a decade ago, in 2004, federal agents, search warrants in hand, swooped into the company's offices in eight states, closing schools briefly as they hunted for evidence of fraud related to student recruitment, enrollment, dropout rates, grade inflation, loans, and reported job placements and salaries.
The collapse of ITT, one of the nation's largest for-profit educational chains, may have seemed sudden, coming less than two weeks after the Education Department -- citing financial instability and the likely loss of accreditation -- barred the parent company from enrolling new students using federal funds. But the unraveling stretches further back, to a time when ITT was a Wall Street darling, raking in record profits.
"It has been a long time coming," said Carrie Wofford, president of the nonprofit Veterans Education Success and the former senior counsel to a Senate committee investigating for-profit colleges. There was "a lack of fair play that was particularly true at ITT and some others."
Founded at the end of World War II as part of the original International Telephone & Telegraph, the career schools operation split off into an independent, publicly traded corporation in the mid-1990s. The switch came as liberals and conservatives began a wholehearted embrace of privatization on the theory that professionally managed, profit-oriented businesses could do a better job of delivering public services than nonprofits or the government.
Investors, thinking that the for-profit education sector was the next big thing, swarmed.
With transformations in the economy, more and more working adults were turning to training programs where factory hands could learn to use computers or home health care aides could earn a nursing degree. Providers like ITT Technical Institutes held out the promise, not just of a good job for eager young prospects, but of steady growth in enrollment and revenue as well.
From 2000 to 2003, the sector outran every other on Wall Street. Publicly traded post-secondary-education shares climbed 460 percent, according to one analysis, compared with a 24 percent loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Some mutual fund managers boasted that the schools' owner, ITT, had been their most profitable stock.
Yet even as business was booming, troubling accusations of abusive practices in the industry like the ones that resulted in the 2004 federal raid bubbled up. That investigation, brought initially by the United States attorney's office in Houston, was ultimately closed, but suspicions continued to trail ITT and other for-profit giants.
The next year, ITT agreed to a $725,000 settlement with California after employees revealed that the company inflated grades to qualify students for state financial aid. Several investors, convinced company officials had lied to them, filed securities fraud lawsuits.
A major grievance was that the industry was overselling programs that left enrollees with deep debt and degrees that had little value in the job market. Students weren't the only potential victims; so were taxpayers.
The company said it was more concerned with the present than the past.
"We're involved in the complicated and heart-wrenching process of closing our academic institutions after approximately 50 years of outstanding service to students and employers who hire them," said Nicole Elam, a spokeswoman for ITT Technical Institutes. "When students have been abruptly forced into the streets and employees' livelihood ripped from them," she added, "regurgitating unproven allegations as a means to justify this horrific end is shameless."
For-profit colleges were a magnet for billions of dollars in federal student loans and grants to low-income students. In 2010, they gobbled up more than $32 billion, a quarter of all federal financial aid, nearly double their share less than a decade earlier, the Senate committee inquiry found. Hundreds of millions more flowed in from the Pentagon and veterans' programs through the G.I. Bill.
For ITT, the total haul in federal dollars that year equaled $1.1 billion. Absent that steady stream of public funds, these privately managed businesses would collapse.
With Wall Street demanding steady growth, the pressure on the company's managers was relentless. The chain was adding eight to 10 new campuses a year, according to the Senate committee. Former employees said recruiters pushed to enroll more and more students -- regardless of their preparation, chances of graduating or ability to repay their loans -- even as the company pared instructional costs and raised tuition to increase profits.
Although the investigations temporarily depressed ITT's stock, within a few years, the company was soaring to new heights thanks to an otherwise disastrous development: the Great Recession.
As employers shed workers, many more people returned to school, taking on enormous debts in the hope of bolstering their credentials and skills and improving their chances on the job market.
Profits took off, but so did disenchantment with the industry. Aggrieved students, graduates who found their degrees of little value, even insiders who became whistle-blowers turned to online websites and watchdog groups. Many filed complaints with state prosecutors and regulators, the Education Department and lawmakers.
They reported deceptive marketing; strong-arm recruitment tactics; misleading information about costs, courses, graduation and job placement rates; inflated enrollment numbers; bait-and-switch schemes; subpar instruction; and more.
Ms. Wofford of Veterans Education Success said that every time the government tried to clamp down on an abuse, some for-profit colleges would come up with a scheme to circumvent the rule, like a private loan program set up by ITT to keep the pipeline of federal funds flowing.
"There's a perniciousness that's disturbing," Ms. Wofford said.
Some employees tried to change company practices. Rodney Lipscomb, the former dean of academic affairs at an ITT campus in Tallahassee, Fla., said he was on the job six months, "when I really started to say something's not right."
Hired in the spring of 2011, he was disturbed by the aggressive recruitment, something he had never seen during his two decades at public educational institutions. Former students returned to the school, stunned by letters demanding payment for high-interest loans they knew nothing about. Worst of all, he said, staff members would then persuade those same students to re-enroll in unrelated programs and take on even more debt as a way of deferring the loans that were already due.
He started filing reports, detailing his concerns.
"I really believed at that time, I could fix it if I got to the right folks," said Mr. Lipscomb, who now works for a community college in Texas. "But the higher I reported up the chain, the worse the environment got for me."
Finally he was told a lawyer from the company's headquarters in Indiana and the district manager were coming to Florida to meet with him. "I was very happy," he said. "I thought they were going to take action."
Instead, Mr. Lipscomb said, they told him that if he continued to report his complaints, he would be fired.
In 2015, he was. He has since filed a whistle-blower suit against ITT Technical Institutes in federal court, accusing the company of defrauding the government of money and wrongful termination.
Beyond the spate of private lawsuits, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and 19 states have either investigated or sued ITT. The Education Department actively monitored the company's finances starting in 2014. But it was last month's ban on enrolling new students with federal funds that delivered the death blow.
Now many current as well as former students have been left stranded.
"This has a huge impact on my life," said Chris Blank, a 31-year-old former Marine who was studying electrical engineering at an ITT campus in California. "I relied on G.I. benefits. They are all basically wasted and I can't get any of those back."

Full text:   BRASÍLIA -- At one heated moment in the impeachment trial of Dilma Rousseff, a powerful senator pushing for her ouster decided that some of his outspoken female colleagues in the chamber needed scolding.
"Calm down, girls," the senator, Cássio Cunha Lima, part of a political dynasty from northeastern Brazil, told Senators Vanessa Grazziotin and Gleisi Hoffmann, both supporters of Ms. Rousseff, Brazil's first female president. His remark drew sharp rebukes from the two women.
"Men believe they are the owners of this space, as if we're just here by chance," said Ms. Grazziotin, 55, a prominent leftist senator from Amazonas State.
For senators like Ms. Grazziotin, the episode reflected the emboldening of conservative voices after the impeachment of Ms. Rousseff, who argued that she had been the target of misogynistic attacks by opponents. Female politicians across Brazil are debating what her downfall means in a political realm dominated by men.
Despite the inroads made by Ms. Rousseff and others, Brazil ranks remarkably low in the representation of women in politics. Of the 513 members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Brazilian Congress, 51 are women, placing the country 155th in the world in the percentage of women elected to the lower house of a national legislature, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. It trails places like Saudi Arabia and Turkmenistan.
The administration of Michel Temer, Ms. Rousseff's successor -- a former ally who emerged victorious in the power struggle to oust her -- is doing little to assuage fears that women will be sidelined. Upon taking office more than three months ago, Mr. Temer named an all-male cabinet in a country where just 48 percent of the population of 206 million is male.
Depicting a 1950s-style suburban idyll in which a gray-haired president is greeted by his spouse, a much younger housewife, the cover of this month's edition of the Brazilian magazine Piauí captured the cultural shift to the right embodied by Mr. Temer, 75, whose wife, Marcela, a soft-spoken former beauty pageant contestant, is 42 years younger.
Throughout the impeachment proceedings, female allies of Ms. Rousseff's in Congress argued that the way her impeachment was carried out reflected a political establishment in which women were still supposed to serve as accessories to powerful men. A new wave of vitriolic positioning against female politicians like Ms. Rousseff is fueling these concerns.
During the impeachment trial, for instance, Jaufran Siqueira, a socially conservative politician in the northeastern city of Natal, seized on a new idea for gaining votes.
"This is what will happen to feminists when Jaufran is elected," Mr. Siqueira, 25, proclaimed alongside a photograph he posted on his campaign's Facebook page, showing a house engulfed in flames.
"I can't deny that I oppose the feminist movement," said Mr. Siqueira, a real estate broker who emerged into the national spotlight with his campaign. "But it's absurd to claim I'm going to set fire to women." He said the photo had been merely "a joke."
Despite the increasing tensions, female political leaders in Brazil remain far from unanimous on whether Ms. Rousseff was driven from office because of her gender.
Marina Silva, the former maid who is a leading contender for the 2018 presidential election, said in an interview that Ms. Rousseff's ouster was rooted in incompetence and deeply flawed policy making, referring to charges that she manipulated the federal budget to conceal economic problems.
"My understanding is that Dilma's budget maneuvers were illegal," said Ms. Silva, 58, an environmentalist, who repeatedly clashed with Ms. Rousseff when both were ministers in the cabinet of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers' Party.
"Conservatives are getting more vociferous on a global level -- just look at Trump in the United States," said Ms. Silva, referring to Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, who, when asked if he had met Ms. Rousseff, responded: "No. Who is he?"
"This doesn't mean that women won't play a crucial role in Brazilian politics after Dilma's impeachment," Ms. Silva said. "Of course we will. We have too much momentum now to stop us."
As campaigning intensifies for municipal elections, other leaders at different points on Brazil's ideological spectrum echoed such views.
"I don't see this moment as something that disappoints the aspirations of Brazilian women," said Teresa Surita, a supporter of Ms. Rousseff's ouster, who is running for re-election as the mayor of Boa Vista, a city in the Brazilian Amazon.
Ms. Surita, 60, who has battled graft charges, said she remained committed to improving life in her city. A member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the centrist party of Mr. Temer, she said that achieving her goals involved maintaining smooth ties with the federal government in the capital, Brasília.
"I have to be aware of the need for support from the federal government, regardless of who is in power," she said.
While women hold only one-tenth of the seats in the lower house of Congress, a more complex picture may be emerging at the local level. For instance, 51 cities have only women running for mayor this year, according to the Superior Electoral Court, and women account for nearly 33 percent of the candidates for City Council seats this year.
Women are also gaining positions of prominence in the judiciary. Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha, 62, a supporter of affirmative action, gay rights and fewer abortion restrictions, is rising this month to become the chief justice of Brazil.
Still, others contend that Ms. Rousseff's ouster revealed the ugly workings of Brazil's male-dominated political scene. As large protests flare against Mr. Temer's administration, especially on the streets of São Paulo, Brazil's largest city, thousands of women are voicing opposition to the new government.
"Temer took out Dilma because a man doesn't like to answer to a woman, and as president, she was the one telling them what to do," said Rayra Lima de Araújo, 14, a high school student who attended the antigovernment protests on Sunday with her mother, Maria da Cruz Lima, 43, an unemployed nurse.
Taking the stand during her impeachment trial, Ms. Rousseff argued that her male counterparts did not have to contend with the same attacks on their character.
"I've always been described as a hard-charging woman in the midst of delicate men," she said. "I never saw a man accused of being hard-charging, and we know that they are."
But even Ms. Rousseff's Workers' Party, once one of Latin America's most powerful political parties, is grappling with an internal debate over sexism as it tries to reinvent itself.
Leaders in the party came under intense scrutiny this year after secret recordings revealed a range of explicitly sexist banter, including crude jokes by Mr. da Silva, the former president, about top female party members.
Míriam Leitão, an economic historian and one of Brazil's most influential columnists, said the Workers' Party was using the debate over women in politics to try to discredit the impeachment process because it cost the party the presidency it had held for more than 13 years.
"Dilma didn't fall because she is a woman," Ms. Leitão wrote in her column in the newspaper O Globo. "She produced a surge in inflation, a recession of historical significance, and lost her job."

Abstract: With Mr. Modi preparing for contentious local elections, some observers have said the government did not want Mr. Rajan to stay because it needed a looser monetary policy to bolster growth.

Full text:   MUMBAI, India -- Three years before the 2008 global financial crisis, an Indian economist named Raghuram G. Rajan presciently warned a skeptical audience of top economic thinkers that excessive risk threatened the entire global financial system.
As Mr. Rajan stepped down on Sunday as India's top central banker, following intense criticism at home, he offered a new warning: Low interest rates globally could distort markets and would be difficult to abandon.
Countries around the world, including the United States and Europe, have kept interest rates low as a way to encourage growth. But countries could become "trapped" by fear that when they eventually raised rates, they "would see growth slow down," he said.
Low interest rates should not be a substitute for "other instruments of policy" and "various kinds of reforms" that are needed to encourage growth, Mr. Rajan said in a recent interview with The New York Times. "Often when monetary policy is really easy, it becomes the residual policy of choice," he said, when deeper reforms are needed.
His warning comes at a time when the world's central banks appear to be at a loss about how to get global growth moving again. A growing number of voices say that low rates are not doing the job and that governments must take other, more politically difficult steps to reinvigorate growth.
The warning by Mr. Rajan, now 53, came as he stepped down from a position that had helped make him something of a rock star -- albeit a controversial one -- in India. He disputed the view that his tight monetary policies had cost him the support of the government, and he said that his departure was based on his inability to reach an agreement with the government on serving longer but not serving another full three-year term.
Mr. Rajan is a celebrity in a country where taxi drivers and vegetable sellers are as likely as business owners and bankers to be immersed in debate on the local economy. A blunt speaker who has laid out the case for tighter monetary policies in more than 30 public speeches over the last three years, he was called "the Ranbir Kapoor of banking," a reference to a Bollywood superstar, by one of the country's longest-running columnists.
Mr. Rajan, whose term expired on Sunday, is credited with helping stabilize the Indian economy. It was fighting double-digit inflation, a weakening of its currency and a plunging stock market when he took the job in 2013.
But he also leaves bruised after a barrage of public attacks from the political base of conservatives and small-business interests of India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party. They complained that he choked business by keeping interest rates high and requiring banks to clean up bad debts, which made credit expensive and hard to come by.
The attacks turned vicious and personal in the weeks before Mr. Rajan announced in June that he would not continue for a second term, with a B.J.P. lawmaker declaring that Mr. Rajan was "mentally not fully Indian," in part because he holds a United States green card, allowing him to work and live there. Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, later denounced the attacks, but only after Mr. Rajan said he was leaving the job.
With Mr. Modi preparing for contentious local elections, some observers have said the government did not want Mr. Rajan to stay because it needed a looser monetary policy to bolster growth. India has the fastest-growing large economy in the world, at an annual rate of 7.1 percent for the most recent quarter, but that is still far slower than the rate of a decade ago and not fast enough to create jobs for the more than one million people who enter the work force each month. Mr. Modi won election in 2014 promising economic growth and jobs.
Mr. Rajan, leaning back in his chair and laughing at times during the interview, disputed that claim.
"I don't think it's fair to say that it's because of tight policy that the government wanted to move on," he said.
He cited the government's move after he announced his departure to set a low inflation target of 4 percent for the next five years. He said his successor, Urjit Patel, a central bank deputy governor who takes over this week, played an important role in setting the country's tough inflation targets.
Mr. Modi has said little in public about Mr. Rajan's departure except to defend him as "someone who loves his country" and "will continue to serve it." Mr. Modi's spokesman declined in a telephone interview on Sunday to explain why Mr. Rajan was leaving, other than to say: "There is a tenure and the tenure has ended. Why should the prime minister of India even be brought into this discussion?"
Mr. Rajan said his tight monetary policy had helped bring India's rate of inflation -- currently about 6 percent -- down to the upper end of the government's target range. "I think we've done exactly what was needed," he said. Mr. Rajan said the central bank should continue to prioritize low inflation.
He said he hoped the country would finish "the process of bank cleanup which is underway." Under Mr. Rajan, India's banks, after decades of loose lending to corporations, had to own up to bad debts. The restriction was intended to shore up the long-term stability of banks, but in the short term it has reduced the pace of lending to businesses.
In discussing the Indian economy in the interview, Mr. Rajan offered a less-than-ringing endorsement of the government's emphasis on manufacturing in India -- what the prime minister has called his Make in India campaign.
Mr. Rajan said he did not support the view of critics that it was too late in world economic history for India to become a manufacturing hub. But he also said that he would not focus exclusively on manufacturing as the solution to joblessness.
If India improves infrastructure and reduces government regulations, manufacturing might take off in a big way, but it "could also be services. It could be value-added agriculture also."
Although China's economy has overshadowed India's in recent decades, Mr. Rajan said he was still a believer in democracy as the better system to create long-term growth.
"India's strengths to some extent comes also from its democracy," he said. "Things can get bad in India, but not beyond a certain point, because the democratic process asserts itself. And we have a change in government."
Mr. Rajan, who served as chief economist of the International Monetary Fund from 2003 to 2006, will return to his longtime job as a professor at the University of Chicago's business school.
He grew momentarily wistful when comparing the job of central bank governor with his past positions, which were more advisory.
"So better to be a doer than an adviser. Of course being an adviser sometimes has effects, important effects, but you don't see it as much immediately. Here you can see what you're doing and in the years to come."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Is EpiPen a Brand-Name or a Generic Drug? Mylan Describes It Both Ways

Abstract: Since Mylan bought the drug in 2007, it has raised the price sixfold -- to about $600, from $100.

Full text:   The drug company Mylan has profited richly from its exclusive right to sell EpiPen, the severe allergy treatment. Recent price increases on the product have rendered it unaffordable for many, leading to a public outcry.
But despite its monopoly on the product, Mylan has been telling an American agency for years that EpiPen is a generic, federal officials say, most likely leading state Medicaid programs to overpay for the product by tens of millions of dollars. If a medicine is considered a generic instead of a brand-name drug, the company can give a smaller discount to the states.
The classification of the EpiPen added a new wrinkle to the intense scrutiny Mylan faces over its pricing of the device. It also raised questions about how closely the federal government was overseeing the pricing of drugs paid for through government health programs.
Since Mylan bought the drug in 2007, it has raised the price sixfold -- to about $600, from $100. The price increases have led to widespread criticism and inquiries from a number of elected officials. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, cited the product as she unveiled a proposal on Friday to curb excessive price increases on drugs, in part by setting up a special team of federal officials to monitor prices.
Mylan has sought to address the criticism by saying it will offer more financial assistance with out-of-pocket costs and will expand the number of uninsured patients who can get free EpiPens. It also said it would introduce a generic version with a lower list price, an unusual move since Mylan is still the only company that can sell the product.
The latest development, first reported by Politico Pro, prompted a fresh round of outrage on Friday, as some wondered how a company benefiting from its lock on the product could also be calling it a generic.
"You can't have it both ways," said Matt Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, who estimated that the overpayments could total tens of millions of dollars. "You're either a brand or a generic."
He said the issue emerged after his organization began polling its members over the effect of the EpiPen price increases on state Medicaid programs, which serve poor people. Around the same time, a handful of senators sent a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees Medicaid, asking similar questions.
The classification is significant because owners of generic drugs pay rebates of 13 percent of the average manufacturers' price. But manufacturers of brand-name drugs must offer discounts of about 23 percent off that average price, or the difference between the average price and the best price they have negotiated with any other American payer, whichever gives the bigger discount. In addition, brand-name manufacturers must pay more in rebates if their products' prices rise faster than inflation, as EpiPen's did.
EpiPen's designation as a generic dates back decades to when it was owned by Dey Laboratories and a Medicaid services official reasoned that it was "entirely fitting and proper" to consider EpiPen a generic, according to a 1997 letter that was cited in the Politico story. EpiPen contains epinephrine, a drug that is available as a cheap generic, but Mylan has the exclusive right to sell the drug as part of a patented auto-injector.
Mylan said in a statement that it had done nothing wrong and that it believed longstanding federal guidelines supported its conclusion that EpiPen was a "non-innovator" product, but it declined to provide details of its reasoning.
Shares in the company fell 4 percent on Friday. In the last two weeks, when the attention on EpiPen's pricing has been most intense, the shares have fallen a total of about 15 percent.
This year, the federal government issued a rule that requires all companies with drugs that have been approved under what the Food and Drug Administration calls a new drug application to either reclassify them as brand-name drugs or seek a waiver. In its statement, Mylan said it planned to seek such a waiver.
Mylan was one of several companies that objected to the proposed rule before it was completed, arguing that it was a reversal of longstanding policy and that many older products did not benefit from the same patent protections and market exclusivity as other branded products.
How many other drugs are similarly being misclassified is unclear. The Medicaid agency did not respond to a question on the topic.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, was one of the senators who wrote a letter asking the Medicaid agency for more information. Her daughter has severe allergies and relies on the EpiPen. If many other drugs are similarly misclassified, she said, the financial impact could be huge.
"It just seems like we opened up a powder keg here, potentially, if in fact this is not only with Mylan but is just par for the course," Ms. Klobuchar said. "The government has to go back and review all these drugs, and the practice has to stop."

Abstract: [...]the unchanged unemployment rate points to a remarkably stable pattern.

Full text:   The new August jobs report is a prime example of data that affirms the status quo. And that's not such a bad thing.
Nearly everything about the latest data from the Labor Department on Friday aligns with the basic trajectory the economy has been on for years now. We have been seeing steady improvement without signs of overheating. The new numbers fit that story precisely.
Indeed, the report is so consistent with the longstanding evidence of how the economy is doing that we probably wouldn't care much at all about the August numbers if the Federal Reserve weren't on the precipice of raising interest rates at its September policy meeting.
If there's good news in the report, it's not that the economy is doing any better than we thought, but rather that the numbers are consistent enough with expectations that bond traders can head to the Hamptons or wherever they plan to spend their Labor Day break. The Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, and her colleagues can safely do the same.
The status quo in this case is pretty solid. The 151,000 jobs that United States employers added in August is far below the gaudy 275,000 added in July, but the more recent number is more consistent with what you would expect in an economy already getting close to full employment. The July number is more what you expect during the recovery from a recession, not when most of the people who want a job already have one.
In terms of more data that affirms the status quo: Previous months' data was revised down by a minuscule 1,000 jobs; the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent. The proportion of the population that is in the labor force was unchanged, as was the proportion of the United States adult population with a job. Average hourly earnings rose by a not-very-impressive 0.1 percent.
The fine print of the new numbers tilts even more clearly away from the Fed's pulling the trigger on an interest rate increase when its policy committee meets Sept. 20-21 than the headline numbers do.
Fed officials are on watch for evidence that the tighter labor market is feeding through into broad-based price rises, which might over time lead to inflation above the Fed's 2 percent target. If anything, the August numbers pointed the opposite direction.
That 0.1 percent increase in average hourly earnings was not impressive. It was a 3-cent increase in average hourly pay for private sector workers, to $25.73 an hour, which represents a 2.4 percent gain over the last year. Year-over-year pay raises have been larger many times in this expansion, meaning that number doesn't point to some acceleration in wage growth, but rather is, again, in line with the longstanding pattern.
More concerning, the average workweek actually fell in August, to 34.3 hours from 34.4. It could be an aberration and isn't a big deal on its own. But if the job market were bursting at the seams, you would expect employers to be asking their workers to put in more hours, not fewer.
Moreover, when you combine the shorter workweek with the very small hourly wage gain, average weekly earnings actually fell in August, dropping 0.2 percent to $882.54. Again, it's nothing to panic over -- but also evidence that the economy isn't overheating in a way that the Fed needs to worry about.
Finally, the unchanged unemployment rate points to a remarkably stable pattern. The jobless rate has hovered between 4.7 percent and 5.1 percent for more than a year now. While on the face of it, that might seem disappointing (after all, the rate has gotten down to 4 percent at times in the past), the fact that it isn't doing so should be a good sign that the economy isn't bursting at the seams. The number of people not in the labor force -- neither working nor looking for work -- actually rose slightly, up by 78,000 in August.
Add it all up, and the new jobs numbers point to an economic recovery that is stable, steady and not entering a danger zone that might prompt the Fed to worry too much about being behind the curve on interest rate increases. Ms. Yellen, and the traders who obsess over her every move, should plan to enjoy the long weekend.

Full text:   Good. But not too good.
That is the verdict from economists after the Labor Department reported on Friday that in August employers added 151,000 jobs, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent, and wage gains were modest. It was a solid performance that keeps the economy on track, but not strong enough to push the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate when policy makers meet this month.
"It confirms that the economy is performing well, but does not provide the threat of overheating that might have caused an interest-rate increase sooner rather than later," said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust.
Since the financial crisis, the Fed has raised interest rates just once, in December, from near zero. Low rates are intended to encourage businesses to borrow and invest, but Fed policy makers are now split between those who worry that reducing this economic stimulus would undermine growth and those who fear that waiting could allow inflation to take hold.
Republicans and Democrats mined the report for evidence that supported the economic arguments they will make through the November election. How to handle a recovery that has delivered steady but less than spectacular growth has not only been a flash point among Fed bankers -- who will next meet on Sept. 20 and 21 -- but also between the presidential candidates Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton.
For the Trump campaign, which has suggested that recent employment figures have understated the dire state of the labor market, the decline in manufacturing jobs was another sign that the policies of the Obama administration were leaving blue-collar workers behind. Mr. Trump, a Republican, has also railed against trade deals, blaming them for jobs lost to Mexico and China, as part of his strategy to appeal to disaffected white, working-class voters.
"The latest economic numbers from the past day paint a bleak picture," said Curtis Ellis, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump.
Hoping to attract those same working-class voters, Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, has proposed public investments in infrastructure like roads, affordable housing and renewable energy. Jacob Leibenluft, an economic adviser to the Clinton campaign, said that she was focused on dealing with "the challenge of not enough good-paying jobs and the general sense of economic insecurity that persists."
At the same time, Democrats have pointed to the positive signs in the overall economy, highlighting sturdy job growth in the private sector that has lasted a record 78 months, and a low jobless rate.
Some economists say that a recovery as modest and uneven as this one would normally add to the problems for the incumbent political party, but the unorthodox nature of Mr. Trump's candidacy could help Mrs. Clinton overcome the odds.
"A kind of ho-hum status quo economy might not have been good enough for Clinton against a normal Republican candidate," Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said. "But against Trump maybe it will be enough."
The jobless rate, based on a separate survey of households, stayed at 4.9 percent, roughly half of what it was seven years ago, and consumer spending remains healthy. But a broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged and underemployed workers is nearly twice that figure.
Wages have only recently begun to climb. The 12-month increase was a modest 2.4 percent in August, slower than in the previous month but a pace that keeps most workers ahead of inflation.
Another report released on Friday offered more encouraging news, showing that the United States trade deficit shrank sharply, by 11.6 percent in July from the previous month, because of an increase in American exports.
Earlier, monthly job gains flip-flopped, plummeting to 24,000 in May and swelling to more than 10 times that number in June and July.
As Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez said, "Sometimes the porridge is really hot; sometimes the porridge is really cold; this one is in between."
Revised estimates from the Labor Department left the hearty totals from the previous two reports little changed and took the three-month average of monthly job gains to 232,000 after big gains of 271,000 in June and 275,000 in July. The August estimate is subject to two more revisions.
Economists, who estimate that the nation needs about 100,000 new jobs every month to keep up with population growth, say it is natural for the jobs machine to slow as the pool of unemployed workers gradually dries up.
Still, large numbers of prime-age workers remain out of the labor market altogether, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots and depressing wage gains.
"A lot of people are still on the bench that could come into the labor market," said Ken Esch, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC, an accounting and consulting network. "Until more people are participating, I don't see the inflationary pressures, and our data says we don't expect to see much over the next 12 months."
A recent PwC survey of private companies found that fewer than half of respondents planned to add positions in the next 12 months, a decrease from the first quarter of 2016, and that companies expected to increase wages, but by less than 3 percent. Retirements in the baby boom generation are also playing a role in keeping wage gains modest.
"You have many young, inexperienced workers joining the work force today, and many older workers at the peak of their earnings retiring," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor Economic Research. "That churning is pulling the average wage down."
Diversity in wage growth is wide. "Most of the best gains are in skilled jobs, like tech, health care and finance," Mr. Chamberlain said. "There are very poor wage gains in many blue-collar professions, especially manufacturing and energy," two areas that have also been shedding jobs.
Ian Siegel, a founder and the chief executive of ZipRecruiter, which distributes job postings primarily from small and midsize businesses, said he had noticed that "the number of jobs posted stayed flat, but there's been a shift in mix," with a "big increase in medium-skilled jobs."
His observations are in line with a report released last month by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that found the American economy was creating more middle-income jobs, basically defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as those paying $30,000 to $60,000 a year.
"The tide has begun to turn," William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said when the report was released. "For the first time in quite a while, we are seeing gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide."
Dan Finnigan, chief executive of Jobvite, a recruiting service used by start-ups, said the tightening job market might be prying open more opportunities for younger workers. "I'm hearing without a doubt that employers are taking more risks and are forced to hire less experienced people for jobs," he said.
In his view, older workers who were able to delay retirement when the recession hit did so, blocking more junior employees from moving up the pipeline. That clog is finally beginning to clear.
The growing number of retirees accounts to some degree for the droopy labor force participation rate, offsetting the number of sidelined workers who have rejoined the labor force, Jason Furman, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said.
At the same time, Mr. Furman acknowledged that a large proportion of prime-age workers, 25 to 54, particularly men, remained outside the circle of work. This group's participation rate, now at 88 percent, started slipping decades ago, he said, but the decline in the United States has been much sharper than in advanced Western European economies.
"That leads me to the conclusion that it is not caused by technology but is a result of institutional and policy choices we've made as a country," Mr. Furman said. "For women, we do very little to subsidize child care or make workplaces flexible. When it comes to men, we spend very little money to train people for jobs or find jobs."
Jonas Prising, chairman and chief executive of the ManpowerGroup, one of the largest recruiters in the United States, agreed that low participation rates were troubling, despite the improving labor market. "It may look like full employment," he said, "but it's not full employment."

Abstract: KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day 0.3 percent lower and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.2 percent. The biggest losses have gone to phone and utility companies, while concerns over drug prices have affected health care stocks.

Full text:   United States markets closed lower on Wednesday, wrapping up a quiet month, as energy companies fell with the price of oil and as makers of chemicals and other materials took losses. A survey of private employers showed that hiring continued at a solid pace in August.
KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day 0.3 percent lower and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.2 percent. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 0.2 percent.
JOBS DATA Private American businesses added 177,000 jobs in August, according to a survey by the payroll processor ADP. After weak hiring this spring, results from July and August suggest employers are bringing on workers at a healthy clip. The federal government will release its own jobs figures on Friday, and analysts expect a gain of 180,000 jobs. Investors think the Federal Reserve is more likely to raise interest rates later this year if hiring stays solid.
TAXED The tax preparer H&R Block reported a bigger first-quarter loss and less revenue than analysts had expected. The company recently sold its bank business, which reduced revenue. H&R Block stock dropped 10.5 percent.
SOUR LIQUOR SALES Shares of Brown-Forman, the maker of liquors including Jack Daniel's whiskey and Finlandia vodka, slumped after its sales fell short of estimates. Brown-Forman said its results were hurt by weak sales in emerging markets and the strong dollar, which makes American goods more expensive overseas. The stock declined 3.5 percent.
ENERGY Energy prices slumped after the government said that crude oil stockpiles increased by 2.3 million barrels last week, a bigger gain than analysts had expected. Gasoline stockpiles shrank, but not as much as investors had hoped.
Benchmark United States crude oil fell $1.73, to $44.62. It fell 63 cents on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, fell $1.37, to $47 a barrel.
Chevron stock gave up 1.1 percent, and shares of Exxon Mobil lost 0.5 percent. Schlumberger declined 2 percent.
DOG DAYS OF SUMMER Stocks closed out the month of August declining five consecute days, but they are still not far from record highs. The S.&P. 500 has risen for five months in a row but may end August down slightly. The biggest losses have gone to phone and utility companies, while concerns over drug prices have affected health care stocks. Banks have risen the most as investors grow more optimistic that interest rates will increase.
EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX closed down 0.6 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent. The FTSE 100 dropped 0.6 percent in Britain.
EUROPEAN VIEW Economic data out of the eurozone was relatively downbeat, suggesting that the currency bloc's central bank could soon do the opposite of the Fed: produce more stimulus, rather than tighten rates. Inflation in the eurozone was stuck at a low 0.2 percent annual rate in August, and unemployment also showed no improvement at a high 10.1 percent.
ASIA'S DAY The Nikkei 225 gained 1 percent in Japan, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng lost 0.2 percent. The Shanghai composite index added 0.4 percent in China. The Kospi was down 0.3 percent in South Korea.
BONDS AND CURRENCIES Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 1.57 percent. The dollar rose to 103.44 yen from 102.97 yen. The euro fell to $1.1144 from $1.1139.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: To help create a flood of new business investment and jobs, the Trump plan would reduce corporate tax rates to 15 percent while eliminating or capping many tax deductions. Mrs. Clinton wants to go in the opposite direction, depressing job growth with an uncompetitive corporate tax rate, higher taxes on estates and short-term capital gains, and a 4 percent surtax on the most successful individuals.

Full text:   This year, the media has been focused largely on the election process -- campaign managers, speaking styles, every slip and misstep. That's been entertaining, but the policy differences between the two sides are much more important, and the most crucial difference may be over economic policy.
Donald J. Trump has campaigned very clearly for change -- a policy upheaval to promote faster growth, repair the economic stagnation and end the corrupt pay-to-play system that favors the well heeled. Hillary Clinton has pledged to extend and build on the policies of the Obama administration.
There is no doubt who has the better plan. Our economy is growing at only 1.1 percent per year, a fraction of our average rate, and the Congressional Budget Office forecasts just 2 percent annual growth (in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product) for the next 10 years.
Yes, we went through a deep recession, but it ended in 2009. The recovery has been the weakest in decades, and the first that has actually pushed median incomes down. Business investment and profits are lower now than a year ago. Counterproductive federal policies squash small businesses with inane regulatory sprawl that affects hiring, taxes, credit and medical care.
The result is a stagnant economy that leaves out millions of Americans who would like to work and get ahead, and a devastating report card on the Obama White House.
To restart growth, Mr. Trump would immediately lower tax rates, including for middle-income voters, and simplify the tax code. Americans would be able to exempt average child-care expenses from taxes, and Mr. Trump's administration would eliminate the death tax, which falls especially hard on some small businesses and farmers.
To help create a flood of new business investment and jobs, the Trump plan would reduce corporate tax rates to 15 percent while eliminating or capping many tax deductions. This would simplify the tax system, making us much more competitive with countries and a magnet for new jobs.
Mrs. Clinton wants to go in the opposite direction, depressing job growth with an uncompetitive corporate tax rate, higher taxes on estates and short-term capital gains, and a 4 percent surtax on the most successful individuals.
She insists that the Trump plan will cause a bigger deficit and a recession, but she is basing that on her party's view that tax rates don't matter much to growth and investment; Mr. Trump knows they do. The Moody's study Mrs. Clinton cites so often says Mr. Trump's plan would cause higher fiscal deficits but would also create faster growth and a surge in new jobs. It assumes that the Fed would raise interest rates to over 6 percent, causing a recession it attributes to Mr. Trump. A much more likely outcome is faster growth without the spike in interest rates or a recession.
Mr. Trump agrees with those who are concerned about the national debt. He wants to help the private sector to grow faster and to create a debt limit that would rein in our debt-to-G.D.P. ratio, which has skyrocketed under President Obama.
Critics of tax cuts say the government can't afford his plan. But what the economy can't afford is the current inept tax system, slow growth and Mrs. Clinton's $1.1 trillion in tax hikes.
Mr. Trump would immediately halt the crush of new federal regulations on business. In 2015 alone, the Obama administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations -- hidden taxes that add a lead weight on our businesses. To grow faster, the economy has to have relief from this central planning and regulatory overreach. And Mr. Trump would seek consumer choice in education and health care and a repeal of Obamacare.
The scant economic gains in the past eight years are even weaker for most Americans than the G.D.P. data indicates because federal policy favored gains for the haves, not the have-nots. Your prosperity is increasing if you work in finance, issuing bonds or trading currencies, or you lobby or arrange government contracts. If not, you've most likely gone backward financially.
Mr. Trump is proposing to overturn that stagnant, corrupt system. An important part of his transformation is a new trade policy that encourages American jobs rather than undercuts them. His position has been demonized by the press as protectionism, but the reality is that our trade system is broken. Bad deals harmed American workers and gave access to United States markets without achieving vital conditions like intellectual property protection in China.
The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, grew to 1,700 pages, yet still allowed Mexico to enforce its value-added tax on American products while exporting goods to the United States duty-free. The even more complicated Trans-Pacific Partnership would allow foreign companies to challenge United States laws in an international court, but it would do nothing to guarantee that countries couldn't use currency manipulation to benefit their exporters over ours.
Voters will have an opportunity to decide for or against a government that's failing on health care, taxes, trade, cost control and regulation. One candidate wants higher tax rates. The other would lower them. One candidate thinks the economic recovery has been successful whereas the other thinks it left millions of Americans out. One candidate has spent her lifetime seeking the presidency. Mr. Trump hasn't.
As Thomas Jefferson said, "A little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical." It's time for one now.

Abstract: [...]the weakness over the past year hasn't been from households -- it's been in manufacturing, in industrial businesses and in the energy and export sectors. If you look at the numbers for retail sales, for labor market participation, for inflation, there's no reason for monetary policy to tighten now.

Full text:   "Give me a one-handed economist! All my economists say, 'On the one hand . . . On the other.' "
-- President Harry S. Truman
What's ahead for the American economy?
That question is dividing experts, given that the economy has advanced at a slow pace since last winter even as the job market has recorded impressive gains.
Well, we have some one-handed economists.
On the one hand, Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, sees growth picking up smartly in the third and fourth quarter, powered by a still-strong consumer and fading headwinds for the business sector. Indeed, he believes the Federal Reserve might well raise interest rates when policy makers meet next month.
On the other hand, Stephanie Pomboy, founder of MacroMavens, an independent economics consulting firm, thinks the optimists on Wall Street are in for another round of disappointment, with the economy once again failing to deliver a much-promised, but so far elusive, acceleration.
With the Labor Department scheduled to release the latest monthly jobs report on Friday, we talked with them last week about why they see things so differently.
Why, fundamentally, has growth been so slow lately?
Ms. Pomboy: After the bursting of the housing bubble and the Great Recession, there has been a generational shift away from spending toward saving among consumers. The great consumer credit boom of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s is over. The savings rate has moved higher and this new impulse to save leads to a sluggish pace for growth. Plus, other expenses are rising for consumers, like health care and health insurance.
Mr. Gapen: I don't agree with the idea that the U.S. consumer isn't healthy. In fact, the weakness over the past year hasn't been from households -- it's been in manufacturing, in industrial businesses and in the energy and export sectors. Wage growth is firming too. We've had modest and unspectacular growth, but it's a mistake to assume slow growth is fragile growth. Given the succession of European debt crises, the sequester and fiscal cliff showdowns in the U.S., Brexit and China also slowing down, I'd say the American economy has been pretty resilient.
So what do you see for the second half of 2016?
Ms. Pomboy: I don't think there will be a second-half rebound. Growth will be the same as in the first half of the year, or even weaker. We have a monster overhang from inventories, and consumer spending will continue to disappoint. I'm not saying they will fall out of bed. I just see the status quo -- a sideways to downward churn, with a squeeze on discretionary spending. People will cut back further in discretionary spending with the huge increase in premiums for health insurance coming later this year and next year.
Mr. Gapen: I see growth of at least 2 percent or better, maybe up to the 2.5 percent range. The labor markets have sent a reassuring signal, and the industrial side of the economy is stabilizing, so that represents less of a headwind than we've seen in recent quarters. If consumers were worried about their income and employment prospects, they wouldn't be buying cars or homes the way they have been. That suggests things are O.K.
When do you expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates? Should it even be considering a rate increase?
Ms. Pomboy: They should never have raised rates in the first place last December, but I wouldn't put it past them to make another mistake next month. They're playing a dangerous game of guiding financial markets and jawboning participants, but my economic forecast in no way justifies another raise in rates. If you look at the numbers for retail sales, for labor market participation, for inflation, there's no reason for monetary policy to tighten now. And looking forward, the No. 1 input to employment growth -- profits -- has been declining for five quarters. That suggests we would be lucky to see job growth of more than 100,000 per month going forward.
Mr. Gapen: The Fed is signaling that the rebound in labor markets is real and they are ready to do one more hike by the end of the year. Whether that means September or December is up for debate. September is our call, but that's on the assumption we see hiring going up by at least 200,000 in August. If we get a strong jobs number for this month, the Fed should move and we think they will.
Given your split in views, and the broader questions about growth, what does that mean for the stock market?
Ms. Pomboy: I come back to corporate profits. People are willing to dismiss quarter after quarter of disappointing economic data and downward revisions, but a moment of truth is coming for the stock market. I have to confess this is one area I've missed in terms of the stock market continuing to rise this year. But given how far asset prices are extended, I think we could easily see a 20 percent move to the downside. You wanted a bear, you got a bear.
Mr. Gapen: Corporate profits are a legitimate issue -- but the weakness has been concentrated in manufacturing, energy and industrials. Other areas, like technology and health care, have fared better. There is a risk out there that the market is still too optimistic, but Barclays's view is that equities will move sideways for the time being.
Longer term, what is your view? Is the economy condemned to slow growth in the years, even decades ahead?
Ms. Pomboy: I believe we are in a permanent era of low growth. The consumer is inclined to save and we have an aging population that is being forced to consume health care that is rising at double-digit rates. Against this backdrop, the Fed is impotent. However, they can't admit that, so they will do more of the same -- to no avail.
Since policy makers can't abide that slow growth, the onus will shift to the fiscal side and political leadership. Reducing the corporate tax rate, reducing the regulatory burden on companies and changing the tax code to incentivize corporations to hire and expand, rather than pay dividends and buy back stock, would certainly help growth in the long term.
Mr. Gapen: I think the best we can do is 2 to 2.5 percent annually in the long run. Productivity growth is slow here, the rest of the world is growing more slowly and there is a lot of excess capacity out there, especially in China. In terms of economic output, America is the best apple in a bad bunch.
That said, there's a case to be made that more investment in education, more emphasis on retraining and retooling American workers, and more infrastructure spending would help. There are things that can be done and a well-calibrated public-sector investment plan would pay dividends in the long term.

Full text:   The children entering kindergarten and first grade this school year were not yet born when the Great Recession ended in mid-2009. Incoming high school seniors were not yet in middle school.
But in many states and localities, the wounds to school budgets from recession-era cutbacks are still large, leaving schools with more students and less money. Recent data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that as of last year, 25 states were still spending less per student than before the recession, adjusted for inflation, and cuts in seven states exceeded 10 percent. In 31 states, local government spending per student fell between 2008 and 2014, the latest data available (adjusted for inflation). It is safe to assume some improvement in recent years, but even so, there is clearly a long way to go before overall spending catches up with enrollment and inflation.
Some states, however, don't seem particularly interested in addressing the shortfalls, while others, notably California and Minnesota, have moved decisively to do so.
The difference has at least as much to do with political priorities as financial challenges. In part, persistent shortfalls in school budgets reflect the depth of the recession and the fitful recovery. To a lesser extent, they also reflect stagnation in federal help, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of school budgets.
But in states with the biggest school-budget cuts, much of the pain is self-inflicted, because they have cut income taxes in recent years, creating budget shortfalls that make it impossible to adequately finance their schools. Kansas is the most notorious for such counterproductive tax cuts; other offenders include Arizona, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. Oklahoma, in particular, is vying with its neighbor Kansas for the title of most fiscally reckless. Repeated cuts to Oklahoma's income tax have resulted in deep and chronic budget shortfalls, and yet the top tax rate went down again in January, from 5.25 percent to 5 percent. The lost revenue has been offset in part by a reduction in the amount of assistance the poorest Oklahomans can derive from the state's earned-income tax credit.
In contrast, California voters in 2012 approved increases in sales taxes and income taxes on wealthy residents. Earmarked for education, the new revenue was enough to restore much of the state's school budget, which had been cut deeply in the face of the recession. At the same time, reforms to the state's school-spending formula have directed more money to low-income schools. Minnesota raised income taxes on wealthy residents in 2013 and is using some of the revenue to bring full-day kindergarten to all school districts and help more low-income families afford preschool.
Investment in education is crucial to improving long-term productivity; conversely, failure to invest in education portends the decline of living standards over time. Some states are doing their best, and yet the challenges seem bigger than their best efforts, while others are clearly failing to rise to the challenge. The federal government could play a more constructive role in supporting the leaders and coaxing the laggards. It could offer aid to states, contingent on improvements to their school budgets. It could also earmark a portion of infrastructure spending for school building, repair and renovation, helping to make up for a devastating decline since the recession in school capital spending by states and localities.
Every child deserves a good education, but, as a new wave of kindergartners anticipate their first day of school, it is important to acknowledge that not every child is getting one.

Full text:   GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. -- Central bankers who gathered here to discuss better ways of jump-starting slow economic growth received a surprising message from their lunchtime speaker on Friday: Stop. You're making things worse.
Christopher A. Sims, a Nobel laureate in economic science, told the annual conference that increased government spending was required to lift the world's major economies from stagnation. The pursuit of innovations in monetary policy, he said, is diverting needed attention from the inaction of fiscal policy makers.
"So long as the legislature thinks it has no role in this problem, nothing is going to get done," said Mr. Sims, a professor at Princeton. The best hope, he said, "is that people at central banks are willing to say publicly that this is what is necessary."
Developed nations have leaned heavily on their central banks since the 2008 financial crisis. The United States, Europe and Japan have all relied on low interest rates to encourage increased spending by businesses and consumers even as government spending has remained relatively austere. Mr. Sims is among a growing number of experts who warn that this experiment has reached its limits.
The central banks have pushed rates to historically low levels. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have even imposed negative interest rates, effectively taxing savings to encourage spending. Yet job growth and inflation remain stubbornly weak. Benoît Coeuré, a European Central Bank official, drew laughter from the audience when he noted the "good news" that eurozone inflation had doubled last month -- from an annual rate of 0.1 percent up to 0.2 percent.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve responded to the crisis more forcefully than other central banks, and the federal government initially spent more freely. Yet here, too, growth remains slow, inflation remains weak and millions of middle-age people are no longer working.
Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, warned in a recent book, "The Only Game in Town," that time was running out. If developed nations do not increase spending and pursue structural reforms in the next few years, Mr. El-Erian predicted, they will be locked into a new reality of slower growth.
Moreover, he said central banks would be handicapped in fighting future crises -- they have little room to cut rates should economic conditions deteriorate.
"It is dangerous to continue to focus the debate on what central banks can do," Mr. El-Erian, who is also the head of President Obama's Global Development Council, wrote Saturday in an email. "What is needed -- not only in the U.S. but even more in Europe and Japan -- is a policy pivot away from excessive dependence on central banks."
Central bankers profess to regard this pessimism as overstated. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, and the heads of other major central banks have repeatedly urged lawmakers to lend a hand -- albeit with considerable diffidence.
However, they also describe their own efforts as effective even without fiscal support. They are increasingly resigned to slower growth and lower interest rates, yet they insist they still have the means -- by buying government debt, for instance -- to help reverse future downturns.
"Even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past," Ms. Yellen said at the conference, "I believe monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively."
The annual meetings here, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in the shadow of the Grand Tetons, often mix technical discussions and loftier debates. This year, as academics presented proposals for minor improvements in the mechanics of monetary policy, some in the audience suggested that monetary policy makers should be spending less time talking about themselves.
Peter Blair Henry, the dean of the Stern School of Business at New York University, asked a panel of central bankers whether they were doing enough to explain the limits of their own powers, to focus the public on the importance of fiscal policy.
"Everyone is sort of waiting for the next pronouncement about monetary policy when that's really not the central issue," Mr. Henry, an expert on international development, said in an interview. "I think it's important to communicate the limitations of what central bank policies can actually do to drive long-run growth. Central banks have done a real good job restoring stability, and we're at a point now where most of what needs to happen, needs to happen through structural reform."
Ms. Yellen and other central bankers do make this point with some regularity, but they also tend to do it with considerable circumspection. On Friday, Ms. Yellen waited until the final paragraphs of her speech to mention that "fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in strengthening the U.S. economy."
Both Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, have called for increased government spending in areas including infrastructure. Those plans, however, would require support from Congress, where Republicans, worried about the federal debt, have prevented spending increases in recent years.
The debt already is large by historical standards. And running up the tab during a period when the economy is growing, if slowly, may make it harder to spend freely during a future recession, when the need for government stimulus is more acute.
But Douglas W. Elmendorf, the dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard, argued in a recent paper written with Louise Sheiner, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, that the sensible solution is to spend money now and deal with the debt later.
"A rush to reduce budget deficits after 2010 was the biggest error in this downturn," Mr. Elmendorf, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, said in a May presentation on the nation's economic woes.
Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, chose this conference two years ago to declare that European governments should increase fiscal spending even as the bank expanded its own stimulus campaign. (Such spending would be "helpful," he said, in the understated language of a central banker.)
But that speech and subsequent pleas have not produced any noticeable effect on Germany, the country whose trade surplus is at the heart of Europe's problems.
At this year's conference, Mr. Coeuré described the efforts of European governments as "half-baked and halfhearted." But he made clear that the E.C.B. would press on by itself.
"I would argue that this fundamentally doesn't impair our ability to achieve our objective, but it has a strong impact on the way we do it," he said.
Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, expressed a similar mix of helplessness and optimism. Japan has struggled with low inflation and slow growth for decades, and the bank's recent campaign to address the problem is perhaps the most aggressive of any developed nation. Yet the Japanese government has undermined those efforts, for example by imposing a large tax increase.
"I agree that monetary policy cannot do all things without the help of fiscal policy and structural policies," Mr. Kuroda said on Saturday. Asked what could be done to secure such help, he said that he met with the prime minister once or twice a month.
"In that sense," he said, "the Bank of Japan is provided the opportunity to speak up."

Full text:   The bull market in stocks has been supported by two fundamental pillars: high corporate earnings and low interest rates. Both of these mainstays appeared wobbly early this year. Fortunately for investors, there is now some good news for both of them.
Interest rates, which were expected to rise, have actually fallen since the beginning of the year. A series of statements by Federal Reserve officials -- including a speech on Friday by Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, in Jackson Hole, Wyo. -- now confirms that even if there are some short-term rate increases, the central bank expects relatively low rates to prevail for years.
Corporate earnings and cash flow, which had flagged, are stabilizing and perhaps rising, according to a stream of corporate reports released during the quarterly earnings season, which is nearing its end.
Taken together, this information is hardly a guarantee that stocks will continue to rise or that current market levels will seem sensible years from now. But for investors, the interest rate and earnings environment has become friendly again, and without these buttresses, the outlook for stocks would be much gloomier.
Consider corporate earnings. They had been weakening steadily since the third quarter of 2014, as American companies ran into headwinds overseas and revenue softened. The strong dollar was an impediment, the global economy was sluggish, and plummeting energy and commodities prices sank the fortunes of companies in those industries. These trends unnerved the stock market.
But fresh data streaming in from corporate earnings reports has been good enough for Edward Yardeni, a veteran economist and market strategist, to declare emphatically in a note to clients on Monday that "the earnings recession is over."
As he acknowledged, it's not entirely a rosy picture, and the numbers are complicated enough to make your head swim. On a year-to-year basis, for example, earnings in the second quarter are expected to have declined more than 2.2 percent for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to a tally by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That's hardly cause for rejoicing.
Exclude energy companies, however, and year-to-year earnings improved to a positive 2.3 percent growth rate. Moreover, Mr. Yardeni noted that compared with the level of the previous quarter, overall earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 increased in the second quarter. And while the consensus of Wall Street analysts is that the current quarter's earnings will post another year-over-year decline, Mr. Yardeni expects that earnings will at least be no worse than they were in the previous quarter and will perhaps grow modestly.
"The point is that earnings are much better than you might have expected, given the dollar, given what happened to energy and commodity prices, and given the slow growth of the global economy," he said.
What's more, the cash generated by corporate America has allowed companies not only to pay reasonably handsome dividends but also to buy back large quantities of their own shares. These buybacks have strengthened the market: By reducing the number of shares, they have been making earnings per share look much better, and that should continue.
Earnings, and cash from earnings, are the essential core of what you are buying as an investor. But what share price is reasonable for those earnings? At least in part, the answer is "It depends on interest rates." When interest rates are lower, earnings are worth more and share prices tend to rise, said Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University, who has explained this truth in elaborate formulas, many of which he posts on his website.
But the simplest way of looking at it, he says, and the most important for an investor, is to consider how interest rates affect the value of a stock and a bond. "Low rates have had a big effect on the stock market," he said. "Stock is much, much cheaper than bonds at today's interest rates."
This comparison may seem odd, if you're not accustomed to thinking this way. It works like this: For the S.&P. 500, the price-to-earnings ratio is about 20, which means that for every $100 worth of stock, you receive $5 in earnings. By comparison, a 10-year Treasury note, with a yield of 1.6 percent, pays out only $1.60 for a $100 investment. The bond has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 60, meaning that it's more than three times as expensive as stock. If interest rates rose to, say, 10 percent, their rough level in 1979, he said, the price-to-earnings ratio of bonds would drop to 10: Current stock prices would look unreasonably high in that environment, he said.
"In the world we live in right now," he said, "low interest rates make stocks look very good, at least in comparison to bonds."
That's why the latest signals from the bond market, and the latest statements from the Federal Reserve, are so important for stock investors. They indicate that while rates are likely to rise moderately in the United States in the next year, they probably won't rise very much, and low rates will be with us for some time. Inflation is very low, growth is meager, and the economy is vulnerable to shocks.
In her speech on Friday in Jackson Hole, Ms. Yellen acknowledged as much. If the economy continues to improve, she said, the Fed will raise its benchmark federal funds rate, as it has stated for many months. That rate is now between 0.25 and 0.5 percent. But she also emphasized that the central bank wasn't likely to raise rates very much.
Forecasts show that the federal funds rate will settle "at about 3 percent in the longer run," she said. "In contrast, the federal funds rate averaged more than 7 percent between 1965 and 2000." When the next recession comes, she indicated, the Fed may consider experimental methods of influencing interest rates. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, set the stage for Ms. Yellen's speech with a note, posted this month on the San Francisco Fed website, indicating that interest rates had fallen to a very low "natural level" that is likely to be sustained for an extended period.
This raises complex problems for central bankers. For stock investors, though, it provides straightforward confirmation of a central assumption of the bull market: While there may be some short-term increases, low interest rates are likely to be here for some time to come.
That's not entirely positive. If economic growth were stronger, inflation would probably be higher and interest rates would rise. Without strong growth, churning out robust corporate earnings will be a challenge. For now, though, the twin pillars of the stock market remain intact. That could keep the bull market in stocks, now in its eighth year, cavorting for a while longer.

Full text:   GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that she saw a stronger case for raising the Fed's benchmark interest rate, suggesting the central bank was likely to act in the coming months.
"In light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months," Ms. Yellen said.
The remarks, delivered at an annual policy conference here, indicated that the Fed would consider raising rates at its next meeting in mid-September, though most analysts say they think the central bank is more likely to move in December.
In trading on Friday, the chances of a September increase rose to 36 percent from 21 percent, according to a measure derived from asset prices. The chances of a rate increase by the end of the year rose to 61 percent from 52 percent.
Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, who has suggested in recent months that the economy is strong enough to move, told the cable business network CNBC that a strong August employment report, due Sept. 2, "would probably weigh in our decision."
But some officials remain nervous about the fragility of this long but tepid period of economic growth.
The Fed also may be inclined to wait until after the presidential election in November, like earlier this year, when Fed officials said they did not want to raise rates before Britain's referendum on European Union membership in June.
Ms. Yellen's speech "leaves the Fed in a stance of watchful waiting, which is exactly where it was at the end of the last F.O.M.C. meeting in July," Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, wrote in an analysis. "Policy makers are leaning toward a rate hike, but feel that they can wait until they are more confident that the expansion will continue at a sustainable pace."
The Fed raised interest rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis and predicted four more rate increases this year. Instead, it has kept its benchmark rate between 0.25 and 0.5 percent. Low rates encourage borrowing and risk-taking, which can bolster economic growth. Raising rates will gradually reduce that stimulus, and the Fed has been reluctant so far to take its foot off the gas.
Ms. Yellen's remarks appeared aimed in part at jarring the complacency of investors who had concluded that the Fed would not raise rates in September. Fed officials have repeatedly warned that markets had too much confidence in the likely path of policy, given the central bank's considerable uncertainty about its own plans.
Ms. Yellen underscored the point with a chart showing that Fed officials thought rates could plausibly end 2017 anywhere from nearly zero to 4 percent.
Yet she also stopped short of echoing other Fed officials who have suggested in recent weeks that they are inclined to raise rates in September. The Fed's policy-making committee is scheduled to meet Sept. 20 and 21 in Washington.
John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said last week in Anchorage that a rate increase "makes good sense." He repeated that point Thursday during an unusual meeting attended by 10 Fed policy makers and more than 100 activists brought to Jackson Hole by the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of community and labor groups pressing the central bank to postpone rate hikes.
"It's not about trying to stop the economy from growing," Mr. Williams said, explaining his view that the economy no longer required quite as much help from the Fed. "We're going to keep this economy growing; we are going to run it hot."
Yasenia Castro, a protester from Brooklyn, said at a demonstration before the meeting that she had not been able to find a full-time job since 2013. Ms. Castro, 35, has an associate degree in criminal justice and works weekends as a babysitter; she and her three children live with her mother to make ends meet.
"If you're a Fed official, and you think the economy has recovered, tell me why I'm still working as a babysitter when I have a degree," Ms. Castro said.
Fed officials said repeatedly that they sympathized with the protesters, but they added that pushing too hard to increase employment could be counterproductive if it led to a recession. Those struggling now would likely suffer most.
"Everybody on this panel is painfully aware of what the costs of the last recession were and wants to avoid a future recession," Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said during the Thursday meeting.
Much of Ms. Yellen's speech on Friday was devoted to the question of whether the central bank will be ready when the next recession inevitably comes.
Even as the Fed moves to continue raising rates, officials expect that they will not rise nearly as much in the coming years as they did during previous periods of economic growth. That means the Fed will not be able to match the scale of the rate cuts it used to combat previous downturns. But Ms. Yellen said that the Fed in recent years had shown that other kinds of stimulus could also be effective.
After cutting its benchmark rate to nearly zero, the Fed amplified the effect by promising to keep rates low. It also bought trillions of dollars in Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, forcing investors to accept lower interest rates.
"Even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively," Ms. Yellen said.
She cited a recent analysis by David Reifschneider, a Fed economist, that found that the central bank's new set of tools would most likely be sufficient to compensate for the weakening of its traditional tool of lowering short-term interest rates.
Ms. Yellen added that the Fed was "not actively considering" a range of other possible policy responses to a future crisis. These include buying assets other than Treasury securities, like municipal bonds, or raising the Fed's inflation target above 2 percent.
She also noted that fiscal policy makers could play a role in addressing any future crises. In particular, she said, the government should consider policies that might increase the productivity of the American work force.
"Finally, and most ambitiously, as a society we should explore ways to raise productivity growth," Ms. Yellen said. Among the possibilities, she mentioned investment in education and infrastructure and reductions in regulation.

Full text:   Stocks on Wall Street ended the day mostly lower on Friday, giving up modest gains following a generally upbeat assessment of the economy from the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
Phone companies and utilities, widely considered safe-play stocks, led the list of declining stocks, while health care and technology companies rose. Shares of AT&T and Verizon each fell about 1 percent.
KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.3 percent lower and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gave up 0.2 percent. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.1 percent.
YELLEN UPBEAT Ms. Yellen said in a speech that the Fed was moving toward raising interest rates, citing a solid job market and an improved outlook for the economy and inflation. But she stopped short of signaling any timetable for the next increase.
BOND REACTION After initially rising after Ms. Yellen's speech, United States government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 1.59 percent from 1.54 earlier Friday. The yield was 1.58 percent late Thursday.
THE QUOTE "Who would think the Fed would raise interest rates two months before a very important election and with economic growth that has been back and forth and back and forth for years?" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R. W. Baird. "She suggests the economy is improving, but the G.D.P. numbers for the past three quarters are closer to 1 percent than 3 percent. That is very anemic."
SOFTWARE SURGE Shares of the design software company Autodesk rose 8 percent after the company reported a small profit, beating expectations of a loss.
HERBALIFE FALLS Herbalife stock fell 2.3 percent after The Wall Street Journal reported that Carl C. Icahn, the company's biggest shareholder and defender, has been trying to unload his stake. Federal regulators recently ordered the company to change its sales practices, but it did not agree with Wall Street critics that it was a pyramid scheme.
EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX rose 0.6 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 gained 0.8 percent. The FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent in Britain.
ASIA'S DAY The Nikkei 225 declined 1.2 percent in Japan after core consumer prices posted their biggest annual drop in three years in July because of weak consumption. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng gained 0.4 percent. The Shanghai composite index added 0.1 percent in China. The Kospi fell 0.3 percent in South Korea. In Australia, the S. & P./ASX 200 lost 0.5 percent.
OIL Benchmark United States crude oil rose 4 cents, to $47.37 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, sank 11 cents, to $49.56 a barrel.
CURRENCIES The dollar rose to 101.53 yen from 100.57 yen the previous day. The euro fell to $1.1231 from $1.1281.

Abstract: Earlier this month, the Treasury Department issued "proposed final regulations" to eliminate a provision in the tax code that effectively allows wealthy people to greatly discount the value of shares in a family limited partnership given to family members. (Mark Williamson, a partner leading the wealth planning practice at the law firm Alston & Bird, said people who have already given shares in family limited partnerships at steep discounts are protected, as long as they filed the proper gift tax forms and the three-year statute of limitations on audits has passed.) But even if discounting goes away, the ability to save on tax, protect assets from creditors and pass any future appreciation on to the next generation still exists through tax planning.\n

Full text:   The Treasury Department has moved a step closer to tightening the way family limited partnerships are valued for tax purposes. And the prospect that the tax code could be changed by the end of this year has tax planners pushing their clients to consider stepping up estate and business planning, or risk paying more taxes.
Earlier this month, the Treasury Department issued "proposed final regulations" to eliminate a provision in the tax code that effectively allows wealthy people to greatly discount the value of shares in a family limited partnership given to family members. These partnerships are able to own assets like family business, real estate and securities.
The discount, which has been allowed since the 1990s, is granted for what is considered a lack of marketability for minority shares in these partnerships. If a family member, for example, wanted to sell his or her share in a partnership that was entirely owned by other family members, the pool of buyers might well be limited to his or her relatives. They might not have the money -- or desire -- to buy him out.
This provision, contained in section 2704 of the Internal Revenue Code, has been abused by aggressive tax planners and lawyers who used the discount, sometimes as high as 40 percent, and applied it to partnerships that contained marketable securities or other assets that could otherwise be easily valued and sold.
The Internal Revenue Service has repeatedly balked at stocks and bonds being discounted just because they were owned in a family partnership. On Dec. 1, it will hold a hearing on the new regulations, which would strip away the discount from all family limited partnerships regardless of what they hold.
And this is one of the sticking points for planners. Many argue that partnerships that hold businesses should still be entitled to the discounts.
"There have been abuses in the past, like when families took a $100 million of marketable securities and wrapped them in a family limited partnership wrapper and took a discount," said Christopher Pegg, regional wealth planning manager for Southern California at Wells Fargo Private Bank.
"But what happens if it's a $100 million corrugated steel company and the family owns it and Mom dies with a 20 percent stake?" he added. "The new regulations say that stake is worth $20 million. That's not what it's worth."
Mr. Pegg pointed out that if nonfamily members owned the same private company, the I.R.S. would allow a discount for the very same lack of marketability.
"We cannot assume that one family acts together," he said. "It's worse in many cases being in with family than with strangers."
Tax experts do not rule out that these new regulations, although labeled final, could be changed in the comment period. Their enactment, which is set for 30 days after they become final, could also be delayed. At the earliest they would take effect on Dec. 31.
Still, predicting when the regulations will take effect is beyond people's control and could be risky for those who would benefit from a family partnership.
"There is no mulligan," said Mark Parthemer, senior fiduciary counsel at Bessemer Trust. "If a family is considering doing some tax planning and they're putting it off to next year, they can't go back in time and take advantage of the discounts."
Some planners are drawing parallels to the fourth quarter of 2012, when wealthy people scrambled to make gifts under what was then a $5.12 million exemption for individuals. The rush was generated by the fear that the Obama administration would abolish or greatly reduce the exemption in 2013. Instead, the government kept it in place, with an annual increase for inflation.
For the very wealthy, there is good reason to set up a family limited partnership by the end of the year. The discounting, for example, can turn a $10 million gift into $6.5 million for tax purposes.
If the proposed changes go into effect as planned, they will certainly have an effect on certain very wealthy families. "We're telling clients to move quickly," Mr. Pegg said. He said that it typically takes six months to set up a family limited partnership, but if families were motivated and focused on this they could set one up in about 45 days.
(Mark Williamson, a partner leading the wealth planning practice at the law firm Alston & Bird, said people who have already given shares in family limited partnerships at steep discounts are protected, as long as they filed the proper gift tax forms and the three-year statute of limitations on audits has passed.)
But even if discounting goes away, the ability to save on tax, protect assets from creditors and pass any future appreciation on to the next generation still exists through tax planning.
"Valuation discounts have always been the icing on the cake for these tax transfers that we do," said Scott Goldberger, estate and trust principal at the accounting firm Kaufman Rossin in Boca Raton, Fla. "If the primary goal is to push future appreciation of the business onto family members, thereby reducing the value of the taxable estate, the discount gives you a head start."
Apart from the discount, there are two effective strategies to move money or business interests to heirs.
The first is simply getting assets that are going to appreciate out of a person's estate. If the gift is over the exemption amount, the person may have to pay gift tax. But after that, all future appreciation will grow outside of his or her estate.
The second is to put those assets into what is called a grantor trust, which benefits future recipients by allowing the person making the gift to pay all the income taxes in the trust.
"Those two in tandem will typically outweigh the tax savings you'd get from a discount," Mr. Goldberger said. "Even after these regulations are finalized, we think we'll still be seeing a lot of our clients doing this type of planning."
Seth R. Kaplan, a shareholder with the law firm Gunster, said he recommends some type of family entity for any family with more than $10 million in assets.
"There are multiple tax as well as nontax benefits to this, like creditor protection," he said. "It lays the foundation for other planning, like charitable planning. It achieves some of the goals of centralized management. It can be given to other family members."
And it is that desire for control and protection of the assets that planners say may be the most valuable benefit. If someone is sued, the assets inside the partnership are viewed as separate from the individual's assets, just as they would be in a well-crafted trust.
That partnership structure also gives the family the ability to bind family interests together. This may not always be what beneficiaries want, but it is meant to ensure that a family business has the best chance of continuing.
"There are many elements to intrafamily planning," Mr. Kaplan said. "It's not the end of the world if it" -- the discount -- "goes away."

Full text:   The American economy is finally creating more middle-income jobs, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a turnabout from the feast-and-famine pattern earlier in the recovery, when hiring was strongest at the bottom and top of the wage scale.
The findings suggest that it may soon be time to retire a familiar criticism of the long but lackluster economic rebound that has been underway since the end of the Great Recession in 2009: the hollowing out of the American middle class.
Between 2013 and 2015, employers added nearly 2.3 million workers earning from $30,000 to $60,000 a year, primarily in fields like education, construction, transportation and social services. That was roughly 50 percent more than in either the high-wage or low-wage categories during the same period.
By contrast, the Fed researchers found, of the nearly 7.6 million jobs created from 2010 to 2013, only about a fifth fell into the middle-tier category, with the largest number instead coming from lower-paid sectors like food preparation and health care support.
"The tide has begun to turn," said William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed. "For the first time in quite a while, we are seeing gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide."
Although the economy has created nearly 15 million jobs since employment bottomed out in early 2010, the gains in the recovery have been noticeably uneven. While many cities along the East and West Coasts have been prolific job creators, parts of the Midwest and South have not experienced similar improvements.
At the same time, most American workers have made only paltry wage gains until recently, despite steady hiring that has helped bring the national unemployment rate down to 4.9 percent last month from a high of 10 percent in late 2009.
"It's important, but we are coming off of a really low threshold," said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist based in Chicago, referring to the new Fed study. "We've shifted gears, but we're only now beginning to regain the quality in terms of jobs."
"We've got a long way to go," Ms. Swonk added, noting that after inflation, family incomes were still below where they were in 2000. "It's more than a lost decade."
The nascent national improvement identified by the Fed researchers in New York also held true in the metropolitan region in recent years, with New York City and surrounding suburbs adding 179,000 middle-wage jobs from 2013 to 2015, compared with just 18,000 from 2010 to 2013.
The shift coincided with the passing of the baton from finance to technology as the major driver in local job creation.
More than any area in the United States, with the possible exception of San Francisco, New York City has come to symbolize an economy built on vast gains for a lucky few, with most everyone else largely standing still.
But as the motor of New York's economy, Wall Street is yielding to Silicon Alley and Brooklyn, as technology companies like Google and smaller start-ups bulk up while banks and hedge funds slim down.
Since 2010, tech employment in New York City has jumped by 53,000, while securities industry jobs have increased by just 12,000.
In fact, with 172,400 workers in 2015, employment in the New York securities industry remains well short of where it peaked before the financial crisis. There were more than 125,000 tech workers in New York City last year, nearly double the total a decade ago.
"In the past, the city has counted on job growth from Wall Street to fuel economic growth during recoveries and expansions," Mr. Dudley said. "This time around, however, job gains in the securities industry have been quite meager."
Hiring in fields like internet publishing, online shopping and scientific research and development, Mr. Dudley added, "is picking up much of the slack created by the softness of the securities industry."
The local tech boom has also spread the largess well beyond the canyons of Wall Street. Private sector job growth in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx was stronger last year than it was in Manhattan.
While technology companies are still mostly based in Manhattan, Brooklyn has benefited from what economists call a multiplier effect, as young tech workers move to the borough in search of more affordable housing and patronize restaurants, clubs and other services there.
The South Bronx, once synonymous with urban decay, is also on an upswing, especially around the markets in the Hunts Point area, said Jason Bram, a researcher with the New York Fed. Queens has benefited from its proximity to local airports.
Suburban counties like Rockland, Westchester and Nassau are also prospering again, and closer-in counties in New Jersey, like Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth, are finally showing signs of life.
Still, large parts of upstate New York, including Binghamton, Elmira and Syracuse, are struggling economically. Ithaca and Albany have been exceptions upstate, paced by gains in education and emerging fields like nanotechnology.
There's plenty of need for further improvement, Mr. Dudley said, but he suggested that the increase in middle-class jobs since 2013 may mark a turning point in the recovery.
"This is an important development in the economy," he said. "If it were to continue, it would create more opportunities for workers and their families who have been struggling up to now."

Full text:   The quandary facing the Federal Reserve this summer is the same as it was back in the spring, and winter, and last fall: By traditional guideposts like the unemployment rate, it looks as if it is time for the Fed to be raising interest rates. Yet the global economy seems to be locked in a low-growth, low-inflation world in which raising interest rates is at best unnecessary and at worst dangerous.
That tension was on display Wednesday in the minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting, which raised the possibility of rate increases as early as September.
As is the Fed's standard practice, the description of the meeting was stripped of names and summarized in bloodless language. But reading between the lines, it is clear there was a rich debate over what factors the Fed should be weighing, and how, in making its next move.
Some policy makers saw evidence that the labor market was getting tighter, the result of which should be higher wages and prices. Others "saw little evidence that inflation was responding much" to the low jobless rate. With inflation low, "many judged it was appropriate to wait for additional information" before considering raising rates.
"Several" suggested there would be plenty of time to react if inflation did rise and so wanted to defer raising rates until it was clear inflation was holding near its desired target of 2 percent. "Some other participants" viewed the economy as already being near full employment, meaning that another rate increase "was or would soon be" warranted.
The result of all that debate at the July 26-27 meeting was affirming the status quo -- agreement that "it was prudent to accumulate more data in order to gauge the underlying momentum in the labor market and economic activity" and that "members judged it appropriate to continue to leave their policy options open and maintain the flexibility to adjust the stance of policy based on incoming information."
That continues a volatile year for market perceptions of when, and how much, the Fed might make the shift toward tighter money. At the start of 2016, it seemed nearly certain the Fed would follow up its interest rate increase in December with more of them this year.
Weak growth in the United States and abroad, combined with a volatile first half of the year in financial markets, drove the odds of a rate increase down to 12 percent by July 1, based on prices in futures markets. That had gone back up to 53 percent by Tuesday. (It edged down very slightly, to 51 percent, after the release of the minutes Wednesday.)
In public comments this week, Fed officials have suggested that markets are underrating the possibility of a September rate increase.
"We're edging closer toward the point in time where it will be appropriate, I think, to raise interest rates further," the New York Fed president, William C. Dudley, told Fox Business on Tuesday. The Atlanta Fed president, Dennis Lockhart, told reporters that one or two rate increases were possible this year and that economic data would suggest strong consideration of raising rates next month.
The Fed faces a profound question: Is the basic framework it has used over the last generation to set monetary policy the correct one in this moment, or has something fundamental shifted in the global economy that calls for a new one?
If this is just a standard economic expansion that has been slowed by some bad luck, then the central bank's usual rules apply. That rule book involves examining how close the economy is to functioning at its full potential, and trying to move up and down to keep on that steady path so as not to let inflation get out of control.
By that standard, it is past time to be raising interest rates. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level the Fed believes is sustainable in the longer term, and job growth is strong. Inflation was 1.4 percent over the last year, according to the index the Fed watches most closely, not too far below the 2 percent the Fed aims for. And mainstream economic models project it should rise in the years ahead given the relatively tight job market.
But there is plenty of evidence -- and a vocal contingent of officials inside the central bank -- that the usual way of thinking isn't quite working.
For one thing, the rest of the world is growing so slowly that it is creating a steady downdraft on inflation and growth that may mean the usual worries about inflation don't apply. Rising wages for American workers over the last year or so have been counteracted by other forces preventing inflation from taking off, including falling energy prices and slack demand for goods and services from overseas.
Moreover, any step the Fed takes toward tightening the United States money supply seems to be offset by an opposite reaction elsewhere. With other countries easing monetary policy with ultralow interest rates and quantitative easing, small moves to tighten American policies have created outsize rallies in the dollar, which disadvantages American exporters and creates ripple effects through the global credit system.
That has led Fed officials to steadily mark down both their expectations for how quickly to raise short-term interest rates and where those rates will settle in the longer run -- meaning they think that low rates may be more a new normal than a short-term aberration.
The San Francisco Fed president, John Williams, raised the possibility this week of more significant change in how the Fed thinks about its goals, even raising the possibility of increasing the Fed's 2 percent target for inflation, or of the Fed's replacing its inflation target with a goal for nominal gross domestic product.
The Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will have a prime opportunity to elaborate on her own views in this debate next week, in a scheduled speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
But for now, Fed officials are openly discussing the need to approach policy choices differently, and holding off from interest rate increases as a result, but not quite concluding that the old rules no longer apply and embracing an alternate approach.
It's an awkward place for a central bank to be, but until Ms. Yellen and her colleagues can find consensus around what the new framework for monetary policy ought to be -- or conclude that the old models still have some usefulness -- the uncertainty evident in the July minutes won't change.

Full text:   Consumer prices in the United States were unchanged in July thanks to falling gasoline costs, but solid gains in industrial output and home building suggested a pickup in economic activity that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.
Tuesday's mixed reports came as William C. Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the central bank could increase rates next month, citing a tightening labor market that he said was starting to spur faster wage growth.
Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York, said: "The strong housing starts and industrial output performance will bolster the Fed confidence that growth momentum has rebounded, potentially supporting the bias for a near-term hike. Nevertheless, with inflation continuing to miss to the downside, the case for caution remains strong."
July's flat reading in the Consumer Price Index from the Labor Department was the weakest since February and followed two straight monthly increases of 0.2 percent. In the 12 months through July, the C.P.I. rose 0.8 percent after increasing 1.0 percent in June.
The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out the volatile food and energy components, edged up 0.1 percent in July. It had risen by 0.2 percent in each of the previous three months. The year-on-year core C.P.I. increased 2.2 percent in July after advancing 2.3 percent in June.
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a measure of inflation that has been stuck at 1.6 percent since March. "It's possible" for the Fed to raise rates at its policy meeting on Sept. 20 and 21, Mr. Dudley told Fox Business Network.
There were increases in the costs of hospital services, doctor visits and prescription medicine. Rents increased a solid 0.3 percent. But Americans got some relief from gasoline prices, which dropped 4.7 percent last month, the first decline since February, reflecting renewed declines in crude oil prices.
Despite benign inflation, economic growth is picking up after output averaged 1.0 percent in the first half of the year. In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production shot up 0.7 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in June.
Production was bolstered by a 0.5 percent jump in manufacturing output, the largest gain since July 2015. Warmer-than-usual weather caused utilities to raise production by 2.1 percent while mining output increased 0.7 percent.
In a third report, the Commerce Department said housing starts increased 2.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.2 million units in July, the highest level since February.
Last month's increase in groundbreaking activity supports the view that investment in residential construction will rebound after slumping in the second quarter for the first time in more than two years.
Groundbreaking on single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, rose 0.5 percent to a 770,000-unit pace in July, also the highest level since February.
Housing starts for the volatile multifamily segment increased 5.0 percent to a 441,000-unit pace. The multifamily segment of the market continues to be supported by strong demand for rental accommodation as some Americans shun homeownership after the housing market collapse.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: According to the World Bank, life expectancy increased to 74.4 years in 2014 from 63.9 in 1986 (in the same period American life expectancy went up by just four years). All of which is to say that I am tired, very tired, of reading negative stories about these Brazilian Olympics -- the anger in the slums, the violence that continues (including the armed robbery of four American swimmers), the enduring gulf between rich and poor, the occasional organizational hassles, the Russian doping and the Brazilian mosquito, money that could supposedly have been spent better than extending the Metro that now runs from the center to prosperous Barra da Tijuca (so, among other things, enabling the poor to get jobs out there).

Full text:   When I was a correspondent in Brazil 30 years ago, inflation was rampant. It ran at an average of 707.4 percent a year from 1985 to 1989. The salaries of the poor were wiped out within hours of being paid. The country went through three currencies -- cruzeiro, cruzado and cruzado novo -- while I lived in Rio. The only way out for Brazilians, people joked, was Galeão, the international airport.
Antônio Carlos Jobim, the composer of "The Girl From Ipanema" (and whose name is now affixed to that airport), famously observed that "Brazil is not for beginners."
It was not then and it's not now. It's a vast diverse country, a tropical United States, whose rich and poor are divided by a chasm. High crime rates are in part a reflection of this divide. Flexibility is at a premium in a culture fashioned by heat, sensuality, samba and rule bending. Life can be cheap. You adapt or you perish.
Edmar Bacha, a friend and economist, had coined the term "Belindia" to describe Brazil -- a prosperous Belgium perched atop a teeming India. I wrote a story about the poor kids from north Rio, far from the beaches of Ipanema and Leblon, who would get their kicks as "train surfers," riding the tops of fast-moving trains, rather than surf Atlantic waves. Often they died, electrocuted. I will never forget the twisted corpse of one in the city morgue.
Inequity was part of the story, yet even in those tumultuous times it was not all of it. "Tudo bem?" -- "All good?" -- I would ask when I ventured into the ubiquitous favelas, or slums. "Tudo bem!" was often the response, along with a smile, even when all was entirely awful. Penury in the sun is not penury in the cold.
I once asked the São Paulo industrialist José Mindlin if he was worried about where Brazil was headed. "I always worry about the end of the month," Mindlin said. "But I never worry about the future." He was right. Brazil is the graveyard of naysayers.
The country has been transformed since the 1980s. Democracy and the currency have been stabilized. The middle class has grown exponentially even if it is under pressure now. Brazil has impeached one president, Fernando Collor de Mello, and is in the midst of an impeachment process against another, Dilma Rousseff, for charges of budgetary manipulation. The law can no longer be bought with facility. The commodities boom that propelled rapid Brazilian growth over many years has ended. Still, Brazil is ensconced in the world's top 10 economies.
According to the World Bank, life expectancy increased to 74.4 years in 2014 from 63.9 in 1986 (in the same period American life expectancy went up by just four years). Illiteracy is still too high but has fallen sharply.
Brazil today is less Belindia than Franconesia -- a substantial France atop an Indonesia. Its problems persist, but only a fool would deny that Brazil will be a major 21st-century player. As anyone attending the Olympics must feel, Brazil has a powerful and joyous national culture. It is the land of "Tudo bem."
All of which is to say that I am tired, very tired, of reading negative stories about these Brazilian Olympics -- the anger in the slums, the violence that continues (including the armed robbery of four American swimmers), the enduring gulf between rich and poor, the occasional organizational hassles, the Russian doping and the Brazilian mosquito, money that could supposedly have been spent better than extending the Metro that now runs from the center to prosperous Barra da Tijuca (so, among other things, enabling the poor to get jobs out there).
First, Brazil was never going to get the job done in time for the Olympics; now that it's shown so much success and held a magnificent opening ceremony, it's blamed for not having resolved every one of its social problems in time for the Games.
There is something in the developed world that does not like a developing country that organizes a major sporting event. I heard the same jeremiads in South Africa at the time of the World Cup in 2010: the crime that would ruin things, the poverty that was shameful and the inefficiency that would plague visitors. The tournament was a triumph. I don't recall reporters combing the poorest, most crime-ridden parts of Britain in 2012 to find people ready to grumble about the London Olympics.
These Olympics are good for Brazil and good for humanity, a needed tonic. Watch Usain Bolt or Simone Biles and feel uplifted.
My preferred image is that of Rafaela Silva, the young Brazilian woman from the violent Rio slum of Cidade de Deus, who won a gold medal in judo and declared: "This medal demonstrates that a child who has a dream should believe, even if it takes time, because the dream can be realized."
Out in the favelas some kids are dreaming in a different way right now. That, too, is a story.

Full text:   THE ALBINO MINE, Venezuela -- The 12th time Reinaldo Balocha got malaria, he hardly rested at all. With the fever still rattling his body, he threw a pick ax over his shoulder and got back to work -- smashing stones in an illegal gold mine.
As a computer technician from a big city, Mr. Balocha was ill-suited for the mines, his soft hands used to working keyboards, not the earth. But Venezuela's economy collapsed on so many levels that inflation had obliterated his salary, along with his hopes of preserving a middle-class life.
So, like tens of thousands of other people from across the country, Mr. Balocha came to these open, swampy mines scattered across the jungle, looking for a future. Here, waiters, office workers, taxi drivers, college graduates and even civil servants on vacation from their government jobs are out panning for black-market gold, all under the watchful eyes of an armed group that taxes them and threatens to tie them to posts if they disobey.
It is a society turned upside down, a place where educated people abandon once-comfortable jobs in the city for dangerous, backbreaking work in muddy pits, desperate to make ends meet. And it comes with a steep price: Malaria, long driven to the fringes of the country, is festering in the mines and back with a vengeance.
Venezuela was the first nation in the world to be certified by the World Health Organization for eradicating malaria in its most populated areas, beating the United States and other developed countries to that milestone in 1961.
It was a huge accomplishment for a small nation, one that helped pave Venezuela's development as an oil power and fueled hopes that a model to stamp out malaria across the globe was at hand. Since then, the world has dedicated enormous amounts of time and money to beating back the disease, with deaths plummeting by 60 percent in places with malaria in recent years, according to the W.H.O.
But in Venezuela, the clock is running backward.
The country's economic turmoil has brought malaria back, sweeping the disease out of the remote jungle areas where it quietly persisted and spreading it around the nation at levels not seen in Venezuela for 75 years, medical experts say.
It all starts with the mines. With the economy in tatters, at least 70,000 people from all walks of life have been streaming into this mining region over the past year, said Jorge Moreno, a leading mosquito expert in Venezuela. As they hunt for gold in watery pits, the perfect breeding ground for the mosquitoes that spread the disease, they are catching malaria by the tens of thousands.
Then, with the disease in their blood, they return home to Venezuela's cities. But because of the economic collapse, there is often no medicine and little fumigation to prevent mosquitoes there from biting them and passing malaria to others, sickening tens of thousands more people and leaving entire towns desperate for help.
The economic breakdown has "triggered a great migration in Venezuela, and right behind it is the spread of malaria," said Dr. Moreno, a researcher at a state-run laboratory in the mining region. "With this breakdown comes a disease that is cooked in the same pot."
Once out of the mines, malaria spreads quickly. Five hours away in Ciudad Guayana, a rusting former industrial boomtown where many are now jobless and have taken to wildcatting in the mines, a crowd of 300 people packed the waiting room of a clinic in May. All had symptoms of the disease: fevers, icy chills and uncontrollable tremors.
There were no lights because the government had cut power to save electricity. There were no medicines because the Health Ministry had not delivered any. Health workers administered blood tests with their bare hands because they were out of gloves.
Maribel Supero clutched her 23-year-old son as he trembled, unable to speak. José Castro held his 18-month-old daughter as she screamed. Griselda Bello, who works at the clinic, waved her hands helplessly and told yet another patient to hold on a bit longer.
The pills had run out. There was nothing she could do.
"Come back tomorrow at 10 a.m.," she said.
"My God," the patient said. "Someone might die by then."
"Indeed, they might," she said.
In the nearby town of Pozo Verde, residents said malaria had swept in after miners began returning home sick, the government fumigators having vanished two years ago. Now, the public high school has become an incubating ground of its own: A quarter of its 400 students have contracted malaria since November.
"You would think we would do something -- a cordon, a quarantine," said Arebalo Enríquez, the principal of the school, who contracted malaria, as did his wife, mother and seven other members of his family.
Officially, the spread of malaria in Venezuela has become a state secret. The government has not published epidemiological reports on the disease in the past year, and it says there is no crisis.
But the most recent internal figures, obtained by The New York Times from Venezuelan doctors involved in compiling it, confirms a surge is underway.
In the first six months of the year, malaria cases rose 72 percent, to a total of 125,000, according to the figures. The disease cut a wide path through the country, with cases present in more than half of its 23 states. And among the malaria strains present here is Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most fatal form of the disease.
"It is a situation of national shame," said Dr. José Oletta, a former Venezuelan health minister who lives in the capital, Caracas, where malaria cases are now appearing, too. "I was seeing this kind of thing when I was a medical student a half-century ago. It hurts me. The disease had disappeared."
In El Dique, a rural town where malaria was largely unknown until two years ago, Juana García, 66, sat outside her home, newly widowed since her husband fell ill with the disease and died. She hardly spoke or moved from her chair.
"She will keep fighting," said her daughter Ana María Padrón.
Inside Ms. Padrón's adobe home, her two sons were fighting malaria, too. Almost like clockwork, their fevers began in the morning: at 8 a.m. for Omar, who is 8; at 11 for Aristides, who is 7. The family has found no medicine. The boys have only painkillers.
"We pray," their mother said.
Lure of the Mines
The illegal mines spill out over dozens of miles, leaving a pockmarked stretch of earth where the jungle gives way to countless craters and scars.
Some are no more than tiny pools where two men sift the mud with pans, like a scene from the California goldfields more than a century ago. Others drain wide marshes with tangled networks of tubes and pumps. In another spot, hundreds of wildcatters had dug out a gaping maw of red and white soil. It sinks 15 stories deep and runs the length of a football field. They call it Cuatro Muertos, or Four Dead Men.
It was not supposed to be this way. The gold reserves were once controlled by a Canadian company before President Hugo Chávez expropriated them and pledged to use their profits to fund his Socialist-style revolution.
But the expropriation followed the pattern of mismanagement and neglect that many others did during the Chávez era. The state eventually abandoned the territory around the mine, and the potentially lucrative profits. Wildcatters have moved in, and so have the armed groups that now call themselves the law here.
But at least there is food.
As the country convulses from food shortages and riots, as hungry mobs ransack grocery stores, restaurants and bakeries, the mining town of Las Claritas, only a short drive from the mines, lives in a state of relative plenty.
Restaurants offer full menus. Street markets are packed with fruit. Pickups drive by loaded with pumpkins. In a country where soap is in short supply, a dozen brands are on sale in a Chinese-owned grocery store, where seven models of flat-screen televisions are also available. Miners dish out fat wads of their gold earnings in cash, which run through a bill-counting machine.
The promise of a different Venezuela -- one where there is ample food and work that pays enough -- led Yudani González to abandon a program to become a preschool teacher in Ciudad Bolívar, the provincial capital, where unemployment is rampant. Instead, she headed to a ramshackle jungle camp, where she cooks for miners with one hand and cares for her two young children with the other.
"Here, you can get ahead," Ms. González said, washing her 1-year-old daughter in a plastic bucket on the counter as she cooked.
Danneris Flores, a government employee moonlighting as a mining camp cook, sat nearby. She is an administrative assistant in a state-run health clinic, but Venezuela's currency has tumbled so far that her salary amounts to only about $1 a day at the current street value.
So she asked for a vacation -- and used it to work for a couple of weeks at the mines.
Her brother-in-law, who works for the state oil company, Pdvsa, does the same thing. In a short stint at the mines, Ms. Flores said she could earn twice her monthly wages. She counted the days until she would be home to see her three children, whom she had left after "closing my eyes and making my heart small."
"I never imagined that I would work in a mine," she said to Ms. González as they served a meal. "Before, people thought of going to school."
A miner walked in to greet the women and said he had recently watched someone collapse and die of malaria on her way to a market. Ms. González said she had come down with it four times herself. Her 4-year-old, she said, has had it three times.
"They charge you two grams of gold for medicine," she said. "You pay what they ask."
Not everyone can find medication, even with gold earnings.
José Yoel Castillo stumbled to the doorstep of the malaria clinic in Las Claritas, carried on the shoulders of two relatives as he convulsed and was unable to speak.
He had been making a living in the town of Caicara del Orinoco, driving passengers on the back of a motorcycle. But an armed gang took the vehicle, and Mr. Castillo could not afford a new one.
So he came to the mines. He quickly found work and money -- even malaria medication the first time he became ill. But when the symptoms came a second time, he could not find treatment anywhere.
"Some people can just keep working through it," said his brother-in-law, Alejandro López. "But others can't."
Even with money in their pockets, the miners know the dangers of going back home.
Josué Guevara, 20, gave up last November on his university studies in industrial engineering in a city about 10 hours away. He once pictured himself as a manager at the state-owned aluminum company, Alcasa. But his family members who worked there could barely afford food, he said.
"Now I have other goals," he said, standing at the edge of the Cuatro Muertos mines, where he lives and works today.
Using gasoline and other chemicals to extract the gold, Mr. Guevara earned 500,000 bolívars -- around $500 at black-market exchange rates, about 33 times the country's minimum wage -- during a lucky two-week stretch. But when he got malaria this spring, he did what many miners do: He returned to his hometown to recover, bringing the disease with him.
"Everything has its risks," he said.
On the other side of the vast pit, Pedro Pérez, 38, sat in a structure made of tree poles and tarp where he sleeps with 10 other miners. He tested positive for malaria twice in March. The third time he fell ill, he did not bother to get tested.
"I was lying here and I felt the same symptoms," he said.
He, too, went back home -- to the provincial capital, Ciudad Bolívar, where his mother eventually caught malaria, as well.
"It's coming from us," Mr. Pérez said.
Mr. Pérez remembered his life before he came to the mines last fall: He was a supervisor at a state-owned metal refinery, he said.
He owned a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house and a 2005 Ford Focus. He and his wife, a lawyer, once jetted off on last-minute getaways to Isla Margarita, a tropical island off the north coast of Venezuela.
Yet even before he lost his job last year and was unable to find another, Venezuela's plummeting currency had whittled his salary down to about $26 a month. He eventually left home for the mine.
"I am still not used to washing myself every day in a river of dirty water," he said. "I thought I had a good life."
A few weeks ago, his wife came to Las Claritas to buy the food and soap she could not find in Ciudad Bolívar. The couple spent three nights together in a miner's hostel. After she left, Mr. Pérez felt the strains on their marriage.
"'I know it's hard for you,' I tell her, 'but we have to accept this new reality,"' he said.
Back in Las Claritas, at a table in a dark brothel that smelled of alcohol, sat Angélica, a young woman with long black hair whose parents do not know she has turned to prostitution to make her living.
She left the eastern city of Maturín three months ago when riots erupted because food had gone scarce.
"Before, you waited in line for hours, but you got something," said Angélica, who did not give her last name, ashamed of her work. "But now there is nothing there."
Today she earns the equivalent of $40 when a miner wants to spend the night with her. More often, the money comes in increments of $8, when a customer wants to have sex and leave a short time later.
At times, she said, it may be a stranger who is trembling with fever, unable to perform because of malaria. Other times, it is the owner of one of the Chinese grocery stores. The men come from all corners of the country.
"The most difficult part of this life is being with someone who you do not love," she said.
A Resurgence Ignored
Venezuela rose only after malaria declined.
It was the 1920s and another resource had set off a bonanza -- the black gold of oil, discovered in massive supply.
But a vast malaria hot zone, then two-thirds of Venezuela, stood between the country and its riches. The deadly scenes were later immortalized in "Dead Homes," a 1955 Venezuelan novel about the rural epidemics of malaria and the waves of migration to the country's oil fields.
Freeing the country of malaria became pivotal to Venezuela's development, said Dr. Oletta, the former health minister.
"Only once malaria was gone, roads could come, industry," he said. "This was a sick country, and when it got well, things changed."
That transformative effort was led by Dr. Arnoldo Gabaldón, the former health minister who began one of the world's first large-scale efforts to eradicate malaria and who became a national hero during his age.
Teams across the Venezuelan countryside built irrigation ditches to drain pools of standing water, distributed quinine and constructed cinder block homes in rural areas so that mosquitoes had fewer places to breed. Dr. Gabaldón founded a research center in the city of Maracay, outside of Caracas and itself a malaria zone at the time, to broaden the mission and train officials from Latin America and Africa.
But it was his use of insecticides -- initially DDT, then other substances -- that began to turn the tide. The walls of nearly every rural home in the country were sprayed, a technique that killed mosquitoes when they landed to rest. Fumigators would leave an envelope showing the date they would return.
By 1949, malaria deaths had fallen drastically: to nine per 100,000 people from 300.
By the time Mr. Chávez assumed the presidency 50 years later and began to carry out his Socialist-inspired vision for Venezuela, the regimented system of Dr. Gabaldón had long faded, though malaria still appeared to be confined to a few rural areas. But the restructuring of the economy under Mr. Chávez and his followers, including a growing dependence on oil revenue and a system of currency controls restricting American dollars, would eventually change that.
In 2014 and 2015, as oil prices collapsed and the government scrambled for money to pay for goods, services and imports, there were long shortages of chloroquine and primaquine, two drugs used for Plasmodium vivax, the most prevalent malaria parasite in the Americas.
By 2016, doctors said there were shortages of nearly all anti-malaria drugs, most notably a drug cocktail for the deadly falciparum strain that costs just several dollars for a full round of treatment. Though debilitating and even fatal, malaria is easily treatable with the proper medication.
Dr. Leopoldo Villegas, an international malaria expert in Bangkok, said the government also relied on outdated methods like outdoor fogging with insecticides, which had unproven effects on adult mosquitoes that transmit malaria. And because it was not publishing epidemiological reports of new malaria cases or deaths, it was unclear how much medicine was needed each year.
"This is an emergency, this is an outbreak, and it's not being dealt with by the government this way," Dr. Villegas said, adding that the Venezuelan government had repeatedly denied the extent of malaria's resurgence to international organizations that could help prevent its spread.
Gustavo Bretas, a Brazilian malaria expert, said that Venezuela once trained people throughout the region in malaria prevention. But Venezuela's inability to contain its own outbreak means that it now plays the opposite role: It poses a threat to the countries around it, particularly Brazil, where there are also illegal gold mines.
"It's starting to spill over into neighboring countries," he said, adding that the lack of government statistics made the extent of the problem hard to assess.
Venezuela's Health Ministry did not respond to requests for an interview, including a letter delivered to its offices.
Oscar Noya now works in Dr. Gabaldón's old laboratory in Caracas under a picture of his mentor in a suit and bow tie. On a recent day, malaria patients once again sat on the steps, most having arrived from the mines. Fifteen had come on a recent morning; 12 of them tested positive for the disease.
Dr. Noya tries to make do without many vital drugs, like artesunate, listed by the W.H.O. as an essential medicine for the treatment of severe cases of falciparum malaria. He has only three vials of it left. He needs six to treat a single patient with a serious case.
One recent night, a gang entered one of his malaria laboratories and stole the computers, one of about 20 attacks this year against the Tropical Medical Institute where he works, Dr. Noya said. He wonders if the groups are aligned with the government.
"We believe this is no more than intimidation because we're not quiet and we won't be quiet," he said, referring to public advocacy about malaria and the spread of other diseases.
Dr. Noya put away his vials of artesunate as more patients gathered outside. He looked up with an air of desperation. "Dr. Gabaldón would have died of a heart attack if he'd seen what is happening," he said.
Order Outside the Law
Despite the constant churn of workers from across Venezuela, there is a clear order to the mines.
It is enforced by an armed group known as the Union.
One of the Union's bosses came to the mines years ago to work as a dentist. He still does. But the squads of patrolmen on motorbikes who dominate this place are the real source of his wealth and power. He sports gold chains, two gold teeth -- and brass knuckles made of gold.
After the government abandoned them, the mines soon grew again, this time at an unruly pace as wildcatters plowed into the forest, creating pools of stagnant water and a population of easy prey for the mosquitoes that breed in them, paving the way for the explosion of malaria.
Sitting on his patio, the boss, who declined to be named because he could be arrested by the government, took pride in what he said was the Union's ability to fill in for the vacuum left by the state. Yes, he acknowledged, the punishments the group meted out could be gruesome, like shooting off a man's hand when he stole, or tying others to posts at the entrance of town with a sign detailing the offense committed.
But he argued that the discipline kept crime in the camps low and allowed miners to go about their business in peace -- another aspect of life that has steadily eroded in Venezuela's dangerous cities.
"To get justice from the police is a joke," he said. "You have to get your own justice."
Eduardo Medina agreed. A former pharmacist, he said he had left the drugstore where he worked in the state of Zulia a year ago to start mining because he saw the economic crisis spread and law and order slip away.
"At any time, you might go out and someone would put a pistol in your face for your phone, or knife your mother," Mr. Medina said in his tent. "Crime is under control here. They charge us, but they solve the problems, too."
But the appearance of calm is deceiving. Storms rage in other places where rivals vie for control of the mines. In March, at least 17 miners were killed in what the authorities believed was one such dispute.
Mr. Medina, on a break, looked down into the pit where his fellow miners labored.
"At any moment, you can be killed in Zulia," he said. "But you can be killed here, too."
For all the challenges of keeping order, the boss said, malaria was even harder.
"On malaria, we are screwed," he said.
The task of monitoring the disease seems to have been delegated to people like a state health employee named Miguel Martínez, who sat at a lonely post a short walk from a brothel near the mines, examining blood samples from miners. Under his microscope, a dye had stained the malaria parasite a dark purple. The log beside him showed that half of the patients who had visited him that day had tested positive for malaria.
Like many health workers in this country, Mr. Martínez was exasperated.
"Just as there are no rice and beans in this country, there are no medicines," he said.
Evening approached at the mine, the time when the Anopheles mosquito begins to feed. Dusk settled over a clapboard Pentecostal church, where parishioners speak in tongues, and past a red-and-blue circus tent promising alcohol and a strip tease.
Under a tarp, five men hammered away at a vein of quartz, which they would grind down and sift for gold. Others waded up to their shoulders in pools laden with heavy metals like mercury, angling tubes to pump the mud. Tropical birds flew in the distance.
"Is the malaria really coming from the miners?" asked Aníbal Flores, 28, a miner who sleeps in a hammock between two poles beside the mine. "But where else can we go to make money? The city? There is no food there."
Lately, many Venezuelans have taken matters into their own hands.
Five hours away in the newly infected town of El Dique, residents were collecting 100 bolívars from each household to hire a fumigator to come spray their homes.
In the mine, where malaria tests are sometimes unavailable, miners said they had developed an exam of their own: Drink two bottles of beer. If a sharp pain is felt afterward in the liver, where the parasites reside, then the patient has malaria, the test goes. Health officials said the measure was futile.
Still, Mr. Balocha, the former computer technician who works in the Albino Mine, lives by it. Miners call it an "artisanal test."
He was sick once again, waiting for medicine at a chain-link fence on the edge of a clinic. He recalled the words of his uncle, who phoned him a year ago when Mr. Balocha found his salary as a computer technician to be worthless in the city of Valencia.
"There is money here," said the uncle, who was mining then. "You have to know how to find it."
Mr. Balocha started as a "palero," a stone breaker, getting the smallest cut of the take. But it was still more than what his salary bought in the city after inflation had whittled it away, he said.
He recalled the first time he got malaria, too, the "chills like you were lying down between two blocks of ice."
"The first time you get malaria is the ugliest," Mr. Balocha said. "You can't control the tremors. You feel like you will die. You feel like you are a zombie."
But he would become a millionaire here, he joked, and one day he would head to Europe -- with a Latin American woman, he added -- far from the mines, the malaria and the Union.
He sighed, looking up at the sky.
"In the mine, happiness is only temporary," he said.

Full text:   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil is in a terrible way: There is a Zika epidemic, the economy is in the toilet and a bare-knuckle brawl for the presidency has paralyzed the nation.
But all of the bad news has been temporarily supplanted by an unexpected love affair with the Olympic Games, an event that has softened the hearts of even some of the most hardened cynics who now find themselves swooning with delight and national pride.
Although many people in the poorest areas of Rio still feel that the Olympics are passing them by, a sense of giddiness is palpable across most parts of this city of six million. Working-class families dressed in the yellow and green of Brazil's flag stroll along Copacabana's beachfront promenade at midnight; fervid spectators have been filling stadiums with deafening cheers; and even some shrill critics who warned of chaos and bemoaned the cost overruns have changed their tune, at least for the moment.
"What a shame I decided to take a vacation out of the city during this period," wrote Dora Kramer, a columnist for the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo and a self-described Olympic pessimist.
Like many critics, Ms. Kramer had complained that the Games were inappropriate for a city buckling under crime, rising unemployment and a fiscal crisis that has crippled schools, hospitals and local police departments.
"Rio is a marvel," she wrote.
The euphoria jumped a notch on Monday, when Brazil earned its first gold medal of the Games, in judo. For many, the pride was especially poignant because the winner, Rafaela Silva, is a black woman who grew up in the City of God, one of Rio's most impoverished favelas, or slums.
"Everyone in my neighborhood is filled with excitement, and people are just happier," said Fabio Costa dos Santos, 47, an unemployed City of God resident temporarily working at a Coca-Cola kiosk in the Olympic Village.
The past few days have not been entirely halcyon. On Wednesday, as a chilly rain doused the city, Brazilians absorbed the news that the Senate had voted to hold an impeachment trial for their suspended president, Dilma Rousseff. And despite an enormous security presence, the city's penchant for lawlessness has not been completely stanched, with gun battles between drug dealers and the police terrorizing residents of Complexo do Alemão, a sprawling collection of favelas.
Those able to afford tickets to the Games have also found reasons to grumble. Food at some Olympic venues has been in short supply, and long security lines have caused some spectators to miss the events they had paid to see. A confounding chemical reaction that turned the diving and polo pools an unsettling shade of green has left many shaking their heads.
But these and other episodes have so far failed to burst the celebratory bubble. In some two dozen interviews, Rio residents and visitors from other parts of Brazil marveled at their government's ability to pull off a complex international sporting event without a serious mishap.
Even with seven days to go before the closing ceremony, Brazilians said their fears of a terrorist attack have eased considerably. So, too, have worries that rampant street crime and transportation gridlock would mar the event and embarrass their country, the first in South America to host the Games.
"Before they started, I thought the Olympics were only about construction noise, disruption and holes in the ground," said Marina de Souza Rolim, 91, a retired teacher and lifelong Carioca, as Rio residents are known. "Now I can see this is a beautiful thing."
The shift in sentiment occurred overnight, inspired by an opening ceremony on Aug. 5 that was widely met with approval.
It helps that expectations had been low, but many Brazilians said they were wowed by the parade of celebrities and well-crafted numbers that lionized the nation's rich history and exuberant culture.
Even left-leaning naysayers were cheered by the nod to Brazil's stain of slavery, the paean to Rio's favelas and the appearances of Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, musical giants who back Ms. Rousseff.
Many were also proud that the ceremony was done on a shoestring, showcasing the Brazilian talent for gambiarra, the art of improvising on the cheap.
The turnaround in national sentiment has been striking. In a poll taken in July, nearly two-thirds of Brazilians said hosting the Games would hurt the country, and only 16 percent expressed enthusiasm. The hostility was so intense that protesters repeatedly tried to halt the torch relay with stones and buckets of water as it traveled across the country.
On the night of the opening ceremony, an anti-Olympics protest that took place near the stadium ended violently, with the police lobbing tear gas at an unruly klatch of demonstrators.
Carlos Henrique Carvalho Ferreira, 29, a doctoral student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said that he and many of his friends were initially opposed to the city's hosting the Olympics, but that he had a change of heart after unexpectedly landing cheap tickets to beach volleyball, field hockey and water polo events.
"With so many tourists in the city, it feels like an extended holiday, yet it's been calmer than Carnival or New Year's Eve," he said. "We want to enjoy the moment, but at the same time, we feel a bit guilty."
At a time of intense political polarization, with liberals and conservatives battling over the future of Ms. Rousseff, Brazilians say the Olympics have helped ease the divisions, even if temporarily.
"We are in a very difficult and vulnerable moment right now, and these Olympic Games have united everyone," said Mariana Negrini, 42, who runs a small hotel in the interior state of Goiás. "Instead of us versus them, it feels as if we are one."
The Games have not won everyone over. Restaurant owners and street vendors, especially those far from the Olympic Village, have complained about disappointing sales. And poor Cariocas say they feel excluded by ticket prices that average between $60 and $110 -- most likely a factor in the 1.1 million seats that remained unsold as of Monday.
Others say the Games have fueled a rise in nationalist sentiment that often finds expression on social media. Leonardo Sakamoto, a liberal blogger, said he had become a pariah for maintaining his stance that the Olympics displaced far too many poor residents and that the government had failed to deliver on its promise to clean up Rio's sewage-laden waters.
"Woe to anyone who is not happy and radiant at this moment in which we Brazilians are finally showing the world who we are," he wrote. "Criticizing this cathartic moment is asking to be burned at the stake of social media."
But most Brazilians are reveling in a singular moment that has allowed them to forget the growing inflation, rising unemployment and a staggering corruption scandal that continues to unfold.
Although she has no money for tickets, Mayara Matheus da França Amorim, 27, an unemployed telecommunications analyst, said she was enjoying the free parties and the ebullient crowds of international visitors who have renewed her faith in a wounded nation.
"It's reminded me how hospitable and friendly we are," she said amid the thrum of sidewalk buskers, carousing Europeans and start-up volleyball games on Copacabana Beach. "And it lets me forget how tough my life is."
But soaring highs often give way to nasty hangovers. Last weekend, amid free-flowing cocktails at a hilltop mansion in the city's Santa Teresa neighborhood, Dudi Machado, an editor at large for Harper's Bazaar Brazil, said he was bracing for what will happen after the athletes and spectators go home.
"The Olympics have given us hope in gloomy times, restored our pride and reminded us what we Brazilians are really good at," he said as the host, a prominent socialite, paraded through the crowd with an Olympic torch raised above her head. "I'm worried about the comedown because there's going to be a vacuum after this, and it's going to be bad."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- In nearly eight years in office, President Obama has sought to reshape the nation with a sweeping assertion of executive authority and a canon of regulations that have inserted the United States government more deeply into American life.
Once a presidential candidate with deep misgivings about executive power, Mr. Obama will leave the White House as one of the most prolific authors of major regulations in presidential history.
Blocked for most of his presidency by Congress, Mr. Obama has sought to act however he could. In the process he created the kind of government neither he nor the Republicans wanted -- one that depended on bureaucratic bulldozing rather than legislative transparency. But once Mr. Obama got the taste for it, he pursued his executive power without apology, and in ways that will shape the presidency for decades to come.
The Obama administration in its first seven years finalized 560 major regulations -- those classified by the Congressional Budget Office as having particularly significant economic or social impacts. That was nearly 50 percent more than the George W. Bush administration during the comparable period, according to data kept by the regulatory studies center at George Washington University.
An army of lawyers working under Mr. Obama's authority has sought to restructure the nation's health care and financial industries, limit pollution, bolster workplace protections and extend equal rights to minorities. Under Mr. Obama, the government has literally placed a higher value on human life.
And it has imposed billions of dollars in new costs on businesses and consumers.
Many of the new rules are little known, even as they affect the way Americans eat, love and die. People can dine on genetically engineered salmon. Women can buy emergency contraceptive pills without prescriptions. Military veterans can design their own headstones.
In its final year, the administration is enacting some of its most ambitious rules, including limits on airborne silica at job sites, an overhaul of food labels to clarify nutritional information, and a measure making millions of workers eligible for overtime pay.
The administration's regulatory legacy has become an issue in the campaign to replace Mr. Obama, as Donald J. Trump has sharply criticized regulatory overreach and promised to undo many of the new rules. But executive power has expanded steadily under both Republican and Democratic presidents in recent decades, and both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton have promised to act in the service of their own goals.
The new rules built on the legislative victories Mr. Obama won during his first two years in office. Those laws -- the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and the $800 billion economic stimulus package -- transformed the nation's health care system, curbed the ambitions of the big banks and injected financial support into a creaky economy. But as Republicans increased their control of Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama's deep frustration with congressional opposition led to a new approach: He gradually embraced a president's power to act unilaterally.
History may now judge the regulations to be one of Mr. Obama's most enduring legacies. At the least, his exercise of administrative power expanded and cemented a domestic legacy that now rivals Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society in reach and scope.
In May, Mr. Obama was asked by a farmer in Elkhart, Ind., to justify the "dramatic increase" in government regulations that affected his business. "I'm not interested in regulating just for the sake of regulating," Mr. Obama responded. "But there are some things like making sure we've got clean air and clean water, making sure that folks have health insurance, making sure that worker safety is a priority -- that, I do think, is part of our overall obligation."
Infuriated Republicans describe many of the new rules as unwarranted, resulting in "less jobs, less businesses, less prosperity, lower take-home pay," in the words of the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan. Business groups, also incensed, have challenged a number of new regulations in court, delaying them or preventing them from taking effect. Some economic experts worry that the accumulation of regulation is contributing to the economy's persistent sluggishness.
"The big issue that I grapple with is that the regulatory state keeps growing," said Robert Hahn, an economist and a regulatory expert at the Smith School at the University of Oxford. "And as it keeps growing, when does it become too much?"
Not Inherently a Regulator
Mr. Obama entered office in January 2009 determined to make his mark by passing bold new laws, not by tinkering with rules. Rahm Emanuel, his first chief of staff, and other top aides mapped out an ambitious two-year agenda that included a health care overhaul, new banking laws, a remake of the federal student loan program, infrastructure spending and stricter limits on pollution.
The new president had a skeptical streak when it came to the value of regulation, influenced by his friend Cass R. Sunstein, a Harvard Law professor who had long argued that the government should more rigorously assess the benefits of new regulations. Mr. Obama liked that idea so much that he named Mr. Sunstein to lead the White House office that oversees rule-making.
"The president is not somebody who is intuitively or inherently a regulator," said Howard Shelanski, who followed Mr. Sunstein in that role in mid-2013. He said Mr. Obama conveyed a simple message: "'If we can get a good result without regulating, let's do that."'
But after eight years of a Republican administration, many Democrats were eager for the government to lean more forcefully on the levers of regulatory power, and officials within the federal bureaucracy felt emboldened.
The White House did resist some ideas. It shut down efforts by Lisa Jackson, Mr. Obama's first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to increase the regulation of ozone, a decision that environmentalists viewed as a betrayal.
But other rules were allowed to proceed. Kate Hanni, an advocate from Napa, Calif., for the rights of airline passengers, had tried for years to persuade the government to address a series of incidents in which flight delays left passengers trapped for hours on planes that had already left the gate, often in cabins with stinking toilets, weak air-conditioning and no food. The Bush administration put Ms. Hanni on a task force consisting mostly of airline executives, which concluded in the fall of 2008 -- over her forceful and repeated objections -- that the public was best served by allowing the airlines to make their own decisions.
Weeks after the task force released its report, Ms. Hanni was invited to Washington in December 2008 to meet with Robert S. Rivkin, the head of Mr. Obama's transportation transition team. Democrats in Congress had introduced legislation to address the issue, but Mr. Rivkin asked Ms. Hanni if she would support new regulations instead. She would back anything enforceable, Ms. Hanni said.
"Right answer," he replied.
Over the course of the next nine months, Mr. Rivkin and his team of career regulators at the Department of Transportation developed rules prohibiting planes loaded with passengers from sitting on the tarmac for more than three hours.
In meetings with Ray LaHood, Mr. Obama's first transportation secretary, and his staff, airline representatives argued for flexibility, saying rigid timelines would only increase flight cancellations. They chafed at the regulators' willingness to see the benefits but not the costs.
Sharon L. Pinkerton, an executive at Airlines for America, the industry's main trade group, recalled Transportation Department regulators suggesting that "unquantifiable, unidentifiable benefits" would "outweigh the costs" of new rules for the airlines.
"What are we supposed to do with that?" she asked later in an interview.
But Mr. LaHood had himself experienced long waits on the runway during frequent trips home to Illinois. Just days before Christmas in 2009, he announced a Passenger Bill of Rights, which for the first time levied fines of up to $27,500 per passenger on airlines that leave domestic flights stranded for more than three hours. He challenged the major carriers to provide their service "in a way that is halfway convenient" for their customers.
His department, Mr. LaHood said in a recent interview, had a new sense of purpose, independent of any specific directive from the White House.
"They had other fish to fry," Mr. LaHood said of senior officials at the White House. "We didn't want to wait around for Congress to take five, 10 years to do this. We could do this by rule and regulation, so we were pretty much off to the races."
Other agencies were moving too. In its second year, bureaucrats working across the government completed 96 major rules, more than in any subsequent year.
Equal Rights for Everyone
The White House soon began to take a greater interest in regulation.
In May 2009, Mr. Emanuel raised concerns about Janice Langbehn, a social worker featured in The New York Times who was barred from visiting her hospitalized same-sex partner.
Passing legislation to address the problem was unlikely, Mr. Emanuel knew, given entrenched ideological opposition and the White House's focus on overhauling the health insurance system. But Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the newly created Office of Health Reform, suggested an alternative: The administration had the power to impose conditions on hospitals that got federal Medicare funding.
A year later, the president directed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop regulations requiring hospitals to extend visitation rights to same-sex partners.
"All too often, people are made to suffer or even to pass away alone, denied the comfort of companionship in their final moments while a loved one is left worrying and pacing down the hall," Mr. Obama wrote in an April 2010 memo.
A focus on similar issues produced more than 100 executive actions and regulatory changes intended to improve the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, particularly after the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down the federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman.
People with H.I.V. were no longer barred from entry into the country; federal housing rules recognized lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families; health insurance companies were barred from discriminating against gay people; labor protections applied to gay couples; married same-sex couples could take family and medical leave; and the Internal Revenue Service started treating same-sex couples no differently.
"These are really lasting things," said David Stacy, the government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy organization. "They affect people in their everyday lives."
The Value of Regulation
As the Obama administration turned toward regulation, it sought to strengthen its hand by changing the estimates of what a life is worth. Those estimates allowed the administration to argue that the benefits of many regulations were greater than previously appreciated. This push was particularly important as a justification for stronger environmental protections.
A White House push to pass a sweeping climate change bill in 2009 failed to pass in Congress, but almost from the outset some of Mr. Obama's aides were working on a Plan B. Mr. Sunstein and Michael Greenstone, the first head of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, created an internal task force to put a dollar figure on the cost of carbon emissions.
The government does not try to quantify all the benefits of proposed regulations. When it came to environmental regulations, the calculation was particularly limited. Analysts often assigned a dollar figure to just one kind of damage -- emissions of "small particles" -- and then stacked up the costs of the proposal against the benefits of fewer particles.
Quantifying a second kind of damage, from carbon emissions, would broaden the assessed benefits of new regulations -- potentially justifying new and stronger restrictions. In 2010, the administration issued a report that estimated the economic impact of global warming, including agricultural disruptions, increased flooding and health problems. It pegged the cost of carbon emissions at $21 per ton. An updated assessment in 2013 raised the price tag to $33.
When the administration announced stricter standards for automobile fuel efficiency in 2011, it cited the reduction in carbon emissions as a key benefit. Those benefits have since been cited in several dozen new regulations, including the hotly debated 2015 rule seeking to restrict emissions from new power plants.
Regulators also revisited a more fundamental concept: the value of life. Not just a theological or philosophical abstraction, that figure is used to assess how much spending the government should require to prevent death or injury.
The Department of Transportation, for example, increased the estimated value of preventing one death from $6.6 million in 2009 to $9.4 million last year, adjusting for inflation. The department made an even larger adjustment for preventing injuries, for example raising the value of averting a broken arm from $103,000 in 2009 to $442,000 in 2015, also adjusting for inflation. The increases have helped to justify new requirements for stronger roofs and rearview cameras on automobiles and seatbelts on buses.
The new carbon cost estimate, in particular, has drawn fire from industry groups who regard it as an arbitrary assessment intended to further an environmental agenda.
Environmentalists, however, argue that the government is still significantly understating the actual impact. A 2014 analysis by economists at Stanford University, published in the science journal Nature, estimated that the cost of carbon was actually $220 per ton, far above the government's official estimate.
Mr. Greenstone, in a recent interview, defended the government's number as a result of a technocratic process that was not influenced by political pressures.
"Our job as faceless bureaucrats sitting in windowless rooms was not to do science but to summarize the frontier of science," he said. " And I feel that we were faithful to that."
The Room Where It Happens
By the fall of 2011, after a summer standoff between the two political parties nearly caused a government shutdown, it was clear to Mr. Obama that little hope remained for moving his agenda forward in a Congress controlled by Republicans.
Speaking in Las Vegas that October, Mr. Obama expressed disdain for "an increasingly dysfunctional Congress" and pledged: "Where they won't act, I will."
That sentiment kicked off a slow-moving realignment as White House officials held a series of strategy meetings that fall in the Roosevelt Room, first with Mr. Obama on Saturdays and later with agency and policy experts, usually on Tuesdays and Fridays. Led by Ms. DeParle, who had become deputy chief of staff, and Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, they asked: What can we do without Congress?
"It's certainly true that we learned by about the third year that the answer to every challenge isn't going to be legislative," said Cecilia Muñoz, now director of Mr. Obama's Domestic Policy Council.
The pace of regulation stalled somewhat in 2012, amid political concerns about announcing sweeping new regulations during the campaign. In 2013, Mr. Obama's team briefly hoped his victory would lead to legislative progress, but Republicans blocked gun control measures and an immigration overhaul, and partisan gridlock shut the government down for 15 days that October.
In early 2014, the moment was finally ripe. Mr. Obama recruited John D. Podesta, then the head of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and policy institution, to be his counselor in the White House
"The weight, if you will, changed with a very recalcitrant Republican House, and with both the House and the Senate being part of the 'Nyet!' caucus," Mr. Podesta said. "It meant that you had to be seriously concerned with trying to make change happen with the tools that you had available."
A Year of Action
In January 2014 a frustrated president stood before Congress and declared "a year of action" -- with or without the help of the Republicans arrayed before him.
"Whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do," Mr. Obama said in his State of the Union address.
Mr. Obama announced an executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for several hundred thousand cooks, janitors and other federal contract workers. In subsequent orders, each resulting in a new regulation, the president required contractors to let their workers take paid sick days and banned discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. He also increased workplace protections for all workers at businesses that held federal contracts -- an umbrella covering roughly 29 million workers.
"What the president was ultimately doing was holding up the United States government as a model employer," said Joseph Geevarghese, director of Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed advocacy group that pressed the administration to embrace its regulatory power. "And it created a ripple effect. Within months of the president acting you had private C.E.O.s -- Ikea, Gap, Disney, airlines -- saying they too were going to boost minimum pay."
The new regulations again required the White House to broaden its assessment of regulatory benefits. During Mr. Obama's first term, administration officials told Mr. Geevarghese and other activists that the government did not have the power to make such changes. But after Mr. Obama's re-election, they found a way: White House lawyers concluded that the president could impose requirements on contractors in the interest of taxpayers.
Betsey Stevenson, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, took the lead in building a case that contractors who paid higher wages would attract and retain better workers, increasing their productivity.
The theory holds, for example, that if the lunch lines at a federal office building moved a little more quickly because of more competent, motivated cafeteria workers, every employee in those lines would save a few minutes a day and have more time to work, thus increasing productivity.
The idea has its roots in work by George Akerlof, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and his wife, Janet Yellen, now chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, who decided in the early 1980s to pay their babysitter above-market wages as motivation.
With the president's blessing, the E.P.A. also became more aggressive. The agency asserted federal authority to protect thousands of waterways and wetlands, proposed to cap carbon emissions at new and existing power plants, raised emissions standards for trucks and airplanes, and called for new limits on methane, mercury and ozone.
"He has been much more ambitious and aggressive on environmental regulation than any other president we've had," said Jeffrey Holmstead, a lawyer pursuing legal challenges to some of Mr. Obama's signature environmental rules.
Courts have now temporarily blocked the administration's water rules and delayed the power plant limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The next administration will also have considerable leeway to determine how quickly new rules are carried out, and how strictly enforced.
The Next White House
Every president promises to prune the federal rule book.
Mr. Obama has tried to formalize the process for reviewing existing regulations, and the two candidates vying to take his place, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, have nodded at the need to ease the burdens of regulation.
But the scope of federal regulation has continued to grow, and the trend is likely to continue. Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, have asserted greater power in recent decades to dictate the shape of regulations, while Congress has become less specific in its instructions.
"We live in an era of presidential administration," Elena Kagan, a Harvard law professor since appointed by Mr. Obama to the Supreme Court, wrote in a 2001 paper that reviewed the expansion of the regulatory state.
Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump would most likely face significant congressional opposition to their major campaign promises. To sidestep Congress, they now have the legacy of Mr. Obama. Mr. Podesta, now Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, said the appeal of taking action without Congress is hard to resist.
"You come in with a strategy of going to the Hill, certainly where you can find some cooperation," Mr. Podesta said. But when that fails, writing regulations "is a way to get much more substantial throw-weight behind solving the problem."

Full text:   In a speech in Detroit on Monday, Donald J. Trump put forward a huge tax cut as the centerpiece of his economic program. He compared his plan to Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut, saying his proposal would be "the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan tax reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation."
I know something about the Reagan tax cut. In 1977, while working for Representative Jack Kemp, Republican of New York, I drafted the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which Reagan sent to Congress in early 1981. The law cut statutory tax rates by about 25 percent across the board.
It is G.O.P. dogma that the Reagan tax cut set off an economic boom. Every Republican presidential nominee since the 1980s has promised big tax cuts and another economic surge. Tax increases, Republicans believe, are the kiss of death for the economy.
While Mr. Trump has been unafraid to differ with Republican doctrine on many issues, such as Iraq and trade, he is embracing party orthodoxy on taxes. But the Reagan tax cut is not the medicine the economy needs.
Tax rates were very high when Reagan proposed cutting them -- much higher than today. The high tax rates from the World War II era had been only partly cut by John F. Kennedy, and the top income-tax rate was 70 percent. Inflation was pushing workers into higher tax brackets when they received cost-of-living pay raises.
According to the Tax Policy Center, the average federal income-tax rate on a family of four with the median income rose from 9.1 percent in 1972 to 11.8 percent in 1981. The marginal tax rate -- the tax on the last dollar earned -- rose from 19 percent to 24 percent in the same period.
By contrast, the average tax rate on the median family in 2014 was just 5.3 percent, and the marginal rate was 15 percent. Inflation is nonexistent, and no one is being pushed into higher tax brackets by it.
In short, taxes were too high in 1981 and needed to be cut -- including for the rich. The tax rates above 50 percent were not bringing in much revenue because wealthy people were likely to invest in tax shelters.
But the Reagan tax cut played only a secondary role in the 1980s boom, which wasn't really much of a boom. Real G.D.P. grew 37.9 percent in the 1970s, compared with 36.1 percent in the 1980s. The economy felt better because inflation came down extraordinarily quickly, far more quickly than economists in 1980 thought was possible. But this was primarily a result of the Federal Reserve's tight money policy, not taxes.
The tax cut deserves credit for softening the blow from the reduction in inflation, which brought on a sharp recession in 1981-82. But what we think of as the Reagan boom was the typical rebound from a sharp recession, just as we had seen after all previous postwar recessions. Much credit for growth in the Reagan years must go to the sharp increase in government purchases for his defense buildup.
What many Republicans also forget is that Reagan cared about deficits and supported 11 different tax increases from 1982 to 1988 that collectively took back half of the 1981 tax cut. Although many conservative economists predicted doom from the 1982 tax increase, which equaled 1 percent of G.D.P., the beginning of the boom coincided with its enactment.
These economists also predicted catastrophe from the 1993 tax increase enacted under President Bill Clinton and from the expiration of many of President George W. Bush's tax cuts in 2013. But in each case financial markets and the economy grew sharply afterward. By contrast, the economy tanked during the Bush years despite numerous large tax cuts.
The final proof that tax cuts are not the be-all and end-all of growth policy is the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which dropped the top income-tax rate to 28 percent. Conservative doctrine predicted an economic boom, but I don't remember one, nor can I find one in the data.
Those economists who claim to be following Reagan's policies by supporting Mr. Trump's large tax-cut proposal are guilty of one-size-fits-all economics. There is far more evidence from the last 35 years showing that tax increases do more to stimulate growth than tax cuts.
I wouldn't suggest that tax increases are always the answer. Whether taxes should be raised or cut can be determined only by analysis, not by dogma.

Full text:   Soft economic data weighed on the dollar and Treasury yields on Friday and pressured stock prices, but Wall Street's losses were softened by continued gains in oil prices.
Retail sales were unexpectedly flat in July as Americans cut back on purchases of clothing and other goods.
"That was certainly the headline; I think it spooked a lot of investors this morning," John Traynor, chief investment officer of People's United Wealth Management in Bridgeport, Conn., said of the retail sales report.
"But the underlying news is still very positive," Mr. Traynor said. "Wages are growing, employment is growing and that's key."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,576.47, The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.74 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,184.05.
The Nasdaq composite index added 4.50 points, or 0.09 percent, to 5,232.90 -- setting another record high.
Shares of the chip maker Nvidia shares rose 5.6 percent after its results helped bolster the Nasdaq.
All three indicators ended at record highs on Thursday, the first time they have done so simultaneously since 1999, and they posted slim weekly gains.
Also among the day's bright spots, the department store chain Nordstrom rose 8 percent to $51.38 after it reported better-than-expected comparable sales and quarterly profit.
J. C. Penney shares jumped 6.1 percent to $10.55, also after upbeat results. The S.&P. retail index gained 0.3 percent.
Energy shares were the best-performing S.&P. sector, rising 0.7 percent and mitigating broader declines as crude prices gained.
Exxon Mobil rose 1.3 percent to $87.85 and gave the biggest boost to the Dow and S.&P. 500, while Chevron added 0.75 percent to $102.16.
The recent "strength in crude has both lifted equity prices and also tended to assuage that fear that we are going into a season of protracted anemic consumer and global demand," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in Berkeley Heights, N.J. "Crude oil is an enormously important factor right now in the global market."
Oil rose after a short-covering rally was triggered by comments from Saudi Arabia's oil minister in the previous session about possible action to help stabilize the market.
Brent crude futures settled 2 percent higher at $46.97 a barrel. In the United States, crude settled up $1 at $44.49.
The dollar fell 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies.
"The U.S. retail sales data in particular is causing the dollar to weaken," said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities in New York.
Benchmark Treasury yields fell to their lowest in nearly two weeks after the economic data, with 10-year Treasury notes last rising 18/32 in price, pushing the yield down to 1.51 percent, from 1.56 percent on Thursday.
Analysts said that cooling consumer spending and tame inflation suggested that the Federal Reserve would probably not raise interest rates any time soon, despite a robust labor market.
"The relationship is pretty straightforward: with low inflation and low growth comes lower interest rates," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
European shares edged back after setting a fresh seven-week high on Friday. The DAX index in Germany fell 0.3 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 lost 0.1 percent. In Britain, the FTSE 100 ended with a slight gain.

Abstract: With both major-party presidential candidates vying for working-class voters, Hillary Clinton on Thursday followed Donald J. Trump to Michigan to outline her job-creation plans, answering his economic address on Monday in Detroit. [...]according to an independent analysis by a former economic adviser to Senator John McCain, if you add up all of Trump's ideas -- from cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations, to starting a trade war with China, to deporting millions of hardworking immigrants -- the result would be a loss of 3.4 million jobs. Fact Check: Mrs. Clinton was making the point that, for many people, post-high school options that she promised to promote with government help -- like job-training programs and community college degrees -- would be sufficient to find jobs.

Full text:   With both major-party presidential candidates vying for working-class voters, Hillary Clinton on Thursday followed Donald J. Trump to Michigan to outline her job-creation plans, answering his economic address on Monday in Detroit. Mrs. Clinton spoke at Futuramic Tool & Engineering Company in Macomb County, long known as a home to political ticket-splitters. Some of her statements deserved a closer look. Here are a few.
Claim: "Even conservative experts say Trump's agenda will pull our economy back into recession. And according to an independent analysis by a former economic adviser to Senator John McCain, if you add up all of Trump's ideas -- from cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations, to starting a trade war with China, to deporting millions of hardworking immigrants -- the result would be a loss of 3.4 million jobs. Now, by contrast, the same analyst found that with our plans, the economy would create more than 10 million new jobs."
Fact Check: Mrs. Clinton stretched facts to ascribe such negative findings about the Trump agenda to "conservative experts" and a former McCain adviser. She referred to an analysis of the Trump plans in June by the economic research firm Moody's Analytics led by Mark Zandi. He did advise the McCain presidential campaign in 2008, but he also has advised Democrats, including President Obama's team, and contributed to Mrs. Clinton's campaign last year.
Moody's concluded that Mr. Trump's plans would cost 3.5 million jobs and provoke "a lengthy recession" by the end of his term. That analysis does not reflect changes that Mr. Trump unveiled on Monday, which reduced the size of his tax cuts. Previously, a range of analysts estimated his tax cuts could add about $10 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years. Reducing that cost presumably could in turn reduce analysts' projections of lost jobs and economic growth. But it remains unclear, because Mr. Trump did not provide enough detail to draw conclusions.
_____
Claim: "We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II." To date, such investments "have been completely blocked in Congress, and American workers in communities have paid the price."
Fact Check: Mrs. Clinton was referring to her proposal for $275 billion in new infrastructure spending to build and modernize roads, bridges, airports, railways, ports, schools, water systems and more. That sum is ambitious, and indeed Mr. Obama's annual call for a similar infrastructure program has been blocked by congressional Republicans, who object to its size and to proposals to pay for it with tax increases.
But hers would not be the biggest investment since the war, allowing for inflation. That honor probably belongs to the project to build the interstate highway system, initiated during the Eisenhower administration, which cost $329 billion by the 1996 estimate of an association of automotive and highway construction industries. Adjusted for inflation 20 years later, that would be more than $500 billion.
_____
Claim: Lack of broadband access "disadvantages kids, who are asked to do homework using the internet -- five million of them live in homes without access to the internet. So you talk about an achievement gap -- it starts right there."
Fact Check: That indeed was the conclusion last year of an analysis of the "homework gap" by the Pew Research Center. It found that about 82.5 percent of the 29 million households with children ages 6 to 17 have broadband access. "This means that some five million households with school-age children do not have high-speed internet service at home. Low-income households -- and especially black and Hispanic ones -- make up a disproportionate share."
In households with incomes below $50,000 -- about 40 percent of all families -- one out of three do not have access.
_____
Claim: "We've got to reverse what has become a kind of commonplace view, which is everybody needs to go to college. Well, in fact, more than half of the jobs that are going to be available in 2020 do not require a college four-year degree."
Fact Check: Mrs. Clinton was making the point that, for many people, post-high school options that she promised to promote with government help -- like job-training programs and community college degrees -- would be sufficient to find jobs. Studies back her up. An analysis by Georgetown University on jobs and education requirements through 2020 found that 65 percent of jobs in 2020 would require some postsecondary education. But just 35 percent of jobs would demand a four-year degree or better.
_____
Claim: "I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president."
Fact Check: What Mrs. Clinton leaves unsaid is that she did not oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the past, before she was a presidential candidate contending with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fiercely anti-trade liberal, for the Democratic nomination. As secretary of state, she backed the Obama administration's negotiations for the trade agreement among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations that would be the largest regional pact in history. Midway through years of talks that concluded in October, she called the emerging agreement the "gold standard" of trade pacts.
In 2012, for example, she said in Australia, "This T.P.P. sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade." But just days after the nations' trade ministers announced a final agreement in October, Mrs. Clinton -- under pressure from Mr. Sanders -- expressed opposition, saying it would not raise wages for American workers.
_____
Claim: By eliminating the estate tax as Mr. Trump proposes, "if you believe that he's as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the Trump family $4 billion. It would do nothing for 99.8 percent of Americans."
Fact Check: Mrs. Clinton is, mischievously, giving Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt on his claims about his net worth, as she indicated. As such, her calculation could be about right, though it is impossible to know what taxes Mr. Trump's heirs would pay upon his death without knowing his actual net worth and what estate-tax planning he has done -- like nearly all wealthy people -- to reduce the liability.
The businessman has said his net worth is about $10 billion, though even some Republicans have expressed doubt and attributed Mr. Trump's refusal to release his federal income tax returns to the possibility those would prove he is worth less. The top rate for estate and gift taxes is 40 percent on amounts above $5.45 million (or double that, shielding the first $10.9 million from taxation, if his wife, Melania, survived him). Roughly apply that rate to $10 billion, and estate taxes would be in the range of $4 billion. Mrs. Clinton is also correct that most Americans, including wealthy ones, are not affected now by estate taxes. According to the Internal Revenue Service, they apply to 0.2 percent of estates.

Abstract: The stock market has bounced back in recent weeks, buoyed by strong job growth in the United States, improved company earnings and persistently low inflation and interest rates. Data out of China showing that consumer price growth declined in July for the third month in a row helped fuel expectations among investors that Beijing would pump out more stimulus in a bid to soften the slowdown in its economy, the world's second-largest after the United States.

Full text:   Stocks on Wall Street recovered from a late-afternoon slide to eke out small gains on Tuesday, nudging the Nasdaq composite to its second record close in less than a week.
The three major stock indexes, all of which set new highs last Friday, rebounded from a slight decline on Monday.
Investors focused on the latest batch of company earnings, bidding up health care, telecommunications and consumer-focused companies most.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 3.76 points, or 0.02 percent, to 18,533.05. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.85 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,181.74. The Nasdaq composite index gained 12.34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,225.48. That's up less than 0.1 percent from its most recent high last Friday.
Energy was the biggest laggard, as crude oil prices closed lower, backtracking after an early rally. Traders also sold off shares in department store chains after Gap reported lower sales figures.
For the year, the Dow is now up 6.4 percent, while the S.&P. is up 6.7 percent and the Nasdaq is up 4.4 percent.
The stock market has bounced back in recent weeks, buoyed by strong job growth in the United States, improved company earnings and persistently low inflation and interest rates.
On Tuesday, stocks in the United States got some help early on from a rally in European markets and in Asia, where most of the indexes closed higher.
Data out of China showing that consumer price growth declined in July for the third month in a row helped fuel expectations among investors that Beijing would pump out more stimulus in a bid to soften the slowdown in its economy, the world's second-largest after the United States.
On Wall Street, traders bid up shares in several companies that posted strong quarterly results.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals surged 25.4 percent after the Canadian drug maker reaffirmed its earnings outlook for the year, despite reporting a wider second-quarter loss. The company said it was undergoing a restructuring.
Retailers didn't fare as well.
Gap sank 6.2 percent after reporting lower sales in the second quarter and in July. Kohl's also fell, shedding 4.2 percent, and Target slid 3.2 percent.
The home furnishings store Wayfair slumped 19.6 percent after posting a wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter.
An early rally in United States crude oil prices evaporated. Benchmark crude fell 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $42.77 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid 39 cents, or 0.9 percent, to close at $45 a barrel in London.
The slide in oil weighed on several oil and gas companies. NRG Energy fell 5.1 percent, while Southwestern Energy shed 3.6 percent. Chesapeake Energy also declined 4 percent.
The DAX in Germany rose 2.5 percent, while the CAC 40 in France gained 1.2 percent. The British FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent.
Markets in Asia were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.7 percent, while the South Korean Kospi climbed 0.6 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.1 percent, while China's Shanghai composite index gained 0.7 percent. Stocks in Australia, Taiwan and the Philippines were also higher.
In metals trading, the price of gold rose $5.60, or 0.4 percent, to $1,339 an ounce. Silver added 6 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $19.91 an ounce. Copper slipped 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.15 a pound.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.55 percent from 1.59 percent late Monday.
In currency markets, the dollar fell to 101.90 yen from 102.43 yen on Monday, while the euro strengthened to $1.1109 from $1.1080.

Full text:   Spend enough time traveling around the United States and you're bound to notice a dramatic variation in what a dollar can buy.
Everything from the price of a cup of coffee to the cost of a house can fluctuate between, and even within, states.
A gallon of regular gas costs $2.74 in Hawaii, but just $1.82 in South Carolina.
The average Connecticut resident pays twice as much for electricity as the average Tennessee resident.
A $7 lager in San Francisco might cost you half as much in Chicago. A $5 hamburger in California may be a dollar cheaper in Nebraska.
Tuition at public colleges varies by orders of magnitude.
Fortunately for the confused consumer, the federal government now measures these variations.
For a few years now, the agency that tracks gross domestic product, personal income and other economic indicators has also produced what it calls Regional Price Parities, measures of price fluctuations across states and metropolitan areas.
That data, published in July by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, shows that a dollar can swing by more than 30 percent in terms of what it can buy.
"Regional price differences are strikingly large; real purchasing power is 36 percent greater in Mississippi than it is in the District of Columbia," Alan Cole, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a think tank, noted last week in a blog post.
To better understand, imagine a store offering a range of goods and services, each for sale at the national-average price for that particular item. Now, imagine a shopping cart filled with $100 worth of items from that store.
In Hawaii, $100 buys about 85 percent of the goods in the cart thanks to the high prices there. In other words, $100 in Hawaii feels more like $85.60, compared to the national average.
In Mississippi, the opposite is true. With $100, you would be able to buy the cart's contents and more: the equivalent of $115.30 of goods and services from the national-average store.
The "real value" of a dollar is highest in Mississippi, Arkansas ($114.30), Alabama ($113.90), South Dakota ($113.60) and Kentucky ($112.70). It buys the least in the District of Columbia ($84.70), Hawaii, New York ($86.40), New Jersey ($87.30), California ($89) and Maryland ($90.70).
The Regional Price Parities are calculated using data already collected for another indicator, the Consumer Price Index, which serves as a measure of inflation.
For that index, the government tracks prices of more than 200 goods and services, including men's suits, college textbooks, cereal, electricity and cars and trucks. It also tallies rents, which are particularly variable among states.
The "real value" of $100 in rent can range from roughly $63 in Hawaii to $160 in Arkansas.
Generally, the prices of goods and services in states correlate with the nominal incomes, according to Mr. Cole.
"There is a relationship between the two: in places with higher incomes, the prices of finite resources like land get bid up," he wrote.
But, he noted, when prices in a region are high, employers often raise pay to attract and retain talent.
The two don't always correlate, however. Some states are home to high incomes and low prices, a valuable combination for working residents.
After adjusting for the purchasing power of a dollar, North Dakota emerges as the state where per capita incomes have the most purchasing power.
The "real per capita personal income" there is roughly $56,000. Connecticut is next at $55,000, followed by Washington, D.C., at $54,000, Wyoming at $52,000, Massachusetts at $50,000 and Nebraska at $48,000.
The states where incomes fall shortest are Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho and Hawaii, all of them home to real per capita personal incomes of $36,000, give or take a few hundred dollars.

Mr. Trump's Scary Economic Blueprint

Abstract: [...]electricity rates, adjusted for inflation, have increased just 2.2 percent, to 12.82 cents per kilowatt-hour, from 2008 to 2015 and are expected to decline to 12.64 cents this year, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

Full text:   Donald Trump said on Monday that he wanted to usher in "economic renewal," but most of his proposals would hurt the economy, rack up huge deficits, accelerate climate change and leave the country isolated from the world.
In a speech billed as a blueprint for stimulating growth and creating jobs, Mr. Trump offered a grab bag of ideas that borrow from discredited supply-side economics, the fossil fuel industry's wish list and "America First" isolationism. He also criticized Hillary Clinton and President Obama for what he called their "job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing" agenda. It was vintage Trump, full of promises of greatness and victories backed by fantastical proposals.
Mr. Trump told the Detroit Economic Club that he would cut taxes to an extent not seen since Ronald Reagan was in the White House. He said he would slash the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, arguing that the current statutory 35 percent is one of the highest among developed countries. He did not mention that the average effective corporate tax rate was 18.1 percent in 2015, including state and local taxes, according to the White House and the Treasury Department. He claims he would help workers by getting rid of the estate tax, though repealing it would have almost no effect on working families. Under current law, that tax doesn't touch 99.8 percent of all estates because it applies only to that portion of an estate that exceeds $5.4 million for an individual or $10.9 million for a married couple.
The big problem with Mr. Trump's tax ideas is that they would leave a multitrillion-dollar deficit for no benefit. Proponents of supply-side economics argue that cutting tax rates encourages people to work and businesses to invest. But the gains are much more modest than proponents claim because many businesses won't invest unless demand for their products is growing and many people are not motivated by lower tax rates to work more.
On the other hand, significant tax cuts exact very real costs. Mr. Trump's previous tax plan, released last year, would have reduced federal revenue by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center, meaning that Mr. Trump would have to slash government spending or increase borrowing substantially. George W. Bush pushed big tax cuts through Congress in 2001 and 2003 with the promises of strong growth that never materialized.
Mr. Trump also promises to take a machete to existing federal regulations and put a moratorium on new rules. He wants to get rid of environmental policies that he says are driving up the cost of electricity by restricting the production and use of coal and other fossil fuels. In fact, electricity rates, adjusted for inflation, have increased just 2.2 percent, to 12.82 cents per kilowatt-hour, from 2008 to 2015 and are expected to decline to 12.64 cents this year, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.
Increasing fossil fuel production, and the carbon dioxide emissions associated with it, is exactly the wrong strategy at a time when the world has become increasingly concerned about global warming and its disastrous consequences. But this is of little concern to Mr. Trump, who has dismissed climate change as a hoax and whose "energy revolution," as he outlined it on Monday, made no mention of carbon-free renewable energy sources.
On trade, Mr. Trump renewed his pledge to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that Mr. Obama negotiated with 11 countries. Mr. Trump claims he can bring back millions of manufacturing jobs to the United States by slapping retaliatory tariffs against China for manipulating its currency, offering illegal subsidies to its exporters and stealing intellectual property from American companies. But such actions would do nothing to recreate jobs that have been replaced by automation, and companies could move production to other developing countries. Mr. Trump's earlier pledge to put a 45 percent tariff on all Chinese goods would almost certainly start a trade war that would harm American industries that export goods to China.
Mr. Trump considers himself a businessman, uniquely capable of improving the economy. But this list of misguided and risky proposals would reduce economic growth while showering the rich with tax breaks.

Abstract: In Florida, green slime infests beaches, in large part because failure to upgrade an 80-year-old dike or to purchase more land as a runoff area is forcing the Army Corps of Engineers to release polluted water from Lake Okeechobee. Despite a low headline unemployment rate, the U.S. economy is still probably short of full employment, and an investment agenda would also offer valuable insurance against possible future downturns.

Full text:   The campaign still has three ugly months to go, but the odds -- 83 percent odds, according to the New York Times's model -- are that it will end with the election of a sane, sensible president. So what should she do to boost America's economy, which is doing better than most of the world but is still falling far short of where it should be?
There are, of course, many ways our economic policy could be improved. But the most important thing we need is sharply increased public investment in everything from energy to transportation to wastewater treatment.
How should we pay for this investment? We shouldn't -- not now, or any time soon. Right now there is an overwhelming case for more government borrowing.
Let me walk through this case, then address some of the usual objections.
First, we have obvious, pressing needs for public investment in many areas. In Washington, the aging Metro is in such bad shape that whole lines may have to be shut down for maintenance. In Florida, green slime infests beaches, in large part because failure to upgrade an 80-year-old dike or to purchase more land as a runoff area is forcing the Army Corps of Engineers to release polluted water from Lake Okeechobee. There are similar stories all across America.
So investing more in infrastructure would clearly make us richer. Meanwhile, the federal government can borrow at incredibly low interest rates: 10-year, inflation-protected bonds yielded just 0.09 percent on Friday.
Put these two facts together -- big needs for public investment, and very low interest rates -- and it suggests not just that we should be borrowing to invest, but that this investment might well pay for itself even in purely fiscal terms. How so? Spending more now would mean a bigger economy later, which would mean more tax revenue. This additional revenue would probably be larger than any rise in future interest payments.
And this analysis doesn't even take into account the potential role of public investment in job creation: Despite a low headline unemployment rate, the U.S. economy is still probably short of full employment, and an investment agenda would also offer valuable insurance against possible future downturns.
So why aren't we borrowing and investing? Here are some of the usual objections, and why they're wrong.
We can't borrow because we already have too much debt. People who say this usually like to cite big numbers -- "Our debt is 19 trillion dollars," they intone in their best Dr. Evil voice. But everything about the U.S. economy is huge, and what matters is the comparison between the cost of servicing our debt and our ability to pay. And federal interest payments are only 1.3 percent of G.D.P., low by historical standards.
Borrowing costs may be low now, but they might rise. Yes, maybe. But we're talking about long-term borrowing that locks in today's low rates. If 10 years isn't long enough for you, how about 30-year, inflation-protected bonds? They're only yielding 0.64 percent.
The government can't do anything right. Solyndra! Solyndra! Benghazi! A large part of our political class is committed to the proposition that any and all government efforts to improve our lives are doomed to failure -- a proposition that turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy when these people are actually in office. But to hold that view you have to turn your back on our own history: American greatness was in large part created by government investment or private investment shaped by public support, from the Erie Canal, to the transcontinental railroads, to the Interstate Highway System.
As for the constant harping on individual failures, all large organizations, private businesses very much included, engage in some projects that don't work out. Yes, some renewable-energy investments went bad -- but overall, the Obama administration's promotion of solar and wind has been a huge success, with a rough quadrupling of production since 2008. Green energy should be seen as an inspiration, not a cautionary tale.
There is, in short, an overwhelming policy case for federal borrowing to pay for public investment. But will the next president be able to act on this case?
The good news is that elite discourse seems, finally, to be moving in the right direction. Five years ago the Beltway crowd was fixated on debt and deficits as the great evils. Today, not so much.
The bad news is that even if Hillary Clinton wins, she may well face the same kind of scorched-earth Republican opposition President Obama faced from day one. So it matters not just who wins in November, but by how much. Will there be a strong enough Democratic wave to give Mrs. Clinton the ability to act?
But while the politics remain uncertain, it's clear what we should be doing. It's time for the federal government to borrow and invest.

Abstract: According to a new analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute, 81 percent of the United States population is in an income bracket with flat or declining income over the last decade. Like most things in economics, the slowdown boils down to supply and demand: the ability of the global economy to produce goods and services, and the desire of consumers and businesses to buy them.

Full text:   One central fact about the global economy lurks just beneath the year's remarkable headlines: Economic growth in advanced nations has been weaker for longer than it has been in the lifetime of most people on earth.
The United States is adding jobs at a healthy clip, as a new report showed Friday, and the unemployment rate is relatively low. But that is happening despite a long-term trend of much lower growth, both in the United States and other advanced nations, than was evident for most of the post-World War II era.
This trend helps explain why incomes have risen so slowly since the turn of the century, especially for those who are not top earners. It is behind the cheap gasoline you put in the car and the ultralow interest rates you earn on your savings. It is crucial to understanding the rise of Donald J. Trump, Britain's vote to leave the European Union, and the rise of populist movements across Europe.
This slow growth is not some new phenomenon, but rather the way it has been for 15 years and counting. In the United States, per-person gross domestic product rose by an average of 2.2 percent a year from 1947 through 2000 -- but starting in 2001 has averaged only 0.9 percent. The economies of Western Europe and Japan have done worse than that.
Over long periods, that shift implies a radically slower improvement in living standards. In the year 2000, per-person G.D.P. -- which generally tracks with the average American's income -- was about $45,000. But if growth in the second half of the 20th century had been as weak as it has been since then, that number would have been only about $20,000.
To make matters worse, fewer and fewer people are seeing the spoils of what growth there is. According to a new analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute, 81 percent of the United States population is in an income bracket with flat or declining income over the last decade. That number was 97 percent in Italy, 70 percent in Britain, and 63 percent in France.
Like most things in economics, the slowdown boils down to supply and demand: the ability of the global economy to produce goods and services, and the desire of consumers and businesses to buy them. What's worrisome is that weakness in global supply and demand seems to be pushing each other in a vicious circle.
It increasingly looks as if something fundamental is broken in the global growth machine -- and that the usual menu of policies, like interest rate cuts and modest fiscal stimulus, aren't up to the task of fixing it (though some well-devised policies could help).
The underlying reality of low growth will haunt whoever wins the White House in November, as well as leaders in Europe and Japan. An entire way of thinking about the future -- that children will inevitably live in a much richer country than their parents -- is thrown into question the longer this lasts.
The first step to trying to reverse the slowdown is to understand why it's happening. A good way to do that is to re-examine predictions from smart economists.
In January 2005, as it does every year, the Congressional Budget Office released its forecast for the United States' budget and economic outlook over the decade to come. If the C.B.O.'s projections had come true, the United States would have had $3.1 trillion more economic output in 2015 than it actually did -- 17 percent more. Even if the steep contraction of 2008-2009 hadn't happened, the shortfall would have been $1.7 trillion.
As a matter of arithmetic, the slowdown in growth has two potential components: people working fewer hours, and less economic output being generated for each hour of labor. Both have contributed to the economy's underperformance.
In 2000, Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, published a paper titled "Does the 'New Economy' Measure Up to the Great Inventions of the Past?" It argued that the internet would not have the same transformative impact on how much economic output would emerge from an hour of human labor as 20th-century innovations like electricity, air transport and indoor plumbing did.
It was a distinctly minority view in that apex of technological optimism. "People said: 'Productivity growth is exploding, Gordon. You're wrong; we're in a new age,' " Mr. Gordon said. But as productivity growth slowed several years later, "people started to take my point of view more and more seriously."
He offers the example of the self-check-in computer technology that airlines use. When introduced in the early 2000s, it really did mean greater productivity: Fewer airline clerks were needed for every passenger. But the gain was more a one-time bump than a continuing trend.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, director of the C.B.O. at the time of the 2005 forecast and now president of the American Action Forum, said technology "just seems to be less special and more comparable to other forms of investments than it had seemed."
The forecasters thought the average output for an hour of labor would rise 29 percent from 2005 to 2014. Instead it was 15 percent.
But it's not just that each hour of work is producing less than projected. Fewer people are working fewer hours than seemed likely not long ago.
The unemployment rate is actually lower than the C.B.O. projected it to be a decade ago (it saw it as stable at 5.2 percent; it was 4.9 percent in July). But the unemployment rate counts only those actively seeking a job. There were five million fewer Americans in the labor force -- neither working nor looking -- in 2015 than projected.
An analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers last year estimated that about half of the decline in labor force participation since 2009 was caused by aging of the population (which was anticipated in the projection), and about 14 percent from the economic cycle. About a third of the decline was a mysterious "residual": younger people leaving the work force, perhaps because they saw little opportunity or viewed the potential wages they could earn as inadequate.
Weak productivity and fewer workers are hits to the "supply" side of the economy. But there is evidence that a shortage of demand is a major part of the problem, too.
Think of the economy as a car; if you try to accelerate far beyond the speed it's capable of, a car won't go any faster but the engine will overheat. Similarly, if the voluntarily exit of people from the labor force and lower-than-expected gains from technological advances were the entire story behind the growth slowdown, there should be evidence the economy is overheating, resulting in inflation.
That's not what's happening. Rather, global central banks are keeping their feet on the economic accelerator, and that is not resulting in any overheating at all.
The distinction is important if there is to be any hope of solving the low-growth problem. If the issue is a shortage of demand, then some more stimulus should help. If it is entirely on the supply side, then government stimulus is not much use, and policy makers should focus on trying to make companies more innovative and coax people back into the work force.
But what if it's both?
Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and a former top official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, watched as growth stayed low and inflation invisible after the 2008 crisis, despite extraordinary stimulus from central banks. Even before the crisis, economic growth had been relatively tepid despite a housing bubble, war spending and low interest rates.
In November 2013, he combined those observations into a much-discussed speech at an I.M.F. conference arguing that the global economy had, just maybe, settled into a state of "secular stagnation" in which there was insufficient demand, and resulting slow growth, low inflation and low interest rates.
While the theory is anything but settled, the case has become stronger in the last three years.
But it may not be as simple as supply versus demand. Perhaps people have dropped out of the labor force because their skills and connections have atrophied. Perhaps the productivity slump is caused in part by businesses not making capital investments because they don't think there will be demand for their products.
Mr. Summers, in an interview, frames it as an inversion of "Say's Law," the notion that supply creates its own demand: that economywide, people doing the work to create goods and services results in their having the income to then buy those goods and services.
In this case, rather, as he has often put it: "Lack of demand creates lack of supply."
His proposed solution is that the government sharply expand investment in infrastructure, which might provide a jolt of higher demand, which in turn could help the picture on supply -- helping workers who build roads and bridges become reattached to the work force, for example. As it happens, increasing infrastructure spending is among the few economic policies advocated by both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump.
Economic history is full of unpredictable fits and starts. When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, the internet, a defining feature of his presidency, was rarely mentioned, and Japan seemed to be emerging as the pre-eminent economic rival of the United States.
In other words, there's a lot we don't know about the economic future. What we do know is that if something doesn't change from the recent trend, the 21st century will be a gloomy one.

Abstract: Political science research particularly points to changes in income as being predictors of how people vote, and the July data on average hourly earnings suggest American workers are being paid more: a 2.6 percent gain over the last year, tied for the highest since 2009 and a comfortable gain in workers' purchasing power in an era of roughly 1 percent annual inflation.

Full text:   There's not much to say about the July jobs numbers beyond this: They're good news across the board.
More Americans are working, and they're getting paid more money for their efforts. People who weren't even looking for jobs now are, and they're finding them. A blockbuster job growth number for June wasn't downgraded with further analysis, but rather revised higher.
It's an election year, which means these numbers will inevitably be viewed through the prism of how they affect the chances of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump to seize the White House. And to the degree a good economy (and good economic headlines) benefits the incumbent party, there's no question this helps Mrs. Clinton.
Political science research particularly points to changes in income as being predictors of how people vote, and the July data on average hourly earnings suggest American workers are being paid more: a 2.6 percent gain over the last year, tied for the highest since 2009 and a comfortable gain in workers' purchasing power in an era of roughly 1 percent annual inflation.
So far in the campaign, Mrs. Clinton has resisted crowing about the strengths of the late-Obama-era economy and instead has emphasized her plans to try to strengthen the areas where conditions remain weak. The unemployment rate among adults over age 25 without a high school diploma was 6.3 percent in July, for example, far above the 2.5 percent for those with at least a bachelor's degree.
And while the proportion of Americans who were in the labor force -- either working or looking for work -- ticked up in July, it has recovered only a tiny sliver of its decline since the 2008 recession (it was 66 percent in December 2007, bottomed out last year at 62.4 percent, and has recovered slightly to 62.8 percent).
Part of this drop is because baby boomers are hitting retirement age, but some large portion is less well understood, driven by both men and women of prime working age who tell survey-takers they're not even looking for jobs.
If you try to search the latest Labor Department numbers for bad news, the closest you'll find is a rise in the number of people who have been unemployed for 27 weeks -- in other words, people who may say they want work but are becoming increasingly unattached from the habits of holding down a job.
So that creates a fascinating backdrop for the economic discussion during the homestretch of the election. The economy truly is growing, and job growth looks to be robust. Expect President Obama and his administration to celebrate (and seek credit for) the good numbers.
Expect Mrs. Clinton to seek to show empathy for those who are being left behind even by this stronger recovery and to avoid claims that the economy is as robust as the headline numbers might suggest. And don't be surprised if Mr. Trump repeats his claims that the economy is actually very weak. (He would have been on sounder footing using the poor second-quarter G.D.P. report late last week to make that argument, but he was distracted by other battles.)
Here's an interpretation of the available data over the last several months that incorporates all these realities. You probably won't hear it on the campaign trail, but if a candidate's job was to provide nuance rather than get elected, this is what could be said:
The United States economy is creating jobs at a rapid pace; most people who say they want a job are able to find one, and employers are having a hard enough time finding workers that they're having to pay higher wages. But large segments of the population, especially those without advanced education, left the labor force during the last several years, and relatively few of them are being pulled back in by this improving job market. Fixing that will be an important goal of the next president. Meanwhile, for reasons that aren't fully understood, economic output is growing much slower than job creation, which will mean lower living standards in the future if that continues. That should be another big worry for whoever occupies the Oval Office in January.
Not the stuff of boisterous campaign rallies, but that's what the facts are telling us.

Full text:   The American jobs machine has moved back into high gear.
After a long stretch of conflicting reports, the Labor Department said on Friday that the economy in July delivered a second consecutive month of robust hiring and rising wages in a signal that the expansion is strengthening, not ebbing, as it enters its eighth year.
Stocks surged, experts expressed more confidence that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates before the end of the year, and it was clear that long-stagnant wages for ordinary workers were advancing at a healthier pace.
"This was everything you could have asked for, maybe more," said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "We're seeing new entrants into the labor market, which implies a longer runway for the business cycle."
With the political conventions completed, the buoyant jobs numbers also have major implications for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.
Not only does the new data undercut Republican arguments that the recovery is faltering, it also suggests that after years of paltry gains, deeply frustrated workers are finally seeing some benefits from the drop in unemployment, which was unchanged last month at a relatively low 4.9 percent.
Wages are up 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, a faster pace than earlier in the recovery, and many economists expect that the gain in incomes, adjusted for inflation, will accelerate later this year and into 2017.
"The idea that Republicans are touting, that the job market is a wreck, is clearly belied by the data," said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served in the Obama administration. "What matters most to people isn't G.D.P. growth, it's jobs and wages."
Longtime G.O.P. economic hands like Wayne Berman, a veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns, conceded Friday's data was favorable for Democrats, but insisted it represented a snapshot of the economy, not necessarily the underlying trends. A major failing in the recovery, Republicans note, is that millions of Americans who dropped out of the work force during the recession have still not found jobs.
July's jobs number "is a good statistic for Clinton to pivot towards," said Mr. Berman, who currently serves as a top official at the Blackstone Group and advised Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republican primary. He noted, however, that the economy grew at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of 2016, a sharp decrease from last year.
"We're in a very mixed economic picture now," said Mr. Berman, recalling the presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole two decades ago, when attacks on Bill Clinton's economic record failed to resonate at a time of rising prosperity. "You can't say this is like 1996, when there was no oxygen for Bob Dole's arguments."
The July increase in payrolls stands in sharp contrast to data released just last week showing disappointing economic growth in April, May and June.
A reason for the difference is that parts of the economy are still suffering from the continuing fallout from low oil prices as energy companies cut back on investment. Government spending also has been weak and many companies, at least for now, prefer to hire more workers rather than invest in new equipment and increase their efficiency and output.
If business and government investment continue to lag, that could undermine the long-term ability of the American economy to be more productive and raise living standards for most workers.
In late spring, the government reported that job creation in May was much weaker than economists had expected; a big rebound in June similarly caught the experts off guard. The July data helps clear up some of the confusion.
"This is a validator," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. "This is a report that indicates that the slowdown in hiring earlier in the year has been reversed."
June's gain was revised upward by 5,000 jobs, and May's by 13,000. The combination of better gains in the spring and July's increase in hiring means that the Federal Reserve is likely to have a more vigorous debate about raising interest rates when it meets in September. But most experts think the Fed will wait until December to be sure the economy remains on a solid track.
The Fed said in July, after the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee, that the economy was growing more strongly and there were fewer clouds on the horizon, suggesting it was giving greater consideration to rate increases later this year.
But on the policy-making front, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an influential adviser to Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said on Sunday that current economic conditions still called for "caution in raising U.S. short-term interest rates."
Job openings are spreading. "It's been a really good summer for hiring all across the country," said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a recruiting and staffing firm based in Chicago. "Business has been great. Kids coming out of college are getting hired, and we're seeing a lot of activity in the $50,000 to $150,000 category."
The upswing in jobs last month also coincided with a sharp drop in unemployment among the least-educated workers, a group that has missed out on nearly all the gains of the current recovery thus far.
Other measures of the labor market suggest that underlying joblessness is higher than the official 4.9 percent rate, although nowhere near the 42 percent level Mr. Trump suggested last fall.
The broadest measure of unemployment calculated by the Labor Department, which includes workers who want full-time positions but cannot find them, stood at 9.7 percent in July.
To arrive at his figure, Mr. Trump apparently compared the total civilian population aged 16 and up -- about 253.6 million people -- with the 102 million Americans who are not in the labor force, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
But in addition to the 7.7 million currently counted as unemployed, that larger figure includes more than 50 million Americans above the age of 55 who say they don't want to work and are, for the most part, retired. It also takes into account 13.5 million Americans age 16 to 24, most of them in school, and millions of women who have chosen to stay home to care for their young children. None of those people are considered unemployed by the Labor Department.
The payroll figures, which reflect hiring at companies and in the public sector, revealed broad-based job gains, not just in lower-paid sectors like retail and leisure and hospitality, but in high-paying fields like professional and business services as well.
The household survey, which has offered a mixed picture in the past, was also robust.
The jobless rate for high school dropouts, which has been elevated throughout the recovery, fell more than a full percentage point to 6.3 percent, suggesting that employers who had previously ignored these lower-skilled workers are now taking a second look.
As the unemployment rate has fallen, some employers have raised salaries to retain their best workers and attract new ones. Increases in the minimum wage in many states recently, and increases in the lowest-tier salaries by big employers like Walmart, Target and Aetna, are also beginning to ripple through the broader work force.
But a two-tier job market remains in place, with workers in the same region facing radically different conditions depending on their level of education and skills.
In San Francisco, even the most junior software engineers hired at Sunverge, a maker of energy storage systems for solar electricity users, command starting salaries of just over $100,000.
A little more than 60 miles to the east, at Sunverge's assembly plant in Stockton, Calif., where the unemployment rate is 9 percent, new blue-collar workers can expect to earn about $14 an hour, or $29,000 a year.
Sunverge is bulking up in both cities. But hiring technical talent is much more time-consuming, said Stu Statman, Sunverge's chief of engineering.
"It doesn't seem like it's that hard to find good factory workers in Stockton," Mr. Statman said. "In San Francisco, if you're talking about software engineers or developers, it's very hard. It takes a long time, and there's a huge amount of hunger out there for people with these skills."

Abstract: According to the Institute of International Finance, a bank lobby that tracks global capital flows, about $25 billion poured into emerging markets last month.

Full text:   On the face of it, this might not seem the right time to be investing in Turkey.
Terrorists attacked the main airport in Istanbul, a foiled coup raised questions about political stability, and the country's debt is being downgraded by rating agencies -- all of this happening within a span of two weeks.
So what were the best-performing investments in the global economy last week?
You guessed it: Turkish stocks and bonds -- up 6.6 and 3.8 percent in dollar terms, according to Merrill Lynch.
Emerging markets are known for their wild, discordant swings, but this mini-rally in Turkey, brief as it may be, highlights just how much risk yield-starved investors are willing to take on when $11 trillion worth of bonds of governments around the world are offering up negative returns.
That is why a Turkish 10-year bond that offers a 9 percent reward can be tempting, even if that country's inflation rate is 8.7 percent and rising and its currency is heading south.
Stocks and bonds in developing markets have been on a tear since early last year, with once-scorned countries like Brazil (stock market up 54 percent in dollar terms for the year) and South Africa (up 24 percent during the same period) leading the way.
The surge has been driven in part by a shift in mood by investors choosing to scoop up beaten-down assets in these countries. Emerging-market stocks as a whole are trading at steep discounts to their counterparts in the United States and Europe.
A partial recovery in oil prices, political calm in Brazil and a growing sense that Chinese authorities will not allow the renminbi to collapse have also had their effect.
At the root of this sudden rush of money into high-risk assets is the pressure that many institutions, from large pension funds and insurance companies to some hedge funds, are facing to find returns in a world of zero to negative interest rates.
These pressures have increased since the market shock of the British vote to leave Europe. Bonds yields have continued to shrink and stock markets have hit record highs, giving investors further pause about their overweight positions in developed market stocks and bonds.
"In places like Europe, the U.K. and the U.S., you have lots of risks but no reward," said Gavin Serkin, an emerging-markets expert at Frontier Funds, a consulting firm based in London. "In the developing world, you have risks, but at least you are getting paid for it."
And that even includes Mongolia, where a new government and a view that commodity markets have bottomed have prompted a stampede into Mongolian government bonds.
These bonds -- issued in the middle of a slump in raw materials -- were not that long ago held out as an emblem of emerging-market excess. Their prices have since surged, halving their yields to 8 percent from 16 percent in March.
Other unlikely markets that are now in demand include Russia, where stocks year to date are up over 20 percent in dollar terms. A big factor driving these rallies, traders say, is the sense the currencies of these countries that have suffered from a strong dollar in recent years are now in recovery mode.
And while there is still potential for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, there is less fear than there was a year ago that rates will push persistently upward and lure money out of emerging economies.
Investors are also finding bargains among established companies in emerging markets that have improved their profitability in recent years but still trade at 30 percent discounts to their developed-market peers.
"We are seeing a real shift in sentiment," said Nick Robinson, a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Investment Management which oversees $420 billion, a large chunk of which is in developing markets. "And you really don't have to look too hard to find good stories with cheap valuations."
According to the Institute of International Finance, a bank lobby that tracks global capital flows, about $25 billion poured into emerging markets last month. Asia and Latin America absorbed most of these funds.
Combined with the $13 billion that swept into these markets in June, the last two months reflect a sharp shift in sentiment after one of the worst periods ever for emerging-market capital flows.
According to the institute's calculations, $81 billion exited these markets in the months after the Chinese devaluation scare last August -- an amount that approached that $96 billion that fled during the financial crisis.
Economists at Institute of International Finance say that the flows surged in the weeks after Britain's surprise vote to leave the European Union when investors doubled down on their safe-haven bets by buying Japanese, European and United States government bonds.
As the yields on these securities vanished late last month, government bonds in Brazil, South Africa and Turkey that yielded around 10 percent began to look attractive.
That was especially so when compared with Italy, where comparable securities offered a 1 percent return even with concerns mounting that the country's banking crisis might force it to leave the euro.
Or Japan, where investors in July took the extraordinary step of paying to borrow money for 20 years from a government with the highest debt burden among developed nations.
Such minuscule returns are the result of an unprecedented era of monetary policy activism. The world's central banks have bought up 15 percent of global corporate and sovereign bonds in an effort to stimulate economic recovery.
But, as Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore in London, which oversees $51 billion in emerging market assets, points out, these securities do not hail from emerging markets.
And that is why, he says, there is such a contrast between bond yields in the developed as opposed to the developing world as investors worldwide have, for the most part, ignored emerging markets in favor of following in the path of central banks.
"The Q.E. trade is over," said Mr. Dehn, referring to the central bank policy of quantitative easing. "And people are now looking to the non-Q.E. world, where the bonds in countries representing 58 percent of G.D.P. had an average yield of 5.6 percent -- which is higher than when the Fed had rates at 5 percent before the crisis. That is pretty extraordinary."

Full text:   Here's a look at what's coming up this week:
TECHNOLOGY
A troubled drug company's effort to restore credibility.
Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and chief executive of the beleaguered blood-testing company Theranos, is scheduled to speak Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry in Philadelphia. In an effort to restore Theranos's credibility -- and her own -- Ms. Holmes is expected to present what will essentially be the first data shared by the secretive company about its technology, which is said to require only a finger prick of blood to perform multiple medical tests. Ms. Holmes will then answer questions from what is sure to be a skeptical audience of medical laboratory experts. The company has been criticized for not publishing data in peer-reviewed medical journals, but that is the least of its problems. Government regulators, citing numerous deficiencies in testing procedures, have barred Ms. Holmes, a 32-year-old Stanford dropout, from owning or operating a clinical laboratory for two years. And Walgreens has closed the Theranos testing centers in its drugstores. Andrew Pollack
ECONOMY
Economists expect softening of manufacturing index.
On Monday morning, the Institute for Supply Management will release figures for the I.S.M. manufacturing index for July. Economists are looking for a slight softening in the index, as manufacturers continue to grapple with pressure from a strong dollar and weak demand from the energy industry. Still, the index is expected to remain above the crucial 50 threshold, which indicates that the factory sector is continuing to expand rather than contract, in a sign the economy is not about to slip into recession. Nelson D. Schwartz
AUTO INDUSTRY
Flat July sales in auto sector are expected.
Investors will be looking for signs of stagnation in the American auto market on Tuesday, when carmakers report their July sales of new vehicles. Analysts are projecting flat sales compared with the same month in 2015, when the industry set a new annual sales record of 17.4 million vehicles. But some auto executives have recently sounded a note of caution about the market in the United States, predicting that costly discounts on many models will be needed to maintain last year's torrid pace of sales. Bill Vlasic
BANKING
More major European banks to report earnings.
It will be another busy week for earnings reports as several of Europe's biggest banks share their second-quarter results, among them HSBC, Standard Chartered and the Royal Bank of Scotland, along with the French lenders Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and UniCredit. Results at European banks have not been as dire as some had feared in the quarter, particularly as uncertainty in the financial markets weighed on trading revenue. Credit Suisse and UBS, for instance, both beat analyst expectations, and Deutsche Bank essentially broke even. The British bank Barclays had a solid quarter in its core businesses, but its profit declined 41 percent as it accelerated plans to sell or close businesses and assets that it no longer considered central to its strategy. And Lloyds Banking Group, a British rival, said it would cut an additional 3,000 jobs and close more branches as it warned about a likely "deceleration" in economic growth after Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union. Chad Bray
AUTO INDUSTRY
A quarterly report for Tesla at a turbulent time.
Tesla Motors will report its earnings for the second quarter on Wednesday, and the bottom line numbers could hardly come at a time of more scrutiny for the maker of high-priced electric cars. Tesla is facing investigations of its self-driving Autopilot technology, which was a factor in a fatal crash on May 7. The company has also announced that it plans to acquire Solar City, whose biggest shareholder is Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive. Tesla has also recently opened the so-called Gigafactory, the gigantic battery factory it built in Nevada. The automaker is expected to report a loss for the second quarter, as it has for the last several quarters, because of the heavy spending on the Gigafactory, the introduction of its Model X sport utility vehicle and the development of a more affordable Model 3 compact. Neal Boudette
ECONOMY
Bank of England's latest predictions on inflation.
The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday after signaling that economic pressures from Britain's vote to leave the European Union could necessitate an easing of rates. The Monetary Policy Committee has left its benchmark rate steady at 0.5 percent since March 2009, but the central bank said in July that "uncertainty flowing from the referendum result was likely to depress economic activity in the near term." Also on Thursday, the bank is also expected to release its latest predictions on inflation, to be followed by a news conference by its governor, Mark Carney. Inflation is an important metric for its monetary policy decisions. Chad Bray
Labor Department to release July's jobs report.
On Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release data on the job market in July. Economists and investors will be paying close attention to this report, after the up-and-down results in recent months. Employers cut way back on hiring in May, only to follow with a burst of job creation in June.
The consensus for July calls for a gain of 180,000 jobs as well as a slight decline in the unemployment rate to 4.8 percent. But another surprise could be in the offing. If the final figure is significantly better than expected, as was the case in June, it will increase the odds of an interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve in September. Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text:   Donald Trump said some more disgusting things over the weekend. If this surprises you, you haven't been paying attention. Also, don't be surprised if a majority of Republicans approve of his attack on the parents of a dead war hero. After all, a YouGov survey found that 61 percent of Republicans support his call for Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton.
But this isn't a column about Mr. Trump and the people who are O.K. with anything he says or does. It is, instead, about Republicans -- probably a minority within the party, but a substantial one -- who aren't like that. These are people who aren't racists, respect patriots even if they're Muslim, believe that America should honor its international commitments, and in general sound like normal members of a normal political party.
Yet the great majority of these not-crazy Republicans are still supporting Mr. Trump for president. And we have a right to ask why.
True, a Clinton victory would mean a continuation of the center-left governance we've had under Barack Obama, which would be a big disappointment for those who want a turn to the right. And many people have convinced themselves that ideology aside, Mrs. Clinton would be a bad president. Obviously I disagree on the ideology, and while we won't know about a Clinton presidency until or unless it happens, I find much to admire in the real Hillary, who is nothing like the caricature. But never mind: even if you're a conservative who really dislikes the Democratic candidate, how can you justify choosing Donald Trump?
Put it this way: Is there any reason to believe that a Clinton victory would lead to irretrievable disaster? Because that's the question you should be asking yourself.
Start with the least important issue (even if it is my specialty), economics. If you're a Republican, you presumably believe that center-left policies -- higher taxes on top incomes, a big subsidized expansion of health insurance, tighter financial regulation -- are bad for the economy. But even if you think the Obama economy should have been better, the fact is that we've added 11 million private-sector jobs; stocks are way up; inflation and interest rates have stayed low; the budget deficit has withered away.
So it's not a disaster, and there's no reason to believe that a Clinton economy would be a disaster either. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is talking about wildly irresponsible tax cuts, renegotiating debt, and ripping up trade agreements.
Moving up the scale of importance, what about national security? Even if you think that President Obama could have gotten better results by bombing more and talking less, there's just no way to paint Mrs. Clinton -- who has the support of many retired military leaders -- as some kind of pushover for terrorists and foreign aggressors. Meanwhile, her opponent talks about abandoning NATO allies if they don't pay up and seems fine with Russian adventurism in Ukraine.
Most important of all is the question of democracy at home.
I know, conservatives like to complain that Mr. Obama has overstepped his authority by, say, using administrative discretion to delay some provisions of the Affordable Care Act. But let's be serious: no non-crazy person, even on the right, thinks that this president is acting like a dictator, or that the woman he wants to succeed him would threaten basic liberty. On the other side, anyone watching her opponent has to be very, very worried about his authoritarian streak.
The bottom line is that even if you don't like Mrs. Clinton or what she stands for, it's hard to see how you could view her possible victory with horror. And it's hard to see how you could view Mr. Trump's possible victory any other way.
How, then, can rational Republicans justify supporting Mr. Trump, or even remaining neutral, which is in effect giving him half a vote?
For rank-and-file Republicans, it's presumably about feelings. Having spent so many years denouncing Democrats in general and Mrs. Clinton in particular, they have a hard time admitting that someone else could be much, much worse. But democracy isn't about making a statement, it's about exercising responsibility. And indulging your feelings at a time like this amounts to dereliction of your duty as a citizen.
And whatever one may say about ordinary voters, the real sinners here are Republican leaders -- people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell -- who are actively supporting a candidate whom they know poses a danger to the nation.
It's not hard to see why they're doing this. Opposing their party's nominee, no matter how awful he is, would probably end up being a career killer.
But there are times when you're supposed to put such considerations aside. The willingness of some people who know better to support Donald Trump is understandable; it's also despicable.

Full text:   The American stock market has reached new highs this summer for some unsettling reasons.
Since the sharp decline set off in late June by the British vote to leave the European Union, stocks have recovered smartly, reverting to an upward trend that has prevailed since 2009. That wasn't unexpected: Relief rallies often have occurred after market shocks.
This time, though, many of the factors that typically propel a rising market are absent: Corporate earnings aren't strong, the economy isn't booming, and stock prices aren't cheap.
None of those fundamental indicators have been auspicious, but it hasn't mattered because the fuel that is making the stock market soar seems to be coming from outside the stock market entirely.
In fact, it appears that we need to thank the bond and foreign exchange markets for providing the underpinnings for the stock rally.
Bonds have risen sharply in value, and their yields, which move in the opposite direction, have plummeted. That has made stock prices look cheap and dividends generous. The average dividend for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is about 2.1 percent -- much higher than the yield on a 10-year Treasury note. Many investors have moved to stocks in search of a better deal.
That has helped make stocks rise, even though stock valuations aren't particularly appealing after seven years of price increases.
"On a historical basis, the overall stock market has become expensive, but not relative to bonds," said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin-Sheff in Toronto. "People have been looking in the stock market for yield, in the form of dividends, because the bond market has become so expensive and bond yields have gotten so low."
That's part of the story. But there's more. Not all parts of the stock market are being affected in the same way. Another factor, the strong dollar, has made stock sectors that are fairly impervious to exchange-rate shifts especially attractive. When foreign earnings in, say, euros or pounds translate into fewer dollars, American stocks with predominantly domestic revenue streams usually benefit.
That's why many American utility and phone company stocks -- which both pay high dividends -- have been soaring.
"These stocks have hit a sweet spot," said Craig Moffett, a senior analyst at MoffettNathanson, who focuses on telecom companies, including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. As a group, telecom companies have far outpaced the market as a whole, even though Mr. Moffett is skeptical about the prospects for the sector's stocks. Many of them are overvalued, he says.
"As an analyst, it's frustrating," he said. "It doesn't seem to matter what the specific issues are for these companies as businesses. Their stocks at the moment are trading for other reasons: interest rates and the dollar." He has found a strong correlation between these factors and telecom stocks.
"At the moment," he said, "interest rates and exchange rates outweigh the stock fundamentals."
Stock investors, therefore, may want to seek guidance from these markets, especially the bond market, which has moved into historically unusual territory.
The 10-year Treasury note, for example, has had an average yield of more than 6 percent since 1965 but has fallen to less than 1.5 percent today, and that counts as a solid yield in the current global market. More than $13 trillion in government bonds around the world carry negative yields, a concept that is difficult to grasp. Buy a bond and you will lose money -- unless yields drop even further into the negative zone, driving up bond prices.
Negative yields attest to severe global economic weakness. Central banks have held interest rates low to try to stimulate the economy, and with inflation at very low levels, bond investors have accepted minuscule or negative yields. Still, among the world's major economies, the United States is perhaps the strongest now, and the Federal Reserve signaled on Wednesday that it remained open to a rate increase this year.
Market prices suggest that a rate increase won't occur before December, especially with a presidential election looming in November. But other central banks have been moving toward even more expansive monetary policies, adding luster to the dollar and hurting returns of American companies with major overseas revenue streams.
Given those realities, investors hungry for better returns and higher yields have been flocking to the American stock market, especially to high-dividend-paying, low-foreign-revenue utility and telecom stocks. Both sectors have risen more than 20 percent this year.
The current interest rate and exchange rate alignment may well persist for a good while, but there are no guarantees. A recession, a surge in inflation, an unexpected rise in interest rates or a major political shock or natural disaster could wreak immediate damage. And interest rates and inflation have rarely remained at today's low levels for very long.
Mr. Rosenberg therefore suggests that investors begin to hedge against these risks by diversifying with inflation-indexed bonds, gold and some reasonably priced stocks in sectors like railroads, automobiles, banking and construction.
Mr. Moffett is certain that at some point, the usefulness of his kind of detailed stock analysis will be restored.
"Many of the valuations in the market don't make sense right now in isolation," he said. "The risk for investors is that if interest rates start to rise, stock prices could start to shift almost overnight. That may not happen soon, but eventually it will happen. And for a lot of people, that won't be a very pleasant moment."

Full text:   The economic recovery may be durable, but it is anything but dynamic.
Weighed down by anemic business spending, overstocked factories and warehouses, and a surprisingly weak housing sector, the American economy barely improved this spring after its usual winter doldrums.
Consumer spending advanced at a robust pace, helping to sustain a modest growth rate of 1.2 percent, but the gain was overshadowed by the poor showing in other sectors of the economy. The April-June quarter was the third consecutive period in which the economy advanced at less than a 2 percent annual rate, the weakest stretch in four years.
The new economic data underscores the continuing frustration about the current growth cycle, which has now gone on for seven years -- longer than most economic upswings -- but which has repeatedly failed to break out into a higher orbit.
And with the political conventions now over, and the brawl between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump for the White House in full swing, Friday's data at least partly undercuts the Democrats' argument that the nation's economic health is improving.
"This definitely feeds into an existing Republican narrative that the economy is growing too slowly and dials it up a notch," said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who served in the Obama administration.
The economic debate may intensify ahead of the election in November, particularly because the recovery's gains have been less robust in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. States firmly in the Democratic or Republican column -- California and Texas, for example -- are generally doing much better.
On Friday, Republican leaders were quick to cite the new data on the nation's gross domestic product to reinforce their argument that President Obama's policies have failed to turn things around.
"After eight years of higher taxes, endless regulations and skyrocketing health care costs, the chickens are apparently coming home to roost," said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas.
But there are other signs that the economy is on the mend, even for ordinary Americans who had, until recently, barely benefited from the rebound. The unemployment rate, which reached 10 percent after the recession, has fallen back to around 5 percent, while hiring and pay gains have been healthier lately. Those factors may ultimately contribute more to perceptions of vitality than abstract statistics on the nation's economic output.
"What really matters to people is jobs and income, and that's most recently been a positive story," added Mr. Bernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Based on more complete information about recent years, the government revised last year's growth rate up slightly to 2.6 percent -- the best so far since the severe downturn ended in mid-2009. But that is still below the gains the American economy recorded in the mid-2000s, let alone in the booming late 1990s.
Over all, the economy's 1.2 percent advance in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday, was just slightly better than the 0.8 percent pace recorded in the first quarter.
Besides the decrease in inventory accumulation and business investment, weaker government outlays also held back growth, reinforcing a trend that has hobbled the recovery in recent years.
The abrupt falloff in homebuilding caught analysts off guard, but it came after a series of double-digit gains in late 2014 and 2015. And with mortgage rates very low and home prices still rising in many parts of the country, the residential real estate sector is expected to contribute to growth again in the coming quarters.
Household spending was the economy's bright spot, rising at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent.
"The consumer is doing all the heavy lifting," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. "Aside from technology and software, business spending was bad and housing was also surprisingly weak, which is payback for gains in recent quarters."
On the positive side, the overstock at stores and warehouses is starting to dissipate. That could help growth in the second half of the year, Mr. Behravesh said.
After a long period in which trade has weighed on the economy, the balance between exports and imports may finally be improving. The net trade picture actually lifted growth by nearly a quarter of a percentage point last quarter, the first significant improvement from trade since mid-2014.
In addition, Mr. Behravesh said, wages are finally beginning to inch higher for many workers after years of stagnation. Gas prices also remain low.
While grappling with weaker demand from customers in Asia and Europe, many factories and mills in the nation's midsection have been hit by the drop in energy prices as new drilling for oil and natural gas has collapsed.
Regional disparities have contributed to differing perceptions of the economy. Workers in the West are finding themselves priced out of neighborhoods in booming San Francisco and Seattle, while families in less prosperous parts of the country say they feel as if the recession never really ended.
Domestically focused service industries like software, health care and financial services are doing well, lifting incomes among white-collar workers. A strong real estate market in many parts of the country and the run-up on Wall Street are also encouraging more affluent consumers to open their wallets.
This week, the Federal Reserve noted improving economic conditions in the United States after a two-day meeting of policy makers, even as the central bank held off on increasing in interest rates.
A top Fed official downplayed the latest report.
John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said the second-quarter gross domestic product reading was weak largely because of inventories and government spending, noting that underlying data that discount for swings in stock building "look good."
Speaking to reporters after a speech in Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Williams, an influential centrist at the central bank, noted the two key employment and inflation reports before the next meeting in mid-September. "It makes sense, assuming the data continue to support that, to raise rates again this year," he said.
Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said the disappointing gross domestic product report makes a move by the Fed in September a bit less likely, but it could still be on track if the government issues strong jobs reports for July and August. July's data will be released by the Labor Department next Friday.
"The domestic side of the economy looks O.K. Not stellar, not fantastic, but enough to keep us on a modest growth path," Mr. Gapen said. "And if it's all about personal consumption, then the labor market is your best forward-looking indicator."

Abstract: Japan's central bank ended a policy meeting on Friday by announcing it would expand purchases of exchange-traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world's third-largest economy and pursue its inflation target of 2 percent.

Full text:   Stocks on Wall Street ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google's parent company, Alphabet, and the retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.
However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news from the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,432.24. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.
The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, because of the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron's results still beat analysts' expectations.
Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.
Wall Street is finishing its busiest week of corporate earnings, which was dominated by mostly strong results from technology companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and others.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped $25.50, or 3.3 percent, to $791.34. The company reported earnings of $8.42 a share, well above the $8.04 that analysts were looking for.
Amazon rose $6.20, or 1 percent, to $758.81. The online retail giant reported a profit of $1.78 per share, well above the $1.11 a share that analysts expected. Amazon reported it sold $30.4 billion in goods in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The strong results from Amazon and Google, as well as the results from other tech companies, helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq 1.2 percent this week, while the Dow lost 0.8 percent. The S.&P. 500 closed the week down slightly. It was the first weekly loss for the S.&P. 500 after four weeks of gains.
The presidential election will continue to grow as an issue for markets in the next several months. Investors tend to dislike uncertainty, and the unexpectedly close presidential election and mostly unknown policies of the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, puts many of them on edge.
Japan's central bank ended a policy meeting on Friday by announcing it would expand purchases of exchange-traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world's third-largest economy and pursue its inflation target of 2 percent. But the measures fell short of hopes for more aggressive action. That helped the yen surge as investors priced in fewer yen in circulation. The dollar dropped to 102.02 yen from 105.34 yen.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark United States 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.45 percent from 1.51 percent the day before.
In energy trading, benchmark crude reversed earlier losses and was up 46 cents to settle at $41.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 24 cents, to $42.46 a barrel in London.
Heating oil rose less than 1 cent, to $1.28 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent, to $1.32 a gallon, and natural gas was little changed at $2.86 per thousand cubic feet.
In other currencies, the euro rose to $1.1175 from $1.1074 the day before, and the British pound rose to $1.3231 from $1.3158.
The price of gold closed up $16.70, to settle at $1,349 an ounce. Silver rose 15 cents, to $20.07 an ounce and copper rose a penny, to $2.222 a pound.

Full text:   It was started in the name of forging a greater sense of union among the disparate nations of Europe. It was supposed to enhance commercial ties, erode borders and foster a spirit of collective interest, furthering the evolution of former wartime combatants into fellow nations of a united Europe.
But the euro, in the 17 years since the common currency came into existence, has instead reinvigorated conflicts, yielding new crises, fresh grievances and a spirit of distrust. So argues the Nobel laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz in a timely new book, "The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe."
Italy's banks teeter on the brink of crisis while the euro has become the subject of ceaseless bickering over economic policy. By Mr. Stiglitz's reckoning, the common currency has made economic inequality worse while dividing Europe into two adversarial camps -- debtor and creditor.
In his first interview about the book, Mr. Stiglitz described the euro as a tragic mistake, a currency begun without the necessary political integration or clear thinking about its fundamental flaws. The euro was compromised from inception by an ill-conceived structure, and its troubles have been amplified by wrongheaded economic policies imposed by the most powerful countries as conditions for bailing out those worst ensnared by crisis.
What follows is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.
It is difficult to overstate the economic trauma Europe has suffered in recent years -- veritable depressions in Greece and Spain, alarming levels of unemployment across much of the continent. You place much of the blame on the euro. What happened?
The euro was an attempt to advance the economic integration of Europe by having the countries of the eurozone share a common currency. They looked across the Atlantic and they said: "The United States, big economy, very successful, single currency. We should imitate."
But they didn't have the political integration. They didn't have the conditions that would make a single currency work. The creation of the euro is the single most important explanation for the extraordinarily poor performance of the eurozone economies since the crisis of 2008.
Were there warnings when the euro was begun that maybe it wasn't such a wonderful idea?
Yes, but it was mostly Americans, and that may have colored the reaction to it: "Oh, you don't understand the value of the European project." But the criticism was not that we don't agree with the European project, but that you were undertaking something that will undermine the European project, because it's not going to work. Their answer was, "We will create institutions as we go along." A lot of people pushing for this were not economists.
You blame the euro for widening economic inequality. How has this played out?
The idea was that for the euro to work, the countries had to converge, and they formulated these ideas called the convergence criteria. They put enormous pressure on the countries to keep their deficits and debts relative to G.D.P. down. That was viewed as the necessary and almost sufficient conditions for making the euro work.
Several of the countries that went into crisis, Spain and Ireland among them, actually had a surplus before the crisis, and a very low debt-to-G.D.P. ratio. But they still had a crisis. That tells us an important lesson: What the people who were behind the creation of the euro thought was going to be a critical condition was not.
The disappointing thing was that after the crisis, they didn't learn a lesson. What they did was double down on that same recipe -- austerity. The structure of the euro was at fault, and the policies they enacted amplified the structural deficiencies. The result was that the countries diverged.
In your telling, Germany has imposed austerity across Europe out of faith in a discredited economic idea, the notion that if policy makers concentrate solely on preventing budget deficits and inflation, the markets can be counted on to deliver prosperity. A lot of your book is devoted to demolishing this idea. Does the German elite still really believe in this philosophy, or is something else at play?
I've visited Germany often, and I'm shocked about how strong the belief is in this view that has been totally discredited elsewhere.
But the policies are mixed together with interests. When the Greek crisis broke out in 2010, what was really at risk were German and to some extent French banks. And there was an enormous bailout that was called a bailout of Greece but was really a bailout of German and French banks. Most of the money went to Greece and then right away went back to Germany and France.
When you look at other aspects of the program, you see that it is also helping special interests within Europe.
How so?
Let me give you an example of one of the really absurd things they did. They demanded that Greece scrap a rule that fresh milk is no more than four days old. If milk was older than four days, it needed to be labeled.
Of all the things that were going on, why would you have a debate about that?
The German and the Dutch dairy industries wanted to ship their factory-farmed milk across Europe and sell it to Greek consumers. That would devastate the small Greek producers. Here was something that could only be seen as benefiting special interests in the eurozone and actually weakening the Greek economy.
You argue that some European leaders secretly welcomed mass unemployment as a means of adjusting to the crisis because this was the only way they could see to spur investment -- lowering wages. The strictures of the euro took other options off the table: Crisis countries could not let their currency fall or lower interest rates or expand government spending. Was unemployment really embraced as a fix?
They wanted to break the back of workers. Their view was that workers needed to accept a wage cut and we are going to change the bargaining rules to make it more difficult for them to resist. And if we need to add on a little dose of unemployment, well, that's unfortunate.
Doesn't that goal predate the crisis?
It's very clear that the euro was a neo-liberal project in its construction. Employers like low wages. They have broken the back of the unions in many of the countries of Europe. They would view that as a great achievement.
The whole point of the European project has been to get past the hostilities of World War II and build a sustainable community. Yet, in your telling, the euro and the policies delivered to preserve it left much of Europe nursing fresh grievances. How are these grievances coloring politics?
The most important divergence is between creditor, Germany, and debtor, the rest. The criticisms that you hear in Greece of the Germans, they are reliving the horrors of World War II; the criticism in Germany of the Greeks, saying that they are lazy even though the number of hours that they work per week is higher than the Germans'. The flinging of accusations, whether true or not, has been enormous and the divisiveness has been enormous.
We just saw Britain vote to exit the European Union -- in part, a reaction to the sense that the European Union is a place of weak economic growth and poor leadership. In Italy, the so-called Five Star political movement is gaining support with calls to abandon the euro -- in part, a backlash against German-led austerity. Is there any evidence that these sorts of events are leading to a re-examination of the economic philosophy guiding Europe?
I wish that were happening. Unfortunately, what I've seen is almost the reverse. It's doubling down on a failed experiment. It's a hard-line approach in which the European leaders in response to Brexit, people like Jean-Claude Juncker, who is the head of the European Commission, have said, "We're going to be very, very tough on the U.K. because we want to make sure that no other country leaves."
To me that was shocking. You hope that people want to stay in the E.U. because it's delivering benefits, because there's a belief in European solidarity, the belief that it's bringing prosperity. He's saying the only way we are going to keep the E.U. together is by the threat of what happens if you think about leaving.
You conclude that the best-case scenario from here is to reform and save the euro. But absent that, you contend that it is better to just scrap it as a failed experiment. What needs to happen to make the euro viable?
A banking union with deposit insurance. Something like a euro bond. An E.C.B. that doesn't just focus on inflation -- you want it to focus on employment. A tax policy that deals with the inequalities. And you have to get rid of limits on government deficits.
What's your sense of what will actually happen?
It is hard to believe that the muddling-through can continue for another five years. Greece is still in depression, no better than it was a year ago. The likelihood is there that in one country or another there will be enough support for another referendum, and an exit will occur. That will begin the process of a real unraveling of the eurozone.

Q. In your telling, Germany has imposed austerity across Europe out of faith in a discredited economic idea, the notion that if policy makers concentrate solely on preventing budget deficits and inflation, the markets can be counted on to deliver prosperity.

Full text:   It was started in the name of forging a greater sense of union among the disparate nations of Europe. It was supposed to enhance commercial ties, erode borders and foster a spirit of collective interest, furthering the evolution of former wartime combatants into fellow nations of a united Europe.
But the euro, in the 17 years since the common currency came into existence, has instead reinvigorated conflicts, yielding new crises, fresh grievances and a spirit of distrust. So argues the Nobel laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz in a timely new book, "The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe."
Italy's banks teeter on the brink of crisis while the euro has become the subject of ceaseless bickering over economic policy. By Mr. Stiglitz's reckoning, the common currency has made economic inequality worse while dividing Europe into two adversarial camps -- debtor and creditor.
In his first interview about the book, Mr. Stiglitz described the euro as a tragic mistake, a currency begun without the necessary political integration or clear thinking about its fundamental flaws. The euro was compromised from inception by an ill-conceived structure, and its troubles have been amplified by wrongheaded economic policies imposed by the most powerful countries as conditions for bailing out those worst ensnared by crisis.
What follows is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.
Q. It is difficult to overstate the economic trauma Europe has suffered in recent years -- veritable depressions in Greece and Spain, alarming levels of unemployment across much of the continent. You place much of the blame on the euro. What happened?
A. The euro was an attempt to advance the economic integration of Europe by having the countries of the eurozone share a common currency. They looked across the Atlantic and they said: "the United States, big economy, very successful, single currency. We should imitate."
But they didn't have the political integration. They didn't have the conditions that would make a single currency work. The creation of the euro is the single most important explanation for the extraordinarily poor performance of the eurozone economies since the crisis of 2008.
Q. Were there warnings when the euro was begun that maybe it wasn't such a wonderful idea?
A. Yes, but it was mostly Americans, and that may have colored the reaction to it: "Oh, you don't understand the value of the European project." But the criticism was not that we don't agree with the European project, but that you were undertaking something that will undermine the European project, because it's not going to work. Their answer was, "We will create institutions as we go along." A lot of people pushing for this were not economists.
Q. You blame the euro for widening economic inequality. How has this played out?
A. The idea was that for the euro to work, the countries had to converge, and they formulated these ideas called the convergence criteria. They put enormous pressure on the countries to keep their deficits and debts relative to G.D.P. down. That was viewed as the necessary and almost sufficient conditions for making the euro work.
Several of the countries that went into crisis, Spain and Ireland among them, actually had a surplus before the crisis, and a very low debt-to-G.D.P. ratio. But they still had a crisis. That tells us an important lesson: What the people who were behind the creation of the euro thought was going to be a critical condition was not.
The disappointing thing was that after the crisis, they didn't learn a lesson. What they did was double down on that same recipe -- austerity. The structure of the euro was at fault, and the policies they enacted amplified the structural deficiencies. The result was that the countries diverged.
Q. In your telling, Germany has imposed austerity across Europe out of faith in a discredited economic idea, the notion that if policy makers concentrate solely on preventing budget deficits and inflation, the markets can be counted on to deliver prosperity. A lot of your book is devoted to demolishing this idea. Does the German elite still really believe in this philosophy, or is something else at play?
A. I've visited Germany often, and I'm shocked about how strong the belief is in this view that has been totally discredited elsewhere.
But the policies are mixed together with interests. When the Greek crisis broke out in 2010, what was really at risk were German and to some extent French banks. And there was an enormous bailout that was called a bailout of Greece but was really a bailout of German and French banks. Most of the money went to Greece and then right away went back to Germany and France.
When you look at other aspects of the program, you see that it is also helping special interests within Europe.
Q. How so?
A. Let me give you an example of one of the really absurd things they did. They demanded that Greece scrap a rule that fresh milk is no more than four days old. If milk was older than four days, it needed to be labeled.
Of all the things that were going on, why would you have a debate about that?
The German and the Dutch dairy industries wanted to ship their factory-farmed milk across Europe and sell it to Greek consumers. That would devastate the small Greek producers. Here was something that could only be seen as benefiting special interests in the eurozone and actually weakening the Greek economy.
Q. You argue that some European leaders secretly welcomed mass unemployment as a means of adjusting to the crisis because this was the only way they could see to spur investment -- lowering wages. The strictures of the euro took other options off the table: Crisis countries could not let their currency fall or lower interest rates or expand government spending. Was unemployment really embraced as a fix?
A. They wanted to break the back of workers. Their view was that workers needed to accept a wage cut and we are going to change the bargaining rules to make it more difficult for them to resist. And if we need to add on a little dose of unemployment, well, that's unfortunate.
Q. Doesn't that goal predate the crisis?
A. It's very clear that the euro was a neo-liberal project in its construction. Employers like low wages. They have broken the back of the unions in many of the countries of Europe. They would view that as a great achievement.
Q. The whole point of the European project has been to get past the hostilities of World War II and build a sustainable community. Yet, in your telling, the euro and the policies delivered to preserve it left much of Europe nursing fresh grievances. How are these grievances coloring politics?
A. The most important divergence is between creditor, Germany, and debtor, the rest. The criticisms that you hear in Greece of the Germans, they are reliving the horrors of World War II; the criticism in Germany of the Greeks, saying that they are lazy even though the number of hours that they work per week is higher than the Germans'. The flinging of accusations, whether true or not, has been enormous and the divisiveness has been enormous.
Q. We just saw Britain vote to exit the European Union -- in part, a reaction to the sense that the European Union is a place of weak economic growth and poor leadership. In Italy, the so-called Five Star political movement is gaining support with calls to abandon the euro -- in part, a backlash against German-led austerity. Is there any evidence that these sorts of events are leading to a re-examination of the economic philosophy guiding Europe?
A. I wish that were happening. Unfortunately, what I've seen is almost the reverse. It's doubling down on a failed experiment. It's a hard-line approach in which the European leaders in response to Brexit, people like Jean-Claude Juncker, who is the head of the European Commission, have said, "We're going to be very, very tough on the U.K. because we want to make sure that no other country leaves."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, but it issued an upbeat assessment of economic conditions that suggested a growing chance that it would increase rates later this year.
The Fed, in a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, said that the economy had overcome wobbles this year and that job creation had increased with moderate economic growth.
Importantly, the central bank added that it saw fewer clouds on the horizon as the United States entered the eighth year of an economic expansion.
"Near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished," the statement said, though it added that the Fed remained wary about the weakness of inflation and about "global economic and financial developments."
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, has won broad support among Fed officials for a patient approach to raising rates.
But after a unanimous decision to leave rates unchanged at the Fed's last meeting in June, there was one dissent at the July meeting. Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted for a quarter-point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate.
Ms. George, who has expressed concern that persistently low rates will lead to financial instability, voted in favor of rate increases in March and April.
Recent data "indicates that the labor market has strengthened and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate," the Fed said in its statement. "Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May."
Yet pockets of weakness remain, the Fed said, including a paucity of investment by businesses.
The Fed did not raise rates at its last meeting in June, citing concern about a downturn in domestic job growth and uncertainty on the eve of Britain's referendum on leaving the European Union.
Those concerns have eased. The economy added 287,000 jobs in June and financial markets rebounded quickly even though the British unexpectedly voted to leave the European Union.
Yet Fed officials made clear in the days before the July meeting that they were inclined to wait at least a little longer.
"Sometimes you just have to take some time and let the waters clear," Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a speech in Victor, Idaho, this month.
Moreover, Fed officials have increasingly concluded that rates may remain unusually low for the foreseeable future. Before the financial crisis, the Fed estimated that holding its benchmark rate around 5 percent was a neutral policy, neither providing stimulus nor hitting the brakes.
Now, after years of downward pressure on global rates, the Fed pegs that neutral rate at around 3 percent. That means the impact of holding the benchmark rate near zero has diminished -- and it also means the Fed's return to "normal" may not take as long.
Still, some Fed officials have continued to emphasize that they expect to raise rates at least once before the end of the year. Some analysts predict that the Fed will move at its next meeting in September, although markets put the chances at only 20 percent. There are also meetings scheduled in November and December.
In the next big event on the Fed's calendar, Ms. Yellen is scheduled to speak at an annual policy conference in Wyoming in late August.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Lael Brainard is poised to win another round this week in her fight for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low.
Ms. Brainard, a Fed governor in Washington since 2014, has emerged over the last year as a leading advocate for patience, pressing the case that low rates are important for domestic economic growth and for global stability.
The Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday, after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, that it again will pass on an opportunity to increase its benchmark interest rate, although officials have said they are still considering rate increases later in the year.
Ms. Brainard has become the leading voice among Fed officials for a concern widely shared among left-leaning economists: that the central bank will raise rates too quickly, potentially stifling economic growth. It is a role that has raised her profile in Democratic circles, and driven speculation that she is in line for a top job if Hillary Clinton wins the White House.
Gene Sperling, a longtime Democratic policy maker who is now advising Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign, hired Ms. Brainard as his deputy at the Bill Clinton White House in the mid-1990s. He said he was tickled that lately, when he gives public speeches, he is often asked about her views.
"My outside impression is that she has been as much a champion as anyone on the inside for the go-slow, full-employment perspective that many of us on the outside are advocating for," Mr. Sperling said.
Ms. Brainard has fueled the talk about her future by donating $2,700 to the Clinton campaign -- the maximum amount an individual can give -- raising eyebrows at the Fed and among congressional Republicans. Mrs. Clinton has said she intends to fill half her cabinet with women, and Ms. Brainard is among the few widely regarded as having the relevant credentials to serve as United States trade representative -- or, even better, Treasury secretary, a job no woman has ever held.
Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the Fed, said Ms. Brainard's donations "call into question the political independence" of the central bank. Fed officials have said that Ms. Brainard did not violate any rules.
Ms. Brainard declined to be interviewed for this article. The description of her views is based on her public remarks and the accounts of others.
Ms. Brainard's case for caution combines the idea that the domestic economy is not ready for higher rates, with something new and controversial: that the Fed should care about other countries.
The American economy, until recently, seemed impervious to all but the largest global shocks. But the integration of financial markets has increased the importance of events elsewhere. The rest of the world plays a growing role in determining American mortgage rates.
"The world has just changed fundamentally," Ms. Brainard said at a New York conference in February. "What China does matters to the U.S."
In placing greater weight on the global economy, Ms. Brainard has argued that the Fed needs to consider the impact of its decisions on other countries. She said at the February conference the Fed might achieve better results by coordinating with other central banks.
Otherwise, she said, countries may simply steal growth from one another.
"There is a risk that uncoordinated policy on its own could have the effect of shifting demand across borders rather than addressing the underlying weakness in global demand," she told an audience of academics and policy makers at the United States Monetary Policy Forum.
This view has drawn criticism both inside and outside the Fed.
Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor who argued with Ms. Brainard at the February conference, said in a recent interview that Congress had instructed the Fed to focus on the United States.
"I tell other central banks, 'I'm really sorry to tell you this, but the Fed doesn't care about you at all,"' said Mr. Meyer, who runs L. H. Meyer, a research firm. "You can say that's very nasty, very selfish. But do you think that other central banks care about us? Of course not. They don't want us to hurt them, but they don't care what their actions do to us."
Others, however, say a recalibration is overdue. Eswar Prasad, a professor of international economics at Cornell University, said financial integration had clearly amplified the Fed's role in the global economy, even if the contours were just beginning to be understood.
"Many people have taken an ostrich 'head in the sand' approach," he said. "But the financial channel is clearly a crucial one, and the fact that it is not well understood is not an excuse for ignoring it."
Ms. Brainard was raised to see America in the context of a broader world. As the daughter of a State Department diplomat, she spent parts of her childhood in communist Poland and in East Germany.
"She is basically an internationalist," said Edwin M. Truman, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who worked with Ms. Brainard in both the Clinton and Obama administrations. "That's not particularly popular these days, but she lives and breathes the idea we're all in the same boat and we need to cooperate. And cooperating doesn't mean do what the U.S. says -- or else."
Ms. Brainard, who holds a doctorate in economics from Harvard University, was hired in 1997 as Mr. Sperling's deputy on the National Economic Council. Mr. Sperling, then 38, said he was advised to find a more experienced deputy than Ms. Brainard, then 35. But she was already working at the White House, and each time he interviewed someone else, he came away convinced that Ms. Brainard was a superior choice. Ms. Brainard later served as President Clinton's "sherpa," or liaison, to the Group of 8 industrial nations.
"She's supersmart, well prepared, even-tempered," said Mr. Sperling, who worked with Ms. Brainard in the Obama administration. "Anything she touches will be done to the highest standards."
After spending eight years at the Brookings Institution, waiting out George W. Bush's presidency, she joined the Obama administration as under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department. In that role, she spent long hours trying to cajole European leaders into addressing the continent's problems with greater vigor. She also played a leading role in selling an overhaul of the International Monetary Fund's ownership structure that gave greater control to emerging economies, principally China, at the expense of advanced economies, particularly in Europe.
Ms. Brainard is "not a backslapper," said Mr. Sperling, but she has developed a reputation as a subtle but unbending advocate for the goals she is assigned to pursue.
Mr. Prasad, a former official at the International Monetary Fund, said Ms. Brainard conveyed a sense of empathy and respect for the interests of other countries. "She did not come across as a very aggressive advocate, so she was a very effective advocate," he said. "She has a lot of credibility with policy makers around the world as a consequence of that, especially in emerging markets."
Ms. Brainard joined the Fed in the summer of 2014, but she said almost nothing about monetary policy until October 2015, as the Fed prepared to raise rates for the first time since the financial crisis.
The move was hotly criticized by left-leaning economists and by centrist Democrats like Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary. And in that October speech, Ms. Brainard chimed in, breaking with the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, to argue that the Fed was overstating the risk of inflation and underestimating the threat of a global downturn.
Ms. Brainard and Daniel Tarullo -- a fellow governor and former colleague in the Clinton administration who raised similar concerns -- ultimately acquiesced in the Fed's December increase, providing Ms. Yellen with unanimous support.
While regional reserve presidents frequently dissent, no Fed governor has done so in the last decade.
But since December, Ms. Brainard's public speeches have become more frequent and more forceful. And maybe she won't need to formally dissent. After all, the Fed, which entered the year predicting that it would raise rates four times, has yet to move again.

TECHNOLOGY
Four tech giants to report earnings.
This is a big week for tech company earnings, as Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet -- Google's parent company -- are expected to report their quarterly financials. The theme remains the same for all four companies: to describe how well they are monetizing their mobile customers, whether it is iPhone sales for Apple or the performance of mobile advertising for Facebook, Twitter and Google.

BANKING
Merger deadline for Deutsche Börse shareholders.
Shareholders of the German exchange operator Deutsche Börse have until Tuesday to approve a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group. Nearly two weeks ago, the exchange agreed to lower the acceptance threshold for investors in Deutsche Börse to exchange their stock for shares in a new holding company for the combined entity. The vote by Britons to leave the European Union has raised questions about whether the merger could be completed under its current terms and, in particular, whether the combined entity's holding company should be based in Britain, as planned. Chad Bray
OIL INDUSTRY
Earnings from BP, Shell, Exxon and Chevron.
Major oil companies are planning to report their second-quarter earnings this week. BP will lead off on Tuesday, and Royal Dutch Shell and Total, of France, will report on Thursday. Exxon, Chevron and Eni, of Italy, will follow on Friday. Shares of most of these companies have performed well this year as investors bet that the industry's heavy cost-cutting combined with stabilizing oil prices would improve results. In a sign of the pressures on the industry's work force, maintenance crews on seven Shell platforms in the British North Sea plan to strike for 24 hours on Tuesday to protest reduced pay. Stanley Reed
ECONOMY
The Fed to meet, but rate increase is unlikely.
The Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise its benchmark interest rate when its policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. The domestic economy continues to expand, and concerns about the global economy have eased, but Fed officials see little downside in waiting a bit longer. The Fed's postmeeting statement, however, could indicate the first step toward rate increases later this year. Binyamin Appelbaum
Drop in durable goods orders is expected.
On Wednesday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release its estimate of the change in durable goods orders in June. Economists expect to see an overall drop of 1.1 percent, because of a fall in demand for aircraft. Core activity, which does not include the volatile aviation category, probably rebounded slightly after weakness in the spring. Nelson D. Schwartz
BANKING
European lenders to report first post-'Brexit' results.
Several of Europe's biggest banks are reporting their second-quarter results this week, among them Deutsche Bank; the British lenders Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group; Santander, of Spain; and the Swiss banks Credit Suisse and UBS. It will be the first time the region's largest lenders will update the investing public on their financial outlooks since Britain voted to leave the European Union last month. European bank stocks have been hit hard since the June 23 referendum because of uncertainty about the economic impact of the vote.
At the same time, the European Banking Authority is expected on Friday to announce the results of its latest stress test aimed at measuring the ability of European lenders to survive a financial crisis or severe economic downturn. The tests this year will not have a minimum capital threshold for banks, so no institution can fail, or pass, the exercise. Instead, the information will be passed on to local banking supervisors, like the Bank of England, to determine if further actions are needed. Chad Bray
AUTOMOBILES
Volkswagen's earnings to be weighed down by scandal.
Volkswagen will on Thursday report its second-quarter earnings, which will be weighed down by the cost of the company's emissions scandal. The company said in a preliminary report last week that it would show an operating profit of 5.3 billion euros for the first half of 2016 after subtracting [euro]2.2 billion for fines and legal settlements. That sum brings the total set aside for emissions wrongdoing to [euro]18.4 billion. Investors are hoping the carmaker will show progress in improving the profitability of its core Volkswagen brand. Jack Ewing
UTILITIES
A decision is expected on new British nuclear plant.
After years of preparatory work, the French utility Électricité de France -- better known as EDF -- says it will make a decision on Thursday on whether to go ahead with the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain since the 1990s. The plant, at Hinkley Point in southwest England, has become a crucial test of whether nuclear plants can be built in industrialized countries in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Despite the huge cost, about 18 billion pounds, the British government wants the power from the plant to replace aging generating facilities. Stanley Reed
ECONOMY
Initial estimate of economic growth in the U.S.
On Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will offer its initial estimate of economic growth in the United States in the second quarter. Wall Street economists think growth picked up during April, May and June, and the consensus is predicting an annualized growth rate of 2.6 percent for the period. That represents a considerable increase from the anemic 1.1 percent annual growth rate recorded in the first quarter. Consumer spending provided much of the tailwind, even as businesses remain cautious about new investments. Nelson D. Schwartz
E.U.'s estimate on growth in the eurozone.
The European Union statistics agency will issue a preliminary estimate on Friday for second-quarter growth in the eurozone as well as the latest inflation and unemployment figures. The data will provide only a hint of the economic impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, which took place near the end of the quarter. Still, growth is expected to slow, from an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first three months of the year, as eurozone residents became more cautious about spending. Jack Ewing
Bank of Japan expected to act on deflation.
The Bank of Japan is widely expected on Friday to take new measures in its fight against deflation. The Japanese central bank pushed its benchmark interest rate below zero this year and has been buying trillions of yen of government debt in an effort to shore up consumer prices and stimulate economic growth. But so far, the policy has not yielded the results it hoped for. Analysts are looking for the bank to reduce rates further below zero or perhaps expand purchases of other kinds of assets, like exchange-traded equity funds. Jonathan Soble

Abstract: The blast occurred the day before Charles Evans Hughes, a former governor of New York, was to formally accept the Republican presidential nomination in a speech at Carnegie Hall and confront Woodrow Wilson, whose re-election campaign slogan, "He kept us out of war," would be abrogated the following April when Congress declared war on the German Empire.

Full text:   The morning after two million pounds of munitions exploded in New York Harbor on July 30, 1916, killing five people, jostling the Brooklyn Bridge, shattering plate-glass windows six miles away and shaking building foundations in five states, law enforcement officials all but ruled out a terrorist attack by Germans. Decades later, dogged investigations proved them wrong.
No individuals were ever convicted in the attack that summer Sunday as World War I raged in Europe, but in 1939, an international claims commission reversed itself and declared the German government legally accountable for the damage. And, finally, four decades after that, the post-World War II government in Bonn paid the last installment of a $50 million award for reparations.
The explosion on Black Tom Island, a 25-acre promontory jutting from Jersey City that was built from New Yorkers' garbage, registered an estimated 5.5 on the Richter scale -- 30 times more powerful than the collapse of the World Trade Center 85 years later. It was considered the most destructive terrorist attack in America until Sept. 11, 2001.
The blast occurred the day before Charles Evans Hughes, a former governor of New York, was to formally accept the Republican presidential nomination in a speech at Carnegie Hall and confront Woodrow Wilson, whose re-election campaign slogan, "He kept us out of war," would be abrogated the following April when Congress declared war on the German Empire.
The explosion's effects also reverberated through World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the relocation of more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor because, he was quoted as saying, "We don't want any more Black Toms."
Yet a century later, Black Tom Island's palpable legacy is largely limited to an ambivalent plaque ("Was it an accident or planned?") on the site in Liberty State Park and an enduring ban, for safety reasons, on visitors climbing a ladder through the right arm of the Statue of Liberty to the rickety catwalk on the torch.
The attack and the protracted claims controversy, Jules Witcover wrote in "Sabotage at Black Tom," was "one of the least remembered true stories of American vulnerability, gullibility -- and tenacity -- of the 20th century."
Black Tom Island was where Lehigh Valley Railroad tracks connected to National Dock and Storage Company warehouses bulging with munitions and armaments to be barged to Gravesend Bay and loaded aboard ships bound for Europe.
While the United States was officially neutral in 1916, most of the arms were destined for Britain, France, Russia and Japan because Germany could not afford to buy them.
On July 30, two explosions, one at 2:08 a.m. and another at 2:40, destroyed more than 100 railroad cars and 13 warehouses, leaving a 375-foot-by-175-foot crater. One blast was touched off on a barge moored illegally to avoid a $25 docking fee.
Shockwaves broke thousands of windows from Downtown Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan. At least five people were killed, including a 10-week-old baby thrown from his crib in Jersey City. Hundreds of immigrants were evacuated from Ellis Island.
"The shells intended to make the world safe for democracy when fired through the cannon of the czar and the mikado," A.J. Liebling later wrote in The New York World-Telegram, "were knocking chips out of the Goddess of Liberty on her island in the harbor."
Yet most law enforcement officials concurred that the blast "cannot be charged to the account of alien plotters against the neutrality of the United States," The New York Times reported, "although it is admitted that the destruction of so large a quantity of allied war material must prove cheering news to Berlin and Vienna."
Blame was attributed to negligence by the owners of the warehouses, railroad cars and barges, or to watchmen who had supposedly kindled smudge pots to ward off mosquitoes.
Inspector Thomas J. Tunney of the New York Police Department Bomb Squad suspected sabotage, but there was no concrete evidence, only presumed links, possibly to anarchists or to Irish and Indian nationalists opposed to British rule. Michael Kristoff, 23, a German immigrant from Bayonne, N.J., was arrested, but he was released because the police had insufficient evidence. Lothar Witzke, a German seaman, was later sentenced to hang in a separate spy case and was implicated in the conspiracy, but his sentence was commuted.
"Black Tom shows that the United States was not neutral," said Kenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University history professor, "and Halifax demonstrates how critical American money and manufacturers were in the defeat of Germany."
Under a 1921 peace treaty between the United States and Germany, a commission was established to settle war claims. Lawyers for the plaintiffs finally proved that the plot had been hatched by German agents and organized from a rowhouse in Manhattan owned by a German-American opera singer.
In 1939, the commission's umpire, Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts (one of three justices to reject Japanese internment), and the American referee (his German counterpart had quit, claiming bias) awarded the owners of the Black Tom property and their insurance companies $21 million in damages and $29 million in interest, the largest settlement by an international tribunal (but whittled by inflation, competing liens and a claim fund bloated with German junk bonds).
Hitler repudiated the settlement. It was renegotiated in 1952 with the Federal Republic of Germany. The first payment, $3 million, was received in 1953 and the last in 1979, but the case still echoes.
"There is a direct line to a lot of the rhetoric we hear today -- the divisiveness on topics such as immigration, securing our borders, our place in an ever-changing world -- and that which we heard 100 years ago, just prior to the attack and in the aftermath," said Chad Millman, the author of "The Detonators: The Secret Plot to Destroy America and an Epic Hunt for Justice."
"Most tangibly," Mr. Millman said, "was how it impacted policies years later as political leaders tried to manage fear and freedom."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. THE recent announcement of a wrenching round of layoffs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has sent a shiver through the museum world. Yet as recently as March, the Met seemed to be on a roll, when it opened a flashy contemporary art annex, the Met Breuer.
Indeed, if you've thought at all about the fate of art museums in the 21st century, it is probably as a rare example of good news in difficult times. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has just opened a $305 million addition, creating what is described as the largest modern and contemporary art museum in the country. Last year, two high-profile museums opened in New York (the new $422 million Whitney building downtown) and in Los Angeles (the $140 million Broad).
The turmoil at the Met should be our cue to ask if all this "good news" is really the story of cultural triumph that it is made out to be. According to the Association of Art Museum Directors, for every $8 visitors spend at museums in North America, museums spend $55. So running a museum isn't a great business, despite the crowds.
According to The Art Newspaper, close to $5 billion from 2007 to 2014 was spent in the United States on new expansions, more than the other 37 countries the newspaper examined put together. The United States is also, the publication notes, unique in the degree to which it funds culture through private philanthropy, rather than public money.
For museum executives, the dirty secret of expansions has been that they are often motivated by the need to have some exciting new thing to rally board members and interest potential patrons. These institutions depend heavily on rich people to fund them. Those rich people like to pay for flashy new buildings; no one wants to donate to boring old museum upkeep.
New institutions like the Broad, financed by the billionaire Eli and his wife, Edythe Broad, and other "ego-seums" illustrate that the people with the money are increasingly interested in founding their own institutions. Consequently, traditional museums have to be ever more aggressive with new projects just to win their imaginations, and their dollars.
Consider the Met. What's really behind the Breuer expansion beyond carrying the Met's classical strengths into contemporary art? About 99 percent of all collectors "are collectors of contemporary art," the former Met director Philippe de Montebello told The New Yorker. "The Met is not, as an act of volition, going to cut itself off from the supporters of the future."
The new initiative was said to add $17 million a year to the big museum's budget. The current job cuts and restructuring are motivated by the threat of a $10 million shortfall. It is evidently still easier to raise money for fancy new things than to maintain what is already here.
So, have museums been growing? Yes. But on a sustainable basis? No.
A 2012 report from the Cultural Policy Center at the University of Chicago looked at more than 700 cultural building projects undertaken from 1994 to 2008. It concluded, "There was significant overinvestment in bricks and mortar during the building boom -- especially when coupled with the number of organizations we studied that experienced financial difficulties after completing a building project."
Institutions that already had to beg for funding were drawn into building more expensive facilities, but had no better way to fill the funding gap when a crisis hit.
At the same time, the spectacular growth of the most visible institutions may distract from how art institutions are faring as a whole. According to the National Endowment for the Arts, between 2002 and 2012, average adult attendance at art museums and galleries declined, by as much as 30 percent.
Large, cosmopolitan institutions have resources to compete for attention in a way that the bulk of smaller institutions, more dependent on local communities and cultures, simply can't.
As Andy Horowitz argued in a recent essay for The Atlantic, leveling the playing field between big and small organizations was one of the historic, modest achievements of the N.E.A. Yet while the 1 percent have accumulated staggering wealth, even modest government outlays for culture have been cut. Adjusted for inflation, public arts funding is 15 percent lower today than it was 20 years ago.
"When grant funding is slashed, the organizations that suffer most are the smaller groups, which have lower levels of visibility among other donors," notes a recent report, "Diversity in the Arts," by the DeVos Institute of Arts Management. "This means that arts organizations of color -- along with rural, avant-garde and service organizations -- suffer disproportionately."
So there's a case for a significant increase in public art funding that's more than just a sentimental call for a cause favored by the well-to-do. In fact, it's based on correcting for the biases of the rich.
That makes it all the more important to see that, whatever its glories, the great American museum boom mirrors all the irrational extremes of the age of inequality.
Correction: July 31, 2016, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An opinion article last Sunday about art museum expansion misstated the status of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art after its expansion. It is now the largest modern and contemporary art museum in the country, not the largest art museum.

Full text:   To the growing list of problems brought about by June's "Brexit" vote, you can add corporate profits in the United States.
The pace of earnings growth for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has been declining since the third quarter of 2014, and it officially turned negative a year ago. Because stock prices tend to follow the general path of profits, this helps to explain why the broad stock market may have been generally flat over the last two years.
But many market strategists had been predicting an end to the earnings drought in the second half of 2016 because of rebounding oil and commodity prices -- a sign the global economy was finding its footing. That is, until Britain chose to leave the European Union in a surprising vote last month, raising a whole new set of risks.
"If companies were looking for a built-in excuse for an earnings disappointment, they've found it," said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.
By raising concerns over the British and European economies, the Brexit vote has spooked investors who had parked their cash in the pound and euro, leading to a stronger dollar, Mr. Ablin said. And that hurts the fortunes of American companies that generate a sizable portion of their revenue abroad.
Before Brexit, the dollar had fallen slightly against a basket of foreign currencies this year, after gaining more than 20 percent in 2014 and 2015. A weakening dollar not only reduces the cost of goods made in the United States and sold in foreign markets, it also increases international profits for American firms when they convert their overseas earnings back into dollars.
Since the Brexit vote on June 23, though, the dollar has risen in strength.
This trend shouldn't have an impact on second-quarter profits, because the British vote took place at the very end of that period. Wall Street analysts continue to look for a profit decline of about 5.5 percent versus the same period a year earlier.
That would actually represent an improvement from the 6.8 percent decline in the first quarter and would end a streak of seven consecutive quarters of declining growth rates.
"Our call for U.S. corporate profits to bounce back in the second quarter is still valid," said Olga Bitel, an economist and portfolio manager at the asset manager William Blair.
"Looking forward, however, there's a considerable amount of ambiguity," she said.
Market strategists had been expecting profit growth for the S.&P. 500 to turn positive in the third quarter, followed by a rise in earnings of nearly 8 percent in the fourth, according to S.&P. Global Market Intelligence. Such a bounce would have bolstered the argument of the optimists on Wall Street, who believe the seven-year-old bull market can keep running despite being older than average.
Such lofty profit projections aren't easy to make now.
"I have a difficult time thinking how large-cap profit growth will rebound significantly this year," said Mr. Ablin at BMO.
Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer at Westwood Holdings Group, said that in addition to a potentially stronger dollar, "Brexit calls into question projections for global growth, and that's an additional headwind for the markets," he said.
So are rising wages.
Throughout this long but shallow economic recovery, wage growth had been weighed down by several factors, including cost-cutting efforts and lackluster productivity growth.
But wage growth has finally started to pick up. "For the last 12 months, wages have grown about 2.5 percent, inflation has been at 1 percent, and productivity growth has been zero," said Ben Inker, co-head of the asset allocation team at the asset management firm GMO. "That's a 1.5 percent increase in unit labor costs. That's the reverse of what's been happening on profits."
Mr. Inker argues that in the long run, this could be a positive for the broad economy. "You could view this as a healing process," he said. "We've had a long time when wages grew so much less than productivity. But if labor income is improving, that's more money going into the household sector, and households will probably spend it."
In the short run, however, rising wages will put pressure on near-term corporate profits.
Investors should not overreact, said Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial.
Mr. White noted that so far, the profit drought has been concentrated in just a handful of the 10 sectors of the market. For instance, in the second quarter, energy sector profits are expected to be down 82 percent. And profits for basic materials companies, which are tied to commodities, and financial stocks are forecast to drop 7 and 9 percent.
Yet other sectors of the market haven't been affected nearly as much. "We continue to see decent earnings growth in areas such as the consumer discretionary sector," he said. Companies that deliver goods and services that aren't necessities but that households want -- appliances, cars and entertainment -- are expected to see a 9 percent increase in their profits in the second quarter and a 13 percent rise in 2016.
John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, also likes consumer discretionary stocks, including automakers, in addition to industrial companies that are benefiting from low commodity prices.
An added benefit is that companies in the consumer discretionary and industrial sectors tend to have modest exposure to foreign economies. Only 26 percent of the revenue for consumer discretionary companies and 38 percent of sales for industrial firms in the S.&P. 500 are generated abroad, according to FactSet. By contrast, nearly 60 percent of information technology company sales are foreign.
Why is this important? Because domestically oriented companies have been sheltered from many of the negative effects of the strong dollar.
FactSet, for instance, points out that while profits for companies that generate most of their sales abroad are expected to fall 9.9 percent in the second quarter, domestically focused firms are bracing for a more modest 2.8 percent decline.
Besides sticking with domestically oriented businesses, investors should also focus on industry leaders, whose dominant positions in their industries are likely to produce steadier earnings growth.
"We think the benefit of being with the dominant, No. 1 player has increased over time in this economy," said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer at Osterweis Capital Management.
Even in the energy sector, where earnings growth is hard to come by, Mr. Osterweis said he has been adding to his position in industry leaders like Halliburton.
"If oil prices recover, the dominant player wins," he said. "And if oil prices were to stay low for longer, more and more of Halliburton's competitors might go out of business, so it would gain market share."
He adds: "People often get spooked and discouraged when the market is under pressure. But that can give you an opportunity to swoop in."

Abstract: Some niches within the markets -- stocks of companies in one industry or region, bonds from certain types of issuers -- may offer adequate return prospects at acceptable risk, investment advisers say. Emerging-market bonds are similarly cheap, in his view, with yields at a greater premium to those on Treasury debt than at any time since 1998, during the Asian financial crisis and Russian debt default.

Full text:   The stock market at midyear hovered around a record high. But after several disturbing weeks in which prices soared, then plunged, then soared again, the view from the summit, or near it, may not be so pleasant.
Stock fund owners escaped the second quarter with modest gains, but the extreme volatility leaves them to contemplate fresh uncertainties in the final half of 2016.
Share prices were advancing steadily until British voters decided in a referendum on June 23 to leave the European Union. Although polls showed a close race throughout the "Brexit" campaign, the result came as a shock -- one that evidently wore off quickly, as stocks fell precipitously but then recovered nearly all of the Brexit losses in the final days of the month.
The British vote overshadowed a far less surprising decision earlier in June by the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates. Explaining the Fed's thinking to a Senate committee, Janet L. Yellen, the central bank's chairwoman, highlighted "considerable uncertainty" about the economy.
Whatever uncertainties investors faced, in whatever corner of the world, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended June at 2,098.86, up 1.9 percent for the quarter.
The post-Brexit bounce -- after the post-Brexit swoon -- helped to produce a 2.5 percent return for domestic stock funds in the quarter, according to Morningstar. The average international stock fund rose 1.4 percent, but portfolios in Europe lost 3.4 percent.
Even if the British referendum had gone the other way, American stocks might have been vulnerable to a decline, albeit not necessarily all at once, and after their rebound, they may be vulnerable to one again. The S.&P. 500 ended the quarter trading at 19 times the earnings that component companies reported in the previous four quarters, compared with a historical average of about 15.
Not only are valuations high, but earnings growth is low and expectations are falling. Analysts estimated earnings of $118.79 for the 2016 S.&P. 500 at the end of June, according to FactSet Research, a figure that has declined in each of the last six quarters.
The conundrum that investors face heading into the second half is that alternative destinations for their money aren't cheap, either. Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for instance, declined in the second quarter to 1.4 percent from 1.78 percent. That helped the average long-term government bond fund gain 6.5 percent, and bond funds in general rose 2.6 percent.
Some niches within the markets -- stocks of companies in one industry or region, bonds from certain types of issuers -- may offer adequate return prospects at acceptable risk, investment advisers say. But they warn that gains are likely to be meager at best in broad asset classes. Few options are good; some may be good enough.
"It's hard to find real pockets of value in the financial markets today," said Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families. "I don't see much where you can say, 'Aha! This is a great opportunity."'
Neither does Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates. He blames the Fed and its peers for much of the situation.
"The mainstream markets that most people rely on are generally pretty expensive, with anemic yields," he said. "Central banks deserve most of the credit for that, basically blowing bubbles all over the world."
But not everywhere.
"If you look outside the mainstream markets, you see some bargains," Mr. Arnott said. "The lowest-hanging fruit is emerging-market stocks. They've been in a brutal five-year bear market."
In contrast to American stocks, indexes of emerging markets are trading at less than 10 times earnings. Emerging-market bonds are similarly cheap, in his view, with yields at a greater premium to those on Treasury debt than at any time since 1998, during the Asian financial crisis and Russian debt default.
"When you see spreads this wide, it makes sense to put a large toe in the water," he said.
Traders displayed no such circumspection when it came to British and Continental European stocks and currencies after the Brexit referendum. They took stock indexes down nearly 10 percent in just a few hours and sold the euro and especially the pound, which fell more than 10 percent, to its lowest level since 1985, and failed to recover with stocks.
Comments from global banks after the referendum were mixed. Deutsche Bank called the result "a sign of Europe's increasing fragility" and warned that "this outcome points to greater risks." The S.&P. 500 could fall to 1,950, Deutsche said, and banks and companies with high European sales are particularly vulnerable.
UBS Wealth Management advised staying the course, treacherous though it may be.
"Given considerable uncertainties, we would encourage investors not to sell down risk assets in a time of heightened market volatility and lower-than-average liquidity," the bank said in a note to clients. "We are confident in the prospects for positive returns for U.S. equities."
Focusing on the outlook for emerging markets, HSBC said there probably would not be much direct impact on business. The bank cautioned, however, that "the U.K.'s referendum decision to leave the E.U. means we are entering an uncertain world and there will likely be pressure on emerging-market financial assets based on immediate risk aversion."
Jeremy Richardson, a manager of stock portfolios for RBC Global Asset Management, said that the world was plenty uncertain before June 23 rolled round.
"A big question that hangs over all of us is, How do we move on from this world of low, even negative, interest rates that we find ourselves in?" he said. "Central banks are running out of policy tools; that creates a level of uncertainty. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why equity markets have not been more robust."
Mr. Richardson recommends avoiding long-term bonds or the stocks of companies that investors may view as proxies for them for their stable trading patterns. Their popularity has made them expensive, just like bonds, he warned.
He prefers stocks of "businesses that do things a little differently," including discount clothing retailers and the carmaker Tesla. He also likes companies involved in cloud computing and so-called big data, as well as immunotherapy, or the development of cancer treatments that enhance immune system responses to tumors.
"People spend so much time on what Janet Yellen is going to say next or the price of copper and tin" instead of focusing on individual companies, Mr. Richardson said. "If you're just talking about the market, you're missing a big part of the story."
But central banks remain a big part of the story, too. However the Fed and its peers might go about extricating themselves from nearly a decade of extraordinary monetary policy, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, wishes they would just get on with it.
"We have uninterrupted growth with full employment," he said. It's no longer appropriate, he said, "to employ crisislike policies when the crisis is long past in the U.S."
Though he considers the economic backdrop benign, Mr. Paulsen acknowledges that valuations are quite high, so he envisions "midsingle-digit buy-and-hold returns" and expects the S.&P. 500 to trade between 1,800 and 2,200 in the second half.
He favors sectors like financial services, industrials and materials and would avoid consumer sectors, where prices have been bid up. Foreign markets may do better than the United States, in his view, because they are less further along in the upward slope of their economic cycles.
Other niches that Mr. Paulsen would consider include market-neutral and other alternative funds, which try to achieve modest returns with minimal risk, and real estate and commodity funds, in case the Fed loses control and inflation begins to stir.
Ms. Patterson at Bessemer cautioned that all manner of developments, from terrorism to slowing growth in China, could cause turmoil in the markets this year, and she reminded investors that the Brexit referendum wasn't the only vote that must be factored into asset prices. She expects some companies to hold off on hiring and investment decisions as the presidential election draws closer.
"Even with a benign outcome" to the various sources of uncertainty, she said, "given valuations and the outlook for profits, being neutral in equities makes sense."
Among the few assets she prefers in the present climate are high-quality corporate bonds and shares of global companies that tend to trade with less volatility than the overall market, as long as they are also reasonably priced.
If such slim pickings and the prospect of slim returns leave investors feeling disappointed, Mr. Paulsen has a simple piece of advice: Get over it.
"You've got to look at the world you live in," he said. "There's not much available anywhere." Trying to make the best of a mediocre situation, he added: "The best of this bull market is long past, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's over."

Full text:   The jury is still out on whether the negative-yield experiment playing out in Japan and across Europe will deliver on its intended goal of spurring economic growth. But central banks have managed to engineer some short-term good news for American bond investors.
Negative yields have served as a powerful magnet pulling rates down just about everywhere, and as yields fall, bond prices rise. Britain's vote to leave the European Union pushed yields down even further in late June, helping to bolster prices.
For the second quarter, the average intermediate core United States bond fund posted a solid 2.3 percent total return and gained 4.9 percent in the first six months of the year, nearly one percentage point ahead of the gain for the S.&P. 500. (Total return is the combined result of the yield you are paid and any changes to the underlying prices of the bonds you own.)
Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund, the largest mutual fund, earned a 5.5 percent return in the first six months of the year, just ahead of the 5.3 percent gain for the largest exchange-traded fund, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond. Metropolitan West Total Return fund, one of the largest actively managed bond funds, generated a gain of nearly 4.5 percent in the first half of the year.
Don't count on that lasting.
"We have stepped through the looking glass," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman wealth management. Even with negative rates in much of the world, interest rates could move lower in the near term, yet the expectation is that they will eventually begin to move off their historic lows, which will cause bond prices and investor total returns to fall.
Goldman Sachs estimates that a one percentage point rise in interest rates would reduce the value of bonds in the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index -- the benchmark for high-quality core bond investments -- by $1 trillion.
"The rise in yields from where we are now comes with no cushion." Mr. Clemons said. "People need to get used to looking at unrealized capital losses."
Yet with so many investors seeking safety and streaming into bonds, actual losses are being pushed into the future.
Still, BlackRock and Vanguard expect annualized returns for core United States bonds to be around 1 percent or so over the next five to 10 years. That's even before accounting for inflation; real returns would probably be below zero.
In a report titled "Diminishing Returns," the McKinsey Global Institute said inflation-adjusted returns for high-grade United States bonds could be between zero and 1 percent over the next 20 years. Research Affiliates, a quantitative asset management firm, says core United States bonds could deliver real annualized returns ranging from a 1 percent loss to a 1 percent gain over 10 years.
"It's basic arithmetic," said Chris Brightman, chief investment officer at Research Affiliates, referring to the fact that a bond's current yield predicts future returns.
Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, points out that 10 years ago, most fixed income investments had yields of at least 3 percent. At the end of June, the 10-year Treasury note yielded 1.5 percent. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond E.T.F., which tracks the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, has a trailing 12-month yield of 2.3 percent, barely ahead of the rate of inflation. The only way to earn 3 percent these days is to stick your neck out into high-yield and emerging-market debt. "In this environment, counting on core fixed income for returns is going to be difficult," Mr. Rieder said.
Pursuing higher yields always means taking on more risk, but those risks are magnified right now. Sure, longer-term bonds pay marginally higher yields. But those yields are still well below historic norms and thus won't offer much of a cushion when prices rise. And the longer the maturity of a bond, the more price volatility you will incur when rates rise. And junk bonds and emerging-market debt need careful consideration at this point in the economic cycle.
"We are of the opinion that investors shouldn't reach for yield now and should accept lower returns," said Stephen M. Kane, a portfolio manager in the United States Fixed Income Group at TCW, which runs more than $150 billion in bond portfolios, including the $78 billion Metropolitan West Total Return mutual fund.
The fund has about 60 percent of assets in a mix of cash and low-yielding -- but superliquid -- Treasuries and government agency bonds, and its current yield is below 2 percent. Its one-year gain of 4.4 percent lagged the Barclays Aggregate by nearly one percentage point.
Mr. Kane said that performance was "frustrating" but the managers don't want to be aggressive in this market. "Our defensive strategy today," he added, "is the dry powder that we will be able to invest once valuations are better."
Taking the long view has paid off for patient investors. Over the last 10 and 15 years, MetWest Total Return ranks in the top 5 percent of similar portfolios, according to Morningstar.
Granted, the prospect of watching your core bond portfolio fail to keep pace with inflation isn't cheery news, but it's worth reminding yourself why you own bonds in the first place.
"All too often, investors forget that low returns are far better than big losses," said Harold Evensky, chairman of Evensky & Katz/Foldes Financial Wealth Management. "When markets turn down -- and they will -- even zero returns will look pretty attractive."
Joe Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard and head of its investment strategy group, puts the odds at "well over 90 percent" that we are due for a stock bear market in the next few years. In 2008, when the S.&P. 500 lost 37 percent, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index gained more than 5 percent. Today's low yields mean bonds probably would not gain that much, but there is no likelihood of a real meltdown, either. Since 1976, the benchmark index has never lost more than 3 percent in a calendar year.
Given that the Barclays U.S. Aggregate is now laden with low-yielding government bonds that will be most sensitive to a rate rise, venturing beyond a pure core index fund may be worth considering.
BKD Wealth Advisors, which manages more than $2.5 billion, recommended core bond index funds before rates plummeted. But now, said Jeff Layman, BKD's chief investment officer, the firm relies on actively managed funds, including Metropolitan West Total Return, DoubleLine Total Return and Guggenheim Total Return. These funds might add some incremental performance.
Mr. Evensky peppers client portfolios with nontraditional bond funds that aren't tethered to the Barclays Aggregate, including JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities, Goldman Sachs Strategic Income and BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities.
A recent analysis by Morningstar found that nontraditional bond funds have outperformed core bond funds when rates are rising, but have underperformed core bond funds when the stock market sells off, because they tend to own holdings like junk bonds and emerging-market debt whose fortunes are often in sync with stock market performance.
Mr. Rieder, co-manager of BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities, says the challenge today for investors is "How can I get 2 percent to 4 percent from bonds to help my portfolio?" BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities currently has about 15 percent invested in junk bonds and owns non-United States bonds as well.
In a research note titled "Negative Rates are Dangerous to Your Wealth," Mr. Brightman, of Research Affiliates, said that in the current markets, a classic balanced approach -- 60 percent invested in United States stocks, 40 percent in domestic high-grade bonds -- has an expected 10-year annualized return of 1.3 percent after inflation. That anemic return may not get investors to their retirement goals.
To improve the chances of achieving a 5 percent annualized return, Mr. Brightman created what he calls a "maverick" portfolio. It is risky, however. The only United States bonds are long-term Treasuries, and there are no United States stocks. Instead, the portfolio contains a 20 percent stake in emerging market stocks and 20 percent in noninvestment grade bonds, among other asset classes. He estimated that it would generate about 40 percent more volatility than the classic 60-40 approach.
Mr. Brightman acknowledges that most investors lack the fortitude to stick their necks out that far, and he doesn't recommend it for the fainthearted. His advice for dealing with the ramifications of negative interest rates: "Save more, plan on working longer and living more frugally."

Market Slows After Five-Day Rally

Abstract: The market was down most of the day after disappointing bank earnings weighed on financial company shares. In economic news, the Labor Department reported consumer prices rose a modest 1 percent in June from a year ago, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may take its time raising interest rates from the record lows that have helped push stocks higher.

Full text:   Stocks ended more or less where they started on Friday as a five-day rally ran out of steam.
The market was down most of the day after disappointing bank earnings weighed on financial company shares. Investors also sold retailers and other consumer-focused stocks. But by the close, the Dow Jones industrial average managed to squeeze out a gain to set another record.
U.S. government bonds fell, sending their yields higher.
"The market is taking a breather," said Anna Rathbun, research director at CBIZ Retirement Plan Services. "Investors are taking gains."
The Dow edged up 10.14 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,516.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 2.01 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,161.74. Six of the 10 sectors in that index ended lower.
The Nasdaq composite lost 4.47 points, or 0.1 percent, to end at 5,029.59.
All three indexes ended the week up for the third week in a row.
Earnings remained a focus for investors. Wells Fargo fell $1.23, or 2.5 percent, to $47.71 after the consumer banking giant reported a drop in second-quarter earnings.
Trading was subdued in Europe after a man drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day along the beachfront of Nice, killing at least 84 people.
France's CAC-40 was down 0.3 percent while Germany's DAX was flat. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent.
Travel-related stocks fell in the wake of the attack. Cruise operator Royal Caribbean lost $1.49, or 2.1 percent, to $70.39. Delta Air Lines fell $1, or 2.4 percent, to $39.98.
Among stocks making big moves, Herbalife rose $5.89, or 10 percent, to $65.25 after it agreed to pay a $200 million settlement over allegations that it deceived consumers, but avoided a more serious charge that it was operating as a pyramid scheme. The deal puts an end to a Federal Trade Commission investigation of the nutritional supplements company that had stretched over two years.
In economic news, the Labor Department reported consumer prices rose a modest 1 percent in June from a year ago, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may take its time raising interest rates from the record lows that have helped push stocks higher. The Fed's target for inflation is 2 percent.
The Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose a robust 2.7 percent in June from a year earlier. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic output in the U.S., much higher than in many other developed countries.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.7 percent. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong climbed 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi index added 0.4 percent.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose 27 cents to close at $45.95 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a standard for international oil prices, climbed 24 cents to $47.61 a barrel.
In other energy trading in New York, wholesale gasoline rose 1 cent to $1.42 a gallon, heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.40 a gallon and natural gas rose 3 cents to $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Retail sales in the United States rose strongly in June as Americans bought more vehicles and a variety of other goods, the Commerce Department said Friday. And other new economic data further reinforced views that economic growth picked up in the second quarter.
Industrial production last month recorded its biggest increase in 11 months on strong manufacturing and utilities output. With domestic demand strengthening, inflation is also rising steadily.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6 percent last month after gaining 0.2 percent in May. It was the third consecutive month of increases, and it lifted sales 2.7 percent from a year ago.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales gained 0.5 percent after a similar increase in May. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component in the gross domestic product report.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said industrial output increased 0.6 percent last month, reversing May's 0.3 percent drop. Manufacturing output rose 0.4 percent at a time of broad increases in production, including a 5.9 percent surge in auto assembly. Utilities output increased 2.4 percent and mining rose 0.2 percent.
Strong domestic demand is being reflected in steady increases in consumer prices. In a third report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in May. In the 12 months through June, the index advanced 1 percent, matching May's increase.
The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, also rose 0.2 percent in June, increasing by the same margin for three consecutive months. That lifted the year-on-year core C.P.I. gain to 2.3 percent, from 2.2 percent in May.
This increase is higher than the average annual rate of 1.9 percent over the last 10 years. The Federal Reserve has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure that is currently at 1.6 percent.
The reports on Friday came after a surge in job growth in June and an acceleration in manufacturing and services sectors activity. The strong rise in core retail sales in June could prompt economists to raise their growth estimates for gross domestic product in the second quarter.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting second-quarter G.D.P. growth at a 2.3 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.1 percent pace in the first three months of the year.
Retail sales will most likely remain supported after a rally on the stock market, rising wages and higher savings.
Retail sales in June were buoyed by purchases of building materials and garden equipment, which rose 3.9 percent, the largest increase since April 2010.
Online retail sales rose 1.1 percent, while receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores increased 0.8 percent.
There was also an increase in furniture sales, which rose 0.5 percent. Auto sales edged up 0.1 percent after declining 0.5 percent in May. Americans also spent more on grooming and paid more for gasoline, but they cut back on apparel purchases and spending at restaurants and bars.

Full text:   LONDON -- Despite the widespread uncertainty created by Britain's vote last month to leave the European Union, the country's central bank decided on Thursday to hold its main interest rate steady, although it signaled that economic pressures could necessitate a cut next month.
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted 8 to 1 to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009.
The decision last month to leave the 28-nation bloc, known as Brexit, has clouded the growth outlook for Britain, which emerged as one of the region's strongest economies after the global financial crisis. Now everything is in flux. The vote is forcing a reassessment of Britain's trading relationship with the Continent, the status of its critically important financial services industry and the future of London as a regional commercial hub.
The uncertainty has rattled the financial markets. After the referendum, the pound plunged to 31-year lows, as investors sought havens. Several real estate funds suspended withdrawals as panicked investors tried to pull their cash. Banking, construction and other stocks in Britain have been hit hard.
Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has cited the continuing uncertainty as a major drag on the economy, creating tighter financial conditions with potential repercussions around the region. Two weeks ago, he said the "the economic outlook has deteriorated" and a rate cut this summer was likely.
The issue of uncertainty has been echoed by the new chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, who was chosen on Wednesday by Theresa May, Britain's new prime minister. Mr. Hammond said in an interview with the BBC on Thursday that the uncertainty was "damaging our economy." He added that it was necessary to "send signals of reassurance about the future" to get "investment starting to flow into the U.K. economy again."
The United States Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, returned to London on Thursday to meet with his British counterpart, after meeting with his predecessor earlier in the week. The last-minute schedule change reflected not just the close American-British relationship, but the global desire to minimize any disruption from the so-called Brexit.
The British central bank on Thursday again pointed to potential signs of stress after the referendum. Some businesses were beginning to delay investment projects and postpone recruitment, while consumer sentiment was weakening.
"This evidence suggested the uncertainty flowing from the referendum result was likely to depress economic activity in the near term," the central bank said, according to the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England.
Even so, the central bank decided to take a wait-and-see attitude before making another move. The financial system, it noted, looked resilient after the referendum, while banks remained on solid ground in terms of capital.
"The Bank of England has decided that patience is a virtue," said Paul Diggle, an economist at Aberdeen Asset Management.
Mr. Carney has sought to reassure investors, saying the central bank has several tools available to stabilize the market.
He made 250 billion pounds, or about $331 billion, available as a backstop to keep the system functioning. The central bank has also lowered the amount of capital that banks are required to keep in reserve, which would in theory allow them to lend more to consumers and businesses.
In the prelude to the rate decision, a number of economists and analysts had predicted that the bank would lower the rate by 25 basis points, particularly in light of Mr. Carney's earlier comments. There also was a belief that the committee could increase the size of the bank's bond-buying program, a policy known as quantitative easing, which injects cash into the economy and helps keeps rates down.
But the central bank, for now, is keeping those two major tools in reserve.
The Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the bond purchasing program at the same level, £375 billion, as it has been for the last four years.
"The committee had taken some reassurance from the evidence that markets had continued to function effectively throughout the period," the central bank's minutes said. "The overall resilience of the U.K. financial system, and the flexibility of the regulatory framework, had allowed the impact of the referendum result to be dampened rather than amplified."
The next steps will depend on the data.
The central bank is expected to unveil in August its updated forecast for inflation, an important metric for monetary policy decisions. It also will keep its eye on the extent to which economic activity has slowed since the referendum -- from housing starts to hiring.
One member of the committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, already felt a cut was warranted, pointing in part to the "outlook for medium-term inflation -- even taking into account the boost from the lower level of sterling." And the committee broadly suggested a rate cut was likely next month.
"Whatever the economic merits or demerits of cutting interest rates at this juncture, the lack of clear direction is more likely to add to economic uncertainty and therefore be detrimental to demand and the economy," said Angus Armstrong, the director of macroeconomics at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.

Full text:   It remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the United States, a startling crime that captured the American imagination, inspiring songs, movies, TV shows and books.
In 1971, a man who called himself Dan Cooper hijacked a passenger plane from Oregon to Seattle where he freed the 36 passengers in exchange for $200,000 in cash. As the nearly empty flight took off again, flying south, he parachuted out of the airplane with the ransom, and was never seen again.
But after 45 years in which hundreds of leads were probed and discarded, the F.B.I. said this week it was no longer actively pursuing what it called one of the longest and most exhaustive investigations in its history.
Who was D.B. Cooper?
No one knows. Or someone does, but is not telling. The F.B.I. has described him as a "nondescript" man. He appeared to be in his mid-40s, which if true would make him about 90 years old by now. As the caper became widely known, he was referred to as "D.B. Cooper" in media reports.
How did he pull it off?
On Nov. 24, 1971, the man calling himself "Dan Cooper" approached the counter of Northwest Orient Airlines in Portland, Ore., dressed in a business suit and carrying a briefcase. He paid cash for a one-way ticket on Flight 305 to Seattle.
"Thus began one of the great unsolved mysteries in F.B.I. history," the F.B.I. said.
A "quiet" man, he ordered a bourbon and soda while waiting for takeoff. In midair just after 3 p.m., from seat 18C, he handed the flight attendant a note saying he had a bomb in his briefcase and showed her a glimpse of wires and red sticks. She wrote down his demands -- four parachutes and $200,000 in twenty-dollar bills -- and passed them to the captain.
In Seattle, the passengers were exchanged for the money and parachutes. The flight resumed with "Mr. Cooper" and the crew en route for Mexico City, with the plane flying no higher than 10,000 feet, as he demanded.
After 8 p.m., somewhere between Seattle and Reno, he jumped out of the back of the plane into a wooded area with a parachute and the ransom, and disappeared.
How did the story affect American culture?
The high-flying exploit of the man known as D.B. Cooper infused American popular culture. The parts of his story that were known were dramatic enough to inspire writers, directors and musicians, but the unanswered questions had to be patched up with guesswork.
The 2004 movie "Without a Paddle" was about three friends who headed into the wilderness in search of the lost ransom money and ended up finding his skeleton.
In 1981, the movie "The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper" opened with Treat Williams in the lead role as a former Green Beret named J.R. Meade. The movie was based on J.D. Reed's 1980 book, "Free Fall." Other fictional books included "D.B." by Elwood Reid in which "Cooper" is actually a Vietnam vet named Phil Fitch, and James M. Cain's "Rainbow's End" in the 1970s, which had similarities.
Artists from Todd Snider to Chuck Brodsky have written and performed songs about him.
[Video: The Ballad of D.B. Cooper Watch on YouTube.]
"They say that with the wind chill, it was 69 below," Mr. Brodsky sings. "Not much chance that he'd survive, but if he did where did he go?"
The Ariel General Store and Tavern, an archive of Coopermania in the Washington State town of Ariel, where he is believed to have landed, has kept the story alive with an annual get-together that toasts Mr. Cooper as a hero. Its next annual D.B. Cooper festival is planned for Nov. 26, including a look-a-like contest.
What happened to the money?
In 1980, a boy found a rotting package of twenty-dollar bills along the Columbia River worth $5,800 that matched the ransom money serial numbers. Using an inflation calculator, the ransom of $200,000 in 1971 would be equivalent to demanding about $1.2 million today. It is unclear what happened to the rest of the money.
Who were some of the suspects?
The F.B.I. has said it interviewed hundreds of people, tracked leads across the nation, and scoured the aircraft for evidence. By the fifth anniversary of the hijacking, it had looked into 800 suspects. As The New York Times reported in 2011, the F.B.I. file on the case, available in an online vault, measures 40 feet long, cataloging more than 1,000 suspects, some supplied by psychics, some turned in by people suspicious of a family member, some coming in deathbed confessions.
One of the suspects interviewed was a man named Richard Floyd McCoy. He carried out a similar hijacking and escape by parachute less than five months after the Cooper flight, the F.B.I. said. But Mr. McCoy was ruled out because he did not match descriptions provided by flight attendants, and for other undisclosed reasons, the F.B.I said.
Here is the original New York Times article about the search. The agency was not sure, even by 1972, that he was alive.
Did the case influence the way the government handled hijackings?
Hijackings during the Cold War were often desperate attempts at escape from the Iron Curtain, but during the 1970s criminals used them as leverage in ransom negotiations. The D.B. Cooper case became a storied example of an era of hijacking. By the mid-1970s, at least 150 planes had been "skyjacked" in the United States alone, as The Times wrote in a report.
Geoffrey Gray, a journalist who has contributed to The Times and who wrote the 2011 book on the investigation, "Skyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper," said in an article published after the F.B.I. announcement this week that the case was legally still open.
He said it had initially been deemed a case of air piracy, a felony that carried a statute of limitations of five years. However, a grand jury indicted the hijacker in absentia for violating the Hobbs Act, another federal statute aimed to prevent extortion that carried no statute of limitations.
"In theory, if Cooper were to walk out of the woods today, he could theoretically be charged with a crime," he wrote.
Why did the F.B.I. decide to shelve the investigation?
The agency said it was redirecting resources because "every time the F.B.I. assesses additional tips for the Norjak case," referring to the name it gave the D.B. Cooper probe, "investigative resources and manpower are diverted from programs that more urgently need attention."
The F.B.I. said that the "countless items" it has examined over the years would be preserved for historical purposes at its headquarters. The agency did say people could still contact the bureau if they had specific leads.
Mr. Gray said, "Hundreds if not more Cooper sleuths continue to harangue the office with their leads."
Reassigning the lone agent on the case, he said, "is really an attempt by the bureau to spare the office from irritating calls, wacky emails and more."

Full text:   The United States is producing more research scientists than academia can handle.
We have been told time and again that the United States needs more scientists, but when it comes to some of the most desirable science jobs -- tenure-track professorships at universities, where much of the exciting work is done -- there is such a surplus of Ph.D.s that in the most popular fields, like biomedicine, fewer than one in six has a chance of joining the club in the foreseeable future.
While they try to get a foot in the door, many spend years after getting their Ph.D. as poorly paid foot soldiers in a system that can afford to exploit them. Even someone as brilliant as Emmanuelle Charpentier, who in 2015 became head of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology after a momentous discovery in gene editing, spent the previous 25 years moving through nine institutions in five countries.
The lure of a tenured job in academia is great -- it means a secure, prestigious position directing a lab that does cutting-edge experiments, often carried out by underlings. Yet although many yearn for such jobs, fewer than half of those who earn science or engineering doctorates end up in the sort of academic positions that directly use what they were trained for.
Others, ending up in industry, business or other professions, do interesting work and earn lucrative salaries and can contribute enormously to society. But by the time many give up on academia -- four to six years or more for a Ph.D., a decade or more as a postdoc, they are edging toward middle age, having spent their youth in temporary low-paying positions getting highly specialized training they do not need.
Now, as a new crop of graduate students receives Ph.D.s in science, researchers worry over the future of some of these dedicated people; they're trained to be academics and are often led to believe that anything else is an admission of failure.
Every year the market grows tighter, and federal money for research grants, which support most of this research, remains flat. The journey of Dr. Charpentier, says Alexander Ommaya, acting chief scientific officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, is not so unusual. "It happens," he said. Job opportunities, he says, "are limited."
But wait. Don't we need more trained scientists -- the people whose research can lead to new knowledge, new products, new cures for disease? Aren't some companies importing STEM workers?
It depends on which field: biology (many more Ph.D.s than academic posts); chemistry (same); computer science (few academic posts, but so much demand in industry that companies import talent).
And it depends on which degree -- bachelor's, master's, Ph.D. The toughest road is the one stretching out in front of people with newly minted doctorates.
The engineering school at M.I.T., for example, often gets 400 applicants for every open assistant professor job, says Richard Larson, an operations research professor there. Many, he adds, are "superstellar."
One way to see what is happening is to look at a measure, called R0, used in demography to show how a population is growing. If every baby girl in a population grows up to have one baby girl on average, R0 is one, and the population size will remain constant. If R0 is significantly greater than one, the population can explode.
Dr. Larson and his colleagues calculated R0s for various science fields in academia. There, R0 is the average number of Ph.D.s that a tenure-track professor will graduate over the course of his or her career, with an R0 of one meaning each professor is replaced by one new Ph.D. The highest R0 is in environmental engineering, at 19.0. It is lower -- 6.3 -- in biological and medical sciences combined, but that still means that for every new Ph.D. who gets a tenure-track academic job, 5.3 will be shut out. In other words, Dr. Larson said, 84 percent of new Ph.D.s in biomedicine "should be pursuing other opportunities" -- jobs in industry or elsewhere, for example, that are not meant to lead to a professorship.
Biomedical sciences have been among the hardest hit. The field had an 83 percent increase in Ph.D.s between 1993 and 2013, to about 192,000 from 105,000. But although most got jobs somewhere, only about half got jobs in academia and only a quarter got tenure-track positions, which, for many, is what all that training was preparing them for.
"It used to be that the majority who got a Ph.D. in the biological sciences would go into an academic career," said Dr. Michael Lauer, deputy director for extramural research at the National Institutes of Health. "Now," he says, "that is very much the minority."
Many spend years in a holding pattern as postdocs, which are temporary positions, working for a professor and being paid from the professor's research grant. The average pay in 2016 for a beginning postdoc in the biomedical sciences is around $44,000, a figure that, adjusted for inflation, has not changed since 1998.
Why would any smart person work for so little? The goal for postdocs is to get grants of their own eventually, but the success rate for those applying has plunged.
In 2000, 32 percent of grant applications to the National Institutes of Health resulted in an award. Now it is just 18 percent. And the average age at which the lucky few actually get a grant has steadily increased -- it is now 42, up from 35 in 1980, which means biomedical scientists in academia are essentially apprentices until middle age. And the tendency is for the grants to go to scientists who already have them, making it harder and harder to break into the system.
The National Institutes of Health recently created a grant specifically for beginning scientists, but only about 20 percent of applications result in an award. Most beginning scientists face five or more years as a postdoc, which is not always conducive to original research.
"The incentive for the professor is to have the postdoc do as much work as possible so the professor can get grants," said Gary McDowell, executive director of a newly formed group, The Future of Research, that supports young scientists. "I have heard of postdocs going to orientation when a faculty member said: 'This is not a time to work on your independence. It is a time for you to work for your professor to help him succeed."'
Postdocs, he added, "are very much a form of cheap labor." But young scientists vie for the positions.
"People are desperate to work, desperate to get academic jobs," said Dr. McDowell, who had two postdoctoral positions before accepting his current job.
At the same time, the number of tenure-track academic jobs is shrinking. Some places, like M.I.T., have resisted the trend; it has had a steady number of tenured faculty -- 1,000 -- for at least 30 years. But with more people vying for those jobs when they open up and faculty members retiring later and later, competition is fierce.
But some colleges -- like the Boston University School of Medicine and Morehouse School of Medicine -- do not even offer tenure-track positions.
For those thinking of science as a career, said P. Kay Lund, director of the division of biomedical research workers at the National Institutes of Health, perhaps the best thing would be for a mentor to sit down with them and have a heart-to-heart talk, preferably when they're still undergraduates.
"A lot of the time, there is not a lot of thought about it," Dr. Lund said. "People say, 'I love science; I am great at it. I will get a Ph.D."'

Full text:   The financial media tend to report breathlessly about what the stock market did yesterday. But savvy economic analysts have always known the bond market is the place to look for a real sense of where the economy is going, or at least where the smart money thinks it is going.
And right now, if the bond market is correctly predicting the economic path ahead, we should all be terrified.
But, please, read on before panicking. There's a lot more to the story.
The stock market can rise and fall for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes for no apparent reason at all. But the bond market, where trillions of dollars change hands and long-term interest rates are determined, is steadier (normally). Its prices are generally tied closely to the outlook for growth and inflation over the years ahead.
The long-term interest rates that currently prevail across all the major advanced economies are consistent with a disastrous economic future. Taken at face value, they imply that the smart money expects inflation will remain extraordinarily low for years to come, and that growth will stay so weak that central banks won't be able to raise rates for years. It is a shift that has accelerated since Britain's vote on June 23 to leave the European Union, but one that has been underway for years.
Look at the current shape of the American "yield curve," the chart of how rates compare for short, medium and long-term bonds. It implies a 60 percent chance of a recession in the next year based on historical patterns, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. Long-term interest rates hit record lows last week -- which is to say the lowest in the 227-year history of the United States.
Prices for inflation-protected bonds suggest that consumer prices will rise only about 1.4 percent a year through 2021 -- and only 1.5 percent in the five years after that. They suggest that not only is the Federal Reserve unlikely to find conditions that warrant an interest rate increase in the remainder of 2016, but also that there is only about a 50 percent chance of a rate increase in 2017.
Across other major advanced economies, the signals sent by bond prices are even worse. Ten-year bonds are now offering negative interest rates in Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Denmark and, as of Friday's close, the Netherlands. That means buyers of these securities will get fewer euros, yen, Swiss francs or Danish kroner back than they invested, a development without precedent in hundreds of years of financial history.
But that phrase "taken at face value" is doing some heavy lifting here. There are reasons to think that current prices are reflecting idiosyncrasies in the supply and demand for safe assets, rather than a conviction among global investors that very bad times are ahead.
Many of the purchasers of government bonds do so not because they find the returns offered compelling but because they have to. Insurers face regulators who may require that they do so. Pension funds seek to offset long-term obligations with safe assets of similar duration. Banks buy bonds to comply with rules limiting how much risk they can take.
In the last few years, central banks have become the biggest buyers of bonds. The Federal Reserve's program of quantitative easing -- buying bonds to try to stimulate the economy -- ended in 2014, but the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are just getting going; the E.C.B. is buying 80 billion euros' worth of securities a month.
So you have a strong demand for bonds coming from institutions that are willing to buy at almost any cost -- they are inelastic, in economic terms.
Then on the supply side, governments have not exactly been issuing vast supplies of new bonds, for reasons involving anti-deficit domestic politics. The value of outstanding German general government debt was $1.8 trillion at the end of 2015, for example, down from $2 trillion a year earlier.
Whatever you think of the wisdom of using government deficits to try to prop up a faltering economy, governments for the most part simply are not responding to very low interest rates and depressed economies by radically increasing deficit spending and thus increasing the supply of bonds.
So rising demand for bonds that is largely indifferent to price (even a willingness to buy the bonds at a certain loss) along with pretty much fixed supply combines to drive up prices, which in the bond market means driving down rates.
And even though the United States isn't the prime driver of this -- the Fed has ended its Q.E. program, and American debt outstanding continues to rise -- the bond market is sufficiently global that it's an important part of the story.
When German and Japanese bonds are offering negative returns, the 2 percent or so that United States Treasury bonds were offering earlier this year looked extremely attractive. Essentially the United States has imported this very low interest rate environment from overseas, even though the domestic economy is in pretty good shape and the Federal Reserve had been planning interest rate increases.
So even though in normal times bond prices give useful information about the likely path of inflation and growth, this might be an instance when those indicators are less useful.
Among the evidence that the recessionary signals out of the bond market are wrong? If bond prices are an unreliable yardstick, we can look to other markets that may be flawed, but are at least flawed in different ways.
And those other markets are not flashing recession warnings at all: The United States stock market closed on Monday at a record high; indexes of future stock market volatility are quite low; and oil prices, after a furious rally since the winter, have mostly held onto their gains.
So how much of the drop in interest rates can we really pin on these supply-and-demand factors in the market for bonds, as opposed to a genuine shift in investors' expectations about the future? Roberto Perli, an economist at Cornerstone Macro, has tried to disentangle the parts of the puzzle.
He estimates that about three-quarters of the drop in American Treasury yields since the start of the year is because of a decline in the "term premium," or the compensation investors demand for tying up their money over many years. This is largely attributable to those supply-and-demand factors. He attributes about one-eighth of the drop to investors' perception that the Fed will raise rates more slowly for any given economic circumstance than they had assumed at the start of the year.
He attributes only one-eighth of the drop to an actual belief among bond buyers that the economy will grow more slowly in the years ahead than they had thought at the start of 2016.
There is good news in that as well as bad. The good news is that most of the drop in long-term interest rates is being driven by things that have little to do with the underlying strength of economic growth. The bad news is that some portion of the drop really is being driven by more pessimistic economic views, at a time a great deal of pessimism is already baked in.
The bond market right now is like a speedometer that is miscalibrated and therefore unreliable. It may be less useful than usual, and is not to be interpreted literally -- but it's still telling us something. And that something is that we should be worried about the possibility the world is in a nasty deflationary economic trap that won't get better anytime soon.

Full text:   Running Britain right now is not unlike steering a battered corporation.
Dazed leaders are trying to convince stakeholders that a big hit is not a knockout blow -- and may in fact be an opportunity. That was the message of George Osborne, Britain's chancellor, in the opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal. "Britain may be leaving the E.U., but we are not withdrawing from the world," he wrote this week before starting a tour of Wall Street to reassure investors. "Britain will be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to that world than ever."
Theresa May, who is poised to become Britain's next prime minister, on Monday offered a similar message. "Brexit means Brexit. And we're going to make a success of it," she said in a speech, using the term for Britain exiting the European Union.
Yet a country cannot just leave a large free-trade area that absorbs over 40 percent of its exports -- and plays a large role in attracting foreign investment -- without suffering significant economic pain.
The pervasive uncertainty is most likely causing people and companies to pull back on their spending. As a result, some economists are now expecting a recession to hit Britain. Also, the pound has slumped against the dollar and the euro. Though a weaker currency may help British exports, by making British goods cheaper in terms of other currencies, it could also damage the country's economy by making imports more expensive and pushing up the overall inflation rate.
There are signs that investors are not expecting the worst.
The FTSE 100 index, a benchmark that measures the stock price of large British companies, is up 6.7 percent since the day before the Brexit vote on June 23. The FTSE 250, which analysts say contains more companies that would be hurt by Brexit, plunged after the referendum, but after something of a recovery, it is now only 2 percent below its level on the day before the vote. Of course, the weakened pound makes the performance of these benchmarks worse in dollar terms.
British government bonds have rallied in recent days, allowing the government to borrow at a lower cost. This could make it easier for the government to spend money to offset some of the negative impacts of leaving the European Union.
But many things could smash whatever optimism exists in the markets.
The biggest challenge to Britain is what happens with its trade with the European Union. Ideally, the country would continue to access the European single market on current advantageous terms. But Europe's leaders have said that, to have those terms, Britain must accept the free movement of European Union citizens into Britain. Since concern about immigration led many voters to vote for Brexit, the British government is unlikely to accept that condition. As a result, Britain will be left trying to negotiate a new trade deal with Europe, which is most unlikely to grant the country the same terms as it grants its members.
Britain's exports could get hammered as a result. A falloff in investment could also occur. An American company wanting to make and sell its products in Europe might avoid Britain and build a factory in Spain or Germany instead.
But it is hard to assess the damage that could be caused. Companies do not invest in countries solely on the basis of whether they get access to certain markets. They may, for instance, prefer Britain because they perceive the country to have looser labor laws than other European countries, or a more reliable legal system.
The British government can also try to introduce changes to make Britain more attractive to outside investment. One approach is to reduce corporate tax rates, a move that Mr. Osborne, who had campaigned against leaving the European Union and who may soon leave office, suggested in his article. But this could anger governments of other countries, including the United States, that want to stop companies moving abroad to lower their tax bills.
Still, it would be hard for European countries to take a punitive stance on trade against Britain. International trade agreements limit many tariffs.
And, crucially, it may not be possible to shut British financial firms out of European business. Take the financial regulations that are to be introduced in 2018. Under these, non-European Union banks that operate under regulations that are considered equivalent to those of the European Union can do business in the bloc. Lawyers caution that this arrangement does not grant the same automatic access as Europe's so-called banking passports, and they add that future disagreements between Britain and the European Union might lead the bloc to deny Britain equivalence.
Still, they say that it is possible that London-based banks will end up providing more or less the same services as they do today. "That is the Utopian position, and if you asked me if we'll be there in five years, I think we will be," said Jake Green, a partner at Ashurst, a law firm. "But there will be so much uncertainty."
That uncertainty will no doubt increase when trade talks actually begin between Britain and the European Union. The British prime minister may also have to contend with the possibility that Scotland, which voted against Brexit, may have another referendum on whether it should leave the United Kingdom. And a deep or long-lasting recession could sap support for Ms. May, leading to more political volatility. "In the coming weeks, I will set out my plans to take our economy through this period of uncertainty," she said in her speech on Monday.
But weeks may be too long for the markets to wait.

Abstract: If anything, developments in the real economies of the advanced world are telling us that interest rates aren't low enough -- that is, while low rates may be having their usual effects of boosting the housing sector and, to some extent, the stock market, those effects aren't big enough to produce a strong recovery.

Full text:   What with everything else going on, from Trump to Brexit to the horror in Dallas, it's hard to focus on developments in financial markets -- especially because we're not facing any immediate crisis. But extraordinary things have been happening lately, especially in bond markets. And because money still makes the world go 'round, attention must be paid to what the markets are trying to tell us.
Specifically, there has been an extraordinary plunge in long-term interest rates. Late last year the yield on 10-year U.S. government bonds was around 2.3 percent, already historically low; on Friday it was just 1.36 percent. German bonds, the safe asset of the eurozone, are yielding minus -- that's right, minus -- 0.19 percent. Basically, investors are willing to offer governments money for nothing, or less than nothing. What does it mean?
Some commentators blame the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, accusing them of engineering "artificially low" interest rates that encourage speculation and distort the economy. These are, by the way, largely the same people who used to predict that budget deficits would cause interest rates to soar. In any case, however, it's important to understand that they're not making sense.
For what does "artificially low" mean in this context? Compared to what? Historically, the consequence of excessively easy money -- the way you know that money is too easy -- has been out-of-control inflation. That's not happening in America, where inflation is still below the Fed's target, and it's definitely not happening in Europe, where the central bank has been trying to raise inflation, without success.
If anything, developments in the real economies of the advanced world are telling us that interest rates aren't low enough -- that is, while low rates may be having their usual effects of boosting the housing sector and, to some extent, the stock market, those effects aren't big enough to produce a strong recovery. But why?
In some past episodes of very low government borrowing costs, the story has been one of a flight to safety: investors piling into U.S. or German bonds because they're afraid to buy riskier assets. But there's little sign of such a fear-driven process now. The premiums on risky corporate bonds, which soared during the 2008 financial crisis, have stayed fairly low. European bond spreads, like the difference between Italian and German interest rates, have also stayed low. And stock prices have been hitting new highs.
By the way, the financial fallout from Britain's vote to leave the European Union looks fairly limited, at least so far. The pound is down, and investors have been pulling money from funds that invest in the London property market. But British stocks are up, and there's nothing like the kind of panic some pre-referendum rhetoric seemed to predict. All that seems to have happened is an intensification of the trend toward ever-lower interest rates.
So what's going on? I think of it as the Great Capitulation.
A number of economists -- most famously Larry Summers, but also yours truly and others -- have been warning for a while that the whole world may be turning Japanese. That is, it looks as if weak demand and a bias toward deflation are enduring problems. Until recently, however, investors acted as if they still expected a return to what we used to consider normal conditions. Now they've thrown in the towel, in effect conceding that persistent weakness is the new normal. This means low short-term interest rates for a very long time, and low long-term rates right away.
Many people don't like what's happening, but raising rates in the face of weak economies would be an act of folly that might well push us back into recession.
What policy makers should be doing, instead, is accepting the markets' offer of incredibly cheap financing. Investors are willing to pay the German government to take their money; the U.S. situation is less extreme, but even here interest rates adjusted for inflation are negative.
Meanwhile, there are huge unmet demands for public investment on both sides of the Atlantic. America's aging infrastructure is legendary, but not unique: years of austerity have left German roads and railways in worse shape than most people realize. So why not borrow money at these low, low rates and do some much-needed repair and renovation? This would be eminently worth doing even if it wouldn't also create jobs, but it would do that too.
I know, deficit scolds would issue dire warnings about the evils of public debt. But they have been wrong about everything for at least the past eight years, and it's time to stop taking them seriously.
They say that money talks; well, cheap money is speaking very clearly right now, and it's telling us to invest in our future.

Abstract: The Monetary Policy Committee has left its benchmark rate steady at 0.5 percent since March 2009, but Mark Carney, the bank's governor, said recently that the bank may be forced to cut the rate this summer as it grapples with economic uncertainty created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Bank shares have been hit hard since Britain's referendum vote last month, and investors fear that market turmoil and prospects for a deeper economic slowdown in Europe will affect American banks.

Another round of trans-Atlantic trade talks.
Negotiators from the United States and the European Union will increase their efforts to agree on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership this week in Brussels. The two sides have held 13 previous rounds of trade talks since President Obama announced the initiative in early 2013, but they have struggled to reach agreement in a number of crucial areas like agriculture and financial services. There is strong opposition to an agreement in Germany and Austria, among other nations, where critics warn that a deal would hand more power to corporations and hobble health and environmental protections. Proponents say a deal would strengthen trans-Atlantic economies and help Europe and the United States set standards the rest of the world could follow. James Kanter
PLANE MANUFACTURING
International air show to feature the F-35 fighter jet.
The Farnborough International Airshow, which begins on Monday in Farnborough, England, and runs through Sunday, will showcase planes from various manufacturers, including Boeing's new 737 Max. Boeing is also hosting a special pavilion commemorating its centennial. The much-delayed F-35 fighter jet, America's cutting-edge warplane, is also expected to make an appearance. The public show takes place on Saturday and Sunday, and will feature drone races and flight displays that include many generations of aircraft -- like World War I fighters and the Airbus A380 passenger plane -- and even wing walkers. A full schedule of events and exhibits is available on the show's website. Zach Wichter
BUDGETS
E.U. finance ministers to discuss missed deficit targets.
The European Union's determination to enforce its budget rules is expected to be the focus of a meeting of finance ministers on Tuesday. Spain and Portugal have repeatedly failed to rein in their deficits, according to European regulators. If ministers support that finding on Tuesday, the regulators would have leeway to take the step of imposing fines as high as 0.2 percent of gross domestic product. Spain and Portugal could still wriggle off the hook or receive only a symbolic fine. France has won leniency in the past, and regulators are wary of imposing punishments on austerity-weary countries, like Spain and Portugal, because that could add to the unpopularity of the European Union. James Kanter
ECONOMY
As pound sinks, Bank of England to report rate decision.
The Bank of England on Thursday will announce its monthly decision on a crucial interest rate. The Monetary Policy Committee has left its benchmark rate steady at 0.5 percent since March 2009, but Mark Carney, the bank's governor, said recently that the bank may be forced to cut the rate this summer as it grapples with economic uncertainty created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Without prejudging what the committee might do, Mr. Carney said on June 30 that he believed that "the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer." As the pound has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in three decades, some analysts have said the committee could move as soon as this coming week to cut rates to 0.25 percent. But a rate cut is seen as more likely in August, when the central bank is expected to announce its updated forecast for inflation. Chad Bray
EARNINGS
Bank earnings season to begin with JPMorgan Chase.
JPMorgan Chase will kick off bank earnings season when it reports second-quarter results on Thursday morning. Wells Fargo and Citigroup report on Friday. Investors will be listening for what top bank executives say about the impact of Britain's decision to leave the European Union on their businesses. Bank shares have been hit hard since Britain's referendum vote last month, and investors fear that market turmoil and prospects for a deeper economic slowdown in Europe will affect American banks. Michael Corkery
ECONOMY
China expected to report drop in gross domestic product.
China is expected on Friday to report that its economic growth has continued to slow in the most recent quarter. China's increase in gross domestic product probably slowed further from the first quarter, when it expanded 6.7 percent compared with a year earlier. The country's economy is being bogged down by weak global demand for its exports and a deep industrial slowdown at home. The government has tried to stem the decline by pumping huge amounts of new credit into the economy and directing the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars in new lending to projects like rails, roads and other infrastructure, but growth continues to slow despite this spending increase.

Full text:   This summer, Venezuela was poised to assume the rotating presidency of Mercosur, a trade bloc that includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. But at the urging of Paraguay, Mercosur heads of state are considering blocking Venezuela, at least temporarily, citing the erosion of democracy there.
This shows that neighboring countries are starting to take a harder line against Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, whose authoritarian and reckless policies have plunged his country into economic and political crisis. It follows a hearing last month at the Organization of American States in Washington during which Secretary General Luis Almagro criticized Mr. Maduro for using the courts, which he packed with allies, to thwart the opposition-controlled parliament and for arbitrarily detaining political prisoners.
Democratic governance is a requirement for Mercosur membership. The bloc briefly suspended Paraguay in 2012 over the impeachment of President Fernando Lugo by its Congress, which some regional leaders saw as a coup. Paraguay now argues, with good reason, that Venezuela's disregard for democratic principles cannot go unaddressed.
"You can be elected democratically but lose legitimacy over time through your actions," Eladio Loizaga Caballero, the foreign minister of Paraguay, said in an interview. "We can't condone any action that silences dissident voices through judicial processes" that are unfair.
The growing international condemnation of Mr. Maduro's government comes as opposition politicians are seeking to hold a referendum this year that could cut his term short. The president appears determined to block the referendum from taking place. Instead of seeking to find common ground with the opposition to address soaring inflation and rising poverty, Mr. Maduro outrageously suggested late last month that he might dissolve the National Assembly.
"What have they accomplished in six months?" Mr. Maduro asked in a televised address, referring to lawmakers elected in December. "Destruction. National Assembly, get ready to say goodbye to history because your time is up."
Meanwhile, authorities in Venezuela have indefinitely postponed an appeals hearing for Leopoldo López, the nation's most prominent political prisoner, who is serving a 14-year sentence on bogus charges.
While Mr. Maduro has dismissed his critics from abroad, saying they are part of a right-wing conspiracy, he is clearly concerned about his government's growing pariah status. He recently expressed a desire to improve relations with the United States, which has been his go-to scapegoat.
It's uncertain that strong and sustained international pressure on Mr. Maduro will make him more responsible and conciliatory. But it could galvanize Venezuelans who are struggling to attain peaceful change.
The leaders of Mercosur and allied governments can call on Mr. Maduro to take basic steps to avoid further international scorn. These steps might include the immediate release of all political prisoners, allowing the referendum to take place this year and permitting the delivery of humanitarian aid in areas afflicted by shortages of food and medicine. A firm, principled position would benefit the entire hemisphere.

Full text:   The job market is fine.
That's the most important single idea to take out of the June employment report published Friday morning. A month ago it looked as if there might well be an economic slowdown underway to add to the mix of a polarizing presidential election, geopolitical turbulence and violence.
The good news is that doesn't appear to be the case. The blockbuster 287,000 jobs the Labor Department reported employers added in June surely overstates the pace of improvement, just as surely as the miserable 11,000 jobs reported to have been added in May understated it. (The May number was originally reported as an almost-as-miserable 38,000.) A Verizon strike contributed to the seesaw, but most of it is probably driven by a mix of sampling error and the sometimes weird effects of seasonal adjustment.
So as a starting point to gauge how the economy is actually doing, we can average the two months. The 149,000 jobs added per month is consistent with many other signs we see, such as steadily positive readings on surveys of businesses about their growth and hiring intentions. It is, however, a step down from the speedier job growth in the recent past. In 2015 the economy added an average of 229,000 jobs a month.
Still, in some ways that slower pace of job creation is utterly foreseeable, and not even necessarily bad news. After the 2008 recession, employers could add jobs almost as rapidly as they wished, because so many unemployed people were waiting on the sidelines of the job market available to be hired.
With the unemployment rate now below 5 percent, it was inevitable that the pace of job growth would slow to something in the ballpark of 100,000 jobs a month. It shouldn't be surprising, or cause for alarm, that that's exactly what's happening in 2016.
But the payroll numbers that get the most attention are only a piece of the story. What do the other data buried in the 39-page report tell us about how the economy is doing as we push toward Election Day?
There, the news is mixed. The unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent for a combination of good and bad reasons. The good news is that the labor force rose by 414,000 people, partly reversing a negative trend from the previous two months. If it continues, that would be a sign that higher wages and steady job growth are coaxing people to work. The bad news is that most of those people didn't find work; the number of people unemployed rose by 347,000.
Translation: More Americans said they wanted work, but couldn't find it. But that is in many ways better than indications that they don't even want work. It suggests that over time they will find jobs and provide a lift to incomes and economic growth, even if they were still on the sidelines in June.
Similarly mixed: Average hourly wages rose only 0.1 percent in June, below the 0.2 percent analysts had forecast. But those numbers are jumpy, and the 2.6 percent rise in hourly earnings over the last year does imply a rising standard of living in this time of very low inflation.
So halfway through 2016, where are we? The economy continues to grow and the job market continues to improve -- not at the blockbuster pace that the June payrolls number might imply, but at a steady rate that is likely to put Americans to work and deliver higher wages over time. The fear that the May numbers induced should subside for now.
These numbers are for a period that predates Britain's vote to exit the European Union, but that, too, is likely to have only indirect effects on America's economy (through global financial markets, for example).
The job market is what we thought it was: not great. Not awful. Fine.

Abstract: (All spending figures are adjusted for inflation.) For some, the reductions are dramatic. Since 2003, the National Institutes of Health, which supports critical research into diseases ranging from cancer to AIDS, have seen their funding fall by 23 percent, forcing an 8 percent reduction in grants to researchers even as applications were rising by 50 percent.

Full text:   WE'VE all seen the long summer lines at airport security checkpoints full of angry travelers. But many of us haven't heard the real reason: funding for the Transportation Security Administration has been sliced by 8.5 percent over the past five years, leading to a 5.5 percent drop in the number of screeners. At the same time, the number of travelers has increased by more than 15 percent.
Sure, inept management at the T.S.A. made matters worse. But few labor-intensive businesses can successfully process increasing numbers of customers with a smaller work force.
The delays put a frustrated face on more than three years of misguided spending cuts imposed by Congress in its fervor to slash the federal deficit. Most of the real-life consequences of the trims -- which proponents argued would eliminate only fat, not muscle -- aren't as obvious. But they will also be painful.
This year, discretionary spending -- which encompasses airport security, infrastructure, education, research and development and much more -- will be lower than it was in 2005. (All spending figures are adjusted for inflation.)
For some, the reductions are dramatic. Since 2003, the National Institutes of Health, which supports critical research into diseases ranging from cancer to AIDS, have seen their funding fall by 23 percent, forcing an 8 percent reduction in grants to researchers even as applications were rising by 50 percent.
In the last decade, inflation-adjusted spending on all education has fallen by 11 percent, including more significant cuts in grants for K-12 programs and to school districts serving low-income students.
Since 2010, the Internal Revenue Service's budget has been slashed by about 18 percent, even as the I.R.S. was given new duties in connection with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The result: The enforcement staff has shrunk by 23 percent, leading to a similar reduction in the number of audits.
And fewer audits have meant additional uncollected taxes, estimated at $14 billion over the past two years. Furthermore, almost a million pieces of correspondence from taxpayers await replies.
Then there's the Environmental Protection Agency, whose budget has been cut by an enormous 27 percent -- about $3 billion since 2010. As a result, over the same period the agency had to eliminate more than 2,000 workers, bringing its staffing to the lowest level since 1989. More problems like the poisoned water in Flint, Mich., are easy to imagine.
Yes, we needed to bring the deficit down. And yes, we still face terrifyingly large obligations in years to come as baby boomers retire and expect to receive Social Security and Medicare benefits. But no, we shouldn't have gone about trying to restore fiscal order by taking a meat ax to some of Washington's most important outlays.
Beginning last fall, sensible members of both parties on Capitol Hill recognized that these important areas needed bolstering, so $80 billion in new discretionary spending was authorized for the next two years.
But even with that increase and a similar one in December 2013, total spending on these programs will rise by barely the inflation rate between 2014 and 2017. (Happily, the N.I.H. and the I.R.S. will see modestly larger increases.)
Then, by sliding extra money to the military and Medicare, Congress nearly doubled the cost of the $80 billion deal to $154 billion while choosing to counterbalance only about half the tab with legitimate savings.
According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the remainder either wasn't paid for at all ($56 billion) or was offset with phony cuts ($20 billion), like changing pension accounting to front-load corporate taxes.
A few months later, Congress went one step further and retroactively extended a raft of expired tax provisions -- many of them egregious giveaways like accelerated depreciation for companies -- without even a pretense of paying for them. As a result of the fiddling and fudging, the projected 2017 deficit rose to $561 billion, from the $416 billion that was estimated just six months earlier.
I'm not under any illusion that Congress will make tough decisions in a tumultuous election year. But at the least, Republicans need to stop using the back door of appropriations to take particular aim at agencies whose mission they question (the I.R.S. and the E.P.A.) and those whose functions they erroneously believe could be privatized (the T.S.A.).
In our zeal to bring down the deficit, we have gone about it in exactly the wrong way. Adopting a sensible fiscal policy that eliminates corporate loopholes instead of extending them and focusing on restructuring Social Security and Medicare instead of starving discretionary spending should be our highest priorities. Something to think about while you're waiting in line.

Full text:   DENVER -- William L. Armstrong, a Colorado news media executive who became a strong conservative voice in the United States Senate, died on Tuesday. He was 79.
Colorado Christian University, of which he was the president, announced his death but did not say where he died. He had been treated for cancer for five years.
Mr. Armstrong was first elected to the Senate in 1978 and served two terms, focusing mostly on economic issues. He sponsored an amendment to a 1981 tax bill that indexed federal income tax brackets to compensate for inflation.
In 1981, he led conservative opposition to President Ronald Reagan's proposed budget, contending that the administration was not doing enough to cut long-term federal deficits. The move forced the administration to come up with a compromise.
Two years later, as a member of a commission appointed by Reagan to devise a plan to solve Social Security's financial problems, Mr. Armstrong said the proposed solutions were focusing too much on raising Social Security taxes and not enough on cutting future benefits. His proposal to raise the retirement age for Social Security recipients was not adopted.
He was also a sponsor of a proposed constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget.
Mr. Armstrong's career in elected office began in 1962 when he won a seat in the Colorado Legislature. He eventually became majority leader of the State Senate.
In 1972 he moved to the United States House of Representatives, winning election to a newly created seat in the eastern suburbs of Denver. He was easily re-elected twice.
In 1978, Mr. Armstrong decided to run for the Senate seat held by a Democrat, Floyd Haskell. After an easy primary victory, he defeated Mr. Haskell in the general election with 59 percent of the vote. He was re-elected in 1984 in another comfortable victory over a Democratic opponent and retired from the Senate in 1991.
William Lester Armstrong was born in Fremont, Neb., on March 16, 1937. He attended high school in Lincoln, Neb., and later went to Tulane University in New Orleans and the University of Minnesota, though he did not earn a degree. He served in the Army National Guard from 1957 to 1963.
He started working at radio stations in Nebraska at a young age. At 22, he bought a radio station on the outskirts of Denver, KOSI-AM, beginning a career that made him wealthy.
Mr. Armstrong was later the president of KEZW in Denver and the president of the Ambassador Media Corporation, which owned television stations in Pocatello and Twin Falls, Idaho, and Jackson, Wyo. He was also the president of the Colorado Springs newspaper The Sun.
Mr. Armstrong married Ellen M. Eaton in 1962, and she survives him.
In the 1970s, he had what he called a "conversion experience," which he said made him a more committed Christian and more tolerant of other people's opinions.
His business career included the chairmanship of three mortgage companies and of the Denver-based Oppenheimer Funds mutual funds group.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Armstrong is survived by a daughter, Anne; a son, Wil; and eight grandchildren, according to the university.

Abstract: [...]it highlights troubling questions about affordability and access, much of the impetus behind the announcement by Hillary Clinton on Wednesday that she was embracing a large part of Bernie Sanders's proposal to provide free tuition at in-state public colleges. Since the 2008 recession, states have reduced spending on public higher education by 17 percent, while tuition has risen by 33 percent, according to a recent report by the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. According to the College Board, the average cost of attending a four-year public university, including room and board, increased from $11,655 in 2000 to $19,548 in 2015, in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Full text:   SACRAMENTO -- Over three generations, the Michael family forged a deep bond with the University of California, dating back nearly 50 years to when Jay Dee Michael Sr. was the university system's vice president and chief lobbyist.
Family members proudly displayed degrees from the campuses in Los Angeles, Davis, Berkeley and Santa Barbara. And when Mr. Michael died last year, his family asked that memorial donations go to a U.C. Davis institute. Recently, though, the relationship has soured, a victim of the economic forces buffeting public universities.
Jay Dee Michael Jr. said he might never feel the same again after his son was rejected from several U.C. campuses.
"I have blue and gold running through my blood," Mr. Michael told a State Assembly hearing here in March. "But I can tell you that when I get calls now from U.C. Davis, as an alum, I'm not giving a dime."
A state audit in March reinforced what many California parents already suspected: On a constant hunt for more revenue, the prestigious University of California system gave favorable admissions treatment to thousands of higher-paying out-of-state and foreign students, to the detriment of Californians.
As a result, admissions to the system have become a bipartisan political issue in California, where the Legislature recently moved to link university funding to enrolling additional California residents.
But at its core, the discontent in California, which is also developing in other states, reflects a broader, fundamental breakdown in the traditional operation of the public university. And it highlights troubling questions about affordability and access, much of the impetus behind the announcement by Hillary Clinton on Wednesday that she was embracing a large part of Bernie Sanders's proposal to provide free tuition at in-state public colleges.
Since the 2008 recession, states have reduced spending on public higher education by 17 percent, while tuition has risen by 33 percent, according to a recent report by the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
The University of California system relied on state money for almost a quarter of its budget as recently as 2002, according to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Now, that figure is 9 percent, after $1 billion in cuts.
Students who once could afford high-quality educations at their state public universities now pay nearly twice what they used to pay, part of the driving force behind a $1.27 trillion student debt bill.
According to the College Board, the average cost of attending a four-year public university, including room and board, increased from $11,655 in 2000 to $19,548 in 2015, in inflation-adjusted dollars. In the City University of New York system, tuition at four-year colleges is now $6,330, having increased by $300 each year since 2011, when it was $4,830.
Mrs. Clinton's proposal -- which would use federal funds to make in-state public tuition free for students with family incomes of up to $125,000 -- would also require states to pay matching dollars. Public higher education advocates generally agree that a federal effort to reverse the long disinvestment by states is overdue.
"What Sanders figured out -- it's not the $65,000 cost of attendance at some of our pricier privates driving the debt bubble, but rather the disinvestment and privatization of public higher ed," said Barmak Nassirian, the director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of State Colleges and Univerities.
For more than a century, the public university has been viewed as the proverbial ticket to the American dream, assuring a pathway to better jobs and a more comfortable lifestyle for generation after generation. With generous state subsidies, the public university operated on the idea that even a poor or middle-class student could acquire a world-class education.
That egalitarian notion was expressed in Michigan through the phrase "an uncommon education for the common man," coined by the university's former president, James B. Angell. In Wisconsin, the university's former president, Charles Van Hise, declared that he would "never be content until the beneficent influence of the university reaches every family in the state." That became known as the Wisconsin Idea.
Funding cuts have also changed the demographic makeup of the public universities as they seek revenues from outside the state, admitting more and more out-of-state and foreign students. In California, even Mrs. Clinton weighed in.
"We have got to get back to using public colleges and universities for what they were intended," Mrs. Clinton said during a California campaign stop. "If it is in California, for the children in California. If it is in New York, for the children in New York."
In California, nonresident enrollment has been about 15.5 percent on U.C. campuses over all, but as high as 29 percent at the marquee Berkeley. Yet California's out-of-state enrollment is low compared with flagship universities in a number of other states. On Monday, Berkeley announced that it had offered admission to 14,400 high school students for this fall, including 1,000 more California residents than last year.
Defending her university system after the audit's release in March, President Janet Napolitano wrote that because of budget cuts, nearly every state in the nation had been forced to make a "Hobson's choice, and they all have reached the same decision: Open doors to out-of-state students to keep the doors open for in-state students."
Ms. Napolitano reeled off a list of more than a dozen big public universities whose out-of-state enrollment exceeds California's. Some, like the University of Alabama, where the student body of 37,000 is more than 50 percent nonresident, have resorted to aggressive marketing aimed at luring out-of-staters, including distributing million of dollars in merit aid to nonresidents, much of it to high-achieving students from affluent families, not only improving its bottom line but also raising average test scores, metrics used by commercial ratings groups to rank colleges.
But it is a ratings and financial game, some worry, that means university student bodies will increasingly become alienated from their state's population.
"It seems like all the incentives are going after wealthy students and leaving the low-income students in the dust," said Stephen Burd, a senior policy analyst with the New America Foundation who has studied the increased use of merit aid to attract nonresident students.
A soon-to-be-published study found that as out-of-state enrollment increases, universities admit fewer minority and low-income students.
"When you grow the share of out-of-state students, you're making the student body richer, more white and Asian and less black and Latino," said one of the study's co-authors, Ozan Jaquette, an assistant professor of education at U.C.L.A.
Enticements for the Rich
William Deary, who has made a fortune in the home health care business in Jackson, Mich., put himself through Michigan State by working nights in a door factory, making $28 an hour. Since then, high-paying hourly jobs have disappeared in Michigan, but tuition at Michigan State has risen sharply, Mr. Deary said, so much so that the university has become out of reach for many students.
It is part of the impetus for his first political campaign -- for Michigan State's board. He is also concerned that out-of-state and foreign students are squeezing out Michiganders.
"Our sons and daughters should come first," Mr. Deary's campaign literature urges.
Michigan State's enrollment of about 50,000 includes 7,568 international students, placing it in the top 10 colleges for foreign student enrollment.
At the nearby University of Michigan, the student body of 43,625 is nearly 37 percent out-of-staters and nearly 14 percent international students. The New York Times reported in 2004 that more freshmen at the Ann Arbor campus came from families with annual income of $200,000 or more than from families with less than the median national income of $53,000.
The university has pointed out that its admissions rate for Michigan students is higher than for out-of-staters.
In Massachusetts, out-of-state enrollment has increased by nearly 85 percent at University of Massachusetts campuses since 2008, while in-state enrollment grew by only 19 percent, said a recent critical report by the Pioneer Institute, a Massachusetts think tank. UMass officials responded denying that in-state students had been adversely affected.
At the University of Wisconsin's flagship campus in Madison, officials last fall lifted a cap on the enrollment of out-of-staters. The Wisconsin student newspaper, The Badger Herald, predicted that the university would transform into a bourgeois playground for wealthy Chicagoans, who can afford the luxury private dormitories near campus.
The newest offering, Hub Madison, offers amenities including a rooftop swimming pool, sauna, a golf simulator, arcade games and billiards tables.
"Rich kids value amenities -- luxury recreation facilities and luxury dorms," said Mr. Jaquette, of U.C.L.A. "These are the things that resident students or first-generation students don't care about."
Among concerns voiced by Mr. Jaquette, Mr. Burd and other experts is that public university campuses, often among the more elite settings in states, will become even more alienated from their state population as a whole.
'Shifting the Culture'
Elliot Spillers, from Pelham, Ala., was student body president at the University of Alabama last year -- the first black student in 40 years to have held that position. He said he doubted he would have been elected if the student body, which is mostly white, had been homegrown. The university's enrollment is now more than half out-of-staters.
"It's definitely shifting the culture here on campus, which is a positive thing," Mr. Spillers said, echoing the views of many students.
Others see a less positive side to the change.
Of the out-of-state undergraduates at Alabama's Tuscaloosa campus, more than 3,000 receive merit aid in the form of free or discounted tuition -- an average of $19,000 per student. In 2015, the university gave $100 million in merit aid.
Mr. Burd, of the New America Foundation, wonders if that money could be better used to help needy students, particularly in a state with a poverty rate among the highest in the country. In essence, he said, some colleges have adopted the enrollment tactics of private colleges to increase revenues and enhance prestige.
Devin Thompson of St. Paul, Minn., had a near-perfect SAT score and realized he could save $200,000 over four years by not attending a private college in Virgina and instead accepting the free tuition offered by Alabama, automatic to anyone with his record. The son of college professors, he will be attending this fall.
By enrolling Mr. Thompson, Alabama will elevate its average SAT score, one of the metrics used in the U.S. News and World Report rankings. That, in turn, education experts say, will attract other affluent students, many of whom will get smaller merit packages from Alabama -- just enough to make the college enticing compared with its peers.
Meanwhile, the number of entering freshmen from Alabama high schools has declined steadily, from 3,122 in 2009 to 2,458 in 2015, records show. University officials say the acceptance rate for those students -- 63 percent -- has remained the same.
About half a mile away and just across the railroad tracks from the University of Alabama's manicured campus sits the mostly black Central High School.
Few Central High students attend the University of Alabama. Ernestine Tucker, a Tuscaloosa school board member, wonders whether the university is working hard enough to recruit them.
"You would think their first priority would be the local students," Ms. Tucker said.
Mr. Michael, whose son attends the University of Washington, was one of thousands of California residents who complained about admissions practices at U.C. From 2010 to 2014, the number of California residents enrolled declined by 1 percent, or 2,200 students, while nonresidents increased by 82 percent, or 18,000 students, the audit found. In 2015, nonresident students paid $37,000, compared with $12,240 for in-state.
"Over the past several years, the university has failed to put the needs of residents first," the audit said.
One of those residents was Priyanka Krishnamurthi, a math wiz from Saratoga with a near-perfect SAT score. She ended up at Yale after being turned down by her desired program at Berkeley.
In debating a bill in June over enrollment at the University of California, Assemblywoman Cheryl Brown told colleagues about her granddaughter, who recently graduated from high school in Sacramento, but did not bother to apply to U.C. schools. That is because a college admissions adviser told her she would be a good candidate only if she were from out of state.
To Mr. Michael's way of thinking, when it came to his son, the University of California had reneged on an unwritten contract.
"In my case, three generations of Michaels have supported and funding the U.C., and the same is true for my wife's family," he said. "And then, when it comes time for our children to go, there's no room."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve did not raise its benchmark interest rate in June because officials worried that economic growth might be flagging, according to an official account published on Wednesday.
And that was before Britain upset financial markets by voting to leave the European Union.
The June meeting, and the fallout from the so-called Brexit vote, continued what has become a familiar pattern: The Fed entered the year predicting stronger growth and a gradual return to higher interest rates. It has beat a slow retreat from both predictions as the data has disappointed its expectations.
"This is not an economy that is running hot," Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor who advocated patience, said on Wednesday. He added that it would take time to assess the impact of Britain's exit from the European Union on the American economy.
Financial markets are now betting heavily that the Fed will not raise rates again before 2017. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond has fallen below 1.4 percent, the lowest level in history.
Fed officials insisted in the weeks before the June meeting that they were thinking seriously about raising rates for the first time since December. The meeting account, released after a standard three-week delay, said the weak pace of reported job growth in May effectively ended that debate.
"Almost all participants judged that the surprisingly weak May employment report increased their uncertainty about the outlook for the labor market," the account said.
The vote to do nothing at the June meeting was unanimous -- a first for the Fed since January -- but differences persisted over how long the Fed should wait. Some officials continued to argue for raising rates soon, while others saw little reason for urgency.
Those in favor of moving argued that unemployment and inflation were close to levels the Fed regarded as healthy, and waiting could cause the economy to overheat. In their view, the minutes said, "taking another step in removing monetary accommodation should not be delayed too long."
Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, said last week on the business cable news network CNBC that there was still reason for optimism about the economic outlook. "First of all, the U.S. economy since the very bad data we got in May on employment has done pretty well," he said. "Most of the incoming data looked good."
Others, however, were inclined to leave rates near zero for some time. These officials, the account said, "underscored they would need to accumulate sufficient evidence to increase their confidence that economic growth was strong enough to withstand a possible downward shock to demand."
James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, announced after the June meeting that he now expected that the Fed should keep rates near the current low level through 2018.
Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays, said the debate would be decided by job growth in the coming months. The government will release its June employment report on Friday.
"If employment growth picks up this summer, members will become more optimistic over the outlook for activity," Mr. Martin wrote on Wednesday, after the release of the meeting minutes. "Likewise, if employment growth disappoints over the summer, even the most hawkish member will begin to revise its outlook lower and no member would push hard for a September rate hike."
Since the financial crisis, inflation has consistently failed to reach the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy. Inflation expectations have declined sharply. And, as inflation sags in other developed nations, some economists warn that central banks are not doing enough. But the Fed remains officially sanguine. The account said most officials expected faster inflation in coming years.
The global economy also remains a concern. The June minutes said that officials saw signs of improvement -- but that was before the British vote. There is general agreement that Britain's exit from the European Union will drag on growth, but the magnitude remains unclear.
In the short term, that is another reason for the Fed to delay any rate increases.
"We are still evaluating it," Mr. Fischer said on Friday. "My guess is that it will be less important for the U.S. than the countries directly involved -- almost just logically so. We will wait and see."

Full text:   OMAHA -- The CenturyLink Center, where the United States Olympic swimming trials are being held, might as well be a Tupperware container given how little of the outside world seeps through its doors. But headlines from Rio de Janeiro about violence, economic unrest and the threat of the Zika virus have nonetheless penetrated the hermetically sealed atmosphere and threatened to contaminate the celebrations of newly minted Olympians.
As a select group of swimmers realized their dreams, their parents contemplated nightmarish scenarios. The same day that Katie Ledecky, 19, qualified for her second Olympic team with a victory in the 400-meter freestyle, the acting governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Francisco Dornelles, told the Brazilian paper O Globo, "I am optimistic about the Games, but I have to show the reality. We can make a great Olympics, but if some steps are not taken, it can be a big failure."
Inflation and crime in the city are on the rise, and the state security budget is being cut back. In one recent fortnight, 10 people were killed and 50 schools were closed because of shootings resulting from police searches.
Michael Phelps, an 18-time Olympic gold medalist, has been to Brazil four times. On three of those trips, he conducted swim clinics in the favelas -- Rio's notorious slums -- always accompanied by a security detail. The risks posed by Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that can cause birth defects, do not concern him, he said. "Security-wise we're more worried," said Phelps, who will foot the bill to have a private security company protect his family, including his fiancée and their 2-month-old son.
The day before Phelps won the 200-meter butterfly to qualify for his fifth Olympics, frustration over unpaid wages for members of law enforcement led to several protests in Rio. One, at the airport, featured angry civil police officers holding up a banner that read: "Welcome to hell. Police and firefighters don't get paid, whoever comes to Rio de Janeiro will not be safe."
That apparently includes athletes. Last month, the Australian Paralympic sailing gold medalist Liesl Tesch, in Rio to train, was robbed at gunpoint during a bicycle ride. After she made plain that she was not carrying any money, her assailants knocked her to the ground and took her bike.
"Obviously, today we picked up the paper and there was a story about Brazil going bankrupt, needing money and security," said Mike Kalisz, whose son, Chase, made his first Olympic team in the 400-meter individual medley on the first night of the competition. Afterward, Kalisz said, he and his wife met with Jim Fox, the marketing director for USA Swimming, the sport's national governing body.
"They've been a tremendous resource," Kalisz said, adding: "They value the safety of all the participants and spectators more than they do the Games. I truly believe that."
The swimmers have received talking points from the United States Olympic Committee, and none have publicly expressed reservations about the script. Asked about security concerns and health issues related to Zika, Ledecky said, "It's not something that we swimmers really like to think about that much."
She added, "I think USA Swimming and the U.S.O.C. will do a great job of preparing us to the best of their ability for all the different circumstances that could come up, just like any other meet."
For the families of the Rio-bound athletes, preparing for a trip to these Olympics involves more than making travel arrangements and procuring tickets to the races. Along with mosquito repellent, some parents are buying special passport holders \ to prevent thieves from intercepting their passport and credit card information. They have been encouraged to check in with the Consulate General of the United States when they arrive in Rio.
A few families are looking into booking chauffeured armored vehicles for their stay. With event finals scheduled to start at 10 p.m. local time and end after midnight, they feel at added risk. "When finals are getting out at 1 in the morning and you have to travel a distance to get back, it's a challenge," said Pat Murphy, the father of Ryan Murphy, 20, who qualified in both backstroke events.
Through a Rio-based property management group, Murphy arranged to have a dedicated driver who speaks English ferry his family around in a van. "What they told us is don't be surprised when he rolls through intersections and stoplights," he said, "because a lot of times if you stop at night at intersections there could be some trouble."
The same day that Ledecky qualified for her second individual event, a passer-by spotted human body parts that had washed ashore on Rio's Copacabana Beach. It was shocking even for people familiar with Rio's reputation for territorial battles between heavily armed drug gangs.
After Olivia Smoliga, 21, made the Olympic team in the 100-meter backstroke, her mother, Elizabeth, was researching flights to Brazil when she stumbled upon a story on the airport protesters and their unwelcoming welcome banner. "So we discussed it with Olivia and she told us about body parts washing up," Smoliga's mother said. "So she said that, yeah, they're probably going to be contained to their safe hotel place."
Smoliga's father, Tom, who had been letting his wife talk, spoke up. 'They had a successful World Cup," he said, referring to the 2014 global soccer event that Brazil hosted, "so we're not worried about it too much."
Wild headlines could not keep Smoliga's Poland-born parents from making the trip to Rio. "I think no matter what, we would go anyway," her father said.
As the list of what could go wrong in Rio grows longer, the parents of Connor Jaeger, 25, who qualified in the 400 freestyle, have become more resolute about attending. "Because if there's problems or whatever," his mother, Bernadette, said, "we don't want him to be down there alone without family."
Maya DiRado, 23, a first-time Olympian, has family in South America. Her father, Ruben, was born in Argentina. Her mother, Marit, is a nurse who spent part of last year in Sierra Leone. DiRado's older sister, Sarah, who is married with a young child, reluctantly decided not to attend the Olympics because of Zika.
"They originally thought about going," DiRado's father said. "And they made a decision that this probably isn't the best time to be going given the health concerns."
DiRado's father said he and his wife have no qualms about making the trip.
"We've traveled to places where it's not your typical American suburban environment," he said, "and actually what is going on in Brazil is more like the reality for most of the six-billion-plus people in the world. So why wouldn't the Olympics be affected by it? The Olympics should not be this thing that's kind of in a bubble, separate from reality."

Abstract: The very, very rich enjoy unimaginable luxury while billions of people endure abject poverty, unemployment, and inadequate health care, education, housing and drinking water. The notion that Donald Trump could benefit from the same forces that gave the Leave proponents a majority in Britain should sound an alarm for the Democratic Party in the United States.

Full text:   Surprise, surprise. Workers in Britain, many of whom have seen a decline in their standard of living while the very rich in their country have become much richer, have turned their backs on the European Union and a globalized economy that is failing them and their children.
And it's not just the British who are suffering. That increasingly globalized economy, established and maintained by the world's economic elite, is failing people everywhere. Incredibly, the wealthiest 62 people on this planet own as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population -- around 3.6 billion people. The top 1 percent now owns more wealth than the whole of the bottom 99 percent. The very, very rich enjoy unimaginable luxury while billions of people endure abject poverty, unemployment, and inadequate health care, education, housing and drinking water.
Could this rejection of the current form of the global economy happen in the United States? You bet it could.
During my campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, I've visited 46 states. What I saw and heard on too many occasions were painful realities that the political and media establishment fail even to recognize.
In the last 15 years, nearly 60,000 factories in this country have closed, and more than 4.8 million well-paid manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Much of this is related to disastrous trade agreements that encourage corporations to move to low-wage countries.
Despite major increases in productivity, the median male worker in America today is making $726 dollars less than he did in 1973, while the median female worker is making $1,154 less than she did in 2007, after adjusting for inflation.
Nearly 47 million Americans live in poverty. An estimated 28 million have no health insurance, while many others are underinsured. Millions of people are struggling with outrageous levels of student debt. For perhaps the first time in modern history, our younger generation will probably have a lower standard of living than their parents. Frighteningly, millions of poorly educated Americans will have a shorter life span than the previous generation as they succumb to despair, drugs and alcohol.
Meanwhile, in our country the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Fifty-eight percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. Wall Street and billionaires, through their "super PACs," are able to buy elections.
On my campaign, I've talked to workers unable to make it on $8 or $9 an hour; retirees struggling to purchase the medicine they need on $9,000 a year of Social Security; young people unable to afford college. I also visited the American citizens of Puerto Rico, where some 58 percent of the children live in poverty and only a little more than 40 percent of the adult population has a job or is seeking one.
Let's be clear. The global economy is not working for the majority of people in our country and the world. This is an economic model developed by the economic elite to benefit the economic elite. We need real change.
But we do not need change based on the demagogy, bigotry and anti-immigrant sentiment that punctuated so much of the Leave campaign's rhetoric -- and is central to Donald J. Trump's message.
We need a president who will vigorously support international cooperation that brings the people of the world closer together, reduces hypernationalism and decreases the possibility of war. We also need a president who respects the democratic rights of the people, and who will fight for an economy that protects the interests of working people, not just Wall Street, the drug companies and other powerful special interests.
We need to fundamentally reject our "free trade" policies and move to fair trade. Americans should not have to compete against workers in low-wage countries who earn pennies an hour. We must defeat the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We must help poor countries develop sustainable economic models.
We need to end the international scandal in which large corporations and the wealthy avoid paying trillions of dollars in taxes to their national governments.
We need to create tens of millions of jobs worldwide by combating global climate change and by transforming the world's energy system away from fossil fuels.
We need international efforts to cut military spending around the globe and address the causes of war: poverty, hatred, hopelessness and ignorance.
The notion that Donald Trump could benefit from the same forces that gave the Leave proponents a majority in Britain should sound an alarm for the Democratic Party in the United States. Millions of American voters, like the Leave supporters, are understandably angry and frustrated by the economic forces that are destroying the middle class.
In this pivotal moment, the Democratic Party and a new Democratic president need to make clear that we stand with those who are struggling and who have been left behind. We must create national and global economies that work for all, not just a handful of billionaires.

Full text:   Donald J. Trump and Boris Johnson: Is this how the era ushered in by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher finally ends?
It once looked as though the financial crisis of 2008 might even bring about the end of laissez-faire economics. "The idea of an all-powerful market which is always right is finished," declared Nicolas Sarkozy, then the president of France. And Peer Steinbrück, Germany's finance minister at the time, predicted that "the U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the world financial system."
Even Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, once known as the "maestro" of capitalism, declared himself "in a state of shocked disbelief" at the collapse wrought by the unfettered markets he had championed throughout his life. "I've found a flaw," he said. "I've been very distressed by that fact."
But I suspect few would have guessed that the economic order built on Reagan's and Thatcher's common faith in unfettered global markets (and largely accepted by their more liberal successors Bill Clinton and Tony Blair) would be brought down by right-wing populists riding the anger of a working class that has been cast aside in the globalized economy that the two leaders trumpeted 40 years ago.
Britons' vote last week to exit the European Union was not simply about their idiosyncratic distaste for all things European -- an aversion shared by Thatcher, who saw Brussels as the kind of meddlesome big government she loathed. Brussels was merely a stand-in for something deeper: the very globalization that Thatcher as Britain's prime minister so enthusiastically promoted.
The so-called Brexit vote was driven by an inchoate sense among older white workers with modest education that they have been passed over, condemned by forces beyond their control to an uncertain job for little pay in a world where their livelihoods are challenged not just by cheap Asian workers halfway around the world, but closer to home by waves of immigrants of different faiths and skin tones.
It is the same frustration that has buoyed proto-fascist political parties across Europe. It is the same anger fueling the candidacy of Mr. Trump in the United States.
Across Europe -- in struggling Spain and affluent Sweden, even in Europe's champion competitor, Germany -- more citizens would like to see powers returned from Brussels to their national governments than would like to see more powers go the other way, according to a poll conducted last spring by the Pew Research Center.
Older people throughout the European Union express nearly as much dissatisfaction as those in Britain's aging industrial heartland who defied the will of the young and voted to leave by a wide margin. Even at the very center of the European project, only 31 percent of the French 50 years old and up have a favorable view of the European Union.
Their frustration is turning traditional ideological labels on their heads. Mr. Trump, a bombastic businessman who's never held office, and Mr. Johnson, the former journalist turned mayor of London, might not put it this way, since they continue to cling to a conservative mantle. But they are riding a revolt of the working class against a 40-year-long project of the political right and its corporate backers that has dominated policy making in the English-speaking world for a generation.
As the conservative magazine National Review gleefully noted, the big "Leave" victories came "deep in the Labour heartland."
So where does capitalism go now? What can replace a consensus built by a charismatic American president and a bull-in-a-china-shop British prime minister in favor of small governments and unrestrained markets around the world?
The British political scientist Andrew Gamble at the University of Cambridge has argued that Western capitalism has experienced two transformational crises since the end of the 19th century. The first, brought about by the Depression of the 1930s, ended an era in which governments bowed to the gospel of the gold standard and were expected to butt out of the battles between labor and capital, letting markets function on their own, whatever the consequences.
In his 2010 book, "Capitalism 4.0," the London-based economic commentator Anatole Kaletsky refers to a document in the archive of the British Treasury that shows the reaction of the permanent secretary to a proposal by the great economist John Maynard Keynes to use government spending to spur Britain's economy. It has three words: "Extravagance, Inflation, Bankruptcy."
Mr. Keynes's views ultimately prevailed, though, providing the basis for a new post-World War II orthodoxy favoring active government intervention in the economy and a robust welfare state. But that era ended when skyrocketing oil prices and economic mismanagement in the 1970s brought about a combination of inflation and unemployment that fatally undermined people's trust in the state.
Even the former president of France François Mitterrand -- a Socialist who nationalized the banking system, increased government employment and raised public-sector pay after being elected in 1981 -- was forced into a U-turn. In 1983, he froze the budget and brought about "la rigueur": the austerity.
The Keynesian era ended when Thatcher and Reagan rode onto the scene with a version of capitalism based on tax cuts, privatization and deregulation that helped revive their engines of growth but led the workers of the world to the deeply frustrating, increasingly unequal economy of today.
There are potentially constructive approaches to set the world economy on a more promising path. For starters, what about taking advantage of rock-bottom interest rates to tap the world's excess funds to build and repair a fraying public infrastructure? That would employ legions of blue-collar workers and help increase economic growth, which has been only inching ahead across much of the industrialized world.
After the Brexit vote, Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary under President Clinton and one of President Obama's top economic advisers at the nadir of the Great Recession, laid out an argument for what he called "responsible nationalism," which focused squarely on the interests of domestic workers.
Instead of negotiating more agreements to ease business across borders, governments would focus on deals to improve labor and environmental standards internationally. They might cut deals to prevent cross-border tax evasion.
There is, however, little evidence that the world's leaders will go down that path. Despite the case for economic stimulus, austerity still rules across much of the West. In Europe, most governments have imposed stringent budget cuts -- ensuring that all but the strongest economies would stall. In the United States, political polarization has brought fiscal policy -- spending and taxes -- to a standstill.
The cost of inaction could be enormous. Mr. Johnson's campaign to reject British membership of the European Union is already producing political and economic shock waves around the world. Mr. Trump -- whose solutions include punishing China with high tariffs and building a wall with Mexico -- is trying to ride workers' angst into the most powerful job in the world.
There are less catastrophic ways to put an end to an era.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Economic growth in the United States slowed in the first quarter but not as sharply as previously estimated, with gains in exports and software investment partly offsetting weak consumer spending.
Gross domestic product increased at a 1.1 percent annual rate, rather than the 0.8 percent pace reported last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, in its final estimate.
First-quarter G.D.P. growth has been revised higher by 0.6 percentage point since the first estimate was published in April. The economy grew at a rate of 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter. The first-quarter revision was broadly in line with economists' expectations.
There are signs the economy has regained momentum in the second quarter, with retail sales and home sales rising in April and May, even though business spending continues to struggle and job growth has slowed.
But uncertainty stoked by Britain's surprising vote to leave the European Union poses a risk to growth for the rest of year
The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, told lawmakers last week that data pointed to "a noticeable step-up" in G.D.P. growth in the second quarter. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is estimating that second-quarter G.D.P. will rise at a 2.6 percent rate.
Economic growth in the first quarter was constrained by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand. Output was also hampered by businesses' efforts to reduce an inventory overhang, with a further drag coming from lower oil prices, which have set off deep spending cuts on capital goods like equipment.
Economists also say they think the model used by the government to strip out seasonal patterns from data is not fully accomplishing its goal. The economy has underperformed in the first quarter in five of the last six years.
First-quarter business spending on software, research and development was revised to show it rising at a 4.4 percent rate instead of falling at a 0.1 percent rate. Business spending on equipment fell at an 8.7 percent pace as opposed to the 9 percent rate reported last month.
Over all, business spending sliced off 0.58 percentage point from first-quarter G.D.P. instead of the previously reported 0.81 percentage point.
Export growth was revised to show a 0.3 percent rate of increase instead of the previously reported 2 percent pace of contraction. With imports weak, that resulted in a smaller trade deficit.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States, was revised down to a 1.5 percent rate, the slowest pace in two years. Consumer spending was previously reported to have increased at a 1.9 percent rate.
The downward revision reflected weak spending on services like transportation and recreation. But April and May retail sales reports suggest that consumer spending has rebounded.
Also on Tuesday, a report from the Conference Board showed that consumer confidence increased to an eight-month high in June. The survey was, however, conducted before last week's referendum in Britain.
"Near-term market volatility may give households reason for pause, but consumer spending should remain a key support for the economy in the coming quarters," said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich.
Separately, data released on Tuesday showed that house prices rose 5.4 percent in April from a year ago.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Sometimes, something bad happens, and it creates huge financial market swings and long-lasting economic ripples. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were an example, as was the 2011 Japanese nuclear disaster.
But the so-called Brexit is different.
The immediate financial downturn after Britain voted Thursday to leave the European Union resembles the fallout from those disasters. But the other events were largely disconnected from the broader economic currents of their time. They were one-off events, at least in terms of their economic ramifications.
What makes Brexit so concerning is that it accentuates and deepens global forces that have been building for years. So far, governments have been unable to limit any of it. And those forces have self-reinforcing, vicious-cycle dimensions that make it a particularly perilous time for the global economy, even though the type of full-scale panic that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 looks unlikely.
Britain accounts for less than 4 percent of world G.D.P. Most people on Earth don't really have a rooting interest in the exact details of the nation's trade relationship with the rest of Europe. But its decision to leave the European Union is making more powerful six interrelated forces that already weigh on the global economy:
Low inflation There is a glut of global commodities, particularly oil. There is a glut of labor, with elevated unemployment in much of the world. Inflation has been persistently below the 2 percent mark that major central banks aim for, and shows little sign of rising.
And since the Brexit decision, markets are signaling that those forces have become even more energized.
The price of oil fell 7.5 percent from Thursday to Monday's close, despite little reason to think that the British referendum will cause any major changes in, for example, the supply of oil from oil reserves that the nation controls.
And bond markets are priced at levels that imply the years ahead will have lower inflation that was priced in before the Brexit news. While high inflation is often seen as the greater threat, in the last few years economists have viewed too-low inflation -- which can discourage spending and investment and make debts more onerous -- as the more pressing concern. In the United States, bond market prices imply that investors now expect annual inflation of 1.37 percent a year through 2026, down from 1.55 percent on Thursday before the vote's results, a drop of 0.18 of a percentage point; in Germany, the drop was 0.13 of a point and in Japan 0.10 of a point. (The one exception: Britain itself, which will almost certainly see much higher inflation in the coming years because of a drop in its currency.
Strong dollar The United States dollar has been on a tear. The dollar index, measuring its value against six other major currencies, is up more than 20 percent in the last two years.
Some of this reflects good health: The United States economy is reasonably strong, with steady growth since 2009 and a 4.7 percent unemployment rate. That has led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates once and contemplate further moves.
Some of the dollar rally reflects a more negative global outlook. The economies of Europe, Japan and many emerging markets have remained exceptionally weak, making the United States look comparatively fantastic. Factor in the United States' traditional role as the beacon of stability in turbulent times, and American assets look more attractive than their underlying economics would suggest.
Most worrisome is that there are some feedback loops between the strong dollar and economic weakness abroad. Many international companies, especially in China and emerging markets, owe debt in dollars, so a stronger dollar makes their debts more onerous and creates spillover economic weakness. And the stronger dollar is undermining American exporters, slowing growth in the United States.
Brexit is only accentuating this. The dollar index is up 3 percent since Thursday, most significantly because of the collapse in value of the British pound, but it is also up against the euro.
Impotent monetary policy The world's central banks are well aware of these forces, of course, and are trying to combat them. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are in the middle of huge programs to try to pump money into their financial systems by buying assets. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have been delaying interest rate increases in hopes of achieving higher inflation and more solid growth.
So far it hasn't been enough to get inflation persistently up to 2 percent or achieve sustained strong growth. And it is an open question if more of the same will change anything, particularly given that the economic challenges emanating from Britain are more because of existential questions of national identity than because of a garden-variety business slowdown.
Nonetheless, in the aftermath of Brexit, analysts and financial markets are now pricing in even slower interest rate increases for the Fed and the Bank of England, and a real possibility of yet more easing programs by the E.C.B. and the Bank of Japan.
Low interest rates Remember back in December when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates? That day, 10-year Treasury bonds were yielding 2.3 percent. Those bonds had fallen to 1.74 percent by Thursday (the Fed controls short-term interest rates directly, but longer-term rates are set in the open market).
In the two trading days since the Brexit vote, that rate has fallen to 1.44 percent. Other bond markets, including across Europe and in Britain itself, have also experienced falling longer-term rates. Germany, Switzerland and several other European countries even have negative long-term interest rates, meaning a person who buys a bond and holds on to it will lose money.
That's very much related to the decline in investors' expectations for lower inflation and more central bank activism. But it may also reflect a "fear premium" as investors throw money into anything that seems safe -- even if it means they are guaranteed to lose money.
Weak growth This is the underlying story behind all of these other market currents. Europe is only now returning to its 2007 level of economic output; Japan's growth is so low it is constantly bouncing in and out of recession status. In developing markets, Brazil is in recession and China is slowing. Britain and the United States are doing better, but only by the diminished global standards of the 21st century.
You can have endless debates about the underlying causes. Is this the inevitable result of a lull in productivity growth, a result of bad policy or bad luck, or some mix? Either way, the reality is that the global economy seems locked into lower growth than had been the norm in the decades before 2007.
Britain's E.U. vote raises the risk of further dragging down that growth rate, particularly if there is a prolonged period of uncertainty around the country's fate or a permanent breakdown in the trade ties that make an economy richer.
Political instability All of this is creating a toxic political environment in much of the advanced world, driving greater polarization and the flocking of voters to candidates outside the mainstream.
Brexit is the most recent example, supported as it was by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. The rise of right-wing nationalist parties in Continental Europe is another prime example, as are the popularity of Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders in the United States; Jeremy Corbyn in Britain; and the far-left Podemos party in Spain.
Of course, less conventional politicians could turn out to succeed at generating stronger economic conditions where parties of the center have failed. But if nothing else, the widening of the ideological spectrum creates a wider range of possible outcomes -- including some that would surely be very negative for financial markets and the global economy.
Again, none of these stand in isolation. Each is deeply related -- either as cause, effect or both. And each has been pushed further by Britain's choice. Where the cycle ends, and when, no one knows.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Upshot article on Tuesday about the effect Britain's decision to leave the European Union could have on the global economy referred incorrectly to the dollar's performance against the yen between Thursday and Monday. It dropped against the yen; it did not rise.

Full text:   As global markets reel after an establishment-rattling vote by Britain to sever ties with Europe, investors are again expecting central banks to ride to the rescue.
And that may be the problem.
Or so believe a number of investors and economists who worry that another round of central bank intervention in the markets will compound the sense of alienation, frustration and anger at global elites that encouraged a majority of Britons to opt for leaving the European Union.
Traditionally, market participants have tended to cheer central bank activism.
In times of financial panic, wholesale bond buying, negative interest rates and disbursing cash directly to consumers (the yet-to-be-deployed weapon in the central banker's armory) have been seen as easy policy substitutes for governments unwilling or incapable of taking action themselves.
But, as the world's leading central bankers finished a weekend of brainstorming in Basel, Switzerland, as to what their next move might be, some feared that this time around they might do more harm than good.
"People say that central bankers have not done enough, but they have done too much already," said Stephen Jen, a former official at the International Monetary Fund who now manages a hedge fund in London.
Global central bankers had already planned to convene at the annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements, a clearinghouse and research shop that provides a private forum for central bankers to gather and exchange views.
But the British referendum results and the sharp fall in the markets that followed brought an extra urgency to the two-day meeting.
On Saturday, Agustín Carstens, the head of Mexico's central bank and chairman of the bank's policy group that monitors the global financial system, said that committee members had "endorsed the contingency measures put in place by the Bank of England and emphasized the preparedness of central banks to support the proper functioning of financial markets."
Adding to global political tensions were parliamentary elections on Sunday in Spain, where the anti-austerity left-wing party Podemos was expected to continue its recent run of electoral success.
While the sell-off in stocks on Friday was very sharp, market participants said over the weekend that they were heartened that major market makers were able to absorb the selling fairly well.
Playing a central role were exchange-traded funds, which at one point on Friday accounted for close to 50 percent of overall trading volume in stocks. That is an extraordinary statistic, given that the funds were largely unknown a decade ago as an investment option for investors.
The ability for investors to quickly and successfully buy and sell stocks and bonds, the crucial advantage that exchange-traded funds have over mutual funds, is seen by regulators as critical in times of acute financial stress.
Part of the conundrum for central bankers is that the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like Lehman Brothers going bankrupt in September 2008, which provided authorities with an unassailable excuse to intervene. Lehman's failure caused markets to seize up and financial institutions to stop dealing with each other.
But when the crises that rock global finance are social and political, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend any form of extraordinary intervention.
And that is what worries analysts, who for some time now have been concerned that interventions by central banks were distorting markets by making them less liquid and creating anomalies such as what currently exists in Japan.
There, the nation's central bank owns 34 percent of the country's government bonds and is one of the top 10 shareholders in 90 percent of the companies listed on the stock exchange, according to data from Bloomberg.
"Central banks have done everything to jury-rig markets," said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investment themes. "What makes you think they won't want to do more?"
Mr. Jen, the hedge fund manager, scoffed at the notion that the extraordinary central bank interventions of recent years were designed to stamp out deflationary threats and spark an increase in prices and economic activity in stagnant economies in Europe and Japan.
"We have plenty of inflation, it's just asset price inflation," he argued, referring to elevated equity, bond and housing markets that have been one consequence of these policies. "People can't live in cities anymore, and they are grumpy about their jobs."
In Britain, this dynamic has been particularly acute. Thanks to aggressive central bank policies, house prices in London are among the most expensive in the world, yet the inflation-adjusted weekly average wage of 470 pounds, or about $632, is still £20 lower than it was before the financial crisis, according to the Resolution Foundation, a British research organization.
Interestingly, one of the most vocal critics of central bank overreach has been the Bank for International Settlements itself.
For years now, two senior economists at its research arm, Claudio Borio and Hyun Song Shin, have been arguing via speeches and papers that artificially low interest rates have created pernicious asset bubbles in equity and housing markets in the developed world and debt frenzies in emerging markets like China and Brazil.
These views were highlighted again on Sunday in Basel with the presentation of the bank's annual report.
In a speech, Jaime Caruana, the bank's managing director, said that extremely low interest rates were a threat to global financial stability as they "depress risk premia and stretch asset valuations."
The result, Mr. Caruana contended, was the threat of a "loss of confidence in policy making" and "unrealistic expectations about growth and the ability of present policies to lift global growth."
While couched in platitudes, Mr. Caruana's message was clear enough. Persistent central bank interventions have not only created dangerous distortions, they have added to a sense of worldwide cynicism that these measures have not accomplished their central aims: lifting economic growth and increasing wages.
It is worth noting that Mr. Caruana is familiar with asset bubbles: He was the head of Spain's central bank a decade ago when reckless lending among the country's financial institutions resulted in a boom and eventual bust of Spanish property prices.
But, Mr. Brigden said, central bankers will have a harder time justifying an intervention when the markets are going haywire because of an election upset somewhere.
Of course, bashing central bankers is always a popular and easy pastime for politicians, economists and investors alike.
It is also true that central bankers in Britain, Europe, Japan and the United States have consistently said that their actions have been forced by the unwillingness of politicians and governments to act themselves.
"Monetary policy cannot do it alone," said Daniel C. Dektar, a bond investor at Amundi Smith Breeden, a global asset manager. "People have been left behind, which is creating anti-establishment sentiment in just about every democracy in the world. You would think that at some point governments would get the message."

Abstract: What's far more worrisome is whether Britain's decision represents an end to the economic integration and opening markets that have helped propel sales at companies like Eastman over the last few decades. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, politics and economics have mostly moved in one direction, with the elites on both sides of the Atlantic favoring policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, the introduction of the European currency and the entry of China into the World Trade Organization.

Full text:   When the mills that birthed the industrial revolution in cities like Manchester and Birmingham still powered the British economy of the mid-20th century, Robert Stevenson was a frequent visitor to the Midlands.
Eastman Machine, the company his family helped start in upstate New York 128 years ago, had a big factory 100 miles north of London, and Britain accounted for roughly a fifth of the firm's sales.
That was then. While Britain is still an important market for Eastman's sophisticated cutting tools, its workshop there was shuttered in the 1970s, and British customers are now served by Eastman's main factory in Buffalo and a smaller one in China.
So when the British electorate stunned the world on Friday with the results of the vote to leave the European Union, it was a shock for Mr. Stevenson, but not because it poses an immediate threat to Eastman's bottom line or the job security of its heavily blue-collar, 120-strong work force in downtown Buffalo.
What most concerns Mr. Stevenson and owners of businesses big and small is what the so-called Brexit says about the shape of economic things to come.
"You never know if there will be a domino effect, and we worry about other countries securing their borders," Mr. Stevenson said. "We were certainly surprised."
For all the shock and awe on Wall Street and financial markets around the globe on Friday, the imminent danger to the underlying American economy is relatively small. What's far more worrisome is whether Britain's decision represents an end to the economic integration and opening markets that have helped propel sales at companies like Eastman over the last few decades.
Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, politics and economics have mostly moved in one direction, with the elites on both sides of the Atlantic favoring policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, the introduction of the European currency and the entry of China into the World Trade Organization. Business has applauded these moves, but voters are not necessarily on board as they once were.
"I think a lot of the market reaction is less about the financial impact and more about populism and what it means for the liberal economic order," said Glenn Hubbard, a top economic official to President George W. Bush who now serves as dean of the Columbia Business School.
The Brexit vote, he added, reflects a deep distrust of the benefits of the global economic system among a wide swath of voters in Europe and the United States, and a broadly held view that government institutions -- whether in Washington or Brussels -- are calcifying and don't work well.
"Both of those forces have a lot of wind at their back," he said.
"In the near term, you're seeing markets being roiled, and feedback effects for the Federal Reserve," Mr. Hubbard said. But for now, at least in the United States, "I don't think it's going to raise recession probabilities."
>
When it comes to commerce, Britain is not even among the United States' top five trading partners -- it's currently the seventh largest, according to the United States Census Bureau, which tracks trade data. American exports to Britain last year totaled $56 billion, or just over 0.3 percentage point of gross domestic product.
Partly that's a reflection of how the United States, despite leading the era of globalization, remains something of an economic island. Exports account for 13.4 percent of American economic output, according to the World Bank, compared with roughly 30 percent for Britain.
The 2015 slowdown in the United States' biggest trading partner -- China -- may have blunted domestic growth in the last year, but even that hardly threw the American economy into a tailspin. Nor should Brexit, most experts say.
Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who most recently served in the Obama administration and is now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, sees minimal pain within American borders. "It won't be helpful for our economy," Mr. Bernstein said, but "we won't take anything like the direct hit that I expect will befall the economy."
Several economists estimated that the fallout from the vote would probably end up decreasing growth in the American economy by about a quarter of a percentage point or less, while postponing any push by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, possibly through the end of 2016.
"The flight to safety means lots of people are flocking to U.S. Treasury bonds, putting downward pressure on interest rates," Mr. Bernstein said. "One possible outcome is that Fed's path to higher interest rates may become flatter as these events play out."
Brexit's impact on the United States economy will mostly be felt through the falling value of the pound and the euro against the dollar, Mr. Bernstein said, which is "likely to slow down inflation and exacerbate our trade deficit."
A surging dollar would hurt American exporters facing weaker demand from customers in Europe and Asia. In fact, Mr. Stevenson's main worry on Friday was whether his British competitors might actually benefit in the short term.
"With the pound dropping 10 or 15 percent, it may strengthen a couple of our competitors in the U.K.," he said. "I think they could be quite happy about it and gain market share."
As befits the owner of a company that survived World Wars I and II, outlasted the Great Depression and the Great Recession, and survived the collapse of the American textile industry -- all without abandoning Buffalo -- Mr. Stevenson has learned to adapt to potential shocks like Brexit.
Increasingly, that's meant focusing on making high-tech, software-driven equipment to cut composites and carbon-based fabrics for the aerospace industry and automakers, rather than the woolens and cotton Eastman's equipment was once designed to slice.
Many of Mr. Stevenson's current customers in Britain are in these sectors, he noted. The dressmakers and hosiers and other clothiers that once populated England's redbrick towns have long departed.
"Our focus has been to understand where the market is going," said Mr. Stevenson. Twenty years ago, 70 percent of Eastman's products were of traditional fabrics; the rest were space-age materials. Now, it is the reverse, which is among the reasons a fifth generation of Stevensons will have a company to take over.
"Our goal has been to maintain the company in Buffalo and as a family business," Mr. Stevenson said. "My son is 40, and I'm 65, and he is focused on these new materials. This saved our butt."
For those exporters that have managed to hang on in the industrial heartland of Britain, the Brexit could actually be good news, simply because the pound's plunge against currencies like the euro and the dollar makes their goods more competitive.
British exports like Rolls-Royce jet engines, high-end Jaguar automobiles and certain food products could get a lift. Last month, for example, Britain exported the largest cargo of wheat to the United States in more than two decades.
So would British hotels and restaurants, eager to host American visitors looking for what could amount to a 10 to 20 percent-off sale.
"If you wanted to buy a nice little house in Scotland, today's the day," said Kevin A. Hassett, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
>
Chief executives of major American companies are paid well to see around corners, and must adapt their businesses even to trends they oppose, or face the consequences in the form of falling stock prices and angry shareholders.
That's among the reasons General Electric, which relies on foreign markets for more than half its revenue, has been preparing for the kind of political retreat from open markets that the British vote to leave the European Union represents.
"Companies must navigate the world on their own," G.E.'s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said in the commencement speech last month at the N.Y.U. Stern School of Business.
For G.E., he said that meant seeking to achieve "a local capability inside a global footprint." Today, its 420 factories spread across the world give G.E. "tremendous flexibility," Mr. Immelt said, with jet engines, power generators and rail locomotives increasingly manufactured at several sites to ensure market access.
"A localization strategy," Mr. Immelt said, "can't be shut down by protectionist politics."
G.E. had prepared for the risk that Britain might vote to leave the E.U. by hedging in foreign currency markets. But beyond that immediate step, a G.E. spokeswoman said on Friday it was too early to discuss longer-term moves the company might make.
Mr. Immelt, in a statement, said that G.E., America's largest manufacturer, which employs 22,000 people in Britain and 100,000 in Europe over all, remains "firmly committed" to both Britain and Europe.
While Brexit's impact on Britain's overall economy may be mixed, its London-based financial sector is likely to feel the full force of the coming storm. The City, as London's equivalent of Wall Street is known, has boomed in the last 20 years as a global financial capital, especially for Continental banks seeking a more market-friendly home than Frankfurt or Paris.
With a recession in Britain now a distinct possibility, some experts worry that a government desperate to create and maintain jobs could seek to save the financial sector by making the City more attractive as an offshore haven.
"This could lead to London becoming even more like the Cayman Islands and other British territories, skirting around regulations, in a race to the bottom for the financial sector," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "This potentially could leave pretty big holes in the financial safety net."
He pointed to the 2008 crisis involving the insurance giant American International Group, where a hedge-fund-like subsidiary operating in London and under less stringent rules nearly brought down the company and contributed to the financial crash.
"They could get away with things in London that they couldn't get away with in New York," Mr. Posen said, "So imagine repeating that on a larger scale or a more frequent scale."
Of course, dangers like those are the hardest to anticipate.
"Right now we're in one of those points in history," Mr. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute said, "where there are lot of 'unknown unknowns,"' referring to the infamous comment by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the Iraq war.
Consider two very different types of uncertainty, Mr. Hassett explained, citing a well-known economic metaphor. If you bet on a roulette wheel, you know all the possible outcomes and the attendant risks. But now imagine a game where you don't know all the places the roulette ball might land, or the chances of it falling into different slots or even the prizes if you are fortunate enough to bet correctly.
"In those types of situations," he said, "anything can happen. And if you don't know what will happen, the optimal strategy might be to assume the worst."

Full text:   On the first Saturday of every month, residents of the Soundview section of the Bronx know where to go for a dose of body-slamming, eye-gouging, family-oriented mayhem: Daro's Extreme Fitness, a gym where people don tights, boots and, often, handmade leather masks to do battle as part of the Bronx Wrestling Federation. Chairs will be swung. Garbage cans will be tossed. Muscles will be flexed. Children will be entertained. And on the right night, Fred R. Conrad, a longtime photographer for The New York Times, will capture it all on film.
Minor wrestling circuits operate all over the country, drawing loyal crowds and stoking hopes that one of the performers will someday reach the big time. Started by Francisco Segundo, 53, an owner of the gym who wrestles as Bronco Internacional, the Bronx federation is a Pan-American affair. Many of the wrestlers grapple in the colorful lucha libre gear and acrobatic style popularized in Mexico; others wear basic brawler attire. Either way, "it's a rough atmosphere," said Jorel Arroyo, 35, who works at a T-Mobile store and wrestles as the King of New York. On June 4, he became the United States champion of the Bronx Wrestling Federation, which sounds like title inflation only to those who don't understand pro wrestling. He is also head trainer at the gym's school for wrestlers. "We have police officers, drug dealers, mailmen, teachers," he said. "I started out as an actor. I was going to audition for Juilliard after high school, but I decided to go for professional wrestling."
At the end of the night, Mr. Segundo lets children in the crowd storm the ring to interact with the wrestlers. Then the real chaos happens. And on a good night, nobody gets hurt.

Full text:   In 2009, when Rio de Janeiro won the right to host the 2016 Olympic Games -- beating out Madrid, Tokyo and Chicago -- Brazil was flying high. Although it had not escaped the consequences of the 2008 financial crisis, it had suffered less economic damage, and come back more quickly, than other countries, including the United States. With the economy booming, the federal government felt so flush that its popular president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, had instituted a series of expensive social programs that helped push millions of poor Brazilians toward a better life. The Economist magazine predicted that Brazil would soon be the world's fifth-largest economy, leapfrogging Britain and France.
"I've never felt more pride in Brazil," Lula (as everyone in Brazil calls him) said after Rio's bid victory was announced. "Now, we are going to show the world we can be a great country." He wasn't the only one who felt that way. On Copacabana Beach in Rio, a huge party broke out.
The Games begin in six weeks, but nobody is partying anymore. The economic -- and social, and political -- conditions facing Brazil and Rio have changed drastically. A huge corruption scandal that began at the country's giant oil company, Petrobras, resulted in exposés and investigations into dozens, if not hundreds, of high-ranking politicians and members of the business elite. Lula's handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, is being impeached for covering gaps in the government's budget in ways that were allegedly illegal. (She has never been connected to the larger scandal, however, despite having once been the chairwoman of Petrobras.) Lula himself is under investigation.
The country's economy has also fallen off a cliff, its gross domestic product dropping by 3.8 percent last year alone. Both the state of Rio de Janeiro and the city are broke -- and the federal government is not in great shape, either. Teachers and the police have had their paychecks delayed. Those much-praised social programs have been cut back. Inflation is on the rise. So is crime. The state security budget has been cut. Just days ago, armed men attacked Rio's largest public hospital, successfully freeing a drug kingpin. Plus there's the Zika virus, which has hit Brazil hard. According to the International Monetary Fund, Brazil's economy has slipped to ninth in the world, behind not only Britain and France, but also India and Italy.
Are the Olympics responsible for those problems? Of course not. But they've highlighted them. Whereas winning the Olympics in 2009 seemed to symbolize Brazil's new place on the world stage, the Olympics have since come to represent something else: "the hubris that existed during the boom years under Lula," said Alex Cuadros, the author of "Brazillionaires," a book about Brazil due out in July. And at this point, Rio's problems and the Olympics' problems seem intertwined.
In April, a top state official, Leonardo Espindola, publicly acknowledged that Brazil's problems could affect the Olympics and damage the country's image. "We are nearing a social collapse in our state," he said.
Cities that hold Olympics rarely, if ever, break even on the Games. In Rio's case, it won't even be close. Brazil originally budgeted more than $14 billion to hold the Olympics, money that would be spent on infrastructure -- stadiums, transportation improvements, the Olympic Village and so on -- as well as on security and other logistical requirements.
That number is now estimated at about $20 billion. But Rio is only likely to reap, at most, $4.5 billion in revenue, said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College whose recent book, "Circus Maximus," examines the economic consequences of the Olympics and the World Cup.
Instead, what cities promote when they bid for the Olympics are two things. The first is tourism: The Olympic Games, carried on television all over the world, offer a city publicity like almost nothing else. Barcelona and Sydney are great examples of cities that became much more prominent as tourist destinations after they held the Summer Games, in 1992 and 2000.
Second, cities claim that the infrastructure and improvements that are made to accommodate the Games will improve residents' lives long after the athletes have left. As part of its bid, Brazilian officials promised to clean up the notoriously polluted Guanabara Bay in central Rio, where the sailing competition will be held. They would build stadiums, yes, but also infrastructure that would ease Rio's congested traffic. Officials also said that the Olympics would improve tax revenue and economic growth -- not only in the years before the Games, but for years afterward.
It may turn out that the Rio Olympics will increase tourism, but the bad publicity surrounding Rio's preparation for the Games makes that a dubious proposition. As has been widely reported, the bay remains polluted, with the government having essentially given up on cleaning it up; it simply doesn't have the money. Thousands of people who live in favelas -- Rio's notorious slums -- have been ousted from their homes, often relocated hours from their schools and jobs, to make way for the needs of the Olympics. But all that Olympic construction has not been enough to stem the decline of Rio's economy.
Perhaps the best example of the problem with Rio's Olympic-mandated infrastructure is a new 10-mile rail line that will connect the hotels of Ipanema and Copacabana to the western suburb of Barra da Tijuca, where the Olympic Park has been built. It will cut the travel time from over an hour by car -- on a good day -- to less than 30 minutes. But after many delays, the rail line is now expected to open just four days before the opening ceremony. The cost has risen to $2.8 billion after an initial estimate of $1.6 billion. There are serious questions about whether there will be enough time to properly test the new line before putting it into use.
There is also a question about how useful this new line will be after the Games. Barra da Tijuca is a relatively wealthy area, and the most urgent transportation needs are in poorer areas of Rio. "The building of the new subway line is problematic," said Christopher Gaffney, a professor at the University of Zurich who studies large-scale sports events like the Olympics. "Extending that line meant they couldn't afford to extend any other line where it was really needed. It is a poorly conceived, poorly executed project."
At this point, virtually all the problems troubling the country seem to be reflected in Rio's Olympic preparation. Corruption? Prosecutors are investigating a number of construction companies building the Olympic sites, starting with Odebrecht, which is involved in over half the Olympic projects. Zika? The virus has caused some public health officials to call for the Games to be canceled, and a handful of athletes -- the golfer Rory McIlroy, most recently -- have declined to participate. Zika is the ultimate in bad publicity. Lack of money? The Brazilian organizers have had to cut about $500 million from the Olympic budget -- affecting aspects of the Games including the opening and closing ceremonies (they're being pared back) to the athletes' dorm rooms, which won't have televisions (the organizers were going to charge the athletes for air-conditioning but backed down).
There have been other miscues, too. In April, a bike path that had been built next to the ocean as part of the Games' infrastructure improvements collapsed, killing two people on the same day the Olympic torch was lit in Greece. (More bad news came Friday, when the World Anti-Doping Agency suspended the accreditation of a Rio lab that had been renovated, at great expense, to handle drug testing for the Games.)
Last week, the governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro declared a state of "public calamity" -- a declaration usually associated with a natural disaster -- essentially acknowledging that the state was bankrupt and would be unable to honor its commitment to the Olympics without help. The federal government stepped in with an emergency $850 million loan, some of which will be used to complete the new rail line.
The Games will go on, of course, and for those of us watching on television, it will be a splendid spectacle. Most of the Olympics will take place in a kind of bubble, divorced from the city's problems. But after the Games end on Aug. 21, almost three weeks after they begin, most of us will move on. The people of Rio will be left to pick up the pieces.

Abstract: The 7.6 percent drop in the British pound against the dollar is indeed a seismic move -- major currency pairs just don't do that. Since 2012, the average daily move in the pound-dollar exchange rate is 0.35 percent. Futures markets priced in a 50 percent chance of a Fed interest rate hike Thursday, but that fell to 14 percent Friday after the news, along with a 12 percent chance of an interest-rate cut this year.

Full text:   Things fall apart. And now, "things" includes the European Union.
British voters delivered a well-aimed kick at the global elites who prefer a Britain that is deeply intertwined, economically and diplomatically, with Europe.
So now that they did it, what does it mean for the British economy and the rest of the world?
With the caveat that nothing is really clear in the immediate aftermath of a seismic event like the one that happened Thursday, here's how to think about the economic forces that have been unleashed and how we can expect them to play out in the weeks and months and years ahead.
In the short run . . .
If you run a British company that exports a lot to Europe, or manage a European bank with thousands of employees in London, nothing much changed with the results Thursday.
Britain is a member of the European Union today, and will be one tomorrow. Your products can still be shipped to Düsseldorf without any hint of a tariff. Your employees can work legally whether their passport is from Sweden or Spain.
The immediate effects of "Brexit" will flow almost entirely through financial markets. Markets may be flawed, but they really do amount to a real-time verdict by millions of people with vast sums of money at stake on what something will be worth over the indefinite future. Economic shifts happen slowly; financial shifts happen overnight (literally, in this case).
The truth is that the stock market declines that took place worldwide Friday are nothing to be too concerned about. The British stock market, as measured by the FTSE 100 index, was down 3.2 percent late Friday afternoon in Britain, above its levels of mid-June. That suggests that investors do not envision the Brexit hit to hammer corporate profits in the near future.
But what is happening in the bond and currency markets suggests bigger problems are brewing. The 7.6 percent drop in the British pound against the dollar is indeed a seismic move -- major currency pairs just don't do that. Since 2012, the average daily move in the pound-dollar exchange rate is 0.35 percent. This move is 21 times that.
Combined with a rally in British government bonds (and consequently lower interest rates), the currency shift will mean a burst of inflation for British consumers as imported goods become sharply more expensive. It will also make the nation's export industries more competitive (for the moment, at least).
In the medium run. . .
As the months pass, the economic consequences of Brexit become less about financial market disruptions and more about real economic activity. Within Britain, a pall of uncertainty is likely to be cast over every business's decisions on whether to hire people or make capital investments -- and that's true of both British-owned businesses and the many affiliates of global companies in Britain.
If you're an American company that has its European headquarters in London, do you keep calm and carry on? Or do you start checking out real estate in Frankfurt or Dublin or some other place where the relationship with the E.U. is more settled? If you run a British company thinking of building a new factory, do you start to entertain the same question?
Even if the ultimate answer for these companies is "remain," it is easy to see how the desire to wait for clarity could hold back economic activity for many months to come -- and perhaps beyond British borders.
And the decision comes at an uncomfortable time. The world's central banks, normally the first responders in times of economic distress, are poorly positioned to help. Those banks have signaled that they are ready to act, with statements from the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve promptly dispatched Friday morning.
And it is looking as if the Fed is leaning toward easier money in the wake of Brexit. Futures markets priced in a 50 percent chance of a Fed interest rate hike Thursday, but that fell to 14 percent Friday after the news, along with a 12 percent chance of an interest-rate cut this year.
But both the Fed and the E.C.B. are already tilted toward cheap money -- indeed, the E.C.B. already has negative interest rates. And the Bank of England faces an extraordinarily knotty situation. It simultaneously must plan for a possible recession caused by Brexit uncertainty and for higher inflation because of the drop in the currency and outflow of capital. It can fight one of those problems, but it can't fight both at once.
So a decline in business confidence and a rise in uncertainty, paired with limited responses by central banks, makes a recession a major risk in Britain and something of a risk in the rest of Europe and the United States.
In the long run . . .
Things like business confidence, market swings and central bank responses shape the economy in the short and medium run, but over time it is bigger forces that prevail.
And this is where there is the most uncertainty of all. What will a post-E.U. Britain really look like?
The exact process by which the nation will remove itself from the union is murky; it will presumably invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which is a mere 261 words. It isn't exactly a detailed road map for extricating a country from a complex set of interconnections affecting every facet of economic life. It will take years of arduous negotiations.
One possibility -- the benign option, if you want Britain to remain well integrated with Europe -- is to model itself on Norway or perhaps Switzerland, two countries that are not part of the E.U. but maintain free trade within the bloc.
The only problem with that: The price of maintaining free access to the rest of the European marketplace for those countries is allowing free migration from E.U. member states and accepting E.U. regulations on businesses. To the degree that pro-Brexit sentiment was driven by British opposition to immigration and regulation, this solution wouldn't really solve anything.
Britain will get through the immediate financial turbulence and a possible recession just fine. The question for its future is which of two options British leaders now choose. They can maintain the status quo and remain a major international business center (while ignoring the impulse that led voters to choose "leave" in the first place). Or they can become a smaller, more isolated island that is a less important cog in the global economy -- but at least one that honors its voters' wishes.

Abstract: In November 2013, voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the State Constitution that raised the minimum wage to $8.25 in 2014 and allowed for annual increases based on the rate of inflation.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey set the stage on Thursday for another showdown with Gov. Chris Christie over the state's minimum wage.
The State Senate in Trenton passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to more than $15 an hour by 2021. That would amount to an increase of 80 percent over four years from the state's current minimum wage of $8.38 an hour.
If Mr. Christie, a Republican, signs the bill, which has already passed the State Assembly, New Jersey would join New York and California as the only states scheduled to raise their minimum wage to at least $15 an hour. Some cities outside those states, including Seattle and Washington, have adopted plans to reach $15 minimums. (The national minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.)
Mr. Christie did not comment on the Senate's passage on Thursday, but he has made his position clear in the past. He spoke in April of "the reckless effort to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour" and said it could have a "devastating impact" on the state's economy.
Democratic leaders have indicated that they would respond to a veto by seeking a public referendum next year on raising the wage to $15. That effort would be a replay of what they accomplished in 2013, when they circumvented Mr. Christie's veto of a more modest increase in the minimum wage.
In November 2013, voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the State Constitution that raised the minimum wage to $8.25 in 2014 and allowed for annual increases based on the rate of inflation. But that plan backfired in a way this year when the official measure of inflation was negative, leaving the minimum wage at $8.38 for a second year.
In the meantime, the movement known as the Fight for 15 gained momentum. Several cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, adopted plans to raise their minimums to $15 an hour, and California and New York followed suit.
Those moves left New Jersey as one of the country's most expensive places to live that had not accepted a $15 minimum. A study published in September 2014 by the United Way of Northern New Jersey found that the average household budget necessary to support a single adult was $27,552-- a sum that equates to year's salary at nearly $14 an hour.
The National Employment Law Project estimates that an increase to $15 would result in raises for about one-fourth of all workers in New Jersey. It would also increase the share of workers in the country covered by a $15 minimum wage to more than one in five, said Paul K. Sonn, program director of the employment law project, which advocates for low-wage workers.
"The $15 minimum wage is roaring across America and delivering the first big raises for workers at the bottom in decades," Mr. Sonn said in an interview. "Governor Christie will have a chance to show which side he is on, the side of the struggling middle class or the side of low-paying corporations like McDonald's and Walmart."
Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat and president of the State Senate, said he expected that "the governor will more than likely flat-out veto" the bill, which passed 21 to 18. If that happens, Mr. Sweeney said, the Democrats plan to pass legislation calling for a question on the statewide ballot in November 2017, when Mr. Sweeney could be running to succeed Mr. Christie.
Mr. Sweeney said he believed that there was broad public support for a $15 minimum and that the measure would easily be approved. He admitted that he had sponsored the 2013 amendment and that "we just didn't get it right."
Mr. Sweeney said that the last increase in the minimum wage did not hurt the state's economy as some business leaders and Republican officials had predicted. But, he added, "We thought it was going to work out better than it did." Still, he said, the state had gained 91,000 jobs since then.
"The reality is where they've done this, the economy has actually gotten better," Mr. Sweeney said. "This gives people an opportunity to have more buying power."
Correction: July 13, 2016, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on June 24 about a vote by the New Jersey Senate to eventually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour referred incorrectly to the figure $27,552 cited in a study by the United Way of Northern New Jersey. That amount is the average household budget necessary to support a single adult, not the average household income of a single adult. The article also misstated the year the study was published. It was 2014, not 2015.

Full text:   Technology NeedsCareful Evaluation
By James E. Ryan
Learning technologies offer great potential to improve education, but whether that potential will be realized depends on three key factors, which have less to do with technology itself and more to do with the people using it.
First, we need to ensure that we don't lose sight of the "learning" in learning technologies. We need to keep in mind that students learn at different rates, that it is critical to master a topic before moving to the next, that students who are engaged are likely to learn more and learn more deeply, and that active learning is more likely to engage students than passive learning.
It follows that technologies that tailor learning to the pace and interests of students are likely to have bigger payoffs than those that do not.
Second, we need to recognize that this is an adaptive challenge, not a technical one. We have to be thinking about fundamental questions like how we organize classes and schools, how we use time, how we think of the role of the teacher and what we expect students to learn. These are not technical questions but questions about organizational behavior and the role of teachers and principals.
Finally, we must be committed to impartial, third-party evaluations of learning technologies. We need to know what is working and for whom. But we cannot rush to judgment. We need to balance our sense of urgency with patience and deliberation, recognizing that fundamental change takes time.

A Four-Year DegreeIsn't for Everyone
By Jeffrey Selingo
Nearly 40 percent of American workers hold a bachelor's degree. Fifteen percent of mail carriers have a four-year degree, as do one in five clerical and sales workers.
Getting a bachelor's degree is what going to college means to most Americans. Students who do not march along are often considered -- or consider themselves -- failures.
Yet the decades-long march to college has actually closed off options for young people.
As recently as the 1970s, a high school graduate had a number of options: get a good-paying job right away, enlist in the military, find a trade apprenticeship or go to college.
Today, there are really only two options: the military or college. Yet only 52 percent of young people have either a two- or four-year degree or an industry certificate by the time they reach their mid-20s.
In the course of researching my new book, "There Is Life After College," what I heard most from employers is a worry about filling so-called middle-skill positions in advanced manufacturing, health care and information technology.
Nearly half of the American work force has these jobs today, but many of them will soon be retiring. As many as 25 million of all new job openings in the next decade will be for middle-skill jobs.
We need job-training institutions on par with academic institutions to attract students interested in pursuing these skilled jobs.
An example is the Apprentice School in Newport News, Va., where students choose from among more than 20 occupational areas and are guaranteed a job with the military contractor that operates Newport News Shipbuilding.
The school receives more than 4,000 applications each year for 230 spots.
We need more such pathways for students who don't want to travel the one route we offer them now.

Freedom to DebateMust Be Protected
By Nicholas Christakis
One of the most difficult challenges I faced this year was answering a Native American student's poignant question: Why should she put any faith in institutions in our society when those institutions had betrayed her people in generations past?
"The same Constitution with its protection of the rights to free expression and assembly that you revere," she said, "was previously of no use to people like me."
I wish I had told her that the way out of this conundrum is to make these institutions her own. These institutions could be hers, and I believe she should want them to be hers.
Students of all kinds are joining traditions that revere free expression, wide engagement, open assembly, rational debate and civil discourse.
But it is illiberal to use these traditions to censor others, to besmirch fellow students and to treat ideological claims as perforce facts. When students (and faculty) do this, they are burning the furniture to heat the house.
Open, extended conversations among students are essential to the pursuit of truth, to moral learning and to social progress. The faculty must show students a way forward: to be harder on the problems society faces, but easier on each other. We cannot be a community of searchers and learners if we do not share the same principles at the core of our universities.
Disagreement is not oppression. Argument is not assault. Words -- even provocative or repugnant ones -- are not violence. The answer to speech we do not like is more speech.
If we fail to see this, we risk confirming for our students the old joke that we wouldn't want to join a club that would have us.

Preparing TeachersFor Diverse Schools
By Marybeth Gasman
In 2014, for the first time, the nation's student body -- from kindergartners to 12th graders -- was majority-minority.
Census data predicts that by 2050 the United States over all will be majority-minority as well. Are our college and university faculties ready to teach a diverse student body? I don't think so. Faculty members receive little, if any, training on teaching, and even less on diversity issues.
For nearly two decades, I have been studying strategies for student success used by the nation's minority-serving institutions, which include historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribal colleges and universities, and Asian-American, Native American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions. Most recently, along with Clifton Conrad, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I wrote a book on this topic, "Educating a Diverse Nation" (Harvard University Press).
First, these minority-serving institutions assume success on the part of their students rather than seeing them from a deficit perspective. Second, they focus on what the student needs to learn rather than what is convenient for the professor. Third, faculty members work together on classes and curriculums that empower students. Fourth, faculty members allow students to bring their full identities to the classroom. And last, the institutions give students the opportunity to participate in culturally relevant assignments.
These approaches require a deeper understanding of teaching and a commitment to student learning.
To meet the needs of a diverse group of students, Ph.D. programs must consider teaching in addition to research when training graduate students. Research is essential, but we also must ensure that our diverse nation truly learns.

Low-Income FamiliesFace College Hurdles
By Harold Levy
For most of its history, America ignored the talents and potential of most Americans. We will never know what great progress might have been made in science, medicine, business and many other fields if we had taken advantage of the brainpower and abilities of all our people -- regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or income level.
But people from low-income families continue to face enormous obstacles.
A 2014 White House report, "Increasing College Opportunity for Low-Income Students," states, "While half of all people from high-income families have a bachelor's degree by age 25, just one in 10 people from low-income families do."
These low-income students lack money, don't get adequate counseling in high school and face many other barriers that more affluent students never encounter. To enable more low-income students to get a higher education, colleges should make socioeconomic diversity a priority. They should encourage outstanding low-income students to apply, simplify the application process and make transparent the actual tuition price and financial aid possibilities for students from struggling families.
In addition, colleges should devote more financial aid to those who need it and less to those who don't, by reducing so-called merit scholarships. Colleges should also re-examine their policies of giving preferential admissions to the children of alumni.
Current policies are resulting in an enormous waste of talent. We need to recommit ourselves to the American dream and being the land of opportunity for all.

Higher EducationAt a Crossroads
By Marvin Krislov
With student activism sweeping the country over issues like sexual assault, police brutality and racial inequality, American higher education is at a crossroads, as it was in the 1960s during the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement.
How best to serve a new generation of students facing challenges from changing demographics, rising income inequality, political tumult and doubts about whether the nation can overcome its deepest divides?
How can the value of liberal arts be demonstrated when public discourse increasingly defines educational value in terms of initial income?
How will higher education create a truly inclusive environment for a diverse group of students who question traditional modes of teaching and learning?
First, the faculty and staff must maintain high academic standards and rigor, empowering students with the intellectual tools they will need.
Second, we must welcome diverse populations and teach our students to embrace multiple perspectives, while valuing their personal experiences.
Third, our institutions must serve as laboratories for collaboration to create sustainable futures that balance idealism with financial realities.
Fourth, we must help our students find meaning in their education by communicating options and opportunities to apply learning, and by embracing new possibilities created by technology.
All parties should have a voice in these conversations: student activists who are demanding a more relevant education, parents who are making emotional and material investments in their children and faculty members who are protecting academic freedom. We all must learn from each other.

Liberal Arts SpurCreative Thinking
By Annette Gordon-Reed
One of the most important issues that educators face is skepticism about liberal arts education in an era that seems to be pushing STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math. This is not just happening in the United States. Calls to cut support for so-called soft disciplines are also made in Europe and Asia.
But just recently, the governor of Connecticut used his line-item veto power to cut support for the humanities. We seem to be rejecting the idea that it is essential for society to have people who are broadly educated, who can investigate, analyze and present their findings logically and clearly, without the aid of numbers or code.
I was a member of the Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, put together by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Our report, "The Heart of the Matter," outlined three goals for America's educational institutions: educating Americans to thrive in a 21st-century democracy; fostering a society that is innovative, competitive and strong; and equipping the nation for leadership in an interconnected world.
The commission took the position that "these goals cannot be achieved by science alone."
We need more homegrown engineers, but not everyone wants to be an engineer, or can be. Innovation is spurred by people who are creative in different ways. Gathering ideas from seemingly disparate fields can bring new ways to think about problems, allowing creativity to flourish.
We need K-12 systems that produce students able to take advantage of all that higher education has to offer. This suggests a need for greater cooperation between those schools and our institutions of higher learning.

Build CommunityThrough Respect
By John Palfrey
It is a mistake to say that diversity and free expression cannot coexist. And yet, on campus after campus, that has been the choice served up this year: You are either for diversity, equity and inclusion in our communities, or you are for free expression. The strength of our communities depends upon a commitment to upholding both, even -- perhaps especially -- when it is hardest to do so.
The American experiment is about the coexistence of diversity and free expression. That coexistence has not been easy, nor has it been all that successful, especially for those who have less power. And free expression has been interpreted in ways that have tended to support those in authority, rather than all people equitably.
That the American experiment has not yet been entirely successful, nor fairly carried out, does not mean that the principles are wrong.
Diversity and free expression ought to coexist on our campuses in particular. One purpose of education is to bring young people into contact with those of different backgrounds so that they might learn from one another.
But free expression and its close cousin, the right to assemble peaceably, do not mean that anyone can say anything to anybody at any time. The First Amendment has been interpreted to permit certain restrictions of time, place and manner on speech. On our campuses, students and faculty need to act respectfully to one another to build community.
The idea of diversity and free expression opposing one another may serve some immediate political purposes, but it will not serve our society in the long run.

A Necessary Mission To End Campus Rape
By Deborah Tuerkheimer
Campus rape is finally receiving the attention it merits. But efforts to address the problem are developing in a scattershot fashion, largely because of confusion about the university's role in responding to sexual assault.
Educational institutions cannot substitute for a functioning criminal justice system, nor should they try to replicate the civil justice model.
Universities' response to sexual assault demands a focus on their core mission: providing education in a manner that does not discriminate based on sex.
Because colleges have an obligation to provide an environment in which all students are able to learn, preventing sexual assault -- and gender-based misconduct of any kind -- is critical. The burden of prevention cannot be placed on women by instructing them how to behave. Universities must instead commit to eradicating gender violence along with the racism and sexism that sustain it.
Colleges can readily offer a range of support for victims of sexual violence, including academic accommodations, mental health services, changes in campus housing or dining locations and transportation services.
And colleges must also hold accountable those found responsible for sexual assault. A formidable challenge is to create a set of fair procedures for adjudicating contested claims. Procedural justice fosters legitimacy, trust and citizenship, all vital to a thriving academic community.
We should not ask college administrators to become prosecutors or plaintiffs' attorneys. Nor should we expect academic institutions to compensate for deficits in the criminal justice system's response to rape on and off campus. But we can demand that universities advance their mission to provide an education free of discrimination.

When Schools LookBeyond Test Scores
By Carol Dweck
Every fall I face my class of college freshmen and announce: "Your old job is over; your new job starts today."
Their old job was getting into a good college. Their new job is to become a person who will make a meaningful contribution to society.
This is the generation that will determine the future of our world. Will we succumb to climate change? Will we foster equality? Will we steward new technologies to serve rather than undermine human needs and values?
The answers depend on whether we can help students look beyond their next test score to focus on longer-term learning and life goals.
In a recent nationwide study, led by David Yeager of the University of Texas, 9,000 ninth graders were asked what kind of assignment they wanted (even if it didn't affect their grade): 63 percent wanted an easy assignment over a challenging one.
But a different group of 9,000 ninth graders in the same schools had earlier participated in an online workshop that taught them that they could expand their brains through hard work, good strategies and help from others. And it taught them why they might want to do this: to learn more and get ready for their future contribution. These students were one-third more likely to choose the challenging assignment.
The most exciting schools in America today are predicated on the belief that intellectual abilities can be developed. They foster that belief in all of their students. And they reinforce it with rigorous, meaningful learning, allowing students to envision their future contributions. These schools understand that this can make all the difference in the world.

Equipping StudentsTo Manage Emotions
By Marc Brackett
Regardless of all the honors classes they took in high school, or the science, technology and engineering classes they cram into their college curriculum, students today will not be fully prepared to compete in an increasingly global business environment.
The problem -- and the solution -- is not intellectual. It's emotional.
A survey of more than 123,000 students at 153 colleges by the American College Health Association in 2013 found that more than half experienced overwhelming anxiety and about a third felt deep depression during the school year.
This is, or should be, worrisome to educators and policy makers, not only because of the suffering that results but also because research demonstrates that the way people manage their emotions matters for personal growth and the success of the broader society and economy.
The Nobel laureate James J. Heckman has written that teaching "noncognitive" skills, including recognizing and regulating emotions, would be a cost-effective way to increase work force productivity and quality.
Teaching emotional intelligence -- or what's more broadly referred to as social and emotional learning -- to children and adults has proved to be effective and sorely needed.
It's frustrating that policies to mandate and finance evidence-based approaches to social and emotional learning are slow to come. A few states have acted on their own. Leaders in Washington and across the nation need to work to equip America's youth to be competitive for the new global century. Our future -- and our children's future -- depends on it.

Working TogetherTo Make Progress
By Freeman Hrabowski
Recently, I visited my hometown, Birmingham, Ala., to recognize high-achieving eighth graders from public schools. I found myself reflecting on my own experiences as a 12-year-old in that city, participating in the Children's March of 1963 to fight for access to a better education, and I wondered: Just how far have we come?
Only about half of students who begin college now will have earned a degree six years later; the completion rates are much lower for students of color. The gap is equally striking by income. More than 80 percent of Americans from families in the top income quartile have attained a bachelor's degree by age 24; under 10 percent of those from families in the bottom income quartile have done so. It's clear that increasing access to college is not enough.
It is not acceptable for so many students to work hard to earn a college education, often going into debt, and not to succeed.
We need communities that view student success as a collective responsibility. Young people need adults who set expectations and help them develop critical thinking skills and a sense of self. We need public policies that encourage all sectors to work together. There are no quick fixes. There weren't any quick fixes 50 years ago either, but through decades of commitment and hard work, we have made progress.
We must remain committed.

THE CHALLENGE OF COMPLETION
By John B. King Jr.
The $1.2 trillion that borrowers and their parents owe on student loans for college is an eye-popping number -- one that some policy analysts, pundits and journalists often cite in declaring a student loan crisis.
But a related challenge that deserves greater attention is the college completion challenge. President Obama has called for America to again lead the world in college graduation. Far too many students start college but do not finish; students of color, first-generation and low-income students are dropping out at higher rates than their white or better-off peers. If students borrow, they may not earn enough money to repay their loans. The typical defaulter owes less than $9,000.
The bottom line is this: Debt without a degree often leads to default.
Colleges, states and the federal government can change this. The Obama administration has made college more affordable by adding tens of billions in student aid and creating tax credits for college tuition, made it easier for students to repay their loans, and encouraged graduating on time.
Across the country, innovative leaders are showcasing strategies that work.
The University of Hawaii's graduation rate has improved significantly since the university began giving students incentives to attend class full time.
At Georgia State University, the completion rate increased by 22 percentage points over a decade as the institution offered peer advising, provided microgrants for low-income students and used data analytics to help advisers identify students at risk of dropping out.
Accelerated Study in Associate Programs, which operates at six of the City University of New York's community colleges, has shown strong results, too.
These promising examples offer hope, but colleges cannot tackle this challenge alone. Congress should support proposals such as structuring the Pell grant program to raise completion rates and providing incentives to scale up other innovative approaches. States need to share responsibility, starting by reversing the trend of disinvestment in higher education.

Costs Keep Soaring,And Families Suffer
By Joni Finney
College is becoming less and less affordable to more and more families higher and higher on the socioeconomic ladder.
According to a recent report from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt University, families earning $48,001 to $75,000 a year had to pay a significant portion of their gross income to send a student to a public four-year nondoctoral institution. On average, it cost 16 percent (in Alaska) to 33 percent (in New Jersey) of their income in 2013.
The burden was higher at public research universities, according to the report, "2016 College Affordability Diagnosis." Families would have had to pay, on average, 17 percent (Wyoming) to 31 percent (Alabama) of their income to enroll in such state-run institutions as the University of Wyoming and the University of Alabama.
Private institutions offered no relief, requiring outlays of 16 percent (Idaho) to 45 percent (Rhode Island) of family income.
Even the safety net of community colleges is fraying. Families earning $48,001 to $75,000 a year had to pay 11 percent (Mississippi) to 22 percent (Minnesota) of income to enroll in public two-year institutions.
If state policy makers are serious about improving education attainment, as they often promise to do, they must make it a priority to lower the financial burden of higher education on students from low- and middle-income families to increase their chances of enrolling and graduating.
Unless we make college affordable for people of all financial means, opportunity through higher education will be a false promise.

Make College FreeTo End Student Debt
By Randi Weingarten
For people who choose educating others over enriching themselves, college debt can seem insurmountable.
The American Federation of Teachers recently started a series of student debt clinics to help our members mitigate the crippling college debt incurred by millions of American students and their families. For some participants, the clinics have been life-changing.
In October, a young adjunct professor from Miami attended a two-part A.F.T. debt clinic. Crushed by more than $168,000 in student loan debt and monthly payments exceeding $2,000, this professor, a single mother, was desperate. After one day of training, she applied for income-based repayment and was able to reduce her monthly payment to $700. On the second day, she told the group that it was the first good night's sleep she'd had in three years.
Many people simply can't afford to seek higher education, or they pay dearly when they do. Forty-seven states are spending less per student than they did at the start of the recession, after adjusting for inflation. Tuition costs have skyrocketed, putting more of the burden on students and their families.
When our country realized the value of educating all students through high school, we made high school universally free. The same should be done for college today.
The men and women who teach in our public schools, colleges and universities have invested in their own education so that they can, in turn, invest in the students in their classrooms. They know they won't be rewarded with huge paychecks, but neither should they be punished with crushing college debt.
President, American Federation of Teachers

Full text:   If Donald Trump were elected president and put in his stated policies, the United States would experience a lengthy recession, enormous job losses, much higher interest rates and diminished long-term growth prospects. At least, that is the conclusion of economists from Moody's Analytics, a recent analysis highlighted by Hillary Clinton in a speech Tuesday.
The Trump campaign has noted, accurately, that the lead author of the study, Mark Zandi, has informally advised the Obama administration and donated to Democratic campaigns.
So what should a properly skeptical person think of the new report?
Is it an accurate projection of what will happen to the economy if Mr. Trump's preferred policies become law, or partisan fear-mongering? Given that a presidential campaign is a contest of competing forecasts, here's how to think about the many predictions you'll hear between now and November.
A careful reading of the Moody's report shows this: Its underlying assumptions about what Mr. Trump would do as president and how the effects of those policies would ripple through the economy are plausible, and squarely within the mainstream consensus view among economic forecasters about how the economy works. But the report also offers a big helping of false precision, giving exact numerical forecasts on effects that have vast amounts of uncertainty.
It's worth being skeptical about Moody's projection that Trump's policies would cause a 1.5 percent contraction in gross domestic product in 2019. After all, forecasters aren't even sure what G.D.P. growth will turn out to be in the second quarter of 2016, which ends in nine days. To forecast growth three years from now under an unknowable set of policies is more an intellectual exercise than anything exact.
It's not as useful to look at numerical projections that are almost certain to be wrong. Instead, let's examine the analytical judgments underlying those numbers -- and what they say about the direction of the economy in a Trump presidency:
Tax cuts and larger deficits would stimulate at first, then cause a contraction. Mr. Trump has advocated major tax cuts, including reducing the highest income tax rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent and increasing the standard deduction for all filers. On spending, he has said he would maintain the military, Social Security and Medicare, and raise spending on veterans health care.
These actions would stimulate the economy at first -- the Moody's projection has stronger growth in 2017 in a Trump administration than in a baseline case. But over time they would translate to higher deficits that would push interest rates much higher and crowd out other activity in the economy, given that they forecast the economy will be near its full potential when the next president takes office in January 2017.
Moody's predicts that Trump policies would push 10-year Treasury bond yields to 8.6 percent in 2018, compared with 1.6 percent today and 3 percent in their base case -- leading to a contraction in business investment, housing and consumer spending. The money the government would need to borrow to fund a much larger deficit would squeeze out business investment, housing and consumer spending.
Mass deportations would be a negative supply shock. The simple version of this is that if there are fewer workers in the United States because the Trump administration deports millions of undocumented immigrants or makes life unpleasant enough for them that they leave voluntarily, the nations's economic output would fall.
As immigrants leave, the Moody's researchers write, employers will struggle to fill the vacated jobs. "Many of these positions will go unfilled, because, by the time the Trump administration is underway, the U.S. is expected to be at full employment, meaning there will be no slack labor out of which to hire workers." Some businesses that are heavily reliant on immigrant labor would close. To the degree the labor shortage drives up wages, it would be counteracted by Federal Reserve interest rate increases to try to slow the economy and combat inflation.
Trade wars would raise prices and reduce exports. The researchers assume a Trump administration would slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports and a 35 percent one on Mexican imports, which in the Moody's model raises overall consumer prices by 3 percent.
Meanwhile, they figure that a retaliatory response from China and Mexico would result in new tariffs and lower American exports to those countries, reducing economic activity. And higher interest rates in the United States and a sense of global uncertainty around a potential trade war would drive up the dollar, making all United States exporters less competitive.
These underlying assumptions, while built on a large body of economic research, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable.
Conservatives have long argued that lower taxes on the wealthy will generate more investment and economic activity, which would offset some of the increased deficits evident in the Moody's model. Immigration skeptics might argue that an exit of undocumented immigrants would drive up wages and would pull more native-born workers into the labor force who are currently out of it. Perhaps Mr. Trump's plans for tough negotiation with China and Mexico really would yield new, more favorable arrangements that don't create import inflation or a trade war that reduces exports.
But while the predictions of a recession and slower long-term growth got all the attention in the new report, understanding why these particular economic forecasters see these effects is more useful.
And there's a lesson there in making sense of any forecast or analysis of a candidate's policies: Focus less on the conclusion, and more on how the researcher got there.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- Year after year of disappointing growth in the United States. Disappearing middle-class jobs. Turmoil overseas, including the looming possibility that British voters will decide on Thursday to part ways with Europe. Urgent economic issues all.
But what did some lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee want to talk about on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, was called before them for her semiannual testimony to Congress? Whether the Federal Reserve, which has the power to create money at will, is solvent.
Ms. Yellen's final appearance before the presidential election in November was a master class in how many members of Congress have allowed real debate about the country's economic challenges to be subsumed in the broader political din.
Wednesday's hearing followed a more sober session on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, where Ms. Yellen laid out a cautious view of the economy's prospects, playing down the risk of recession while reiterating that near-term weakness may prompt the Fed to hold off on any imminent rate increases.
With that message dominating the headlines, it was the turn of House members to pressure the central bank, which has become a bête noire for the right, just as it once was for the left in years past.
For the most part, Ms. Yellen didn't fall into any traps, echoing the academic, even remote tone adopted by predecessors like Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan in the face of congressional gadflies and firebrands.
There were moments during the three-hour hearing when the Kabuki-type theater briefly abated and Ms. Yellen was asked to address the economic questions that many ordinary Americans are wrestling with, too.
Representative Denny Heck, a Washington Democrat, noted that the government's best-known yardstick for unemployment stands at a healthy 4.7 percent.
But he pointed out that a broader measure of joblessness, which includes part-time workers who can't find full-time work, is still more than twice as high, an unusually large gap by historical standards that underscores the paucity of gains in the current recovery for many workers.
"I agree with you," Ms. Yellen said, before acknowledging that the higher rate shows just how much slack remains as the economic recovery approaches its seventh anniversary.
And Representative Ed Royce, a California Republican, queried Ms. Yellen on the impact of negative interest rates in Europe and Asia even as the Fed considers an interest rate increase in the coming months.
That spread in rates could have major implications for the dollar, Ms. Yellen explained, noting how exchange rates are sensitive to monetary policy and affect things as varied as inflation and overall economic conditions.
But the insights from Ms. Yellen, who taught economics at the University of California, Berkeley, for many years, were soon drowned by the dog whistles and dubious political point-scoring.
Representative Scott Garrett, a senior Republican on the Financial Services Committee, accused Ms. Yellen of unfairly aiding Wall Street and worsening income inequality.
That's a serious issue, subject to intense debate among economists, but Mr. Garrett made it partisan by accusing Ms. Yellen of making statements that were "eerily similar to what the administration has said," and then giving her little opportunity to explain her position.
"Why do you see a need to benefit Goldman Sachs?" he asked.
"I'm sorry, we are not trying to benefit the rich," Ms. Yellen responded, before trying to interject that more than 14 million jobs had been created since the recession ended in 2009.
"Excuse me, I have the floor," said Mr. Garrett, not long before the chairman's gavel brought the unenlightening exchange to an end.
Representative Frank Guinta, a New Hampshire Republican, was more polite. But he noted that the Great Depression, stagflation of the 1970s and most recently the Great Recession had all taken place since the Fed's creation more than a century ago, apparently confusing correlation with causation.
He then wandered off on a tangent to inquire how often Ms. Yellen consults with Richard Cordray of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and what thoughts she had on the agency's budget.
An apparently puzzled Ms. Yellen pointed out that it is her staff that deals with Mr. Cordray, a longtime Republican target, before waving off how the new agency is funded as a matter for Congress, which holds the government's purse strings, not the Fed.
Using an unusual metaphor not found in economic textbooks, the committee's chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, compared the central bank's tradition of charging banks interest on reserves at the Fed to how his son chases his daughter around the house with a Louisville Slugger baseball bat.
Then it was the turn of Representative Sean P. Duffy, a Wisconsin Republican, to cite the imposition of hundreds of thousands of pages of regulations in recent years. He wanted to know if that was among the "headwinds" Ms. Yellen has cited as hurting growth.
"Are you referring to our regulations?" she asked.
"I'm talking about government regulations," he responded. "Why don't you cite it as a headwind?"
"It's very hard to quantify the extent to which regulations is headwind," she said. "Businesses certainly cite regulation as a factor."
After a fruitless attempt to get Ms. Yellen to call health insurance costs for Wisconsin manufacturers a headwind, Mr. Duffy gave up in a fit of pique.
"I'll accept that as a nonanswer," he said.
Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican, and other members peppered Ms. Yellen with questions on whether the Fed itself is too big to fail, wondering aloud whether the central bank was a threat to global stability and needed to be subject to the kind of "stress tests" it forces commercial banks to go through.
"Our balance sheet is very different," she replied. "The Fed is very different from a commercial bank."
Still, at least one committee member, Representative Gwen Moore, a Wisconsin Democrat, stepped in to defend Ms. Yellen, turning attention back to her fellow lawmakers.
"The failure is Congress's failure, not the Fed's," she said. "Stop derailing us with nonsense."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Weak economic growth in the United States could force the Federal Reserve to hold off on any imminent interest rate increases, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told Congress on Tuesday.
While Ms. Yellen said that the American economy's long-term prospects remain favorable, she signaled that headwinds, including slower employment gains in recent months, weak productivity growth and the persistence of a sluggish pace of inflation have prompted the Fed to adopt a more cautious stance.
"The latest readings on the labor market and the weak pace of investment illustrate one downside -- that domestic demand might falter," Ms. Yellen said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
Ms. Yellen's overall message on Capitol Hill echoed her comments at a news conference last week after the Fed's decision to hold rates steady. But her tenor suggested that there was little chance of an increase in the benchmark federal funds rate at the central bank's next meeting, in July, and that a move when policy makers meet again in September is hardly guaranteed.
"Proceeding cautiously in raising the federal funds rate will allow us to keep the monetary support to economic growth in place while we assess whether growth is returning to a moderate pace," she said.
Mirroring the habit of Fed leaders going back decades, Ms. Yellen hedged her bets, emphasizing her positive outlook for the years ahead, if not the coming quarter or two.
But she acknowledged influential voices in academia and elsewhere who have warned that long-term growth could be substantially below the pace achieved in the decades before the Great Recession.
"Although I am optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy, we cannot rule out the possibility expressed by some prominent economists that the slow productivity growth seen in recent years will continue in the future," she said.
In the question-and-answer portion of the hearing, Ms. Yellen termed recent productivity growth "disappointing," and pointed out that business investment had been similarly weak during the recovery. She added that the productivity issue was something Congress needed to address by improving polices for workplace training and other issues.
Ms. Yellen's appearance is part of two days of testimony before Congress that the Fed leader is required to present twice each year. Another session is scheduled on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee.
Her previous testimony on monetary policy was in February, so this week's appearance before Congress is Ms. Yellen's last before the presidential election in November.
As a result, Ms. Yellen received a barrage of questions on everything from the course of interest rates and banking regulation in the United States to the potential fallout if British voters decide in favor of leaving the European Union when they go to the polls on Thursday.
Responding to opening questions from Senator Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking committee, Ms. Yellen emphasized that until recently, the job market had held up well despite "mixed developments in the economy."
Noting that the jobs data for May was disappointing, she nonetheless said that "it is important we don't overblow the significance of single report."
"If the slowdown is a reflection of weak growth earlier in the year, I'm hopeful we will see stronger job gains going forward," she added.
Ms. Yellen called the possibility of a so-called Brexit "significant for the United Kingdom and Europe," and said that if Britain left the European Union it could usher in a period of uncertainty and volatility "that could affect market conditions and the U.S. economic outlook."
Late in the hearing, Ms. Yellen said that while the Fed was closely monitoring the Brexit vote and the possible consequences of a vote to leave, she was not offering advice on how to vote.
Although the decision "is a unique event that has no close parallel," she said, the Fed "is not attempting to take a stand. I am not providing advice in that sense."
Under questioning from Senator Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, Ms. Yellen took aim at a recent suggestion from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, that one option in managing the federal debt might be to force investors to accept less than the face value of what the government owed.
So-called haircuts aren't unusual for bondholders of troubled companies, or for businesses going through bankruptcy, like the ones Mr. Trump controlled as a businessman. But she made clear such a strategy could prove disastrous for the government and the economy alike.
"I feel the consequences for the United States and the global economy for defaulting on Treasury debt would be very severe," she said, avoiding mentioning Mr. Trump by name. "At a minimum, it could result in much higher borrowing costs for U.S. households and businesses."
Despite the Fed's first move to tighten monetary policy in a decade in December, interest rates remain extremely low by historical standards and not too far above the so-called zero-bound.
That kind of accommodation provides support for the economy, Ms. Yellen said, but it does rob the Fed of what she called a "tried and true" tool in the face of an economic shock: a rate cut to spur growth.
For now, though, Ms. Yellen saw little reason to fear an impending crisis and she dismissed fears among some on Wall Street that the Fed has contributed to imbalances in the markets. "I don't see any evidence," she said, "of those broad-based financial stability concerns."
And for all her caution about the outlook for the economy, Ms. Yellen said she did not see a recession on the horizon.
"The odds of a recession are low," she said. Even as the Fed chairwoman listed headwinds like a weak manufacturing sector, lower commodity prices and job losses in the energy sector, she said, "I remain quite optimistic."
Recessions are usually preceded by the threat of rising inflation and tightening monetary policy, she said. "We don't have any such conditions in play right now."

Abstract: Key members of this organization, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and the United States, should demand that the Venezuelan government start allowing the delivery of humanitarian aid and permit the opposition to hold a referendum on whether Mr. Maduro's term should end early.

Full text:   As growing lawlessness, looting and hunger threaten to plunge Venezuela into a state of anarchy, its neighbors remain strikingly reluctant to confront President Nicolás Maduro.
There have been unabashed enablers, a shrinking but resolute camp of left-wing governments that have served as apologists for the despotic president. There are the co-opted, a pack of Caribbean and Central American nations that have turned a blind eye to Mr. Maduro's abuses in exchange for subsidized oil. And there are the ambivalent, a large and powerful group of nations that only gently criticize the government of Venezuela, if at all, for its mounting human rights violations.
On Thursday, diplomats from across the hemisphere are scheduled to convene in Washington at the request of Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, to discuss Venezuela's descent into chaos. Key members of this organization, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and the United States, should demand that the Venezuelan government start allowing the delivery of humanitarian aid and permit the opposition to hold a referendum on whether Mr. Maduro's term should end early.
Clearly, the Maduro government has failed to govern democratically, a commitment required of all O.A.S. member nations. Mr. Maduro has packed crucial state institutions, including the Supreme Court, with loyalists and has stymied the opposition-run Parliament at every turn. His government has kept political opponents arbitrarily jailed for years.
The calamity in Venezuela is multipronged and won't be solved without comprehensive reforms, which the Maduro regime has been unwilling to even contemplate. The government has been refusing offers of humanitarian aid, even as Venezuelans perish in growing numbers because hospitals have run out of medicine, and food has grown so scarce that trucks and shops are routinely looted.
In the long run, Venezuela will most likely need help from international financial institutions to start addressing its runaway inflation, avoid defaulting on its loans and diversify an economy that has been perilously dependent on oil and vulnerable to its price fluctuations.
None of this is likely to happen unless the political opposition succeeds in its push to oust Mr. Maduro through constitutional means. But without firm international pressure, Mr. Maduro, whose term ends in 2019, may find a way to sabotage the recall vote.
If regional leaders fail to take a strong and united stand against Mr. Maduro, Venezuela's crisis can only be expected to grow. That would lead to more violent political confrontations and, quite likely, an exodus into neighboring countries. Leaders in those nations should realize that this disaster is now very close to becoming their problem.

Full text:   Consider her found.
Putting to rest worries of sequel fatigue and a soft overall start to the summer box office, at least for now, the strongly reviewed "Finding Dory" (Disney) arrived to $136.2 million in estimated weekend ticket sales in North America, setting a record for a Pixar film, even when adjusting for inflation.
The results are a return to form for Pixar, which suffered disappointing sales in the fall for "The Good Dinosaur." "Finding Dory," a sequel to "Finding Nemo" that cost at least $300 million to make and market worldwide, played in 4,305 theaters in the United States and Canada, one of the widest releases for an animated film. About 3,200 locations played the film in 3-D, which raised the ticket price by $3 to $5.
Overseas, "Finding Dory" took in an additional $50 million. Audience interest was always expected to be huge: Dory, a memory-impaired blue tang fish, has emerged in recent years as one of Disney's most popular characters. She has more than 25 million followers on Facebook, leaving Mickey, Minnie and most other Disney characters in the dust. (Tinker Bell and Capt. Jack Sparrow come close.)
Still, after adjusting for ticket price increases over the years, "Finding Dory" fell a dorsal fin short of breaking the opening record for an animated film. The record-holder remains "Shrek the Third," which took in an adjusted $140.9 million in 2007.
Second place for the weekend went to "Central Intelligence" (New Line and Universal), an action comedy starring Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson that cost roughly $50 million to make. It collected an estimated $34.5 million in its first weekend in domestic release, a better-than-expected result.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Much of the bond market has been living in a bizarro world of negative interest rates in which the traditional relationship between lender and borrower is inverted, as I wrote in March. The United States Treasury is not selling bonds with negative interest rates, but yields on 10-year Treasuries have plummeted as well, dropping close to 1.5 percent on Thursday. Since 1981, such securities have yielded more than 6.3 percent, on average, a staggeringly large gap.

Full text:   The markets have been sending out distress signals. Stock volatility has risen sharply and bond yields have fallen below zero in part of the world while rising sky high elsewhere -- all indications of distress as Britain approaches a pivotal vote on whether to exit the European Union.
With turmoil like this, it's easy to see why the Federal Reserve would stand pat on interest rates, as it did on Wednesday: safety first. With the global economy looking shaky, it must have seemed unwise to tighten the monetary policy screws further.
But the Fed faces difficult choices. A look at its own data suggests that its policies have led to financial imbalances that place it under pressure to raise rates, as it has repeatedly said it will do.
One problem is that the purchases of trillions of dollars of bonds by the Federal Reserve and other central banks in a strategy known as quantitative easing have contributed to the extraordinarily low yields in much of the bond market.
Another, less obvious problem is that by helping to engineer such low rates, the Fed has helped create a surge in American household wealth that has far outstripped growth in wages and incomes. Low interest rates increase bond values directly, because rates (also known as yields) and bond prices move in opposite directions. Those low yields have made many other investments, from stocks to houses and other real estate, much more appealing in comparison. This increase in wealth may have helped stimulate the economy, but because wealth has grown so much faster than wage income since the last financial crisis, measures of inequality, in both wealth and income, have worsened.
"The Fed's policies are largely responsible for creating a wealth cycle," said Joseph G. Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein. "It's past time that the Fed took some action."
Yet the case for holding rates steady, and not touching the Fed funds rate (the central bank's crucial short-term rate) is easy to make, and the Fed made it on Wednesday. In a statement, it warned of risks facing the still fragile domestic economy. And in a news conference, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said that next Thursday's British referendum could "have consequences" for global markets. She said: "It could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy. "
Polls indicate it is quite possible that British voters will decide that their country should leave the European Union. The British pound, Britain's global trade, the status of the City of London as a world financial capital -- all could be threatened, and so could the stability of the rest of the European Union. In merely two days, Monday and Tuesday, the VIX index, a measure of expected volatility in the stock market, leapt 20 percent. Yields of bonds of troubled countries on the eurozone periphery, like Greece and Spain, rose to levels not reached in months, as investors demanded more rewards for the risks of holding them.
What's more, the yields of sovereign bonds in core countries like Germany and France plummeted as global investors sought a semblance of safety. This has produced some strange results: For the first time in history, the yield on the 10-year German bond moved into negative territory on Tuesday.
What that means is difficult to comprehend. Buy a bond and you get an investment that erodes in value. People who buy bonds that pay negative rates are essentially accepting that deal. Much of the bond market has been living in a bizarro world of negative interest rates in which the traditional relationship between lender and borrower is inverted, as I wrote in March. Over the last few months, as global economic weakness has persisted, the zone of negative yields has expanded, from around $7 trillion worth of global bonds to more than $10 trillion, with no end in sight.
Yields on numerous sovereign notes of shorter maturities of, say, five years have been negative for some time. The list includes Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. A saving grace, for investors in such bonds, is that if yields keep dropping, prices, which move in the opposite direction, will rise, and handsome profits can be made when the securities are sold.
The United States Treasury is not selling bonds with negative interest rates, but yields on 10-year Treasuries have plummeted as well, dropping close to 1.5 percent on Thursday. Since 1981, such securities have yielded more than 6.3 percent, on average, a staggeringly large gap. The current ultralow Treasury yields make sense only when compared with the even lower yields available elsewhere around the world.
While the Fed influences the entire fixed-income market, it directly controls only short-term yields through the Fed funds rate, which it raised to 0.25 percent, from nearly zero, in December. The Fed has repeatedly said it would increase that rate further, only to backpedal. On Wednesday, it did so again, forecasting that the rate would reach only 1.6 percent next year, down from a projection of 1.9 percent made in March; and only 2.4 percent in 2018, down from a March projection of 3 percent.
While wage inflation appears to be on the increase, and the unemployment rate is quite low at 4.7 percent, some recent data on the labor market and on inflation has been disappointing, gross domestic product has been growing slowly, and the Fed has decided to be extremely cautious in setting rates.
Yet from the perspective of household wealth and asset prices, the dangers of Fed inaction are readily apparent. By keeping interest rates low for so many years, the Fed has not merely reduced fixed-income yields. It has increased the value of other assets, to spectacular effect.
In the first quarter of this year, the Fed's report, "Financial Accounts of the United States," shows, total household wealth rose by $837 billion, to $88.1 trillion. That figure, which includes the value of financial assets and homes owned by American households and nonprofit corporations, increased $32.5 trillion, or 58 percent, since the end of the last recession in June 2009.
Growth of household wealth has outstripped income, enriching those lucky enough to have houses and financial investments and leaving those who rely solely on wage income far behind. Asset prices may not be high enough to call them a bubble, but they are high enough for ordinary people to exercise caution. That wasn't the case in 2009, when the Fed embarked on its loose monetary policy, deliberately encouraging people to buy riskier assets.
In Mr. Carson's view, it's past time to raise rates, both to stay ahead of inflation and rein in speculative excess.
Higher interest rates would even have a stimulative effect for a while, he says, because people with savings would benefit from higher interest payments.
Yet with the threat of disruptions abroad, and economic growth tepid at best in the United States, arguments for waiting longer prevail. Central banks are in a tough spot, dealing with economic problems for which quick remedies are not readily apparent.

Full text:   Economists, like physicians, sometimes confront a patient with an obvious problem but no obvious diagnosis. That is precisely the situation we face right now.
Let's start with the problem.
There is no simple way to gauge an economy's health. But if you had to choose just one statistic, it would be gross domestic product. Real G.D.P. measures the total income produced within an economy, adjusted for the overall level of prices.
Here is the sad fact: Over the last decade, the growth rate of real G.D.P. per person has averaged just 0.44 percent per year, compared with the historical norm of 2.0 percent. At a rate of 2.0 percent, incomes double every 35 years. At a rate of 0.44 percent, it takes about 160 years to double.
It may be tempting to blame the Great Recession of 2008-9 for the paltry 10-year growth rate. Indeed, this recession was a deep one.
Yet the explanation for the poor long-run performance is not that simple. The recession of 1982 was also a deep one. The unemployment rate peaked at 10.8 percent in 1982, compared with a peak of 10 percent in 2009. But by the first quarter of 1989, as Ronald Reagan was leaving the White House, the 10-year growth rate was up to 2.1 percent.
The difference: The 1982 recession was followed by a robust recovery, whereas the recession of 2008-9 has been followed by a meager one.
So what's wrong with the economy? No one knows for sure. But numerous theories are being bandied about. Here are five of them:
A statistical mirage Some Silicon Valley economists suggest that there really isn't a problem. When quality improvements and new products are pervasive and so different from what came before, the national income accountants who construct gross domestic product might underestimate how much life is getting better. Think of how your smartphone now replaces your camera, GPS, music system and various other previously stand-alone devices. According to this theory, the problem is not in the economy but in the statistics.
There is, however, reason to doubt that this is the whole story. Polls indicate that most Americans think the country is on the wrong track, and that the economy is their top concern. This dissatisfaction comes not from studying the national income statistics but from their day-to-day experiences, which are not living up to their aspirations.
A hangover from the crisis The recession of 2008-9 was caused by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Maybe something about financial crises makes recovery from a downturn all the more difficult.
During the recent crisis, many feared another Great Depression would follow. We averted that catastrophe, but the anxiety may linger, causing businesses to be reluctant to borrow to finance risky investments and banks reluctant to finance them. The good news is that hangovers eventually dissipate, but patience is required.
Secular stagnation Lawrence H. Summers, former economic adviser to President Obama, has suggested that the problem predates the recent financial crisis. He points to the long-term decline in inflation-adjusted interest rates as evidence of reduced demand for capital to fund investment projects. He cites several reasons for the change, including lower population growth, lower prices for capital goods and the nature of recent innovations, like the replacement of brick-and-mortar stores with retail websites. The result, he says, is secular stagnation -- a persistent inability of the economy to generate sufficient demand to maintain full employment.
His solution? More government spending on infrastructure, like roads, bridges and airports. If the government takes advantage of lower interest rates to make the right investments in public capital -- admittedly a big if -- the policy would promote employment in the short run as projects are being built and make the economy more productive when they are put into use.
Slower innovation Robert Gordon, author of "The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War," believes the pace of innovative activity has declined. Previous generations introduced electricity, indoor plumbing and the internal combustion engine. This generation's innovations, like the smartphone and social media, are just not as life-changing.
This theory is the most pessimistic. If he's right, we may have little choice but to get used to slower growth.
Policy missteps When Barack Obama took office in 2009, the economy was in the midst of the Great Recession. President Obama's advisers relied on standard Keynesian theory when they proposed a large increase in government spending to energize the economy. The stimulus package was the administration's first economic policy initiative. As the economy recovered, the administration supported tax increases to shrink the budget deficit.
But even at the time, there were reasons to doubt this approach. A 2002 study of United States fiscal policy by the economists Olivier Blanchard and Roberto Perotti found that "both increases in taxes and increases in government spending have a strong negative effect on private investment spending." They noted that this finding is "difficult to reconcile with Keynesian theory."
Consistent with this, a more recent study of international data by the economists Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna found that "fiscal stimuli based on tax cuts are more likely to increase growth than those based on spending increases."
So there they are. One sickness, five diagnoses. Unfortunately, I have no idea which one is right. The truth may well involve a bit of each.

Full text:   This is the buzz saw that Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, walked into as she addressed the news media -- and by extension, every trading floor on earth -- Wednesday afternoon.
The Fed's official mission is to take care of the American economy, and the economy is doing pretty well. The unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, its lowest in nine years and around the level Federal Reserve officials think is sustainable in the long run. Wages are rising steadily. After a soft first quarter, economic growth is accelerating.
For Ms. Yellen, a labor economist with decades of experience, it all points to a recipe for higher inflation, a single month of weak jobs data notwithstanding. Some of her colleagues would also emphasize that keeping rates too low could create imbalances in the economy and spur new financial crises.
But global financial markets aren't having it. If you take bond and currency markets at face value, the underlying path of growth in the United States is too weak and global deflationary forces too powerful; the Fed will need to raise interest rates much slower than its officials say they expect.
If markets could talk, they would be saying: "We don't think you'll raise interest rates as much as you say, and if you do it anyway you'll probably regret it."
All 17 top officials of the Fed expect an interest rate increase to happen this year, according to projections they released Wednesday. Yet financial futures markets price in only about a 40 percent chance that it will happen. Fed officials envision a 2.4 percent interest rate target at the end of 2018, versus 0.6 percent that is priced into the markets. Fed officials see inflation rising to its target of 2 percent by 2018 and staying there; the price of inflation-protected bonds implies it will be much lower.
There are technical factors that distort those market signals, as Ms. Yellen noted in her news conference. For example, aggressive bond-buying by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan may be sending money flooding across borders into higher-yielding American bonds, making American rates lower than the economic fundamentals would justify.
But even with those distortions, Ms. Yellen and the Fed face danger if they ignore these market signals entirely. A pattern has repeated for years: Markets expect slower growth, lower inflation and a slower path of rate increases than Fed officials themselves; markets turn out to be right.
Two years ago, for example, the median projection among Fed officials was that its interest rate target would be 2.5 percent at the end of 2016. A year ago it was 1.68 percent at the end of 2016. Now both look like pipe dreams. Fed leaders expect a 0.9 percent rate at the end of the year, and markets expect 0.4 percent.
Ms. Yellen and the Fed have been grappling with which set of signals to listen to, and the tone that pervaded her news conference Wednesday was one of uncertainty.
"We're quite uncertain about where rates are heading in the longer term," she said. "Many of us believe as a base case it's reasonable to assume those rates will move up over time, but we aren't certain about that. There could be revisions in either direction."
Ultimately, by holding off on a June rate increase and marking down rate forecasts for the months ahead, the Fed nudged its views toward market views.
As Fed officials make their decisions at their remaining four meetings of 2016, the issue that hangs over them is as complex as ever. It is not merely about evaluating how the United States economy is doing and whether it remains solidly on track -- and given the flaws in economic data, that job is hard enough.
Fed officials must also weigh whether the global force of low inflation is so powerful as to continue dragging down prices in the United States even after the domestic economy has healed. They have to figure out whether the feedback loops between economic weakness and easy money in other countries create unconventional risks to the United States by raising rates too quickly.
The 2008 financial crisis was a profound test of the Fed's ability to prevent economic collapse; from 2009 to 2012, the central bank made crucial decisions to keep pushing the United States economy toward recovery.
This year is showing just how intricate the exit from this era of easy money will truly be.

Full text:   The stock market fell for a fifth straight day Wednesday as investors set aside the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision and remained focused on next week's vote on whether Britain would remain in the European Union.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.82 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,071.50, and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.62 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,834.93.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,640.17.
As expected, the Federal Reserve voted to keep interest rates unchanged at their current level of 0.25 to 0.50 percent. In its statement, the Fed said that while United States economic activity continued to strengthen, "the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed," a reference to the April and May job reports that were weaker than anticipated.
Kristina Hooper, head of United States investment strategies at Allianz Global Investors, said after the decision was announced, "They needed to hit the pause button for June, but I think a July rate hike still remains a distinct possibility."
United States government bond prices remained high, keeping yields low. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.58 percent from 1.61 percent a day earlier. Bond investors said the uncertainty about the British vote had forced European investors to buy up United States government bonds in a search for yield and security, pushing bond yields to their lowest levels in years.
"We are in a rare moment where the highest-quality creditor, the United States, is also the creditor with the highest interest rate," said Brandon Swensen, senior portfolio manager and co-head of United States fixed income at RBC Global Asset Management.
Most investors remained focused on the other side of the Atlantic. There is considerable uncertainty about whether British voters will choose, in a June 23 referendum, to leave the European Union, referred to as a Brexit. The repercussions of such a move are not clear.
During her news conference, the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said the coming vote was one of the reasons the central bank kept interest rates unchanged.
Ms. Hooper of Allianz said a potential Brexit had "not loomed as large with investors as it should have."
In economic data, the Fed said on Wednesday that industrial output -- which includes factories, mines and utilities -- dropped 0.4 percent from April. The decline reversed the 0.6 percent gain seen between April and March, an improvement that was taken as a sign the industrial economy was turning around.
"The industrial side of the U.S. economy remains under pressure," said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group.
Manufacturing fell 0.4 percent last month, as motor vehicle production tumbled 4.4 percent. Mining production rose 0.2 percent, helped by a rebound in coal, but remained down 11.5 percent from a year ago. Utilities slipped 1 percent.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said that its Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, increased 0.4 percent in May after a 0.2 percent rise in April. It was the biggest gain since a similar 0.4 percent increase in January.
Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, was up 0.3 percent in May, an acceleration from a modest 0.1 percent rise in April, indicating that inflation, which has been below the Fed's preferred 2 percent pace, could be starting to accelerate.
Among individual companies, Whole Foods Market shares fell $1.62, or 5 percent, to $30.90 after the Food and Drug Administration said there were "serious violations" at a kitchen in Massachusetts that may have resulted in contaminated food and the grocery chain had not done enough to fix them.
Benchmark United States crude oil fell 48 cents to close at $48.01 a barrel in New York. The price has fallen 6.3 percent over the last five days. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 86 cents to close at $48.97 a barrel in London.
In other energy commodities, wholesale gasoline futures fell 2 cents, to $1.50 a gallon; heating oil closed down 2 cents, to $1.48 a gallon; and natural gas fell 1 cent, to $2.595 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The dollar fell to 106.01 yen from 106.12 yen. The euro edged up to $1.1251 from $1.1204.
Gold prices rose 20 cents, to $1,285.80 an ounce. Silver rose 8 cents, to $17.50 an ounce, and copper closed up 5 cents, to $2.091 a pound.

German 10-Year Bond Yield Goes Negative on 'Brexit' Fears

Abstract: A sluggish global economy and uncertainty surrounding the coming vote in Britain over whether to leave the European Union have some investors rushing for safe havens. The European Central Bank is also printing money to buy bonds in an effort to bolster the eurozone's weak growth.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- At first it seems illogical to buy bonds at prices practically guaranteed to lose money.
But there are good reasons that the yields on 10-year German bonds dipped below zero percent on Tuesday for the first time, meaning investors are essentially paying Berlin to keep their money.
Fear is probably paramount. A sluggish global economy and uncertainty surrounding the coming vote in Britain over whether to leave the European Union have some investors rushing for safe havens.
The European Central Bank is also printing money to buy bonds in an effort to bolster the eurozone's weak growth. That has pushed prices higher, and made yields go down.
It has all created a topsy-turvy world for bonds, where investors are actually paying governments for the privilege of holding their debt. The German 10-year bonds are just the latest to fall into negative territory, after those in Switzerland and Japan. Yields on German five-year bonds fell below zero last year.
While many central banks are pushing for low or even negative rates, the new world order could create unexpected consequences. Much of the global financial system is based on above-zero interest rates. Banks, pension funds and insurance companies depend on interest-bearing investments for a big part of their profits.
Stock prices around the world have been falling since last week, and European shares are near three-month lows. Some investors are preferring to hoard cash until conditions improve.
The surge of fear lately stems from the so-called Brexit vote. Recent polls are showing that support in Britain for leaving the European Union is on the rise: More voters are backing a departure from the bloc than are opting to stay. If Britain drops out, the future of the European Union could be in doubt, and financial markets would be in for a rough ride.
Top officials of the European Central Bank, including Mario Draghi, the president, have said they have contingency plans if voters in Britain choose to leave the bloc. The central bank is battle-tested after enduring a series of crises since 2007, and it already has mechanisms in place to ensure that banks and businesses will be able to get access to all the pounds or euros they need. "The E.C.B. is ready for any outcome," Mr. Draghi said this month.
Still, investors are nervous. And the cash -- or liquidity in technical investment terms -- that is sloshing around the eurozone looking for a home is not helping. For that, the European Central Bank is partly to thank, or to blame, depending on your point of view. For a year, the central bank has effectively been printing money and using it to buy government bonds. This month, the bank began buying corporate debt as well, spending about 80 billion euros, or around $90 billion, per month.
All that buying drives down interest rates across the board, more so for the safest assets. Investors trust Germany because the government has a budget surplus, a healthy economy and a long history of fulfilling its obligations.
The low-inflation environment is another important part of the equation for investors. At least for now, bondholders do not need to worry about their money losing too much value. When prices are weak, investors can even come out ahead despite paying negative interest rates. The real buying power of their euros can increase enough to more than compensate.
And most economists do not see any risk that inflation will pick up soon, anyway. The global economy is simply too weak. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has warned that the world is locked in a "low-growth trap." The International Monetary Fund lowered its economic expansion forecasts at its last meeting in April. And the Federal Reserve in the United States, meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, is likely to postpone an interest rate increase.
The outlook is so dismal that some investors may be betting that yields will fall even further. The yield on the German 10-year bond went as low as minus 0.03 percent at midday. An investor who bought at that price could make a profit if market rates dropped below that level. In June 2015, the yield was 0.92 percent, a rate that once would have been regarded as ridiculously low.
From the European Central Bank's point of view, low interest rates are the whole point. The bank set a precedent for negative interest rates two years ago when it began charging banks to keep money in its virtual vaults, instead of paying them interest as it did in the past. The so-called negative deposit rate is currently minus 0.4 percent.
The lower borrowing costs take pressure off government finances and ripple through financial markets. Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds, for example, were trading at yields around 1.5 percent on Tuesday, compared with more than 7 percent in 2012.
In theory, businesses and consumers will spend more, stimulating the economy. Low rates also help depress the value of a currency, bolstering exports. And they increase the attractiveness of stock markets, which are considered riskier investments than bonds.
But very low interest rates also create tensions. In Germany, where many people are savers rather than borrowers, low rates make it hard for them to earn a return. Some economists, particularly in Germany, argue that central bank policies have encouraged dithering by political leaders in countries like Italy that need to do more to improve the performance of their economies by removing obstacles to hiring and firing or by investing in infrastructure.
"The E.C.B. has allowed politicians to sit on their hands with regard to growth-enhancing reforms and necessary fiscal consolidation," David Folkerts-Landau, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients recently.

Full text:   TEREKEKA, South Sudan -- In the shade of a fishing supply store by the river's edge, a group of young men has little to do but chat, drink glasses of sugary milk and wait for trucks that rarely arrive.
Alfred Lado, 29, and his friends used to earn cash by unloading goods transported from Juba, the capital of South Sudan, about 50 miles to the south. But after civil war broke out in December 2013, trade was disrupted, and the trucks grew scarce.
"There are no jobs, no good food and nothing to work on," Mr. Lado said.
The brutal war cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced more than two million people. But in April, Riek Machar, South Sudan's rebel leader and former vice president, returned to Juba to become deputy to his wartime rival, President Salva Kiir, as part of a transitional government.
That fragile peace could bring the traders back to Terekeka. But first, the formerly warring parties must agree on what Terekeka is: a county or a state.
The parties agreed to a peace deal in August, but Mr. Kiir threw a wrench into its implementation in October when he announced the formation of 28 states instead of the 10 that had existed before. The capital's state, Central Equatoria, for example, was divided into Yei, Jubek and Terekeka.
The rebels cried foul, arguing that Mr. Kiir had divvied up the land in ways that favored members of the Dinka ethnic group, of which he is a member.
Yet the president moved quickly to make his decree a reality. Governors and ministers were appointed in December to manage each of the new states, even though South Sudan's roster of officials and civil servants was already bloated. Because of a sharp decline in oil revenue in recent years, most government workers have not been paid in months.
The president's decree has left Terekeka in limbo. Members of what used to be known as the county government still roam the dusty roads in a roaring convoy of four-by-fours, while civilians struggle to survive on small plots of land, unsure of which officials will represent their interests.
Terekeka, which covers about 4,000 square miles, is also home to the Mundari ethnic group, whose members are known for their reliance on the Ankole-Watusi, a species of large cows with long, curved horns.
Farmers, who live in small mud huts without electricity, complain that their harvests of sorghum, ground nuts and beans have been meager after disappointing rains. And as inflation jumps, the prices of basic goods are rising too fast for families to keep up. Poverty, food insecurity and child mortality are rampant all across this chronically undeveloped country.
Mr. Lado would like Terekeka to remain a state, but hesitates to endorse the idea fully.
"It isn't recognized yet by the international community," he said. "We don't know whether the president's decision is going to be reversed."
Since 2011, when South Sudan became the world's youngest country, Terekeka has seen its share of conflicts over resources, often pitting the Mundari against the Dinka and other ethnic groups.
The capital, Terekeka town, is a three-hour drive from Juba along a deeply rutted dirt road. It sits just west of where the White Nile River unravels into a web of interlocking tributaries, and is the midway point between the capital and the conflict-scarred town of Bor.
The town's main drag is not much longer than a football field. Mundari and Dinka people mingle here, but many of the small shops are run by foreigners, including Ugandans and Ethiopians. Local eateries serve mostly bread and beans, though they sometimes run out of both.
The only substantial buildings belong to the government, sporting South Sudanese flags that hang motionless in the stifling heat.
They include the cement block primary schools on the edge of town, where a dedicated team of teachers is struggling to adapt the curriculum from Arabic into English. They say they have no idea when their backlog of unpaid salaries will be addressed.
The new governor, Juma Ali Malou, has an air-conditioned office in Juba and stays in a lodge when he visits Terekeka. He says the area has potential for oil exploration and agricultural development. He also envisions turning the riverside town into a tourist attraction, even though it has barely any infrastructure, no paved roads and no electricity except from privately owned generators.
The governor's deputy and information minister both resigned in May, accusing Mr. Ali of nepotism and misuse of funds.
During South Sudan's civil war, Terekeka experienced clashes for only a few days. It was spared the scale of atrocities that befell Juba, where the conflict began, and Bor, where territorial battles led to massacres of civilians.
But in recent months, the announcement of statehood has caused problems here. On May 7, a flag-raising ceremony in Mongalla, a county that borders Terekeka but now falls within the boundaries of Jubek, was interrupted by armed assailants over a territorial dispute. Four people died.
Supporters of Mr. Kiir's decree remain adamant. James Mori, 37, a farmer and civil servant, argued that a localized government system could make officials more accountable. "If the government is big at the top and small at the bottom, that's not good," he said.
For the moment, the United Nations does not formally recognize the 28 states, said Ellen Margrethe Loj, the head of the United Nations mission in South Sudan.
"It's very clear that there are challenges around the country in relation to how the borders have been drawn in the 28-states proposal, and that has led to ethnic tensions," she added, singling out the areas around Malakal in the north.
It will be up to the transitional government to reach an agreement on these borders. A 15-member committee was formed this month to decide on the division of states by the beginning of July.
But confusion still reigns. Supporters of the president say the committee exists only to redraw the 28 states' borders, while opponents say a return to the 10-state system is on the table.
Terekeka's residents hope that whoever is left in charge of their area will bring development soon.
"People at the grass-roots level are very happy about the creation of this state," Mr. Mori said. "But the top politicians don't care about the people here. They are complicating everything."

Abstract: "While the global economy has stabilized in the sense that it is not dropping like a rock, global economic growth remains anemic at best," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. "The Fed wants to keep markets' feet to the fire, but they do not want to hike rates so much that they exacerbate an economic slowdown," said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Tufts University.

Full text:   United States and global stocks fell for a third day on Monday, as concerned investors waited to see what the Federal Reserve would do with interest rates later this week and anxiously awaited Britain's decision on membership in the European Union.
LinkedIn shares jumped after Microsoft announced plans to buy the company.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 17.01 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,079.06 and the Nasdaq composite fell 46.11 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,848.44.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 132.86 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,732.48.
The Federal Reserve's two-day meeting will start on Tuesday, and a decision on interest rates is expected Wednesday afternoon. The central bank's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is scheduled to hold a news conference after the interest rate decision.
For months, the Fed had said that once economic data showed a consistently healthy economy, it would be time to resume raising interest rates. But after the government issued a surprisingly bleak hiring report for May, most Fed-watchers predicted the next rate increase would be put off until the fall.
On Wednesday, the Fed is expected to echo the message Ms. Yellen sent in a speech last week: While the United States economy looks fundamentally solid and higher rates will come eventually, too many uncertainties exist.
Among them is a June 23 referendum in Britain, nicknamed Brexit, over whether to leave the European Union. A yes vote could roil financial markets, and the Fed is unlikely to want to further unnerve investors with a rate increase just a week before that vote.
Some recent polls have shown that a majority of British voters are in favor of exiting the E.U.
Given the interest in Brexit, "this week's Fed meeting feels like a bit of a sideshow," said John Briggs, head of strategy for the Americas at RBS, in a note to investors.
Economists who foresee no rate increases before September say the Fed will not have a clear enough picture of the economy before then. The biggest uncertainty is whether the job market has succumbed to a prolonged slump or is merely enduring a brief pause. Other economic barometers have also sowed doubts, like tepid consumer spending and stresses from China and other major economies.
"While the global economy has stabilized in the sense that it is not dropping like a rock, global economic growth remains anemic at best," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. "Given all the uncertainties on economic growth and continued low inflation, there is no need to rush to hike interest rates."
However, the Fed does not want to lead investors to inflate the prices of stocks and other assets out of a mistaken belief that it will keep rates ultralow well into the future. The need to discourage such excessive risk-taking is why even analysts who think the economy still faces challenges predict that the Fed will nevertheless raise rates at least once this year.
"The Fed wants to keep markets' feet to the fire, but they do not want to hike rates so much that they exacerbate an economic slowdown," said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Tufts University. "They want to turn the crank slowly."
The uncertainty over the Fed's plans could be seen on Monday in bonds and the dollar. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.61 percent from 1.64 percent on Friday, its lowest yield so far this year. The dollar, while off its lows, is still trading near its lows for the year against other major currencies.
Brexit, combined with the weight of the Fed decision, kept stocks in Europe under pressure. The DAX in Germany closed down 1.8 percent, the CAC-40 in France fell 1.9 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 1.2 percent.
Shares of the professional social networking site LinkedIn soared $61.13, or 47 percent, to $192.21 after Microsoft announced it was purchasing the company for $26.2 billion in cash. Shares of Microsoft fell $1.34, or 2.6 percent, to $50.14 after the deal was announced.
Twitter shares jumped as well, up 53 cents, or 4 percent, to $14.55 on speculation that LinkedIn's buyout could mean better buyout prospects for that social media service.
The security software company Symantec jumped 91 cents, or 5 percent, to $18.21 after it said it would purchase another security company, Blue Coat, for $4.6 billion. Blue Coat had plans to go public later this year. Symantec was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500.
In currencies, the dollar fell to 106.21 yen from 106.79 yen. The dollar fell slightly against the euro to $1.1291 and rose slightly against the British pound to $1.423.
United States crude fell 19 cents, to $48.88 a barrel. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, fell 19 cents, to $50.35 a barrel in London. Oil prices had reached 11-month highs in the last few days.
In other energy commodities, heating oil was effectively unchanged at $1.515 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline futures fell 2 cents, to $1.536 a gallon, and natural gas rose 3 cents, to $2.585 per thousand cubic feet.
In the metals markets, gold rose $11, to $1,286.90 an ounce. Silver rose 11 cents, to $17.44 an ounce, and copper rose 2 cents, to $2.054 a pound.

Abstract: Financial policy makers in China will be hoping their languid stock markets get a vote of confidence on Wednesday (Tuesday evening in New York), when a decision on whether to include domestic Chinese shares in a major global stock index is to be announced. The MSCI emerging markets index, a benchmark tracked by hundreds of billions of dollars in investment funds around the world, is set to announce the results of an annual review on whether to include stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen for the first time.

Full text:   Here's a look at the week ahead:
TECHNOLOGY
Apple to convene developers in San Francisco.
Apple will hold its annual conference for software developers on Monday, previewing new features that will be in the next version of the operating systems powering its devices. Sales of Apple's biggest product, the iPhone, are slowing, and there has been little in recent months to excite consumers. The company is likely to show off a new version of Apple Music, its streaming music subscription service, and new photo-editing features.
Apple is also trying to improve its sometimes testy relationship with developers. One big announcement geared to that crowd: Developers will be able to use Siri, the company's voice-activated digital assistant, within their apps. Developers are also expecting the company to finally offer Apple Pay to online retailers as a checkout method for their websites. The digital payment service is currently restricted to physical stores and apps, where it has gotten a lukewarm response. But the ability to pay on the web with a thumbprint would be more convenient, which could drive wider use. Vindu Goel
BANKING INDUSTRY
Libyan fund's suit against Goldman to begin.
The Libyan Investment Authority, the country's sovereign wealth fund, is expected to square off against Goldman Sachs in a London court beginning on Monday in a dispute over $1.2 billion in derivative transactions it purchased in 2008. In its lawsuit, the Libyan fund claims that the transactions were rendered worthless during the financial crisis, but Goldman still earned $350 million in profit on the transactions. Chad Bray
TECHNOLOGY
A quieter games convention as industry adapts.
The Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, video game convention in Los Angeles is usually the most cacophonous of trade shows, where lots of earsplitting new games debut. But the event that begins on Tuesday will be a little less deafening than normal. Major game publishers like Activision and Electronic Arts have decided not to exhibit on the show floor this year; instead, Electronic Arts held its own expo nearby on Sunday. Nintendo has already told fans not to expect to see its next-generation game console, code-named NX, at E3. Still, Sony and Microsoft are likely to get gamers buzzing on Monday when they hold events showcasing the games coming to their consoles. Analysts are also expecting the companies to announce updated versions of their existing consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Nick Wingfield
RETAIL INDUSTRY
Consumer spending numbers expected for May.
Retail sales data for the United States, due on Tuesday, is expected to show a rise in consumer spending for May. Still, it probably will not be as robust as that in April, when spending rose to the highest levels in more than a year. Rachel Abrams
MARKETS
China awaits word on inclusion in MSCI.
Financial policy makers in China will be hoping their languid stock markets get a vote of confidence on Wednesday (Tuesday evening in New York), when a decision on whether to include domestic Chinese shares in a major global stock index is to be announced. The MSCI emerging markets index, a benchmark tracked by hundreds of billions of dollars in investment funds around the world, is set to announce the results of an annual review on whether to include stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen for the first time. Even though it is the world's second-biggest by market value, China's domestic share market remains only partly open to foreign investors, and values have remained depressed since the government bungled a stock bailout attempt last summer. Neil Gough
ECONOMY
Fed meeting is expected to yield economic projections.
Federal Reserve officials drained much of the drama from their scheduled meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday by making clear in recent days they were once again postponing any increase in the Fed's benchmark interest rate. But there still will be substance: In addition to the post-meeting policy statement, the Fed will release a fresh batch of economic projections, and the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. The looming question is whether the Fed will raise rates this summer. The Fed's next scheduled meetings are in July and September. Fed officials are likely to debate whether the recent slowdown in job growth indicates that their mission of restoring the health of the labor market is largely accomplished, or a more worrisome sign of fresh economic weakness. Binyamin Appelbaum
May's report on industrial production is due.
On Wednesday, at 9:15 a.m., the Federal Reserve will report data for industrial production in May. After industrial production rose 0.7 percent in April, economists are expecting to see a slight decline for last month, with the sector facing headwinds from depressed mining and drilling, lagging overseas demand for manufactured goods and adverse weather in some parts of the United States. Nelson D. Schwartz
Labor Department to disclose consumer prices.
On Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release data on consumer prices in May. Economists are expecting to see a 0.3 percent increase in overall consumer prices, with a 0.2 percent rise in the less volatile core Consumer Price Index. Inflation remains tame, with a likely increase in May driven, in part, by higher gasoline prices. Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text:   Friday's employment report was a major disappointment: only 38,000 jobs added, a big step down from the more than 200,000 a month average since January 2013. Special factors, notably the Verizon strike, explain part of the bad news, and in any case job growth is a noisy series, so you shouldn't make too much of one month's data. Still, all the evidence points to slowing growth. It's not a recession, at least not yet, but it is definitely a pause in the economy's progress.
Should this pause worry you? Yes. Because if it does turn into a recession, or even if it goes on for a long time, it's very hard to envision an effective policy response.
First things first: Why is the economy slowing? The usual suspects wasted no time blaming President Obama. But you need to remember that these same people have been warning of imminent disaster ever since Mr. Obama was elected, and have been wrong every step of the way. They predicted soaring interest rates and soaring inflation; neither happened. They declared that the Affordable Care Act would be a huge job-killer; the years after the act went into full effect were marked by the best private-sector job creation since the 1990s.
And despite this disappointing report, we should remember that private job growth under Mr. Obama has vastly exceeded George W. Bush's record, even if you leave out the economic collapse of 2008.
So what is causing the economy to slow? My guess is that the biggest factor is the recent sharp rise in the dollar, which has made U.S. goods less competitive on world markets. The dollar's rise, in turn, largely reflected misguided talk by the Federal Reserve about the need to raise interest rates.
In a way, however, it hardly matters why the economy is losing steam. After all, stuff always happens. America has been experiencing major economic downturns at irregular intervals at least since the 1870s, for a variety of reasons. Whatever the cause of a downturn, the economy can recover quickly if policy makers can and do take useful action. For example, both the 1974-5 recession and the 1981-2 recession were followed by rapid, "V-shaped" recoveries, because the Fed drastically loosened monetary policy and slashed interest rates.
But that won't -- in fact, can't -- happen this time. Short-term interest rates, which the Fed more or less controls, are still very low despite the small rate hike last December. We now know that it's possible for rates to go slightly below zero, but there still isn't much room for a rate cut.
That said, there are other policies that could easily reverse an economic downturn. And if Hillary Clinton wins the election, the U.S. government will understand perfectly well what the options are. (The likely response of a Trump administration doesn't bear thinking about. Maybe a series of insult Twitter posts aimed at China and Mexico?) The problem is politics.
For the simplest, most effective answer to a downturn would be fiscal stimulus -- preferably government spending on much-needed infrastructure, but maybe also temporary tax cuts for lower- and middle-income households, who would spend the money. Infrastructure spending makes especially good sense given the federal government's incredibly low borrowing costs: The interest rate on inflation-protected bonds is barely above zero.
But unless the coming election delivers Democratic control of the House, which is unlikely, Republicans would almost surely block anything along those lines. Partly, this would reflect ideology: although right-wing economic predictions have been utterly wrong, there's little indication that anyone in that camp has learned from the experience. It would also reflect an unwillingness to do anything that might help a Democrat in the White House. Remember, every Republican in the House voted against a stimulus even during the darkest days of the slump, when Mr. Obama was at the peak of his popularity.
If not fiscal stimulus, then what? For much of the past six years the Fed, unable to cut interest rates further, has tried to boost the economy through large-scale purchases of things like long-term government debt and mortgage-backed securities. But it's unclear how much difference that made -- and meanwhile, this policy faced constant attacks and vilification from the right, with claims that it was debasing the dollar and/or illegitimately bailing out a fiscally irresponsible president. We can guess that the Fed will be very reluctant to resume the program, and face accusations that it's in the pocket of "corrupt Hillary."
So the evidence of a U.S. slowdown should worry you. I don't see anything like the 2008 crisis on the horizon (he says with fingers crossed behind his back), but even a smaller negative shock could turn into very bad news, given our political gridlock.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Wall Street hasn't had much to cheer about lately. But there are some signs that rank-and-file workers do.
You might not think so, given a very weak government jobs report on Friday, yet many employees have actually been climbing out of the financial hole in which they have been mired since the Great Recession.
Where the economy is heading now isn't clear. But consider the overall picture since the recession ended in 2009. Until about a year ago, big businesses and investors prospered, despite extremely slow economic growth, while wages for most employees languished.
As the Federal Reserve and other central banks pumped out money, corporations racked up handsome profits, and those fortunate enough to hold shares in big companies made fortunes. If you had invested $10,000 in a Standard & Poor's 500 index fund at the end of February 2009, it would have more than tripled by the end of last year, including dividends.
Rising corporate profits provided fuel for the sizzling stock market. By the fourth quarter of 2011, pretax corporate profits reached 14.5 percent of national income, the highest level since 1950, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis data compiled by Edward Yardeni, an independent market researcher.
What was good for business wasn't great for workers, however. By 2012, labor's share of the corporate income pie had dropped to the lowest level since 1951, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, found. Companies bolstered profits by cutting costs -- including the cost of labor -- and they got away with it because unemployment was high and jobs were scarce.
"In a weak job market, wages grew very slowly," said Josh Bivens, the institute's director of research and policy. They grew so slowly that through last year, median weekly wages for full-time workers were still stuck below their 2009 level when adjusted for inflation, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Mediocre economic growth has been a central problem. An annual growth rate of 2 percent has become the new normal. Until recently, growth that slow was viewed as "stall speed" -- a rate so feeble that it made the economy vulnerable to an outright recession. Yet despite some scares, the United States economy has continued its snail-like expansion since June 2009.
Almost imperceptibly, the recovery entered a new stage. Over the last year or so, conditions appeared to have changed -- for business, investors and workers.
For many rank-and-file workers, the labor market improved significantly, even if the gains have been uneven. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent from 5 percent in May, the Labor Department reported on Friday, a bright spot in a report filled mainly with grim numbers. For example, job creation slackened sharply, with a net gain of a mere 38,000 jobs. But the report also confirmed that hourly wages have been rising, for a gain of 2.5 percent for the year.
On Wednesday, in the survey known as the "beige book," the Federal Reserve reported that "tight labor markets were widely noted," and pay raises were "concentrated in areas of labor tightness."
A major labor dispute was resolved as striking Verizon workers returned to work last week with a tentative agreement on four-year contracts that would give workers a nearly 11 percent increase in pay over all. Their return should bolster future jobs numbers.
Purchasing power for many workers has finally climbed back to prerecession levels. By March, using inflation-adjusted figures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that median weekly wages had at last surpassed their 2009 peak.
Mr. Bivens cautioned that the real-wage improvement last year was at least partly because of unusually low inflation, and not entirely because of monetary wage increases. Oil, gas and other commodity prices plummeted last year, making wage growth, after adjusting for inflation, look relatively high. "It's good news, but it's not clear whether that growth rate for real wages is sustainable," he said.
Still, labor's share of the corporate income pie has unquestionably been growing, though it hasn't regained the prerecession levels of 2007. Reaching that modest goal will require further economic growth. "We're slowly making headway, but we have a while to go before I'd say conditions were normal," Mr. Bivens said.
On the other hand, from the standpoint of corporate executives and stock market investors, conditions have worsened considerably over the last year. The market has struggled to hold its own. The S.&P. 500 hasn't reached a new peak since May 2015. Corporate profits, which had supported the long bull market in stocks, have been weak. In the first quarter of 2016, earnings declined 5 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimated.
On Tuesday, Mr. Yardeni summarized the year this way: "Labor compensation is up 5 percent while profits are down 5.8 percent. Workers finally may be gaining income share as the labor market has tightened, boosting both employment and hourly pay. This development is squeezing profit margins."
Rising incomes spurred consumer spending, which grew in April at its fastest rate since 2014. Inflation remains very low but has been rising. Investors are betting that on the heels of the latest jobs report, the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates this month.
Further wage increases and a sustained uptick in inflation could induce the Fed to act later on. But unless such developments are accompanied by much stronger economic growth, neither workers nor businesses nor investors are likely to celebrate very loudly.
Correction: June 12, 2016, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about signs of rising wages as the labor market tightens misspelled the surname of the Economic Policy Institute's director of research and policy, who tracks wage trends. He is Josh Bivens, not Bevins.

Full text:   Well, that stunk.
The latest employment report -- typically the most timely and accurate measure of the state of the business cycle -- suggests that the economy is slowing. Employers added only 38,000 jobs in May, and revisions suggest that they created 59,000 fewer jobs over the previous two months than initial estimates suggested.
It is worth bearing in mind that this is noisy data, and the economy rarely zigs or zags as often or as dramatically as any initial set of numbers suggest. A better gauge of the underlying rate of jobs growth is to take an average over the past three months. By that measure, the labor market is creating around 116,000 jobs per month. This is a notable slowdown from jobs growth in the 150,000-250,000 range over most of the past five years. But it's a slowdown and not a sudden stop.
There are actually two surveys of employment conducted each month, the headline measure that comes from a survey of firms, and an alternative and less reliable measure from a smaller survey of households. Both were weak. The household survey registered employment growth of only 28,000 in May.
The household survey is also used to measure the unemployment rate. In an odd twist, it shows that the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in May, from 5 percent in April. But this is not the good news it seems, because it almost entirely reflects a decline in the number of people reporting that they were looking for work. The decline reversed the hopeful signs over recent months that labor force participation may be recovering.
It is likely that this month's report overstates the extent of the slowdown. A strike at Verizon cut payrolls by about 35,000. A mild winter led to higher employment levels in the first part of the year, which leads to lower growth as employment has since reverted to seasonal norms. Then again, Jonathan Wright, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins, has published an improved algorithm for adjusting for seasonal fluctuations, and it suggests this report actually overstated jobs growth by about 40,000.
If all of these adjustments suggest that it's hard to know what the underlying pace of jobs growth is, then you are correct. These numbers are imprecise estimates, and they come with a margin of error of plus or minus 100,000.
No matter what the true numbers are, the jobs report should be interpreted in the context of other indicators that do not show as speedy a slowdown. Putting it all together, the outlook is less rosy, but by no means terrible.
The economy still appears to be reducing unemployment.
There was a time when the working-age population was growing so rapidly that if the underlying rate of monthly jobs growth slipped to 100,000, that would not only be disappointing, but it would also point to rising unemployment. But that's not today's reality.
As the number of baby boomers entering retirement continues to rise, the number of jobs the economy needs to create to keep pace with population growth has fallen sharply. A reasonable estimate is that the economy needs to produce somewhere between 70,000 and 90,000 jobs per month to keep the unemployment rate stable. (The Council of Economic Advisers estimates 77,000.) Even after today's report, it seems likely the underlying pace of growth remains above this.
That is, the economy is still growing faster than its long-run potential rate of growth, and the recovery is continuing.
It's not that things are getting worse, it's that they're getting better more slowly.
Moreover, unemployment is now at historically low levels. The last time the economy registered an unemployment rate this low was November 2007, on the eve of the Great Recession.
There remains a vibrant debate as to whether the labor market has fully recovered from those dark days, or whether today's low unemployment rate overstates its health. Millions of people are still working part-time but looking for full-time work, and millions more are no longer actively searching for work, and so do not meet the technical definition of unemployment.
Average wage growth of only 2.5 percent over the past year suggests there remains a lot of potential for the labor market to improve without sparking inflation.
But at some point, slower employment growth is an inevitability.
Forecasters have long suggested that as the economy approaches full employment, jobs growth must slow. By this reckoning, the economy cannot continue to create jobs more rapidly than the labor force is growing without the emergence of bottlenecks. If this is right, perhaps we should get used to seeing employment growth closer to 100,000 per month.
The disappointing news, then, is that the day of reckoning may be a step closer than we had thought.

Expressing Optimism, Europe's Central Bank Keeps Its Rates Steady

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank made no changes on Thursday in its program to revive the eurozone economy, as it expressed slightly more optimism about the prospects for growth in the region.
The lack of any significant policy moves was expected. Growth in the 19-member eurozone is neither so terrible that it requires a new burst of stimulus from the bank nor so torrid that there is a need to apply the brakes, analysts say. The European Central Bank's Governing Council is now expected to pause for a while, after several years in which it pushed the boundaries of monetary policy.
The bank left its benchmark interest rate at zero, where it has been since March. It also left intact a penalty rate of minus 0.4 percent on money that commercial banks keep at the central bank. The so-called negative interest rate is designed to force commercial banks to lend money rather than hoard it.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said that growth in the eurozone this year would be 1.6 percent, slightly more than earlier forecasts. But the bank's economists left their growth predictions for 2017 and 2018 unchanged at 1.7 percent for both years.
Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in Vienna that although the risks facing the eurozone had declined, "it's not a dramatic effect."
The bank has already made aggressive moves in recent months by buying government debt in large quantities and cutting interest rates to their lowest levels. This month, the bank will expand those measures by buying corporate bonds and by effectively paying banks to lend to businesses, all in a bid to spur Europe's economy.
Analysts would have been surprised, indeed shocked, if the bank had taken action on Thursday after a monetary policy meeting in Vienna, one of the Governing Council's periodic forays outside its base in Frankfurt.
The bank is also not expected to make any major changes to policy for some time to come. The meeting on Thursday "was a continuation of a series of wait-and-see events," Christoph Kutt, head of interest rate strategy at DZ Bank in Frankfurt, said in an email.
Inflation in the eurozone was minus 0.1 percent in May, according to an official estimate on Tuesday, still far from the bank's official target of 2 percent. But a 1 percent increase in the price of services in May, as well as a turnaround in oil prices that has pushed them near $50 a barrel from around half that in January, signal that overall inflation could rise in months to come.
To the disappointment of some analysts, the central bank did not raise its inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018. That is a sign that the bank remains concerned about the risk of deflation, a sustained decline in prices that can be disastrous for economic growth and employment.
The European Central Bank's charter defines its main job as keeping inflation below 2 percent, but not too far below it.
Another reason the central bank had not been expected to announce new stimulus on Thursday is that its previous measures are just going into effect. In March, it said it would begin buying corporate bonds in an expansion of its so-called quantitative easing program, a way of pumping money into the economy. Those purchases are scheduled to begin on June 8.
In addition, the central bank will begin a program on June 22 intended to address a shortage of credit in countries like Italy. Under some circumstances, the European Central Bank will pay commercial banks to take its money, which the banks must lend to customers.
The central bank will want to take some time to see how those programs are working, analysts said.
The eurozone economy is recovering, but slowly and unevenly. During the first quarter, the total value of goods and services produced in the eurozone surpassed the previous peak reached in early 2008, before the region was struck by financial and debt crises.
But unemployment remains above 10 percent and is falling only gradually, and eurozone growth is not so brisk that economists see any need for the bank to think about removing stimulus to prevent overheating. That is in contrast to the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise interest rates in the United States as early as its next meeting, June 14 and 15.
Along with questions about the direction of the economy, there is potential for a new crisis that would push the European Central Bank to mobilize.
Britain will hold a referendum on June 23 about whether to remain a member of the European Union. A vote to quit the union would raise concerns that other members would leave, perhaps causing the bloc to fall apart. The uncertainty would have an economic effect, making businesses cautious about hiring and investing.
In such a situation, the central bank would be under pressure to intervene once again.
Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that he and other members of the Governing Council believed that Britain should remain in the European Union. But if British voters elect to leave, he said, "The E.C.B. is ready for all contingencies."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Power Struggles Stall South Sudan's Recovery

Abstract: [...]the party has always been divided by power struggles. Since South Sudan achieved independence in 2011, the movement has functioned less like a political party and more like a tenuous coalition of war veterans who have never quite been able to put down their weapons. Mr. Machar, who met with officials from the International Monetary Fund last week to discuss a much-needed economic recovery, insisted before his return to the capital that if the peace plan was followed, development would come.

Full text:   JUBA, South Sudan -- If there is any chance for South Sudan to get back on its feet, it will need to be serious about the mundane.
So says Fredrick Lokule, a veteran civil servant who is passionate about bureaucracy, of all things -- specifically tax collection, the thankless task that any functioning state requires.
But the government of South Sudan, the world's youngest country, has long been driven by personalities, not by policies. Now it cannot afford to pay even its most experienced technocrats.
Mr. Lokule, who is in charge of his state's revenue authority, says he has not been paid for more than two months. His office sits on an unpaved road and experiences frequent power failures, so his employees have grown used to working in the dark.
"People are patient," Mr. Lokule said. "But of course we've been frustrated because of a lack of this, a lack of that."
South Sudan has, at least officially, just emerged from more than two years of a brutal civil war that killed tens of thousands of people and displaced over two million.
Much of the damage remains. Even here in the capital, nearly 28,000 people are still sheltering in a United Nations camp on the outskirts of the city. Many of them fled their homes in December 2013 after troops loyal to President Salva Kiir clashed with those loyal to Riek Machar, who had been dismissed that year as vice president, and killed hundreds of civilians in the city during the early stages of the war.
Since then, most of the war's atrocities, often perpetrated along ethnic lines, have occurred far from Juba, in the country's north and east. Civilians were killed deliberately. Child soldiers were recruited to fight. Women were raped en masse.
In recent weeks, the country's top priority has been to form a transitional government that strikes a delicate peace between former warring rivals. But South Sudan's governing elite have done little to focus on something just as critical to the country's health: righting the devastated economy.
"You cannot talk about improving the economic situation now, because peace and security are the cornerstones for whatever you do," Michael Makuei, the country's minister of information, said last month as the government was being formed.
After an August peace agreement, Mr. Machar returned to Juba on April 26 and was sworn into his old position as the vice president to Mr. Kiir, essentially returning the country to the fragile political situation it was in before the war.
Both leaders claim membership in the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, which began in 1983 as the political wing of an army fighting for autonomy from Sudan.
But the party has always been divided by power struggles. Since South Sudan achieved independence in 2011, the movement has functioned less like a political party and more like a tenuous coalition of war veterans who have never quite been able to put down their weapons. Its members have been accused of committing war crimes, fanning the flames of ethnic tension and profiting from rampant corruption.
"Our apologies to the people of South Sudan for the situation we, the leaders, have created," Mr. Kiir said in a speech after Mr. Machar resumed his post. "You have been patient throughout the duration of the crisis."
More than half of South Sudan's roughly 12 million people live below the poverty line. Food prices have skyrocketed because of inflation. People are dying in hospitals where medical supplies are running low. Oil fields were damaged in the war, slashing production to less than half of peak levels.
Now, saddled with fees and debt repayments totaling about $25 for every barrel of crude exported via Sudan -- and facing low oil prices globally -- South Sudan is desperately short on hard currency.
Mr. Machar, who met with officials from the International Monetary Fund last week to discuss a much-needed economic recovery, insisted before his return to the capital that if the peace plan was followed, development would come.
"The money spent by the government on perpetrating the war will be available for other things," he said.
People in the capital are struggling to make ends meet. Abraham Matoch, 27, a laptop technician, said his workplace had not had a regular electricity supply for about two years. So he pays top dollar for power from privately owned generators, many of which run on fuel from the black market. His business is barely profitable, but he said his five siblings relied on him for support.
"All I want is for the economy to be stable," he said.
In order to secure the outside funding that South Sudan sorely needs, the country's leaders must prove their ability to govern. But high-level officials argue that the transitional government has much to accomplish before it can address the problems plaguing the population.
To that end -- and despite the lack of cash -- South Sudan's government has expanded. A new cabinet of 30 ministers was appointed shortly after Mr. Machar's arrival, with former rebels leading 10 ministries, including those of the interior, mining and petroleum.
Lam Akol, a veteran of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement who now leads an opposition party, became the minister of agriculture -- a sector about which, he admitted, he knows very little.
During his first few hours in office, he greeted a parade of well-wishers from behind his huge desk, offering candy and cookies as the electricity supply sputtered.
"I don't deny that many of the problems have been personal," he said of the government's internal power struggles. "But now there are many centers in this government, ensuring that no one center is controlling everything."
Troops from both sides of the conflict are undergoing a balancing act of their own. Leaders of the two armies have begun talks on how to enforce security in Juba. The plans include the formation of a police force with 1,500 recruits from each side.
Col. William Gatjiath Deng, a spokesman for Mr. Machar's troops, said he was disappointed that the government had been slow to demilitarize the capital in accordance with the peace plan. He also acknowledged that some of his troops might have trouble adapting to the transition after two years of conflict.
"They are still holding the violence in their minds," he said. "But we trained them. We told them we are here for peace."
The soldiers, who do not know when they will receive salaries, have settled in a garrison on the edge of Juba and have built small homes out of wood, straw and mud. During the day, civilians from the nearby displaced persons camp are welcomed into the makeshift barracks. Women have volunteered as cooks, preparing huge vats of beans to distribute to the troops.
Nyakoang Doar, 54, who has been living in the United Nations camp since her husband and three of her six children were killed in December 2013, said the government had not stopped killing civilians in Mr. Machar's ethnic group, the Nuer, until his soldiers had begun to arrive here this year.
"We women are really suffering," she said, pointing a finger at Colonel Gatjiath as she waited for a batch of beans to boil. "You men are not doing so well."
Since the formation of the transitional government, reports of violent skirmishes across the country have raised fears that South Sudan will not be able to maintain peace in the buildup to national elections in 2018, in which Mr. Machar could square off with Mr. Kiir once again for control of the party.
But technocrats like Mr. Lokule hope the country can put personal politics aside for now, and focus instead on a blueprint for development that will attract foreign investors. He said he was proud to be involved in the establishment of a new national tax revenue authority, which should come to fruition soon as part of the peace deal.
"When we split from Sudan, we came with the spirit to build a country," he said. "We hope everything will be O.K., and this depends on keeping the peace."

Abstract: [...]many mainstream politicians recognized the danger but they failed to stop him. The heady growth of the 2000s led Europeans and Americans to believe they were on firm economic ground; the shattering of banks, real estate markets and governments in the wake of the crash left tens of millions of people at sea, angry at the institutions that had failed them, above all the politicians who claimed to be in charge.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Hamburg, Germany -- WE Germans can never escape the trauma of our recent history. That has rarely been clearer than today, as we look around our Continent and across the Atlantic. There are almost too many differences to mention between what happened in the 1930s over here and what is going on today. And it goes without saying that Donald J. Trump and Austria's Norbert Hofer are not Adolf Hitler. Still, Germany's slide into a popular embrace of authoritarianism in the 1930s offers a frame for understanding how liberal democracies can suddenly turn toward anti-liberalism.
Setting aside debate about whether the rise of Nazism was built into the German DNA, there were four trends that led the country to reject its post-World War I constitutional, parliamentary democracy, known as the Weimar Republic: economic depression, loss of trust in institutions, social humiliation and political blunder. To a certain degree, these trends can be found across the West today.
First, the history. The Black Friday stock-market collapse of 1929 set off a global depression. As bad as things were in America, they were even worse in Germany, where industrial production shrank by half in the following three years. Stocks lost two-thirds of their value. Deflation and unemployment rocked the country. The Weimar government, already held in low esteem by many Germans, seemed to have no clue about what to do.
All this happened as traditional ways of life and values were being shaken by the modernization of the 1920s. Women suddenly went to work, to vote, to party and to sleep with whomever they wanted. This produced a widening cultural gap between the tradition-oriented working and middle classes and the cosmopolitan avant-garde -- in politics, business and the arts -- that reached a peak just when economic disaster struck. The elites were blamed for the resulting chaos, and the masses were ripe for a strongman to return order to society.
Some people today imagine that Hitler sneaked up on Germany, that too few people understood the threat. In fact, many mainstream politicians recognized the danger but they failed to stop him. Some didn't want to: The conservative parties and the nobility believed the little hothead could serve as their useful idiot, that as chancellor he would be contained by a squad of reasonable ministers. Franz von Papen, a nobleman who was Hitler's first vice chancellor, said of the new leader, "We've hired him."
At the same time, even the imminent threat of a fascist dictatorship couldn't persuade the left-wing parties to join forces. Instead of being conciliatory for the sake of the national interest, Ernst Thälmann, the head of the German Communist Party, branded the center-left Social Democrats the "moderate wing of fascism." No wonder Hitler had an easy time uniting broad sections of the German public.
Are we at another Weimar moment now?
The 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent global recession were nowhere nearly as painful as the Great Depression. But the effects are similar. The heady growth of the 2000s led Europeans and Americans to believe they were on firm economic ground; the shattering of banks, real estate markets and governments in the wake of the crash left tens of millions of people at sea, angry at the institutions that had failed them, above all the politicians who claimed to be in charge.
Why, voters ask, did the government allow so many bankers to behave like criminals in the first place? Why did it then bail out banks while letting car factories go under? Why is it welcoming millions of immigrants? Are there separate rules for the elites, defined by a hypermodern liberal worldview that ridicules the working class -- and their traditional values -- as yokels?
In America and Europe, the rise of anti-establishment movements is a symptom of a cultural shock against globalized postmodernity, similar to the 1930s' rejection of modernity. The common accusation by the "masses" is that liberal democracy has somehow gone too far, that it has become an ideology for an elite at the expense of everyone else. Marine Le Pen, chief of the French National Front, calls these normal folk "les invisibles et les oubliés," the invisible and the forgotten.
Of course this isn't 1933. Democratic institutions are much more stable today. But the power of nostalgia doesn't depend on the times you live in. This is why, for all the differences, we are indeed witnessing another 1930s moment across the West.
It's easy to say that people need to accept the new realities and work toward feasible reforms -- however true that is. And yet most mainstream parties haven't done even this, at least not in a compelling way. Instead, they fight among themselves, and see the rise of demagogues as a solution to their problems, not a threat to their nations. Mr. Trump is no Hitler, but that's not the point. Today, as in the 1930s, we are seeing the failure of the liberal mainstream to respond to serious challenges, even those that threaten its very existence.

Correction: June 14, 2016, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Op-Ed article on May 31, about the far right in Europe, misstated an element of Germany's economic collapse during the Great Depression. It was deflation, not inflation
