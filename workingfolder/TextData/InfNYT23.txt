Full text:   Updated, 7:12 p.m. | A day after Credit Suisse pleaded guilty to tax evasion in the United States, the Swiss bank says that it is able to conduct its business as normal despite its criminal conviction. Swiss officials and investors seemed to welcome the fact that the resolution allows the bank to put the matter behind it.
Credit Suisse on Monday pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to aid tax evasion in a scheme that spanned decades. The bank will pay about $2.6 billion in penalties and hire an independent monitor for up to two years. While the governments involved haggled over the release of client names for years, Credit Suisse ultimately was not forced to so as part of the plea.
In contrast, UBS agreed in 2009 to pay $780 million and turned over the names of 4,450 American account holders after the Swiss government passed measures that allowed the bank to effectively bypass Swiss secrecy laws. As part of the settlement, UBS avoided criminal prosecution in the investigation.
Brady W. Dougan, Credit Suisse's chief executive, disputed reports that the bank had dragged out the discussions with American officials in an effort not to release the names of clients.
"We did everything we could to bring this to a resolution," he said. It was complicated by "government to government" conversations, he said, and Swiss law that prohibits the release of client data.
Mr. Dougan said there were two major differences with the UBS settlement. The Swiss government allowed UBS to provide names; it did not do so with Credit Suisse. And five years later, fines that Credit Suisse is paying are significantly higher. "Everyone is obviously very aware of the inflation of costs in settlement issues," he said.
Since the start of the negotiations, the American government had hoped to obtain the client names so that it could pursue individuals over tax evasion. In February, Mr. Dougan testified before the Senate that he had asked the government to make it possible to provide the names.
In early May, Gregory B. Craig, a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who was previously White House counsel under President Obama, phoned officials at the Department of Justice to say that Credit Suisse was hoping to persuade the Swiss government to cooperate.
Around that time, Switzerland's finance minister, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, met with the United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., to discuss the investigation, said people with knowledge of the matter. She said the government would not use emergency powers.
In recent weeks, the board at Credit Suisse debated the pros and cons of pushing for such powers, which would allow the bank to produce the names, said one person briefed on the matter. But doing so could possibly make the bank beholden to the government.
"The government was not prepared to offer emergency powers and the bank did not want it," this person said.
Swiss officials, however, said that the bank did not recently press the issue.
"They did not ask us to introduce emergency law," said Mario Tuor, a spokesman in the Swiss finance ministry.
Credit Suisse investors shrugged off the impact of the guilty plea. Shares in the bank, Switzerland's second-largest after UBS, closed up nearly 1 percent in trading in Switzerland and in New York.
On Tuesday, the Credit Suisse top management spread out around the world to calm employees and clients after its felony conviction. Mr. Dougan was in New York while Urs Rohner, the chairman, was in Switzerland and David Mathers, the company's chief financial officer, was in London.
In call with media and analysts, Mr. Dougan again said the bank took full responsibility for its actions, but emphasized that it had seen little business impact as a result of the plea.
"We have found no instances where clients cannot do business with us," he said. "Our discussions with clients have been very reassuring and we haven't seen very many issues at all."
Mr. Dougan also said that he never considered resigning over the incident, even as opposition politicians continue to call for his ouster. Mr. Rohner told a television station in Switzerland that he and Mr. Dougan had clean hands (though in German the literal translation is a white vest). He conceded that in the past, Swiss banks, including Credit Suisse, did accept untaxed funds. "We are disappointed and regret this," Mr. Rohner said.
Swiss government officials said that they were relieved that the matter was resolved and that Credit Suisse could continue operations. Switzerland's main markets regulator also issued a statement saying that its investigation was over, and no further measures against the bank were expected.
Credit Suisse also said on Tuesday that the settlement would reduce second-quarter net income by 1.6 billion Swiss francs ($1.8 billion). Mr. Dougan said Tuesday that the bank would pare its assets to try to restore its capital levels after the fine.
Credit Suisse will reduce so-called risk-weighted assets by $14 billion, to $266 billion, and sell noncore assets, including real estate, to try to restore common equity Tier 1 capital ratio -- a measure of its ability to absorb losses -- to 10 percent by the end of 2014. The capital level would have been at 9.3 percent in the first quarter of 2014 had the charges from the settlement been applied. Some analysts expressed doubt about the bank's thin capitalization levels.
After it restores its 10 percent level, the bank said it would return half of its earnings to shareholders. Its long-term goal for common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is 11 percent.

Full text:   On Tuesday, Ben S. Bernanke spoke in Abu Dhabi; on Wednesday, he was in Johannesburg. By Friday, he was in Houston. That week in March was a particularly busy one for Mr. Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
During his eight years as steward of the world's largest economy, Mr. Bernanke's salary was about $200,000 a year. Now he makes that in just a few hours speaking to bankers, hedge fund billionaires and leaders of industry. This year alone, he is poised to make millions of dollars from speaking engagements.
Mr. Bernanke is following a well-trodden path that his predecessor, Alan S. Greenspan, and other Washington policy makers have taken. On the speaking circuit, he is putting just one foot through the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street, being paid by financial firms but not employed by one.
Investors are dealing with an economy that is in large part the creature of Fed policies under Mr. Bernanke, and they are willing to pay top dollar for his words of wisdom as a result.
Mr. Bernanke has agreed to speak with a Middle Eastern bank, private equity firms and trade associations, as well as at investment bank get-togethers, charging his hosts fees that range from $200,000 in the United States and $400,000 for engagements in Asia. While he has dined with hedge fund managers at small events arranged by investment and brokerage firms including JPMorgan Chase, some Wall Street firms have balked at the high fees.
"Chairman Bernanke decided after he left office, like most good civil servants, that he wanted to make a little bit of money and did the dinner circuit," Michael E. Novogratz, a principal of Fortress Investment Group, told an audience of wealth managers at a conference in Las Vegas last week.
At his first of several dinners after retiring from the Fed in March, Mr. Bernanke spoke to a group of hedge fund managers, including Mr. Novogratz, at Le Bernardin in Midtown Manhattan. The setting was so intimate that the group took up just one of the four-star restaurant's three private dining rooms.
"At those dinners he gave credence to the idea that the Fed believed in lower potential G.D.P. and lower potential inflation," Mr. Novogratz said.
"I think that got through to the market and that was kind of the accelerator of this giant trade in fixed income that has happened," he added, referring to an unexpected rally in government bonds. The market has rallied this year as investors, concerned that the economy will not grow as fast as expected, have sought safer assets like Treasury securities.
"I think that the markets and investors will put more credence on what Bernanke says," said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. Referring to Mr. Bernanke's successor, Janet L. Yellen, Mr. Rosenberg added, "There is a pervasive belief that Bernanke and Yellen are joined at the hip."
David A. Tepper, founder of the $20 billion hedge fund Appaloosa Management, who was also at the Le Bernardin dinner, expressed regret that he did not trade on Mr. Bernanke's guidance at the dinner.
"He gave this stuff out, but I didn't realize what he was saying at the time, so I didn't do a great trade," Mr. Tepper said at the conference in Las Vegas last week.
For many investors, the big question is when and how quickly interest rates will rise. Some Wall Street firms like BTIG, the institutional brokerage firm that organized the Le Bernardin dinner, offer their top clients private dinners with important former officials like Mr. Bernanke to try to differentiate their offerings from those of their rivals.
But others are consciously passing up the opportunity to hire Mr. Bernanke. UBS and Goldman Sachs considered his fees too high, according to two people briefed on the discussions between Mr. Bernanke's representative and the banks but not authorized to speak about either publicly.
It is not unusual for senior government officials to join the speaking circuit or take lucrative jobs in the private sector after leaving public office.
Mr. Greenspan was hired to consult for the hedge fund Paulson & Company, Deutsche Bank, and the bond investment firm Pacific Investment Management Company after stepping down as Fed chairman. After leaving the top job at Treasury, Timothy F. Geithner joined the private equity firm Warburg Pincus.
And Mr. Bernanke is free to speak about his views on the economy as long as he does not breach any confidentiality agreement.
"If they are saying something that they were saying as a public official, is there something wrong with that?" Mr. Greenspan said.
Since his busy week jetting around the world in March, Mr. Bernanke has made several other appearances, including at a private equity conference hosted by the Blackstone Group a few weeks ago. He is scheduled to speak in Pennsylvania at the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce's annual event on May 28, where members will pay $225 for a ticket.
Then things will pick up again for the former Fed chairman in the fall, when he is scheduled to speak at the SALT hedge fund conference in Singapore. Morgan Stanley is in discussions with Mr. Bernanke to have him also speak at a dinner on the sidelines of the conference.
In November, over the span of two weeks, he is to give keynote speeches at a series of events in the United States, hosted by the Association for Financial Professionals; the Schwab Impact conference; and the Commercial Finance Association.
Though Mr. Bernanke has been busy traveling these days, he spends most of his time as an economic studies fellow at the Brookings Institution and is working on a book about his time at the Fed.
He also delivers pro bono speeches and does not always pocket all the fees, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bernanke at the Brookings Institution said. "In addition, he is donating hundreds of thousands to charity," she added.
The Washington Speakers Bureau, which coordinates Mr. Bernanke's speaking engagements, did not return calls.
Not everyone agrees with the fees that Mr. Bernanke charges.
"You can spend $250,000 for Bernanke's time at a private dinner, or you could just sit down and read what people like Janet Yellen and Mark Carney have to say," Mr. Rosenberg said, referring to the governor of the Bank of England. "You can actually do that for free and pretty much draw the same conclusions."

Full text:   Updated, 10:36 p.m.
LONDON -- AstraZeneca has to hope it can deliver on its vaunted drug pipeline.
On Monday, AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swedish drug maker, rejected Pfizer's latest -- and what it described as its "final" -- bid to buy AstraZeneca, which would create the world's largest pharmaceutical company.
Barring a last-minute change of heart by AstraZeneca's board or another sweetened bid by Pfizer later this week, the likelihood of a potential deal looks bleak. Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 -- a holiday this year in both Britain and the United States -- to decide whether to walk away.
The latest offer, made Sunday evening, was worth about $119 billion. On Monday, AstraZeneca responded that the increased bid "undervalues the company and its attractive prospects."
In making its final offer on Sunday, Pfizer said that it did not believe that AstraZeneca's board was prepared to recommend a deal "at a reasonable price" and it encouraged AstraZeneca's shareholders to urge the company to engage in "meaningful dialogue" about a potential combination.
Pfizer, which began its pursuit of a merger last year, has said it will not make a hostile bid.
The news sent AstraZeneca's shares down 11.1 percent, to 42.875 pounds, in trading on Monday in London. The company's stock had been trading higher in recent weeks as shareholders anticipated an increased offer from Pfizer.
A Pfizer spokesman said on Monday that the company was evaluating its options after the latest rejection.
Leif Johansson, the AstraZeneca chairman, said in a statement that Pfizer's pursuit all along "appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimization." He was referring to Pfizer's plan to reincorporate in Britain through the transaction to substantially reduce its United States tax bill.
"From our first meeting in January to our latest discussion yesterday, and in the numerous phone calls in between, Pfizer has failed to make a compelling strategic, business or value case," Mr. Johansson said. "The board is firm in its conviction as to the appropriate terms to recommend to shareholders."
AstraZeneca has raised a number of concerns about the potential tie-up, but the main sticking point appears to be what constitutes an appropriate price for AstraZeneca and its stable of drugs in development.
The latest proposal would have given AstraZeneca shareholders 1.747 shares of the combined company, and £24.76 in cash for each of their shares. The offer valued each share of AstraZeneca at about £55, or about $92.50.
Analysts had predicted that AstraZeneca's board would be willing to engage in meaningful discussions about a merger at that price. Yet AstraZeneca said on Monday that it was looking, at a minimum, for a price closer to £58 a share.
Sunday's offer represented a 45 percent premium over AstraZeneca's share price before news of Pfizer's interest became public in April and came after a previous offer by Pfizer late on Friday.
Is AstraZeneca "realistic in what it believes 'fair value' is?" Timothy Anderson, a pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a research note Monday. "Projecting the worth of new drug pipelines is notoriously difficult, and drug companies and financial analysts alike are often wrong to the tune of billions of dollars, especially when going out five to 10 years. Drug development is just not that predictable."
AstraZeneca said this month that it expected to achieve annual revenue of $45 billion by 2023 as an independent company.
The company, which has an attractive portfolio of cancer drugs, has repeatedly trumpeted the strength of its drugs in development, saying it is projecting peak annual sales potential of about $23 billion for those drugs by the end of 2023.
The company's pipeline includes potential treatments for cancer, cardiovascular disease and asthma. One promising area is its immuno-oncology drugs, which use the body's immune system to attack tumors. MEDI4736, a cancer treatment in development, is one drug that the company is pointing to as a reason to be optimistic about its pipeline. The company expects the drug could earn $6.5 billion in peak annual sales.
Pfizer, the maker of best-selling drugs like Lipitor and Viagra, has raised questions about AstraZeneca's prospects as a stand-alone concern and vowed to keep jobs in Britain in a bid to persuade British politicians to support the transaction.
If completed, the deal would be one of the largest acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry, surpassing Pfizer's takeover of Warner-Lambert 14 years ago, which was valued at $90 billion at the time. Adjusted for inflation, however, that takeover would now be valued at about $124 billion.
Savvas Neophytou, an analyst at Panmure Gordon & Company in London, said a majority of AstraZeneca's large shareholders would have preferred that the company engage in a "more robust discussion" with Pfizer and that £55 a share would have been an attractive price for many stockholders.
Now, AstraZeneca must deliver on its lofty outlook, Mr. Neophytou said.
"From AstraZeneca's point of view, the challenge is not the next six months," Mr. Neophytou said. "The challenge is what happens in the medium to long term, the next three to five years."
Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca has been a contentious one, with both companies seemingly talking past each other and AstraZeneca's board showing little desire to engage Pfizer.
On Friday, Pfizer approached AstraZeneca with another increased offer of cash and stock worth about £53.50 a share. AstraZeneca's board again felt the offer was too low.
On a conference call between the companies on Sunday, Mr. Johansson said, even if other crucial aspects of the deal were satisfactory, the board would be prepared to recommend only an offer price that was more than 10 percent above the Friday bid, or about £58.85, according to AstraZeneca.
Pfizer reiterated that its Friday proposal was final and would not be amended, according to AstraZeneca, but then announced an increased -- and again final -- proposal on Sunday, without previous notice.
The potential combination has also raised concerns among British and United States lawmakers.
In Britain, the concern has centered on whether Pfizer would eliminate jobs after a merger and hurt Britain's standing in life sciences research. AstraZeneca employs 51,500 people worldwide, including about 6,700 in Britain.
Pfizer had committed to keep at least 20 percent of its research and development work force in Britain after a deal and to complete a research-and-development center being built by AstraZeneca in Cambridge, England.
But British politicians have pointed to Pfizer's decision in 2011 to close a facility in Sandwich, England, as a reason to be concerned about its commitment to keeping jobs in Britain. The closing led to the loss of more than 1,500 jobs.
United States politicians also have raised questions about the company's plans to reincorporate in Britain. The strategy, known as an inversion, is increasingly popular among United States companies, especially in the pharmaceutical industry.
The opposition Labour Party, which had accused Prime Minister David Cameron of cheerleading for the Pfizer bid, welcomed the decision by AstraZeneca.
"The AstraZeneca board has remained resolute and sought to act in the best long-term interests of the company and its vital work in developing new lifesaving drugs," said Chuka Umunna, who speaks for the Labour Party on business issues.
"Pfizer has said today that it will not seek to launch a hostile bid and must not renege on this promise," Mr. Umunna said.
Stephen Castle contributed reporting.

Abstract: Because they aren't tips, they don't belong to the serving staff. According to one multicity study, in a single week, nearly two-thirds of low-wage workers had, on average, 15 percent of their pay stolen by their employers.

Full text:   Midterm elections are like fancy software: Experts love them, end-users couldn't care less. But if the 2010 elections are any indication, we might not want to doze off as we head into the summer months before November. Midterm elections at the state level can have tremendous consequences, especially for low-wage workers. What you don't know can hurt you -- or them.
In 2010, the Republicans won control of the executive and legislative branches in 11 states (there are now more than 20 such states). Inspired by business groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, they proceeded to rewrite the rules of work, passing legislation designed to enhance the position of employers at the expense of employees.
The University of Oregon political scientist Gordon Lafer, who wrote an eye-opening report on this topic last October for the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington, looked at dozens of bills affecting workers. The legislation involved unemployment insurance, the minimum wage, child labor, collective bargaining, sick days, even meal breaks. Despite frequent Republican claims to be defending local customs and individual liberty, Mr. Lafer found a "cookie-cutter" pattern to their legislation. Not only did it consistently favor employers over workers, it also tilted toward big government over local government. And it often abridged the economic rights of individuals.
Take the case of tipped workers and the minimum wage. In most states, tipped workers earn an hourly wage that is less than the federal minimum -- the federal subminimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour -- because they're supposed to make up the rest in tips. (They often don't; the poverty rate among waiters and waitresses is 250 percent higher than it is among the general work force.) But non-serving staff who don't get tips must be paid the minimum wage.
Republican state legislators have devised a way around that. In 2011, lawmakers in Wyoming introduced a bill that would have allowed restaurants and other employers to force their serving staff to pool their tips; tips would be redistributed among the nonserving staff, who could then be paid the subminimum wage. That same year, Maine legislators passed a bill declaring that "service charges" were not tips at all. Because they aren't tips, they don't belong to the serving staff. Employers can pocket them -- without informing customers -- whether they redistribute them among the staff or keep them.
In both cases, conservative Republicans supported the right of employers to take money that workers had earned. This disregard for the earnings of workers is only an extreme manifestation of a more common phenomenon among Republican legislators: their indifference to the problem of wage theft.
Wage theft refers to the practice among employers of taking money from their employees by illegally paying them less than the minimum wage or not paying them overtime. According to one multicity study, in a single week, nearly two-thirds of low-wage workers had, on average, 15 percent of their pay stolen by their employers.
One of the causes of this epidemic of wage theft -- which, according to Mr. Lafer's E.P.I. report, involves sums "far greater than the combined total stolen in all the bank robberies, gas station robberies, and convenience store robberies in the country" -- is lax enforcement of the country's wage and hour laws. In 1941, there was one federal inspector for every 11,000 workers. As of 2008, there was one for every 141,000 workers. "The average employer has just a 0.001 percent chance of being investigated in a given year," Mr. Lafer estimates. Because there is so little risk of getting caught, one-third of all employers who have been found guilty of violating wage and hour laws continue to do it.
In 2010, liberal legislators in Miami-Dade County decided to take matters into their own hands. They passed an anti-wage-theft ordinance, resulting in more than 600 prosecutions and $1.7 million recovered in stolen pay in the first year alone. Miami-Dade's success inspired Broward and Palm Beach Counties to propose similar measures.
In response, Republican legislators in Tallahassee tried to pass a bill that would prohibit any "county, municipality, or political subdivision of the state" from enacting laws, rules, ordinances or regulations "for the purpose of addressing wage theft." They failed, so they tried again. This time, the bill passed the Florida House, but failed in the Senate.
Where conservatives often style themselves as the champions of local control -- Ronald Reagan called for a government with "as much law and decision-making authority as possible kept at the local level" -- the Florida example suggests that they have no compunction about sacrificing that principle when it threatens business interests.
Over the last four decades, for example, low-wage workers have been hit hard by the declining value of the federal minimum wage. In the absence of federal action, states, cities and counties have increased the minimum wage or indexed it to inflation (or both) to ensure that it keep pace with rising costs.
Republican politicians in state capitals have tried to check them at every point. Florida, Indiana and Mississippi have banned local governments from increasing the minimum wage. In Nevada, Missouri and Arizona, state legislators tried to overturn constitutional amendments and ballot initiatives. In 2011, New Hampshire's Republican legislature simply abolished the state's minimum wage.
State legislators have also overridden local efforts to grant employees a right to paid sick days. Nearly 40 percent of private-sector workers have no such right. So Milwaukee and Orange County in Florida tried to establish one within their jurisdictions (as New York City did recently). In Wisconsin, state legislators overturned Milwaukee's ordinance. In Florida, they simply prohibited any city or county from passing such an ordinance. Other states, including Louisiana and Mississippi, have done the same.
Perhaps most surprising is the willingness of Republican legislators to expose the individual to the intrusion and interference of the state. In Tennessee, a bill sponsored by ALEC members that was passed in 2012 stipulated a series of deadlines at which an unemployed worker would have to start accepting a lower-paying job or lose her unemployment benefits. After 13 weeks, she would have to accept any job paying at least 75 percent of her previous wage; after 25 weeks, 70 percent; and after 38 weeks, 65 percent. To ensure compliance with these byzantine regulations (the red tape Republicans so often claim to oppose), the bill required anyone receiving unemployment insurance to submit detailed weekly reports showing that she had applied for at least three jobs per week. It also mandated that the State Department of Labor to audit 1,000 recipients per week. This time, Republicans managed to find the personnel.
The overall thrust of this state legislation is to create workers who are docile and employers who are empowered. That may be why Republican legislators in Idaho, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Ohio, Minnesota, Utah and Missouri have been so eager to ease restrictions on when and how much children can work. High schoolers should learn workplace virtues, says the conservative commentator Ben Stein, like "not talking back." Early exposure to employment will teach 12-year-olds, as the spokesman of an Idaho school district put it, that "you have to do what you're asked, what your supervisor is telling you."
And if workers don't learn that lesson in junior high, recent Republican changes to state unemployment codes will ensure that they learn it as adults. In 2011, Florida stipulated that any employee fired for "deliberate violation or disregard of the reasonable standards of behavior which the employer expects" would be ineligible for unemployment benefits. Arkansas passed a similar amendment ("violation of any behavioral policies of the employer"). The following year so did South Carolina ("deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect") and Tennessee. The upshot of these changes is that any employee breaking the rules of her employer -- be they posting comments about work on Facebook, dating a co-worker or an employee from a rival firm, going to the bathroom without permission -- can be fired and denied unemployment. Faced with that double penalty, any worker might think twice about crossing her boss.
What might Adam Smith, often claimed as the intellectual godfather of the American right, have said about these legislative efforts? "Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and their workmen," wrote Smith in "The Wealth of Nations," "its counsellors are always the masters. When the regulation, therefore, is in favour of the workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes otherwise when in favour of the masters."
Indeed.

Abstract: In particular, economists said, a rise in the Consumer Price Index in April, along with several other reports this week, suggest a broader economic firming is underway after a weak, weather-plagued start to 2014. Besides the increase in consumer prices reported on Thursday, data Wednesday on producer prices showed a rise of 0.6 percent last month, the largest increase since September 2012 and an indication that demand for a number of basic goods is growing faster than economists expected.

Full text:   The Federal Reserve finally seems to be getting what it wants.
Two indicators of economic health that the Fed and its chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, have identified as keys to a stronger recovery -- modestly higher inflation and a more robust job market -- finally seem to be moving in the right direction, according to new data released by the government on Thursday.
In particular, economists said, a rise in the Consumer Price Index in April, along with several other reports this week, suggest a broader economic firming is underway after a weak, weather-plagued start to 2014.
Besides the increase in consumer prices reported on Thursday, data Wednesday on producer prices showed a rise of 0.6 percent last month, the largest increase since September 2012 and an indication that demand for a number of basic goods is growing faster than economists expected.
At the same time, a survey of small-business optimism on Tuesday showed sentiment at its best level since before the recession began in December 2007.
"It's not just the C.P.I.," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "We've had loads more data showing the same thing, and it's good news because the fear at this time last year was excessively low inflation or even deflation."
These nascent signs of a rebound in the United States stand in stark contrast to the economic landscape in Europe, where many countries are struggling to grow at all, and stagnation, deflation and high unemployment remain menaces.
Although preventing higher inflation has long been the traditional concern for central bankers, and many remember it as a serious problem from the 1970s, the Fed has been more worried in recent years about the risk of stagnant prices, which reflect an economy struggling to recover from the financial crisis and recession.
As recently as last month, in a speech in New York, Ms. Yellen warned that the danger of too little inflation still outweighed the risks posed by too much. But even as the Fed's preferred inflation gauge remains contained, the new data from the Labor Department Thursday, including a 12-month rise in consumer prices of 2 percent, suggests inflation is moving within shouting distance of the Fed's target.
A separate Labor Department report on Thursday put new claims for unemployment insurance last week at their lowest level since May 2007, the latest in a series of indicators suggesting a healthier labor market, including the upswing in payrolls reported by employers last month.
The American economy is still emerging from a very slow patch. The first estimate for the growth rate of the economy last quarter showed that output expanded at a rate of just 0.1 percent, and that number may even drop into negative territory when the Commerce Department revises the figure later this month. Other data this week on industrial production and housing has also been underwhelming, and even some relative optimists like Mr. Shepherdson foresee more headwinds for the housing market as rates rise.
Still, many private experts, as well as the policy makers at the Fed, argue that a substantial part of the weakness last quarter was caused by frigid temperatures and wintry conditions that delayed business activity in many part of the country, rather than a fundamental slowdown.
Private economists forecast overall growth in the United States could rise at an annual rate of 3 to 4 percent in the second quarter, the period of April, May and June.
The advance on the price front was widespread. "Virtually anywhere you look in this report, you see inflation is turning somewhat higher," said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. "Prices for services have risen at a solid pace for some time, but what's changed as of late is that goods prices have started to firm up after actually dropping."
For example, he pointed to increases in prices for new and used vehicles, airline tickets and prescription drugs, as well as for apartment and house rentals. "It's not where you'd say there was an inflation problem, but the Fed is starting to get their wish for a move up in the inflation rate," Mr. Maki added.
The less volatile core rate of the Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy prices, increased by 0.2 percent in April, compared with the 0.1 percent gain economists had expected.
Energy and food prices also rose sharply, lifting the total increase for consumer prices to 0.3 percent. Meat prices rose by 2.9 percent, the biggest monthly jump in more than a decade.
One reason that the Fed worries about persistently low inflation and the threat of deflation is that they discourage consumer spending and hold back investment. They are also difficult to overcome, as Japan's experience in recent years has shown. Mr. Maki noted that while the Fed still possessed tools to combat inflation, it had few options in reversing deflation, with short-term interest rates near zero.
With inflation now showing signs of picking up, and a gradual improvement in the labor market bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.3 percent in April, the Fed is now on a glide path that could lead to the first increase in short-term rates, starting in the second half of 2015.
"If inflation continues to rise as we expect it to, and the unemployment rate keeps falling, it could potentially change the timing of the first rate hike and move it up slightly," Mr. Maki said.

Full text:   Investors retreated from stocks on Thursday, giving the Dow Jones industrial average its worst day in five weeks, after disappointing earnings from Walmart Stores and mixed news about the global economy were reported.
Financial markets reflected broader investor jitters: Bond prices rose, small-company stocks fell anew, and safe, slower-growth industries fared best.
The latest economic data from the United States was mixed: Factory output fell. But fewer people sought unemployment benefits. The news was more disappointing in Europe, where output in the 18 countries that share the euro rose just 0.2 percent in the first quarter.
"People are just a little bit nervous about the entire global economic environment at the moment," said Ryan Larson, head of United States equities at the Royal Bank of Canada.
The Dow lost 167.16 points, or 1 percent, to close at 16,446.81. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 17.68 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,870.85, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 31.33 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,069.29.
The Dow was dragged down by Walmart, which fell $1.91, or 2.4 percent, to $76.83. The company reported lower earnings for its most recent quarter and warned that the current one was not expected to be much better. Kohl's shares dropped $1.82, or 3.4 percent, to $52.21 after reporting lower first-quarter earnings.
One bright spot was Cisco Systems, the telecommunications equipment maker. Its stock jumped $1.37, or 6 percent, to $24.18. Cisco reported earnings that were better than expected.
The broader stock sell-off comes two days after the Dow and S.&P. 500 hit record highs, not adjusted for inflation.
The Russell 2000 index, a measure of mostly small-capitalization companies, fell 0.7 percent on Thursday. The index is down 9.3 percent from its March 4 high.
The bond market had its best day since early February, when measured by the Barclays United States aggregate bond index, a broad gauge of the entire market.
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note hit its lowest level in about 10 months, dropping to 2.50 percent, from 2.55 percent late on Wednesday. Its price rose 14/32, to 100 1/32. At the beginning of the week, the 10-year note had a yield of 2.66 percent. That is an extraordinary move for bond yields.
Typically, such a movement in the bond market might signal something wrong with the American economy. But recent economic data has been mixed. For example, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production fell 0.6 percent in April. But a Labor Department report showed that the number of Americans who filed for unemployment benefits fell to a seven-year low.
And the Labor Department said consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in nearly a year in April, putting inflation on pace to rise 2 percent this year.
Investors do not normally buy bonds at 2.5 percent interest if inflation is running at 2 percent.
"It's really confusing, to be honest," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. "The bond market thinks there's a risk out there that the stock market isn't seeing."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Top officials of the European Central Bank sent strong signals on Wednesday that action to stimulate the economy was all but certain next month. But they also made it clear that the bank was unlikely to make a powerful injection of money into the economy.
Such a boost, which the Federal Reserve accomplished in the United States through huge purchases of government bonds, is seen by many analysts as necessary to prevent the euro zone from tipping into a new crisis.
At its meeting in June, the E.C.B. is likely to cut the main interest rate to close to zero, begin penalizing banks for hoarding cash by means of negative interest rates and perhaps issue a new round of cheap loans to banks, according to the comments by the central bankers. The E.C.B. could also buy assets like packages of bank loans.
Expectations were already high that the bank would do something at its June 5 meeting to promote growth. Mario Draghi, the president of the bank, said last week that there was a consensus on the bank's 24-member governing council that inflation was too low and that something should be done about it.
But the outlook for inflation and the state of the European economy would have to significantly worsen before the central bank would begin buying government bonds wholesale, Peter Praet, a member of the bank's executive board, told the German newspaper Die Zeit in an interview published on Wednesday.
Continued reluctance by the E.C.B. to deploy quantitative easing, or the buying of bonds and other financial instruments to stimulate the economy, will come as a disappointment to many economists, who warn that the euro zone faces the same kind of prolonged stagnation that has gripped Japan.
"Any action that is likely to be taken is almost certainly going to be a case of too little, too late," Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, a consultancy in London, said in an email on Wednesday.
With the benchmark interest rate already at a record low of 0.25 percent, the central bank has been struggling to find ways to raise inflation and get banks to lend.
The central bank's main aim in imposing a negative deposit rate would be to lower the value of the euro against the dollar and other major currencies. A negative deposit rate would encourage investors to buy other currencies that pay a better return. Euro zone exporters benefit from a weaker currency because it makes their products cheaper in foreign markets. The bank has expressed concern that the euro is too strong.
"Negative deposit rates are a possible part of a combination of measures," Mr. Praet told Die Zeit. "We are preparing a range of things." He also said that the central bank could offer long-term loans to banks, with conditions attached to ensure that banks lent the money to businesses and consumers.
At 0.7 percent, annual inflation in the euro zone is below the 2 percent level that the central bank considers healthy. When inflation is that low, debtors have more trouble repaying their loans and there is a risk that some kind of shock could lead to deflation, a broad decline in prices that undercuts business investment and can lead to mass unemployment.
Such a shock could come from the current tensions in Russia and Ukraine. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is partly financed by the United States, warned on Wednesday that the dispute could have severe economic consequences in Eastern Europe, countries of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East. That bank promotes economic development in those regions.
"The crisis in Russia and Ukraine is having a severe impact on the economies of the two countries and is threatening to slow down the recovery in the wider E.B.R.D. region -- or even bring it to a complete halt," the bank said on Wednesday.
The statements by central bankers showed wide agreement on measures, short of quantitative easing, to combat such risks.
The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, signaled that it would not object to more aggressive stimulus measures, which should in turn assure the support of the German public.
However, the Bundesbank gave several caveats and remained opposed to the purchase of euro zone government bonds, an action it regards as illegal.
Mr. Draghi indicated last week that the bank would announce stimulus measures at its June 5 meeting, assuming that there was no change in the long-term outlook for inflation.
"The governing council is not resigned to having low inflation for too long a time," Mr. Draghi said last week at a news conference in Brussels. "The governing council is comfortable with acting next time."
The euro fell on Tuesday after reports in The Wall Street Journal and several German newspapers that the Bundesbank would support unprecedented stimulus measures. On Wednesday, a person at the Bundesbank who is familiar with the thinking of top policy makers played down the reports. The person said the Bundesbank's position had not fundamentally changed in recent months.
The euro rose slightly on Wednesday to about $1.37.
The Bundesbank would not oppose measures like new low-cost loans to banks or negative deposit rates if such measures were deemed necessary, said the person at the bank, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The Bundesbank also would not oppose the purchase of packages of bank loans, the person said, which could make it easier for banks to lend money in troubled countries like Italy and Spain.
Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, confirmed on Wednesday that he was open to more stimulus.
The Bundesbank first indicated in March that it might consider unusual steps to stimulate the economy.
Mr. Weidmann is a vocal member of the European Central Bank's governing council. He has often split with other members over policy and speaks for a significant number of Germans. His support for stimulus measures would reduce the risk that moves by the central bank to push up inflation would alienate the German public.
Mr. Weidmann said he had not dropped his opposition to E.C.B. purchases of euro zone government bonds, which he regards as a violation of the bank's mandate.
Yves Mersch, a member of the E.C.B.'s executive board, appeared to leave the door open to quantitative easing, saying in Berlin on Wednesday that the central bank would not be violating its mandate if it bought government bonds.
Mr. Mersch defended the central bank's promise to buy bonds of troubled countries to keep their borrowing rates under control.
The program, which has not been put into effect since its announcement in 2012, has been controversial in Germany and was the subject of a legal challenge in the country's constitutional court. The German court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, which is considering it.
The E.C.B.'s mandate "includes the possibility of buying, under the appropriate conditions, government bonds on the secondary market," Mr. Mersch said, according to a prepared text, "should this be necessary from a monetary policy perspective."

Full text:   The stock market fell back from record levels on Wednesday as investors decided it was better to play it safe.
A day after the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index flirted with 1,900 mark for the first time, investors turned their backs on stocks that would benefit more than others from a reviving economy. Consumer discretionary stocks, a group that includes luxury retailers and entertainment companies, dropped. Industrial and technology companies also fell, and riskier small-company stocks continued their sell-off after a rebound on Monday.
Instead, investors sought safety in utility and telecommunications stocks -- favorites when the market gets choppy -- which rose the most in the S.&P. 500. Government bonds also rallied, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to its lowest point in about six months, another sign that investors were favoring safer assets.
"There's some internal self-correction and rotation going on beneath the surface," said Jim Russell, a regional investment director at U.S. Bank. Mr. Russell said stocks were getting closer to being fairly valued.
The S.&P. 500 fell 8.92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,888.53. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 101.47 points, or 0.6 percent, to 16,613.97. Both reached nominal record highs on Tuesday.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 29.54 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,100.63.
The Russell 2000 index, a gauge of small-company stocks, fell 18.02 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,103.14. The index has slumped 9 percent since peaking on March 4, as investors have fled risk.
Bonds benefited from investors' appetite for safer assets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.55 percent from 2.61 percent on Tuesday, as its price rose 18/32, to 99 19/32.
"People are rotating out of equities and into bonds," Mark Pibl, United States fixed-income strategist at Canaccord Genuity, a wealth manager, said of Wednesday's moves in the bond market.
Bonds have rallied this year because inflation remains low and investors have been concerned that the economy may not grow as quickly as anticipated. The Barclays index of Treasury bonds maturing in 20 years or more has gained 10.6 percent this year, outperforming the 2.2 percent rise of the S.&P. 500.
In corporate news, the Fossil Group, a maker of watches, jewelry and accessories, was the biggest decliner in the S.&P. 500 in terms of percentage. Fossil fell $11.45, or 10.3 percent, to $100 after the company said late on Tuesday that its first-quarter net income had fallen 8 percent despite sales gains across all its business segments. The results beat market expectations, but the company gave a weak forecast.
The farm equipment maker Deere & Company fell $1.91, or 2 percent, to $91.70 after it reported a decline in second-quarter net income because of weaker demand for its products. The company also cut its full-year sales forecast.
The American depositary receipts of Sony dropped $1.14, or 6.5 percent, to $16.50 after the Japanese electronics giant reported a loss of $1.3 billion and forecast more to come as it struggles to execute a turnaround.
Almost all the companies in the S.&P. 500 have finished reporting their first-quarter earnings. Earnings rose 3.3 percent for the period, according to S&P Capital IQ. That compares with growth of almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter.

Full text:   Preliminary data shows Japan's economy, the world's third-largest after the United States and China, grew at a 5.9 percent annualized rate in the January-March quarter as companies and consumers stepped up buying ahead of an increase in the sales tax. The growth figures released on Thursday were in line with expectations. Strong private consumption, residential investment and corporate spending were the biggest contributors to growth, while public spending fell slightly. Quarter-to-quarter growth, adjusted for inflation, was 1.5 percent. Japan raised its sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent on April 1, and economists expect that change to cause a contraction in the current quarter. The first-quarter expansion was the fastest since the rebound from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami disasters and the sixth straight quarter of expansion.

Abstract: Pfizer, the maker of best-selling drugs like Lipitor and Viagra, has said it is willing to pay a combination of cash and shares in a deal worth more than $100 billion. In separate testimony, Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, said he worried that a combination of the two companies would be a "distraction" that would derail AstraZeneca's efforts to rebuild its product pipeline and innovate in the future.

Full text:   LONDON -- Pfizer opened the door on Tuesday to a possible higher offer for AstraZeneca, saying the deal remained compelling. It also urged AstraZeneca's board to engage in discussions that could result in "a transaction that AstraZeneca can recommend."
In a statement on Tuesday, Pfizer said it was still disappointed by AstraZeneca's unwillingness to engage in substantive talks and reiterated that it would be "disciplined on price" in any offer. Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 to make a formal offer or walk away from the deal.
AstraZeneca has rebuffed several takeover approaches by Pfizer, most recently this month. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca said its board believed that Pfizer was "making an opportunistic attempt to acquire a transformed AstraZeneca without reflecting the value of its exciting pipeline."
Pfizer, the maker of best-selling drugs like Lipitor and Viagra, has said it is willing to pay a combination of cash and shares in a deal worth more than $100 billion. If completed, the deal would nominally be one of the largest acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry, surpassing Pfizer's takeover of Warner-Lambert 14 years ago. That deal was valued at $90 billion, not adjusting for inflation.
The top executives of both companies appeared before Parliament in Britain on Tuesday.
In a contentious session before a parliamentary committee, British lawmakers repeatedly challenged Ian C. Read, Pfizer's chief executive, about the company's commitment to keep jobs in the Britain.
British politicians have raised concerns that the deal would mean the elimination of jobs and financing for future science research in Britain. AstraZeneca employs 51,500 people worldwide, including about 6,700 in Britain.
Pfizer has committed to keeping at least 20 percent of its combined research and development work force in Britain. It said it would follow through on a deal to complete a hub being built by AstraZeneca in Cambridge, England.
In his testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Read called the commitment "unprecedented," but he refused to be pinned down on a jobs number or say what the combined company's research budget would be.
William Bain, a member of the House of Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, pressed Mr. Read about the proposed deal.
"There are no commitments of any substance being made whatsoever," Mr. Bain said. "You're telling us you don't know how many R&D staff you're employing. You can't tell us next year how many R&D staff you're employing. Is this really credible? You must have some forward planning about how many staff you're going to employ. How many?"
Mr. Read replied, "What I said to you is that I'm trying to run this business to be a successful business which gives confidence to our employees their jobs are going to be there ---- "
"How many?" Mr. Bain interrupted.
"I'll get to that," Mr. Read said. "So, I can't tell today how many people are going to be in research and development in the combined company. I haven't even seen the books of AstraZeneca. I don't know how many people they have today in the U.K. I don't know how many they have globally. I don't know how many of them are on projects that are duplicate to our projects."
The lawmakers also challenged Mr. Read on whether the proposed merger was simply driven by potential tax savings by Pfizer.
One reason the deal is attractive to Pfizer is that it would allow the company to reincorporate in Britain and avoid higher corporate taxes in the United States.
The strategy, known as an inversion, is increasingly popular among United States companies, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, despite drawing the anger of politicians in the United States.
Mr. Read said the deal's tax advantages were important, but were not the only driving factor behind the potential combination.
"We are a great company with 80,000 employees," Mr. Read said. "Our purpose is to bring life-changing products to patients. The way to do that is to put together the pipelines of both companies."
Mr. Read said Pfizer had a strong commitment to science, pointing to the 13 drugs the company had taken to market since its acquisition of Wyeth in 2009.
Frank A. D'Amelio, Pfizer's chief financial officer, said the combined company's consolidated tax rate would probably be below the 27 to 30 percent Pfizer has paid in the United States in recent years.
In separate testimony, Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, said he worried that a combination of the two companies would be a "distraction" that would derail AstraZeneca's efforts to rebuild its product pipeline and innovate in the future.
"Pfizer is certainly a company with a lot of great people," Mr. Soriot said. "The problem with a merger of this magnitude is the distraction it brings."
Mr. Soriot said employees, after a merger of this size, worry about their jobs, who their next supervisor will be and whether their research will continue. That, combined with the difficulties of integrating two large organizations, can pose a distraction, he said.
He reiterated that AstraZeneca believed Pfizer's latest offer undervalued the company. He added that it was unclear to him what Pfizer's 20 percent commitment would ultimately mean in terms of jobs in Britain.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: According to Centaline, one of China's largest real estate brokerage firms, transactions over the May 1 holiday weekend fell by half in Beijing and Shanghai from a year ago.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- After almost two decades of nearly unceasing increases in real estate prices and construction across China, one of the world's longest-running bull markets finally seems to be stalling, with broad consequences for the country's economy and possibly its politics.
Prices are falling for both new and old apartments. The volume of deals is drying up. And developers are pulling back, furloughing workers and delaying new projects. In the latest sign, housing starts plummeted 25 percent in April from a year ago, the Chinese government announced on Tuesday.
It is a severe blow for a country where real estate sales offices have become ubiquitous and tower cranes are jokingly described as the national bird.
Su Hua, a real estate broker in Shenzhen, had his highest commissions ever last year, as a speculative frenzy prompted families all over China to buy and sell apartments at a brisk pace. But he sat in a deserted office late last week with several silent phones on his desk. His income has halved so far this year.
The question is how much further the real estate market will slow, and whether its troubles will spill into other sectors of the economy, notably the banking system. Any weakness in the great Chinese economic engine could reverberate through the global markets.
"You can't predict how the bursting of a Chinese real estate bubble plays out because it plays out in very small steps," said Joel H. Rothstein, a partner in the Beijing office of the Paul Hastings law firm who specializes in Asian real estate.
China's real estate market correction -- some economists are even calling it the popping of a bubble -- is partly the result of a deliberate decision by the country's leaders in Beijing.
The Federal Reserve and other regulators in the United States did not try to deflate what now seems to have been an American housing bubble in the years leading up to the 2008 downturn. But the Chinese leadership has been increasingly concerned over the last several years that housing prices were rising to unaffordable levels and that the economy was becoming overly dependent on investment; residential construction accounts for one-ninth of all economic output.
The result has been a series of policies that includes punitive interest rates for mortgages on second homes, a ban on the purchase of third homes and, more recently, deliberate action by the central bank to keep short-term interest rates well above the rate of inflation. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, the People's Bank of China, reaffirmed tight credit policies on Saturday, saying that he did not think the economy was in sufficient trouble to justify monetary policy stimulus.
But the real estate market continues to slump, which could prompt Beijing to take a different tack.
Economic data released on Tuesday also included a deceleration in industrial production, with growth in steel and cement output slowing to a crawl. Retail sales also grew more slowly than expected in April, and the furniture market stalled as fewer families moved into new homes.
According to Centaline, one of China's largest real estate brokerage firms, transactions over the May 1 holiday weekend fell by half in Beijing and Shanghai from a year ago. The weekend is traditionally one of the two biggest real estate buying times of the year, along with a weeklong national holiday at the start of October.
Mr. Su, the real estate broker, worries that the market tumult shows no sign of ending. "There is not much else I know how to do," Mr. Su said. "Maybe I will consider selling insurance on the side, if business continues to slow."
A handful of real estate restrictions are already being rescinded. In the last two weeks, state-controlled banks in Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, have stopped charging the extra half percentage point to one percentage point above the regulated national benchmark rate for mortgages. They had been charging extra in recent years, in an effort to discourage excess in the market.
But some experts wonder whether wealthy families will want to jump back into the market even if the most important restrictions, on the purchase of multiple apartments, are lifted. Nicole Wong, the head of property research at CLSA, a Hong Kong-based brokerage and investment firm, said that easing limits on overseas investment meant that more wealthy families were starting to send their money to Hong Kong and elsewhere instead of buying more apartments.
For real estate prices, "even if you relax all the restrictions, it won't make much of a difference," she said. "The one thing that is certain is the direction is set, and it is down -- but it can be managed."
Chinese banking executives and economists say that a severe housing downturn would most likely cause a considerable increase in nonperforming loans at the country's banks. But they make several arguments for why even a fairly steep slump in housing might not lead to the bank failures or emergency bailouts seen in the United States when its market soured.
A major reason is that a significant drop in the housing market would still leave the prices of most homes higher than the balance on the mortgages. So almost nobody expects a big wave of foreclosures.
The bulk of the homes in China were bought more than five years ago, and real estate prices have about doubled in the last five years. Down payments range from 20 to 40 percent and are often higher, giving banks a larger cushion against any losses.
A bigger worry is the extent to which companies in other sectors have borrowed money from banks and trusts that they were supposed to invest in equipment purchases and other business activities, but have secretly speculated in real estate instead. Extensive anecdotal evidence suggests that such speculative activity by companies has been widespread.
Other sectors of the Chinese economy are healthier than residential real estate, and could help sustain economic output. Infrastructure spending by the government, particularly railroad construction, is moving into high gear. And the central bank has gradually pushed down the renminbi against the dollar in currency markets this year, helping the competitiveness of Chinese goods.
But the trouble in the housing market has serious implications for consumers. A national survey released in March by the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, China, found that households across the country had 66 percent of their assets in their homes, a figure that rises to 84 percent in Beijing. The comparable figure for the United States, where stocks and bonds are more popular, is 41 percent.
With so much wealth tied up in housing, concerns are rising about the potential for protests and other turbulence if real estate prices keep falling. A new crop of discounts adds to the nervousness.
Government and private sector statistics for real estate prices are inconsistent and hard to compare. But discounts of 10 to 20 percent from a year ago are increasingly common for homes sold between individuals, and for new units sold by developers as well, real estate executives said.
The chairman of a large developer with operations across China said that offering price discounts for the remaining units in half-sold projects was extremely difficult, because earlier buyers could protest and demand refunds equal to the discounts. The potential for protests, and not banking sector exposure to real estate, "is what concerns me," said the developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
But Winnie Y. Cheng, the research director at Centaline, said that many developers could not afford to hold apartments off the market indefinitely and were already cutting prices. Street protests have occurred, notably in Hangzhou, although earlier buyers have mostly accepted the discounts for later buyers, she said.
These days, she added, "All of the developments are willing to cut their price."

Full text:   The years from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were not the most egalitarian in American history. Robber barons roamed the economy, living off lavish rents generated by powerful cartels and industrial monopolies.
The richest 1 percent of Americans reaped nearly one in five dollars generated by the economy and amassed almost half its wealth; at the other end of the scale, wage earners lost ground to inflation. It was the era of the Haymarket riots and Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle." Workers staged 1,500 strikes in 1886 alone.
Ultimately, though, the disparities in wealth and income led to an age of ferment that came to be known as the Progressive Era.
Women got the right to vote. Congress passed the Sherman Act. Chicago's Beef Trust and John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil were taken down. In 1914, Henry Ford decided to raise wages to $5 a day, doubling at a stroke most of his workers' pay.
And crucially, a progressive federal income tax was enacted by Constitutional amendment, overcoming the opposition of not only the steel lobby and the establishment press, but a Supreme Court that had struck down the income tax law of 1894 as unconstitutional.
"The present assault on capital is but the beginning," wrote Justice Stephen J. Field in a concurring opinion against the 1894 law. "It will be but the steppingstone to others, larger and more sweeping, till our political contests will become a war of the poor against the rich; a war constantly growing in intensity and bitterness."
But Edwin Seligman of Columbia University, one of the leading proponents of a progressive income tax, ultimately had the winning argument: "Amid the clashing of divergent interests and the endeavor of each social class to roll off the burden of taxation on some other class, we discern the slow and laborious growth of standards of justice in taxation and the attempt on the part of the community as a whole to realize this justice."
The United States has come a long way over the last century. Still, it remains a strikingly similar place in a couple of important respects.
The income of a typical American family has barely risen since the 1970s. The share of national income captured by the richest 1 percent of Americans is even higher than it was at the dawn of the 20th century.
The parallel offers valuable insight into one of the most important questions posed by the nation's lopsided development: Can democracy stop inequality from rising? Despite the gains of the Progressive Era, the answer echoing down the halls of history is not encouraging.
Basic models of political economy hold that inequality self-corrects. As income concentrates among a smaller group of voters, majorities will vote for more redistribution.
But that isn't quite how the world works. For starters, the poor vote less than the rich. And they don't vote exclusively based on their economic self-interest. Many Americans, rich or poor, mistrust government. They support free-market capitalism and view the distribution of the nation's economic fruits as roughly fair.
The growing concentration of income can, in fact, make inequality more difficult to correct, as the wealthy bring their wealth to bear on the political process to maintain their privilege.
What's more, disparities in income seem to produce political polarization and gridlock, which tend to favor those who receive a better deal from the prevailing rules, says Francesco Trebbi, an expert on political economy at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
The American political system may eventually act against the interests of the fortunate few at the very top of the pyramid of success. But that may be only because many affluent, powerful people just below the top notch see themselves as losers from the nation's economic dynamics.
"The really upset people are those that are well in the top of the distribution," said Nolan McCarty, a political scientist at Princeton. "There could be a populist uprising, but that is less likely than a battle within the top 1 percent."
This is, indeed, reminiscent of the Progressive movement, which was led not by pitchfork-wielding populists, but by lawyers, college professors and others in the upper middle class who saw their future prosperity and social standing at risk.
"There hasn't been the immiseration you would associate with a revolution," Professor McCarty said. "But people are concerned about fairness and the way the game has been rigged."
Is this alignment of forces enough to stop America's income chasm from growing?
Some scholars draw hope from the nation's history. In his best-selling "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," the French economist Thomas Piketty proposes that inequality could be tempered by returning to the tax rates of the past. Confiscatory taxes of excess incomes are, he says, "an American invention." If we could raise top tax rates to nearly 80 percent once, why couldn't we do it again?
Historical precedent, however, doesn't justify unbridled optimism. For all the egalitarian initiatives of the Progressive Era, it did little to curb the concentration of income at the top.
"The Progressive era established the basic grammar and vocabulary and syntax of the American policy discussion for a century," said David Kennedy, the prominent Stanford historian. "All the main themes of equity and access to democratic institutions and workplace regulations came up then."
But in terms of real redistribution, Professor Kennedy added, "relatively little was accomplished."
The bold new income tax affected only a tiny share of Americans. And while the top rate for a married couple was 7 percent, to reach it they had to make more than $500,000, nearly $12 million in 2014 dollars. In 1913, it raised a grand total of $28 million, a mere $668 million in today's dollars.
Justifying hefty taxation of the wealthy required a more compelling argument than inequality. The immiseration caused by the Great Depression helped. But winning the argument required war. Only the prospect of many thousands of poor young men contributing their lives to the national project could justify taking more of the elite's money in the service of the national good.
"The idea was conscription of wealth and income," said Kenneth Scheve, a political scientist at Stanford. "The term was used in party manifestos, in speeches to Congress. It came up everywhere."
By 1917, the top federal income tax rate had been raised to 67 percent. Though it fell in the 1920s, it would rise again during the Great Depression and, especially, World War II. In 1940, before the United States entered the conflagration, the federal income tax raised $1.5 billion ($25 billion in today's money). By 1945, it collected $17 billion ($223 billion). The top income tax rate would not fall below 70 percent again until 1980.
But what does this historical precedent say about our ability to deal with inequality today?
The Great Recession helped make a case for redistribution. Jason Furman, President Obama's chief economic adviser, says that the administration's initiatives -- like higher income tax rates, subsidies to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and expanded tax breaks for poor families with children -- have produced "the most significant policy-induced reduction in inequality in at least 40 years." Just the tax measures, Mr. Furman estimated, take off about half a decade's worth of increasing inequality, as measured by the so-called Gini coefficient.
Is this as good as it gets? For all the struggle on the part of the White House, the income gap keeps growing. Maybe this means that, in the absence of war, democracy can't do much more.

Full text:   BEIJING -- Since China introduced a floating exchange rate on July 21, 2005, the Chinese yuan has consistently risen in value against the United States dollar, from a low of 8.28 yuan to the dollar in July 2005 to a high of 6.06 in January of this year. But the appreciation of the yuan has failed to convince ordinary Chinese people that their money buys more; on the contrary, they feel it's worth less.
For the last nine years, while the yuan has appreciated in relation to other currencies, it has steadily lost value at home. Many attribute this to excess printing of currency by the central bank. The excess of China's money supply (known as "M2") at the end of 2013 totaled 110.65 trillion yuan ($17.77 trillion), four times greater than the figure 10 years earlier, when it stood at 22.1 trillion yuan ($3.55 trillion, at today's rate).
The basic tenets of monetary policy say that for every 1 yuan rise in the value of the economy, the central bank should add 1 yuan in currency. Any supply of currency above that rate is excess. Today, the value of Chinese currency in circulation compared with gross domestic product is at a ratio close to 2:1 (in 2013, China's G.D.P. amounted to 56.88 trillion yuan, or $9.31 trillion).
Because China's economic growth relies chiefly on investment, it requires major injections of capital. As the government economist Wu Xiaoling put it, "In the past 30 years, we have used excessive money supply to rapidly advance our economy."
In most economies, that would lead to rampant inflation, but if we look at the rise in China's Consumer Price Index over the last two years, it's usually been in the range of 2 to 3 percent, and only occasionally above 3 percent. During the last decade, there have been only two occasions when prices rose sharply: in 2008, when the increase topped 8 percent, and in 2011, when it peaked at about 6 percent. Why has large-scale monetary inflation failed to trigger price inflation?
From official quarters, we hear denials that China's money supply is inflationary. Sheng Songcheng, the head of the central bank's statistics and analysis department, said in January that the money supply was large because the savings rate and the ratio of indirect financial investment (that is, funding in the form of bank loans) were high. China has one of the highest household savings rates in the world, surging recently to 50 percent of disposable income (although it is only a minority of households driving the trend).
Economists differ as to what this all means, but one professor of literature has coined a term for it: "the economics of corrupt officialdom." Corrupt officials, he argues, have a lot to do with the absence of price inflation.
Corrupt officials generally do not spend the huge sums they acquire from kickbacks, and are loath to deposit their money in banks for fear it will be discovered. So they hide their money instead. The professor estimates that as much as 50 percent of the surplus money supply may have been taken out of circulation for this reason.
China's Internet commentators have seized on this phenomenon, hailing dishonest officials' creative ways of hiding money as performance art.
For example, Xie Mingzhong, a former Communist Party secretary of Wenchang in Hainan Province, was dismissed after he allegedly concealed more than 25 million yuan in safe deposit boxes.
Yan Dabin, the former chief of the state communications bureau in Wushan County, Chongqing, hid cardboard boxes containing 9.39 million yuan in the bathroom of his new apartment, where they were discovered after a water leak.
Xu Qiyao, a former chief of the construction department of Jiangsu Province, accepted some 20 million yuan in bribes. Parts of that sum were wrapped in layers of plastic and hidden in a hollow tree trunk, beneath an ash heap, in a rice field and inside a latrine.
Li Guowei, the former chief of the highway bureau in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, buried a box stuffed with 2.8 million yuan in a garbage heap next to a brother's house. "I was an unlucky dog when I got picked out," he said.
Luo Yaoxing, the former chief of the immunization planning office of the disease control center of Guangdong Province, rented a luxury apartment to store his booty. He wrapped the notes tightly inside black plastic bags. Despite protecting his stash with waterproof paper and drying agents, 1.2 million yuan still got moldy.
The list goes on. Despite a wave of prosecutions over the past decade, there is little reason to believe that much has changed. In December, a former deputy director of the Hohhot Railway Bureau in Inner Mongolia, Ma Junfei, was given a suspended death sentence for accepting bribes and concealing the sources of his immense fortune. His annual salary would have been only about 120,000 yuan ($19,300), but his two houses were stuffed with cash and gold with a value of more than 130 million yuan ($21.48 million). During his trial, Ma Junfei admitted that concealing the money he had received in bribes was a colossal headache.
The professor's estimate that half of the money supply surplus has been salted away by corrupt officials is a calculation based more on poetic license than empirical evidence, but I have no doubt that the total of stolen cash is big enough to play a role in curbing price inflation at a time of monetary expansion. Like most Chinese, I am sure that those officials who have been brought to justice represent the tip of an iceberg of kickbacks and bribes.
Of course, "the economics of corrupt officialdom" can't stop prices from rising. That is one change ordinary Chinese have become very conscious of in recent years: Everything is getting more expensive -- only the money gets cheaper.
Yu Hua is the author of "Boy in the Twilight: Stories of the Hidden China." This essay was translated by Allan H. Barr from the Chinese.

Full text:   The mortgage market was starting to come apart on Aug. 16, 2007, when Federal Reserve policy makers gathered for an emergency videoconference. The worst of the financial crisis was more than a year away, but big problems were emerging.
As the officials debated how to help, Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed, expressed alarm that the planned public statement said nothing about the risk of inflation. "Did I miss something?" he asked in a derisive tone, as Timothy Geithner recalls in his new memoir.
"No," Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said simply.
In retrospect, Mr. Lacker's concern was spectacularly misplaced. He was worried that the Fed's efforts to help the economy could overheat it and unleash inflation. Instead, the economy was on the brink of the worst downturn in 70 years.
Yet Mr. Lacker said something else during that meeting that looks more prescient -- a concern Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Geithner and other crisis fighters of the last seven years have never successfully addressed: "We could easily be portrayed as helping banks make a lot of money on this."
The release of Mr. Geithner's book, "Stress Test," has reopened the almost religious debate about whether the Obama administration and the Fed have been too easy on banks. The left and the populist right think the answer is self-evidently yes. Mr. Geithner, Mr. Bernanke and President Obama think their critics are more interested in coming up with clever talking points than thinking through the actual choices that policy makers face in a crisis.
I'm wary of the notion that both sides have a point. It's too easy a position to take. In this case, though, it happens to be accurate, and it's accurate in a way that often gets lost in the shouting. The financial rescue of 2008 and 2009 was both deeply impressive and deeply insufficient in fixing our economy's problems.
The standard argument from populist critics of Mr. Geithner, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bernanke is that they should have let more banks fail. Rather than bailing out A.I.G., Bank of America and Citigroup, rather than shoring up Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Washington could have let them pay for their sins. The executives and traders at these firms would then have suffered far more than they did.
They almost certainly would have, but so would have the rest of the economy. Just consider the global chaos that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the only big firm left to die without federal help, and remember that many other banks were bigger than Lehman.
Another popular strategy -- rejected by the White House and Fed -- was nationalizing the banks. Yet some of the most thoughtful advocates of that approach concede that it doesn't look so good in retrospect. It could have led to a wave of bank failures and left taxpayers to pick up the bills. "We were wrong," Jeremy Stein, who saw the merits in nationalization as a White House official in 2009, later said, according to Mr. Geithner.
The administration instead forced banks to shore up their balance sheets, by raising private capital or accepting government loans. Within weeks of these programs going into place in the spring of 2009, the crisis began to recede. Critics predicted trillion-dollar bailout bills and zombie banks that would haunt the economy for years. Amazingly, the federal government's various rescue efforts, like the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, have made money.
More important, global trade and industrial production fell as sharply in 2008 and 2009 as they had in 1929 and 1930 -- yet this time they recovered far more quickly. And economic output in the United States has risen more since the crisis ended than it has in Europe. So it's a little hard to accept the case from the rescue's critics that their preferred policies would have all the same benefits as the government's actual policies, without the downsides.
Mr. Geithner, who spent 2008 at the New York Fed and nearly all of 2009 as Treasury secretary, and his colleagues are justifiably proud of their record. Listen carefully to their recitation of it, though, and you'll notice something: It relies mostly on economic statistics (like G.D.P. and industrial production) that only indirectly describe people's living standards. The picture isn't nearly as bright when you look at incomes or jobs.
Incomes in this country have fared worse over the last few years than in much of Europe. So has job growth. The share of American adults with jobs -- 58.9 percent -- has risen only marginally over the past five years. Yes, the rescue prevented the situation from being far worse, and, yes, many of the problems of the middle class and the poor predated the crisis.
Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's first chief of staff, famously said, "Never let a serious crisis go to waste" (a line Mr. Geithner quotes in the book). By that standard, the rescuers were not nearly so successful. To read the early histories of this crisis is to be struck by how little it seems to have reordered the economy.
The Great Depression created much of modern American government and reversed decades of rising inequality. Today, by contrast, incomes are rising at the top again, while still stagnant for most Americans. Wall Street is flourishing again.
Something about the American economy has changed in the last 15 years. The usual measures of economic health no longer translate into rising living standards as directly as they once did. The financial crisis offered an opportunity to change this dynamic. And Mr. Obama and his team left no doubt that they sought to do so, including through the 2010 financial regulation law that Mr. Geithner shaped.
But that law seems unlikely to transform Wall Street, and the debate over finance's huge role in today's economy will now fall to others. Should the banks be broken up, as some conservatives argue? Should the government tax wealth, as Thomas Piketty urges? Should banks face higher taxes, a step that has occasionally intrigued Mr. Geithner?
In his book, Mr. Geithner describes his feelings in the summer of 2009, as the success of the rescue programs was becoming clear: "But the primary goal of our financial engineering had always been to revive the broader economy, and times were still very tough on Main Street. We could see early signs of economic growth in the data, but people weren't feeling it on the ground."
Many still aren't, five years later. The response to the worst financial crisis in 70 years was more effective than its critics, and most Americans, believe. It was also less ambitious than its architects acknowledge.

Abstract: Because that's what the central bank did in the summer of 2008. In both cases, a financial catastrophe lurked just round the corner: the global financial crisis in 2008 and the deepening of the euro zone crisis in 2011, and the rate increases were reversed within months.

Full text:   Europe is staring into the face of the kind of deflationary cycle that has paralyzed the Japanese economy for the better part of two decades. Prices are rising far more slowly than its central bank wants, against a backdrop of astronomical unemployment on much of the Continent.
Mario Draghi's response: Give us another month.
Mr. Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, did everything he could on Thursday to hint, insinuate and flag the possibility that the central bank will unleash some new tools to combat Europe's drift toward lower prices. Just not now. Check back with us in June, he suggested. Really. Or at least probably.
The decision to wait, even as economic risks gather, highlights a pattern of behavior that has become common among central banks over the last few years -- behavior that the banks themselves often come to regret. When faced with evidence that economic growth is weak and inflation too low, bankers have acted slowly and cautiously, often citing the risks of using untested tools and offering projections that better times are just around the corner.
But the mistakes the central banks have made since the crisis ended in 2009 have overwhelmingly been the opposite: not of acting too rashly in response to economic weakness, but of moving too slowly and being overly confident that things will turn around without a monetary boost. This pattern of caution is one reason the economies in the United States and Europe remain so weak almost seven years after the financial crisis began.
"There is consensus about being dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation," Mr. Draghi said in a news conference in Brussels on Thursday. In the period from March 2013 to March 2014, prices rose 0.5 percent in the 18 countries using the euro. The central bank's goal for inflation is slightly under 2 percent. "There is a consensus in not being resigned to this and accepting this as a fact of nature. Which would lead to having consensus about action, but after having seen the staff projections that will come out in early June."
This low inflation is dangerous for Europe for a few reasons. It makes the large overhang of debts more onerous; repaying what they owe is harder for consumers, businesses and governments. It is intertwined with a rise in the value of the euro on currency markets, making European exporters less competitive on the global marketplace by increasing their costs relative to competitors in the United States or Asia. And it risks becoming self-fulfilling, as the Japanese know too well, as stagnant or falling prices lead people to hoard cash rather than spend freely.
The lowflation, as people have taken to calling it, is particularly dangerous in that it could easily turn into outright deflation, or falling prices, should one nasty shock come along. For example, if tension between Ukraine and Russia boils over into a full-scale war, it could easily tip the European economy back into recession and send prices tumbling.
Mr. Draghi gave every sign on Thursday that he agreed with the premise that the combination of low inflation and a strong euro was dangerous. He and his colleagues just want time and more data before doing anything about it.
A deliberative, cautious manner is, in general, desirable in a central banker. But what is dangerous about the E.C.B.'s sluggishness in the face of deflation risks is its asymmetry: The risks of too little action may be greater than the risks of too much.
Imagine the opposite case. Inflation has been moving higher for two years straight, reaching 3 or 4 percent. There are some signs of the economy slowing, but unemployment is low and growth rates basically healthy.
What would the bank do? It would raise interest rates pre-emptively, trying to nip those inflationary pressures in the bud.
How do we know that? Because that's what the central bank did in the summer of 2008. It's what it did again in the spring of 2011. In both cases, there was high inflation (4 percent in the year ended July 2008, a peak of 3 percent by the fall of 2011). In both cases, a financial catastrophe lurked just round the corner: the global financial crisis in 2008 and the deepening of the euro zone crisis in 2011, and the rate increases were reversed within months.
The bank has declined to show the same urgency when deflation and high joblessness are the risks instead.
Throughout the last seven years, central banks have moved with speed and creativity when there is an imminent financial crisis: Think Ben Bernanke in the fall of 2008 or Mario Draghi in the summer of 2012, when he pledged to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the Eurozone.
But when it has come to the slower-moving, grinding challenge of trying to get the major Western economies on track to avoid a lost decade (or, in the Japanese case, two), they have appeared much readier to let debates stew for months, even as the evidence becomes more and more persuasive that they are undershooting their inflation goals and growth is falling short.
This is surely due in part to the fact that the tools they have available are increasingly exotic. The European Central Banks's target interest rates are already scraping near zero, as they are in each of the biggest central banks, which means they are having to experiment with less tested tools.
If Mr. Draghi makes good on his strong suggestion that the bank will act in June, it may find itself joining the other major Western central banks with "quantitative easing," buying assets on the open market as a way to pump euros into the financial system even with interest rates near zero. It could also shift to a negative interest rate for its key bank deposit rate, the idea being to give banks greater incentive to lend money out rather than park it at the central bank.
The uncertainty around these types of policy tools is clearly feeding Mr. Draghi's go-slow approach. But it is also true that these things aren't as exotic as they once were. The Fed and the Bank of England have been doing quantitative easing for half a decade, the Bank of Japan for much longer. The Danish and Swedish central banks have dabbled in negative deposit rates.
No one expects the central banker in charge of one of the world's most important currencies to become an impulsive, impetuous radical. But with a clear and pressing economic danger staring Europe in the face, it may not be the worst thing to see Mr. Draghi loosen his tie and display the same urgency he would be likely to show if inflation were too high rather than too low.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Thursday sharply questioned Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, about the persistence of unemployment and the slow pace of the economic recovery during a hearing that highlighted the growing prominence of election-year considerations on Capitol Hill.
The hearing before the Senate Budget Committee flipped the standard script of congressional sessions in recent years with Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. Generally, Democrats are the ones who fret about unemployment and the weak economy, while Republicans question whether the Fed will lose control of inflation or destabilize financial markets.
With the midterm elections approaching, however, Democrats are increasingly eager to claim credit for the progress of the economic recovery, while Republicans are emphasizing that the recovery remains weak and incomplete.
Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee, was particularly critical of the Fed's performance, sharply questioning Ms. Yellen's statement that the labor market was showing signs of progress.
"We've got fewer people working today than there were in 2007 and the population has increased by 15 million," he said. "So how is this progress? Please tell me."
When Ms. Yellen responded that things were getting better, but were still not good, Mr. Sessions suggested the Fed should not overstate the improvement. "From the point of view of working Americans, this is the slowest, most anemic recovery that we've seen, ever," he said. "Whatever we're doing, we need to get better at it."
Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, asked Ms. Yellen what it would take for the Fed to extend its bond-buying campaign. The Fed is gradually reducing the volume of its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, now $45 billion, with the goal of ending the purchases sometime this fall.
"Whenever we meet," Ms. Yellen responded, "we ask ourselves the question, 'Do we continue to believe that the economy is on a path that will take us toward our objective of reaching full employment or maximum employment?' "
Other Republicans said that they doubted the Fed's ability to help.
"I worry that the Federal Reserve is trying to use its monetary policy hammer to solve a problem that's really not a monetary problem and at some risk of doing so," said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. Companies, he said, would not invest "no matter how low interest rates go" because they were frozen by uncertainty about the economic outlook.
Mr. Portman suggested the Fed could help by ending its stimulus campaign because it had become a crucial source of the uncertainty.
Ms. Yellen did not stray from her script in answering the attacks.
"Monetary policy is not a panacea," she said, invoking a favorite line. But "I think maintaining a policy of low interest rates has been helpful in a number of ways."
Democrats were more supportive. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the committee chairwoman, opened the hearing by thanking Ms. Yellen and the Fed.
"Our economy is much stronger than it was five years ago when the Great Recession hit," she said. "More workers are getting back on the job, and the unemployment rate has declined to 6.3 percent -- the lowest level since September 2008."
Ms. Yellen also faced a significant number of questions about fiscal policy, and she echoed Mr. Bernanke in chiding Congress for its failure to address the federal government's long-term fiscal challenges.
"We can see that going out 20, 30, 50 years without some further shifts in fiscal policy, it's projected that the ratio of debt to G.D.P. will rise to unsustainable levels," Ms. Yellen told the committee, referring to the country's gross domestic product. "I would join my predecessor in saying that I do think it's important that Congress address that issue."
Ms. Yellen also commented on proposals to raise the minimum wage. She said such a change would benefit workers whose pay increased, but was also "likely to have some negative effect on jobs," an assessment that is shared by many economists. "It's a question mark exactly how large that impact is," she said.
In response to questions, Ms. Yellen said that she was in favor of adding someone with community banking experience to the Fed's board. She said she had shared her view with the White House, which is considering several such candidates for a pair of openings on the seven-member board.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told Congress on Wednesday that the economy was growing at a decent rate and that the Fed intended to continue the stimulus campaign that it considered at least partly responsible.
Central bankers are paid to worry, and Ms. Yellen also delivered a laundry list of things that could go wrong: The housing recovery has stalled, geopolitical tensions are rising, some asset prices are perhaps a little too high.
But the overall tenor of her testimony was upbeat. The economy, she said, is shaking off a grim winter. The labor market is slowly improving.
"With the harsh winter behind us, many recent indicators suggest that a rebound in spending and production is already underway, putting the overall economy on track for solid growth in the current quarter," Ms. Yellen told the Joint Economic Committee. She will testify before the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday.
The Fed is steadily cutting its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, now at $45 billion a month, and Ms. Yellen affirmed that it planned to end those purchases in the fall. The bank must then decide when to start raising short-term interest rates, which it has held near zero since December 2008.
But Ms. Yellen, who suggested at a March news conference that the Fed might start raising rates about six months after it ended bond purchases, carefully avoided affirming those comments on Wednesday. Investors generally expect the Fed to start raising rates around the middle of 2015. Ms. Yellen said only that the timing would be determined by the progress of the economic recovery.
And she made clear that even after the Fed began raising borrowing costs, the central bank did not plan to return interest rates to normal levels, which she defined as around 4 percent, until it was sure the recovery was complete.
The hearing reflected the complexity of partisan divisions over the economy. Democrats generally praised the progress of the recovery while pressing for new actions to address unemployment and inequality. Republicans, conversely, highlighted the weakness of recent growth while pressing for the Fed to curtail its efforts and questioning whether the Fed was flirting with inflation.
Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the committee, said the Fed's enormous stimulus campaign could lead to higher inflation, particularly if the central bank did not pull back quickly as the economy recovered.
He pressed Ms. Yellen repeatedly to set a timetable for raising interest rates.
"When do you expect that to begin?" he asked.
Ms. Yellen responded that the Fed would choose its moment based on the progress of the labor market and the movement of inflation.
Mr. Brady decided to try a new approach. "If I were to say you'll begin normalizing interest rates in 2015," he asked, "would I be wrong?"
The Fed has "no mechanical formula or timetable," Ms. Yellen said.
Mr. Brady: "If I were to say this will begin normalizing in 2016, would I be wrong?"
Ms. Yellen: "There is no specific timeline for doing that."
Mr. Brady tried one more line of questioning, asking when rates would reach 2 percent -- about half the historically normal level -- then closed with a parting shot. "It strikes me, over time, this 'don't worry be happy' monetary message isn't working," he said. "I believe we need more specifics and a clear timetable on the comprehensive exit strategy."
The exchange typified the caution that Ms. Yellen has demonstrated in her first few appearances before Congress. Where her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, sometimes sought to educate his interlocutors, and the broader audience attending to the hearings, Ms. Yellen mostly has tried to avoid surprises.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, labeled Ms. Yellen, who grew up in Bay Ridge, a "Brooklyn Dodger" in a note emailed to clients after the hearing. "Yellen successfully dodged any attempts to attach more specific guidance on the timing of the first rate hike," he wrote. "She did not say anything that sent a novel signal about the Fed's reading of the economy or the outlook for policy."
Ms. Yellen, in a similar exchange with Representative Richard Hanna, a New York Republican, strongly defended the Fed's commitment to control inflation. She said the high inflation of the 1970s had been a formative experience for the entirety of the Fed's leadership, and they were determined to keep inflation below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed has described as its target.
"I do believe that we have the tools and absolutely the will and the determination to remove monetary accommodation at an appropriate time to avoid overshooting our inflation objective," Ms. Yellen said. "The lessons from that period are very real for all of us and none of us want to make that mistake again."
Inflation, however, is not the Fed's primary worry. Prices rose just 1.1 percent over the 12 months ending in March, and Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed was focused on the labor market. While the unemployment rate has declined, she noted that other measures continued to reflect that many people could not find full-time work.
The government estimated last week that the economy grew at an annual pace of just 0.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014, and some economists expect the government will eventually conclude that the economy actually shrank.
Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that growth had "paused" during the winter months, but she said the Fed already saw evidence that activity was rebounding as the weather turned warmer. "Recent data is certainly much more encouraging on a wide range of fronts from car sales, retail sales, industrial production," she said.
She added a new note of caution, however, saying the housing recovery had stalled. "The recent flattening out in housing activity could prove more protracted than currently expected rather than resuming its earlier pace of recovery," she said.
Ms. Yellen also devoted a considerable section of her prepared remarks to the risk that the Fed's stimulus campaign would destabilize financial markets. She said that the Fed was watching closely for signs of excessive speculation, and that "some reach-for-yield behavior may be evident." But she said such signs were limited to small pockets of the markets, and the Fed did not see broad reasons for concern.

Full text:   For most travelers, flying in style may be a thing of the past, but airlines are determined to bring back some glamour to air travel, at least for those sitting in the front of the plane.
Flat beds and fluffy pillows, fancy wines and four-course meals, designer-brand pajamas and luxurious vanity kits -- these options have become the staple of business-class travel these days.
And after a couple of sluggish years, business travel spending in the United States is forecast to grow by 7.1 percent to $293 billion in 2014, according the Global Business Travel Association. Spending on international travel is expected to increase almost twice as fast, at 13 percent, to reach $37 billion.
With this pickup in corporate travel, airlines are taking extra steps to offer ever more personal services and benefits to compete for high-value business passengers, even as they squeeze more travelers in the back.
"Corporate passengers are definitely being fought over by all the airlines," said Claudia Sender, the chief executive of TAM Airlines, the Brazilian carrier. "They have never been so important because of their willingness to pay more."
Airlines have always treated their business-class passengers a little better than the rest. But in today's era of mass travel, the extra attention to the front of the cabin has increased disparities in the air as never before.
"The gap between what's going on at the front of the plane and in the back has never been wider," said Tim Winship, publisher of the FrequentFlyer.com website. He added: "If you're one of the lucky few who flies first or business class these days -- it's as good as it's ever been. It's all about profitability. Given the disproportionate contribution from high-yield customers, it would be financially irrational for the airlines not to take this into consideration." Airlines typically charge six to eight times as much for business class as for coach on long-haul, international flights, and two to three times as much for first class as for business class. For a passenger booking a month in advance, Cathay Pacific, for instance, can charge $900 for a round-trip economy ticket from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, $6,400 in business class, and nearly $16,000 in first class.
(The difference in prices on domestic flights is not as wide as on international flights, meaning coach passengers contribute a far higher share to the flight's total revenues.)
Corporate accounts get discounts in exchange for a commitment to buy business-class seats, and airlines will often throw in a few first-class seats as incentives to sweeten the deal.
About a third of the passengers on a plane, generally those flying in the premium cabins or paying full fare for economy tickets, account for roughly two-thirds of an airline's revenue.
So it's no surprise that airlines are redoubling efforts to please these corporate passengers even at a time when business travelers are trying to stretch their travel budgets.
They get speedier service at the airport, their bags come out of the carousel first, they can use faster security lanes and their check-in counters are less crowded. They are also the first to board and get off the plane. Some airlines have dedicated terminals for first-class passengers and provide limousine transfers on the tarmac between flights.
Delta Air Lines, for instance, picks up some of its connecting elite passengers in New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Minneapolis and takes them to their next flight in a Porsche Cayenne. United Airlines offers a similar service at Chicago O'Hare, Newark Liberty, San Francisco International and George Bush Intercontinental in Houston, with a Mercedes GL-Class, and plans to expand it to Los Angeles International in May and Washington Dulles and Denver International later this year.
"We know, because our business customers tell us, that what matters most to our passengers are speed and efficiency, and that's what we try to provide," said Mike Henny, Delta's director of customer experience. "We try to think about the entire journey."
Inside the plane, the most visible sign of this attention is the latest generation of business-class seats. The standard today are comfortable seats that can be turned into flat beds, not angled ones, where passengers complain of sliding down as they sleep. Many airlines now favor seats that have direct-aisle access for passengers, meaning travelers do not have to climb over a sleeping neighbor if they want to get out of their seats in the middle of the night.
Air France is the latest of the big global carriers to realize that these features have become indispensable in the battle for corporate accounts. The airline recently announced that as part of a $500 million investment to upgrade its cabins, it will install new flatbed seats in business class. Each costs at least $68,000, and Air France will begin fitting them in June on its fleet of Boeing 777s.
The investments, says Alexandre de Juniac, the airline's chairman and chief executive, have become necessary for Air France to compete against Asian and Middle Eastern carriers that long-ago started lavishing the most luxurious amenities on their business-class and first-class customers.
"Our only weapons, since we can't lower our costs to the same level as theirs, is to fight back with our own quality services," said Mr. de Juniac.
Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier, has two showers inside its flagship fleet of Airbus A380s for its first-class cabin. Korean Airlines has a spacious bar and lounge for its first-class passengers on its own A380s. Even egalitarian JetBlue Airways is getting in on the act. The low-cost airline is introducing new first-class and business-class seats on its Airbus A321 jets operating transcontinental routes starting this year.
Delta last month announced it had just finished installing full flatbed seats with direct-aisle access in its business-class cabin across its entire international wide-body fleet, which includes its Airbus A330s and Boeing 767s, 747s and 777s.
Airline executives say these expensive amenities are worth the cost because of the much higher fares they can charge for business class.
And airlines have realized that offering a real opportunity for a good night's sleep while aboard has become a competitive tool, particularly with the advent of new jets that can fly longer distances without stopping for fuel. These include the Boeing 777, which has become a flagship aircraft for the world's longest routes, and the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which can provide nonstop flights between the East Coast of the United States and Japan, or between Europe and Australia.
Given the limited real estate in an airline cabin, the downside of these seats is that they take up more space.
"For the business class to be profitable you need to be able to generate significant fare premiums to justify the extra real estate," said Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways and Spain's Iberia. "It's an interesting balancing act."
This has forced seat makers to come up with innovative designs to increase seat density in business class without sacrificing comfort.
Tomorrow's business seat will most likely offer movie suggestions based on passengers' preferences stored in their mobile devices. Seat headrests will come with a surround-sound system to provide an immersive experience. And television screens will be even bigger, rivaling what many people have at home.
Airline seats are borrowing tricks from the hotel industry, too, which has long focused on improving a guest's sleep experience. Japan Airlines, for example, is offering a selection of different pillows similar to what's found in many high-end hotels. It is also working with a mattress company to develop extra padding for its seats to make the beds more comfortable.
But competing with seats alone can be a tricky business. The best seat on the market can only be unrivaled for a short while before another airline comes up with a new product, fueling an expensive arms race. And since seats remain on a plane for about seven years, investments can quickly become outmoded.
"It's a catch-up game," said Ms. Sender, TAM's chief executive. "You can have the best seat ever for two years. But guess what? Someone else will come up with a better seat."
Airlines may have started to reach the limits to innovations with seats and cabin space, said Raymond Kollau, the founder of Airlinetrends.com, which looks at the latest industry developments in product and service. So airlines are increasingly turning their attention to customer service to complement investments in hardware.
"There's not a lot more you can do once you've provided a fully flat bed," Mr. Kollau said. "After that, it all comes down to customer service."
Since the whole point of providing flatbeds is better and longer sleep, airlines are rethinking their approach to in-flight service, particularly during night flights, to allow passengers more uninterrupted time to sleep.
"It's about attention to the tiniest details," Mr. Kollau said. "It becomes less about the single product and more about the entire package."
Virgin Atlantic, for instance, which flies between London and the United States, offers business passengers the option to have their dinner in the terminal before boarding. Those who pick that option are then assigned seats in the "snooze," or quiet section of the cabin, where flight attendants will not bother them.
SAS, the Scandinavian carrier, hands out a takeout breakfast bag upon arrival for passengers who wish to sleep right up to landing. That option is soon coming to British Airways, too.
Lufthansa has installed humidifiers in the first-class cabin of its newer Airbus A380s, which increase the relative humidity of the cabin to around 25 percent; it ranges from 5 to 10 percent in the rest of the plane. The technology promises to "improve sleep, reduce jet lag and tiredness and alleviate dehydration of the eyes, skin and linings of the mouth and nose," according to CTT Systems, the Swedish manufacturer.
Etihad Airways, based in the United Arab Emirates, recently outlined a sleep initiative that it described as a result of a two-year partnership with sleep experts from the American Center for Psychiatry and Neurology, an Abu Dhabi-based clinical center.
Passengers in coach get noise-canceling headphones, as well as beverages conducive to sleep, like hot chocolate and herbal teas. First-class passengers get "sleep-inducing camomile tea," the airline says, as well as luxury sleep suits.
To make sure travelers remain loyal, airlines are also going the extra mile on the ground as well as in-flight.
In Frankfurt, Lufthansa has an entire terminal dedicated just to first-class passengers that offers an array of services, including fine dining and baths. Passengers facing a long connection time can rent a Porsche 911 for 99 euros -- about $137 -- for three hours to cruise German highways.
At its Paris hub at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Air France offers a similar high-end experience. Its first-class lounge delivers red-carpet treatment from the airport's main gate all the way to the plane. It includes a spa and massage service, and food prepared by Alain Ducasse.
First-class passengers do not have to stand in line to get their passport stamped. An immigration official will come to the lounge to do so. Passengers are then taken to their flight by car -- German luxury models initially used were recently replaced with French cars.
Even when they do not get their own terminals, perks in the United States are still good for elite passengers. At Delta's new Terminal 4 in New York's Kennedy International Airport, the airline has built a viewing deck inside the business-class lounge for the exclusive enjoyment of a select few. All this preferential treatment has changed air travel. Critics say the airlines are increasingly mirroring some of the worst inequalities found elsewhere.
"The difference between the worst and the first has never been wider," said Charlie Leocha, who leads the Consumer Travel Alliance in Washington and is a frequent industry critic. "Passengers in the front of the plane travel in a totally different system."
Delta, for instance, recently announced it would change in 2015 the way passengers are awarded frequent-flier miles by moving to a system that takes into account how much they spend, dropping the previous standard of how far they fly.
Passengers going round trip from New York to Los Angeles in coach now get 4,930 award miles, whether they paid $500 or $1,000 for their ticket. Under the new SkyMiles program, the lower fare will get 2,500 award miles while the higher fare will net 5,000 miles. (Business passengers usually spend more and so are likely to benefit from this approach.)
And while the front of the plane has been significantly upgraded, the traditional economy class has become more cramped as coach passengers pay the price to make more room for premium passengers. The average seat pitch -- the industry standard for the space between two seats, currently about 31 inches -- has been reduced by about 10 percent over the last decade. Airlines are also using slimmer economy seats that allow them to add more rows and passengers on their planes.
Some are also trying to increase the number of seats they can fit into each row. For instance, American Airlines has introduced a new seating plan for some of its refurbished Boeing 777s that fits 10 passengers abreast, instead of nine. The move to more seats has been brisk. In 2010, fewer than 15 percent of the 777s Boeing manufactured had 10 seats abreast. Today, nearly two-thirds of them do, says Mr. Kollau.
"Coach is pretty much the seat and the seatbelt these days," said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst in San Francisco and founder of Atmosphere Research Group.
Airlines argue that ticket prices remain historically low, once they are adjusted for inflation, and that passengers for that reason are generally better off today than when the industry was deregulated.
But some executives see risk in that strategy. Economy passengers, they warn, may not be willing to accept increasingly bad traveling conditions. It might also hurt the brand with premium passengers, since business travelers also often fly coach.
"I don't think you can offset the profitability of business class by squeezing more people into economy," Mr. Walsh of British Airways and Iberia said. "Passengers will simply not tolerate it. They will go elsewhere."
There are one or two areas, however, where a sort of trickle-down theory of flying may be at work, to the benefit of the traveling masses.
As today's business class is comparable to what first-class travel used to be 20 years ago, a new class of service on some long-haul carriers, known as premium economy, is offering many of the amenities once found only in business class.
And over the last decade, airlines have vastly improved their in-flight entertainment systems. Individual television screens, first introduced in first class and business class, have become pretty much standard on long-haul flights in economy as well. Passengers have also come to expect them.
Cathay Pacific provides on-demand audio and video and its economy seats each have nine-inch personal screens. Passengers can connect their electronic devices and stream their own movies. Each seat also has a USB port, and 110-volt power sources are widely available on board.
Airline executives are now turning to improving connectivity on board. Many airlines provide Wi-Fi on domestic flights, and the industry is rapidly moving to over-the-water connections for international flights, using satellite transmissions instead of ground networks.
The speed of technology improvements has been rapid in this area. When Gogo began offering in-flight Internet service five years ago, the peak speed available on the company's air-to-ground network was 3.1 megabits per second. Last year, it installed new service that took the speed to 9.8 megabits a second.
At the recent Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany, Gogo presented its latest offering, known as a ground-to-orbit system, that will increase the top speeds to 70 megabits per second. The system will be installed first by Japan Airlines for trials and should be available starting next year, according to Gogo.
"People are now expecting to remain connected in flight," said Mr. Walsh. "That's a little surprising since many people used to view flights as the only time to disconnect."

Full text:   With relatively little fanfare, the stock market has become expensive again.
While the rest of economy has been growing frustratingly slowly for almost five years, stocks have been rising at a boomlike clip. An investment in the Standard & Poor 500-stock index would have doubled from early 2009 through early 2013 and then gained an additional 18 percent over the last year.
Relative to long-term corporate earnings -- and more in a minute on why that measure is important -- stocks have been more expensive only three times over the past century than they are today, according to data from Robert Shiller, a Nobel laureate in economics. Those other three periods are not exactly reassuring, either: the 1920s, the late 1990s and in the prelude to the 2007 financial crisis.
Wall Street, of course, can always come up with justifications for high stock prices. Remember: The Internet changes everything. Or: The business cycle has been repealed. Some of the current justifications even have a ring of reality to them.
Today's economy seems almost perfectly built to raise stock prices. Economic growth is weak enough to keep interest rates low, which both reduces corporate costs and makes stocks seem more appealing than safe, low-return investments. And despite the mediocre economy, corporate profits are fairly strong, because companies have the upper hand on workers today and wage growth is modest. Inequality, in other words, tends to be good for stocks.
It's possible that a world of rising inequality and low interest rates is here to stay -- and that stocks have reached a permanently high plateau. In that case, whatever our other economic worries, the stock market's valuation doesn't need to be high among them.
Yet any argument that depends on the notion of a new paradigm is one you should treat with a healthy amount of skepticism. Those arguments are usually wrong. They were wrong in the 1920s, when the economist Irving Fisher coined the phrase "permanently high plateau" to describe stocks. They were wrong in 1999, when the book "Dow 36,000" appeared. They were wrong in 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis.
"You can always think of reasons of why now is different," Mr. Shiller told me, when I called him recently to ask his view of today's stock prices. "But maybe the mind is too creative in thinking of how it's different." As John Campbell, a Harvard economist who has collaborated with Mr. Shiller, puts it, "One should be skeptical of 'This time is different' arguments."
We obviously can't know which way stock prices are headed. But the evidence, as I read it, suggests that stock prices are now high. The best assumption -- for retirees, future retirees, other investors, pension-plan managers, federal budget analysts and anyone else whose life depends on stock prices -- is that returns in coming years will be modest at best.
If the historical comparisons here surprise you, it may be because you are used to a different yardstick for the market's valuation. The most commonly cited measure is a price-earnings ratio that compares the current price of stocks to the earnings of the underlying companies over the past year.
The problem with this measure (which also shows that stocks are expensive, but less severely) is that a year isn't a very long time. Judging a company's long-term future based on the last 12 months puts too much weight on fleeting factors, like the current state of the economy or a company's latest product.
That's why the classic 1934 textbook "Security Analysis" -- by Benjamin Graham, a mentor to Warren Buffett, and David Dodd -- urged investors to compare stock prices to earnings over "not less than five years, preferably seven or ten years." Ten years is enough time for the economy to go in and out of recession. It's enough time for faddish theories about new paradigms to come and go.
Mr. Shiller picked up the Graham-Dodd thread and has long published on his web site a version of the price-earnings ratio that compares current stock prices to average annual earnings over the last decade. He shared the Nobel Prize in economics last year for "empirical analysis of asset prices."
The 10-year price/earnings ratio has as good a record of any stock-market measure in warning about excess. More broadly, when the ratio reaches 25, roughly where it is now, disappointment tends to follow. The average inflation-adjusted return since 1871 (the first year for which Mr. Shiller has data) in the five years after the ratio equals 25 or higher is negative 12 percent. After stocks get expensive, a correction typically follows.
I'm not predicting that the market is going to fall 12 percent or 50 percent. (And if I did, you should stop reading this column.) As Mr. Shiller says, "There is no way to predict the future."
Sometimes, the economy really can change in important ways. Maybe stock prices will be somewhat higher in the 21st century than in the 20th. Mr. Campbell, for example, notes a couple of plausible explanations for higher stock prices: the lack of recent world wars, for example, and the spread of stock ownership to a larger group of investors, which distributes risk more broadly.
But none of these changes are likely to rewrite the rules of economics in a fundamental way. Based on history, stocks look either very expensive or somewhat expensive right now. Mr. Shiller suggests that the most likely outcome may be worse returns in coming years than the market has delivered over recent decades -- but still better than the returns of any other investment class.
So don't be tempted (or terrified) by the siren song of a rising market. For most people, the sensible path is still to find a low-cost way to save for retirement, typically through diversified index funds. And given where the market now is, you should err on the side of conservatism.
The fact that the last three decades have witnessed one bull market after another shouldn't fool you into thinking that the next three decades will.

Full text:   The single best gauge of the economic recovery -- better than the headline unemployment rate -- may be wage growth.
So ignore April's sharp drop in unemployment. Pay no attention to the creation of 288,000 jobs announced on Friday. The most important number in the latest jobs report did not change at all.
Average hourly wages for American workers held steady at $24.31 last month. They have increased just 1.9 percent over the previous 12 months. But after adjusting for inflation, real wages have increased by something like 0.5 percent.
David G. Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, and Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argue in a new paper that the slow pace of wage growth is the best indicator of an incomplete economic recovery. Until wages start rising more quickly, the economy remains far from healthy.
The two men also argue that the Federal Reserve should focus on wage growth in calibrating its stimulus campaign because wage growth effectively summarizes other measures like unemployment and participation.
Mr. Blanchflower found affirmation for this theory in Friday's jobs report. In the traditional view, the decline of the official unemployment rate should have indicated that the labor market was closer to good health, and it should have put upward pressure on wages. But the unemployment rate fell entirely because people stopped looking for work, not because they found jobs. And wages did not rise by even a penny.
"What happened today is entirely consistent with what we said would happen," Mr. Blanchflower said in an interview by telephone on Friday morning. "Hourly wages were up two pennies last month, and this month they're flat, and that tells you there's too much slack in the labor market. And all the other stuff is just noise."
Their paper is the latest contribution to a raging debate about labor market slack, a concept that is easy to explain, hard to quantify and very important right now.
When only 48 percent of American adults held full-time jobs in April, the important question is what share of the rest were prevented by the weak economy from finding full-time work. Put differently, how much of the damage caused by the Great Recession can still be fixed by the Fed, or by fiscal policies that broadly promote economic growth?
The unemployment rate, which counts people actively seeking work, overstates labor market slack during good times, because some people are always between jobs. Even during the halcyon 1990s, the rate bottomed out around 4 percent.
Since the recession, however, the unemployment rate has understated slack, because millions of Americans have stopped looking for jobs that do not exist. As the economy improves, it is likely that some of those people will rejoin the hunt.
Policy makers including Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, say the unemployment rate remains the best gauge of the labor market. But they acknowledge it has lost some of its value.
In March the Fed said it would consider other measures, including wage inflation, in charting its campaign. Ms. Yellen suggested she would like to see wages rising at a "normal" pace of about 3 or 4 percent a year.
Mr. Blanchflower and Mr. Posen see an easier answer. Instead of counting heads, policy makers can simply rely on market forces to do the work. Wage inflation, after all, is basically a summary of the balance between supply and demand. Employers raise wages as they find it harder to hire and retain qualified workers, so the market, in effect, is constantly judging the extent of labor market slack.
"Unlike unemployment, the rate of wage inflation requires less judgment and is subject to less distortion by such factors as inactivity," the paper says. "Unemployment, underemployment of part-timers, long-term unemployment and participation rate reveal their nonstructural component by their influence on wage growth. And that is what the Fed should be trying to stabilize along with prices."
The main objection to this view is not about the accuracy of wage inflation, but about its timeliness. Wages generally are among the last prices to rise during an economic expansion. Prices, in particular, generally rise before wages.
To keep price inflation under control, Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, warns that the Fed needs to begin raising interest rates well before wage inflation takes hold. Indeed, he contends the time has already come.
"If you want to hit inflation on the head, you need a Fed Funds rate that is above 4 percent, say 4.25 percent to create any pressure, and it will take you considerable time to get from zero to 4, and in the meantime you could see very substantial inflation," Mr. Slok said. "You could say that this is too early and we don't know quite yet, but I'm saying that if we run a risk, we run a risk of being behind the curve."
While Friday's report showed no sign of wage pressures, Mr. Slok said that some alternative measures of wages had started to show an upward trend. "About a year ago or six months ago, there was no sign of wage pressure, but when you look at the data today, some of the measures are starting to point upwards," he said. "If it really is the case that there is so much slack, why are any of these indicators going up?"
But the greater concern about inflation, at the moment, is that prices are rising too slowly. The Fed's favorite inflation index rose just 1.1 percent in the 12 months that ended March 31, the government said on Thursday. That is well below the 2 percent pace the Fed considers healthy.
Mr. Blanchflower and Mr. Posen have experience as central bankers -- they served separately in recent years on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee -- and they argue that the greater risk is in failing to do enough about unemployment, in part because that is also the best way to raise inflation back to a healthier pace.
"Pulling back too soon is worse than pulling back too late," Mr. Blanchflower said. "And we won't know what full employment is until we begin to approach it."

Full text:   MEXICO CITY -- Panamanians, enjoying one of the fastest-growing economies in the hemisphere but wary of corruption and growing executive power, rejected the governing party's choice for president on Sunday -- on a ticket with the president's wife for vice president -- and instead hewed to tradition by electing an opposition candidate.
Panama's election commission declared the president-elect to be Juan Carlos Varela, who is vice president but broke with the governing party in a rancorous falling-out and was stripped of many of his duties. He captured 39 percent of the vote, with more than three-quarters of the ballots counted.
Mr. Varela, 50, an engineer and well-known politician whose family owns the country's biggest liquor producer, was seven points ahead of the 32 percent won by the governing party candidate, José Domingo Arias, a former housing minister and a political newcomer. A third major candidate, Juan Carlos Navarro, a former two-time mayor of Panama City, had 28 percent.
Mr. Varela, who takes office on July 1 for a five-year term, campaigned against growing fears of corruption and the president's iron fist-style of leadership. He promised a more transparent government that would maintain growth and popular social programs and fight inequality.
"Today democracy won, today Panama won," Mr. Varela told supporters at a Panama City hotel, later adding, "We will not tolerate corruption in any way."
Mr. Varela's victory was a rebuke to President Ricardo Martinelli, who oversaw years of rapid growth and defied electoral law by campaigning openly for Mr. Arias on a ticket that included his wife, Marta Linares de Martinelli, as the vice-presidential candidate. Opponents seized on the move as a thinly veiled attempt to hold on to and concentrate power.
It seemed Mr. Martinelli's Democratic Change party had much to give it a sharp advantage: A newly opened subway line in Panama City, the first in Central America, and plans for an expansion. A new, if controversial, highway bypassing the city's old quarter. A skyscraper forest in the capital reflecting the cash pouring in from corporations and wealthy immigrants. And a strong economy, with a $5.2 billion expansion of the Panama Canal that could accelerate it more.
But while Mr. Martinelli had approval ratings around 60 percent, the final round of polls showed Mr. Arias in a close race, with Mr. Varela in third place.
Voters formed long lines all day on Sunday, and there were few irregularities, said Jennifer L. McCoy, Americas director of the Carter Center, who observed the balloting. In one last-minute dirty trick she cited, fake editions of a major newspaper claimed that two candidates had withdrawn.
It was typical of the mudslinging in what political analysts had once expected would be the closest of the four presidential contests there since the United States invasion in 1989 toppled Manuel Noriega's dictatorship. The Panama America newspaper reported that even Mr. Noriega had voted in the Panamanian prison where he is serving time for crimes during his reign.
Mr. Martinelli, 62, a supermarket magnate who shook up the political establishment five years ago as an outsider with a commanding win, could not seek another term. The choice of Mr. Arias, 50, led opponents to doubt that Mr. Martinelli would give up power if his party won.
Mr. Arias had sought to ride Mr. Martinelli's popularity with promises to continue big public works and social programs, but he lacked the president's flair for the dramatic and the blunt talk that endeared supporters and turned off opponents.
His wife's presence on the ticket also had been questioned, as Panamanian law prohibits the sitting president's blood relatives from seeking the country's top two offices. It is unclear if the prohibition also applies to spouses.
"Her nomination," said Orlando J. Pérez, a political scientist at Central Michigan University who studies Panamanian politics, "evidences a desire by Martinelli to remain powerful after the elections." .
Mr. Pérez, who was in Panama City for the election, said her candidacy could backfire, as Panamanian voters tend to fret over concentrations of power. The opposition has run strongly despite improvements in the country, including social programs aimed at helping older people, the poor and schoolchildren, because "the historic tendency in Panama is to vote for the opposition," he said.
"Every one of the previous four presidential elections since 1990 has been won by the opposition," Mr. Pérez said. Of Mr. Varela's victory, he said, "this represents 'Martinellismo' without Martinelli -- support for government programs while punishing Martinelli."
Analysts said signs that the economy's surge is slowing -- it grew 8.4 percent last year after consecutive years of double-digit expansion -- could have worried voters, who also are paying more for goods as inflation rises. Panama has wide income inequality, with more than a quarter of its four million people living in poverty. Crime remains a serious problem. Infrastructure problems, including traffic congestion, chronic urban flooding and power shortages, could also have worked against Mr. Arias.
Mr. Arias's opponents had thrown sharp elbows -- mainly at Mr. Martinelli.
Ruben Blades, the Panamanian salsa star and actor who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1994, posted a statement on his website declining to endorse any candidate but warning that electing Mr. Arias would constitute a re-election of Mr. Martinelli. He called that a "dangerous risk for Panamanian democracy."
Mr. Varela had accused Mr. Martinelli and his sons of taking kickbacks in exchange for government contracts. Italian prosecutors are investigating whether the Italian defense firm Finmeccanica paid bribes to foreign governments, including Panama's, but no Panamanian officials have been charged. Mr. Varela's supporters suggested Mr. Martinelli put his wife up to running in part to ensure an Arias cabinet would not pursue any case against him.
Mr. Arias, in turn, accused Mr. Varela of being close to drug traffickers, a provocative charge in a country where Mr. Noriega was deposed to face charges in the United States of drug trafficking and money laundering. On Saturday, Mr. Varela found himself denying rumors that his American visa had been suspended, with a statement by the American Embassy backing him up.

Full text:   THE conventional wisdom these days is that kids come by everything too easily -- stickers, praise, A's, trophies. It's outrageous, we're told, that all kids on the field may get a thanks-for-playing token, in contrast to the good old days, when recognition was reserved for the conquering heroes.
Children are said to be indulged and overcelebrated, spared from having to confront the full impact of their inadequacy. There are ringing declarations about the benefits of frustration and the need for grit.
These themes are sounded with numbing regularity, yet those who sound them often adopt a self-congratulatory tone, as if it took extraordinary gumption to say pretty much what everyone else is saying. Indeed, this fundamentally conservative stance on children and parenting has become common even for people who are liberal on other issues.
But seriously, has any child who received a trinket after losing a contest walked away believing that he (or his team) won -- or that achievement doesn't matter? Giving trophies to all the kids is a well-meaning and mostly innocuous attempt to appreciate everyone's effort.
Even so, I'm not really making a case for doing so, since it distracts us from rethinking competition itself and the belief that people can succeed only if others fail.
Rather, my intent is to probe the underlying cluster of mostly undefended beliefs about what life is like (awful), what teaches resilience (experiences with failure), what motivates people to excel (rewards) and what produces excellence (competition).
Most of all, it's assumed that the best way to get children ready for the miserable "real world" that awaits them is to make sure they have plenty of miserable experiences while they're young. Conversely, if they're spared any unhappiness, they'll be ill-prepared.
This is precisely the logic employed not so long ago to frame bullying as a rite of passage that kids were expected to deal with on their own, without assistance from "overprotective" adults.
In any case, no one ever explains the mechanism by which the silence of a long drive home without a trophy is supposed to teach resilience. Nor are we told whether there's any support for this theory of inoculation by immersion. Have social scientists shown that those who are spared, say, the rigors of dodge ball (which turns children into human targets) or class rank (which pits students against one another) will wind up unprepared for adulthood?
Not that I can find. In fact, studies of those who attended the sort of nontraditional schools that afford an unusual amount of autonomy and nurturing suggest that the great majority seemed capable of navigating the transition to traditional colleges and workplaces.
But when you point out the absence of logic or evidence, it soon becomes clear that trophy rage is less about prediction -- what will happen to kids later -- than ideology: -- how they ought to be treated now. Fury over the possibility that kids will get off too easy or feel too good about themselves seems to rest on three underlying values.
The first is deprivation: Kids shouldn't be spared struggle and sacrifice, regardless of the effects. The second value is scarcity: the belief that excellence, by definition, is something that not everyone can attain. No matter how well a group of students performs, only a few should get A's. Otherwise we're sanctioning "grade inflation" and mediocrity. To have high standards, there must always be losers.
But it's the third conviction that really ties everything together: an endorsement of conditionality. Children ought never to receive something desirable -- a sum of money, a trophy, a commendation -- unless they've done enough to merit it. They shouldn't even be allowed to feel good about themselves without being able to point to tangible accomplishments. In this view, we have a moral obligation to reward the deserving and, equally important, make sure the undeserving go conspicuously unrewarded. Hence the anger over participation trophies. The losers mustn't receive something that even looks like a reward.
A commitment to conditionality lives at the intersection of economics and theology. It's where lectures about the law of the marketplace meet sermons about what we must do to earn our way into heaven. Here, almost every human interaction, even among family members, is regarded as a kind of transaction.
Interestingly, no research that I know of has ever shown that unconditionality is harmful in terms of future achievement, psychological health or anything else. In fact, studies generally show exactly the opposite. One of the most destructive ways to raise a child is with "conditional regard."
Over the last decade or so, two Israeli researchers, Avi Assor and Guy Roth, and their colleagues in the United States and Belgium, have conducted a series of experiments whose consistent finding is that when children feel their parents' affection varies depending on the extent to which they are well behaved, self-controlled or impressive at school or sports, this promotes "the development of a fragile, contingent and unstable sense of self."
Other researchers, meanwhile, have shown that high self-esteem is beneficial, but that even more desirable is unconditional self-esteem: a solid core of belief in yourself, an abiding sense that you're competent and worthwhile -- even when you screw up or fall short. In other words, the very unconditionality that seems to fuel attacks on participation trophies and the whole "self-esteem movement" turns out to be a defining feature of psychological health. It's precisely what we should be helping our children to acquire.

Full text:   After a frustrating series of false starts since the economic recovery began five years ago, American businesses appear to be increasingly confident about hiring new workers.
In the best monthly showing in more than two years, employers added 288,000 jobs in April, the Labor Department said on Friday, representing three consecutive months in which payrolls grew by more than 200,000. The report, combined with other recent data, suggests the economy is poised to expand at a faster pace in the coming months, after a slow start in the depths of winter.
Despite the big jump in payrolls, wages did not grow at all in April, illustrating why so many Americans remain doubtful that they will benefit from what both the Federal Reserve and the White House see as evidence of a resurgent economy.
"The payroll numbers suggest that the economy is recovering from a weather-induced slowdown," said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But, he said, "we still have not reached the point where workers have negotiating power."
Even a sharp drop in the nation's unemployment rate, to 6.3 percent from March's 6.7 percent, provided little cause for celebration, since it was primarily because of a large decline in the number of people participating in the labor force rather than an increase in the number of Americans telling government survey workers that they had found a new job.
As a result, even as President Obama sought to seize on the upswing in the job market as evidence that his policies are working, he continues to struggle to capitalize politically on the improving economy.
Although the unemployment rate is at the lowest level of Mr. Obama's presidency, his job approval rating is also near a record low.
Economists had anticipated a jump in hiring in April, as the bitterly cold winter faded into memory and consumer and business activity rose in tandem with temperatures, but the increase was much better than had been expected and cut across both white-collar and blue-collar sectors of the economy. Professional and business services was the single biggest gainer, adding 75,000 positions, while the number of construction jobs jumped by 32,000.
In addition, government statisticians also revised upward the number of jobs added in February and March, suggesting the economy was stronger than first assumed.
Month-to-month swings in hiring represent a snapshot of the economy, rather than a portrait, and frequently blur. But April's 288,000 increase, which was adjusted to take account of normal seasonal variations and is itself subject to further revision, was well above the average monthly gain of 194,000 in 2013.
"It's as good as I could have expected," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "It was either a post-winter catch up, or the start of a stronger trend. There's no way to know yet, but I'm happy either way."
At big companies like YRC Worldwide, a trucking firm based in Overland Park, Kan., April was something of a turning point. For the first time in several years, the company's chief executive, James L. Welch, said, YRC has hired full-time recruiters to find more drivers and is also advertising open positions and participating in career fairs again.
So far this year, YRC has hired 600 people, mostly hourly workers like truckers, mechanics and dock workers, with the bulk of them coming aboard in April. If business remains brisk in May and June and the growth trajectory seems more certain, Mr. Welch said, YRC will add another 1,000 employees to its total work force of 32,000 by the end of the year.
Positions like these are especially important if the recovery is to benefit all Americans, especially since a majority of workers lack a college degree. Hourly workers at YRC earn roughly $21 an hour, and benefits are fully covered by the company.
But Mr. Welch is not prepared to open the doors wide just yet. "I'm very curious to see how freight levels are in May and June," Mr. Welch said. "We're trying to figure out if this is an overhang from the winter, or is it the economy getting better. I don't have the answer yet."
The uncertainty faced by companies like YRC is echoed by the conflicting signals evident in Friday's report.
While most observers agreed the surge in hiring that companies reported in April reflected more confidence among executives as profits soar and stock prices rise, Washington officials as well as professional economists were divided on the deeper significance of the contraction in the labor force. Unlike the payroll data, the figures on the labor force come from a separate survey of households that is used to determine the unemployment rate.
In an interview, Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, suggested the big drop in the number of workers in the household survey was caused by fewer new entrants coming into the job market, rather than a sudden exodus out of it.
One explanation, he said, could be that last month's survey was taken a week earlier than usual to accommodate Easter, reducing the number of seasonal workers and high school graduates who otherwise might have been counted as part of the work force.
"It's a huge Rorschach test for everyone who is reading it," said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. "People expecting a spring rebound are zeroing in on the payroll advance, while pessimists are looking at the household survey and the decline in the participation rate."
The pivot point in the debate, Mr. Berger added, is the course of inflation in the months ahead and how that might affect the Fed's decisions on when to begin raising short-term interest rates. A falling unemployment rate and big payroll gains might normally suggest that wage pressures could begin to rise, but the lack of salary increases for ordinary workers and the lackluster participation rate portend otherwise.
Janet L. Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and her immediate predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, have both emphasized that other yardsticks besides the traditional unemployment rate are needed to gauge the economy after the financial crisis and the Great Recession.
"Yellen can hang her hat on the participation rate to argue inflation is not a threat," Mr. Berger said.
The feeble participation rate, which reflects the share of all working-age adults with a job or actively looking for one, suggests a sizable amount of slack remains in the labor force, helping keep wage gains modest because employers know they can appeal to a wide range of applicants when they have new jobs to offer.
But many companies draw from a relatively specialized pool, which is good for those with appropriate skills but limits the possibilities for those who are out of work.
Take the case of Synchronoss Technologies, a maker of software for cloud computing and mobile communication. The company, based in Bridgewater, N.J., is looking to hire roughly 150 workers in the next few months, many of them in positions like software development and engineering that start at $75,000 to $100,000. More senior positions pay $150,000 to $200,000.
Most of those jobs require specialized skills and usually go to people with extensive experience who are nearly all currently employed or to college students and former interns.
"We could get 50 résumés for a position and two to four of those people will be brought in for interviews," said Stephen Waldis, Synchronoss's founder and chief executive. "If we're lucky, that might yield one hire."

Full text:   The British drug maker AstraZeneca rejected an improved offer by its American rival Pfizer on Friday as political debate in Britain intensified over whether a foreign takeover of one of the country's largest pharmaceutical firms should be encouraged.
Friday morning, Pfizer increased its previous bid by about 7 percent, raising the value of the potential deal to more than $100 billion. Pfizer, the maker of best-selling drugs like Lipitor and Viagra, said it was willing to pay a combination of cash and shares equal to 50 pounds a share ($84).
If completed, it would be one of the largest acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry, surpassing the headline figure of Pfizer's $90 billion takeover of Warner-Lambert 14 years ago. Adjusted for inflation, however, that takeover would currently be valued at about $124 billion.
But within hours, AstraZeneca said that its board believed the terms were a substantial undervaluation and that its strategy and pipeline of drugs would make it more successful as a stand-alone company.
Market analysts say that a price of £52 to £54 a share may persuade AstraZeneca to agree to a merger. Some viewed the company's quick rejection on Friday as a tactic meant to elicit a higher offer.
Any discussion about whether the merger made business sense was nearly drowned out by the political squabbling between the government of Prime Minister David Cameron, which has held discussions with Pfizer this week about the company's plans for AstraZeneca, and the opposition Labour Party. The opponents accuse Mr. Cameron of selling out British jobs and drug making prowess to an American company.
But despite the infighting, Britain prides itself on being a much more open economy than France, where an offer by the American giant General Electric for a large portion of the industrial conglomerate Alstom has met stiff, unified government resistance.
AstraZeneca has an attractive portfolio of cancer drugs, an area that is a priority for Pfizer. But equally attractive is AstraZeneca's British base, which would allow Pfizer to escape a higher American corporate tax rate and free its overseas profits from any claims by United States tax collectors. That has given opponents of the deal leverage to argue that Pfizer's motives have more to do with its tax avoidance than with industry synergies.
"Do we really want a jewel in the crown of British industry, our second-biggest pharmaceutical firm, to basically be seen as an instrument of tax planning in some tax planning game?" Chuka Umunna, a business spokesman for the Labour Party, told the BBC. "There is grave concern in the business community and in the sector about this transaction." In Britain, only the drug maker GlaxoSmithKline is bigger than AstraZeneca.
A spokesman for Mr. Cameron, Jean-Christophe Gray, rejected suggestions that the government had favored one side over the other and said that any offers and acceptances were "matters for shareholders."
The chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who has promoted Britain as a country open to foreign investors, spoke with Pfizer officials this week. In those discussions, the government has sought assurances from Pfizer that if it did acquire the British company, a significant portion of jobs and research and development activities would stay in the country.
Mr. Cameron "takes a strong interest in terms of jobs, skills and the research and development base," Mr. Gray said.
On Friday, Mr. Cameron spoke with AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, though Mr. Cameron's office declined to say who had initiated the phone call or give details of the discussion.
In rejecting Pfizer's higher offer, Mr. Johansson said, "We are showing strong momentum as an independent company."
Pfizer, which is based in New York and is a symbol of business prowess in the United States, publicly declared its interest in AstraZeneca early this week after making several informal takeover approaches.
"We believe our proposal is responsive to the views of AstraZeneca shareholders and provides a sound basis upon which to arrive at recommendable terms for the combination of our two companies," Ian C. Read, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
In a research note Friday, Mark Clark and Richard Parkes, analysts at Deutsche Bank, said they believed that Pfizer would have to improve its offer further to complete the transaction, indicating that investors would prefer an offer of £52 to £55 a share.
AstraZeneca said that there was no certainty over the terms of any offer and that "shareholders are strongly advised to take no action."
It is now up to Pfizer to decide whether it wants to sweeten the deal again.
On Friday, Pfizer sent a letter to Mr. Cameron to address concerns about potential job losses if the companies combined.
In the letter, Mr. Read, the Pfizer chairman, said the company would move its corporate and tax residence to Britain, base important scientific research there and employ a minimum of 20 percent of the combined company's research and development work force in the country.
"Ultimately, establishing the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical company in the U.K., together with the commitments made in this letter, represent a strong indicator of the incentives that your government has created to attract successful business to the U.K.," Mr. Read wrote.
AstraZeneca employs 51,500 people worldwide, including about 6,700 in Britain.
The British government has appointed Jeremy Heywood, a cabinet secretary and the former head of Morgan Stanley's investment bank in Britain, and John Kingman, a senior Treasury official and the former global head of financial institutions at Rothschild, to lead discussions between the government and Pfizer over the potential acquisition.
Even from within Mr. Cameron's Conservative Party, there were some expressions of concern. A former senior cabinet minister, Michael Heseltine, called for greater government powers to block foreign companies from taking over British companies.
"There are so many issues about the science base, about the supply chains, about employment prospects that ought to be explored," he told the BBC.
In 2011, Pfizer closed research facilities in Sandwich, England, leading to the loss of more than 1,500 jobs, a point that has made the bid for AstraZeneca particularly sensitive. Another case often cited here is the takeover of Cadbury by Kraft, a deal that led to job losses and the closing of a plant near Bristol.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   PARIS -- The European labor market remains stagnant in spite of recent signs that growth might be ticking up, an official report showed Friday.
The jobless rate was 11.8 percent in March in the 18 nations that share the euro currency. The figure has been unchanged since December, after revisions to previous months' data, according to a report from Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union.
For the whole European Union of 28 nations, the jobless rate was 10.5 percent, unchanged from the revised February figure.
About 25.7 million people across the European Union, including 5.3 million young people, were counted as unemployed. That was down slightly from March, but not enough to change the unemployment percentage.
There have been signs that economic growth is accelerating in Europe, albeit from a very low base. An April survey of private sector purchasing managers showed the economy expanding at the fastest pace in almost three years.
And investors have returned in force, once again buying the sovereign debt of Spain, Italy and other countries that took a beating during the euro crisis. On Friday, the yield on Spain's 10-year government bonds fell below 3 percent for the first time since 2005.
But the pace of job growth has been a drag on the euro zone, where the number of unemployed fell by only 22,000 compared with February and 316,000 compared with March 2013.
Employment is a lagging indicator, as employers -- especially those bound by the rigid labor market rules common in many European countries -- tend to hold out until their prospects are certain before adding to their work forces.
Christian Schulz, an economist in London with Berenberg Bank, said in a research note that the economic recovery, which began in the second quarter of 2013, was "gradually feeding through to the labor market." But while the number of unemployed has fallen by 310,000 since September, he wrote, at that meager pace it may take "years, if not decades" to restore the 7.5 million jobs Europe has lost since 2008.
Nonetheless, "it is a start," he said. "We expect the labor market improvement to accelerate soon following stronger momentum in the economy since the beginning of the year."
Europe's lowest jobless rates remained those of Austria, at 4.9 percent, and Germany, at 5.1 percent -- both of which use work-sharing programs to hold down unemployment. Greece, at 26.7 percent in January -- the latest figure available -- and Spain, at 25.3 percent in March, continued to experience depression-level unemployment.
France, where President François Hollande's government has announced 50 billion euros, or roughly $69 billion, in new austerity measures to meet European Union fiscal targets, posted a 10.4 percent jobless rate.
The United States, in contrast, had an unemployment rate in March of 6.7 percent. Employment data Friday from Washington showed the jobless rate in April dropping to 6.3 percent and the economy adding 288,000 jobs, far better than economists had expected.
Eurostat is scheduled to release first-quarter gross domestic product figures on May 15. Economists expect the euro zone economy to show first-quarter growth of 1.0 percent on an annual basis. That would put Europe ahead of the United States, after a report Thursday from Washington that showed the American economy expanded by just 0.1 percent in the first three months of the year.
The euro zone continues to fight serious headwinds besides the fragile labor market, including weak consumer demand. And very low inflation has raised fears of a potential period of Japan-style deflation -- an economically debilitating condition in which prices and wages actually fall, removing many of the usual growth incentives. It also makes it more difficult for borrowers to repay their debts.
Continued low inflation has left the European Central Bank under pressure to take action. Lending to real-economy companies has been shrinking for months, and a report Wednesday showed that consumer prices in April rose just 0.7 percent from a year earlier. That is well below the central bank's official target of slightly less than 2 percent, and a worrisome sign that very low inflation may be getting entrenched.
Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, has said that the E.C.B. is considering the use of the bond-buying policy known as quantitative easing, which is already employed by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, to provide monetary stimulus. Such unconventional tools are one answer to the challenge of conducting central bank policy when interest rates, the traditional lever, are already near zero.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Nor was it just rhetoric. Since 2010, we've seen a sharp decline in discretionary spending and an unprecedented decline in budget deficits, and the result has been anemic growth and long-term unemployment on a scale not seen since the 1930s.

Full text:   On Wednesday, I wrapped up the class I've been teaching all semester: "The Great Recession: Causes and Consequences." (Slides for the lectures are available via my blog.) And while teaching the course was fun, I found myself turning at the end to an agonizing question: Why, at the moment it was most needed and could have done the most good, did economics fail?
I don't mean that economics was useless to policy makers. On the contrary, the discipline has had a lot to offer. While it's true that few economists saw the crisis coming -- mainly, I'd argue, because few realized how fragile our deregulated financial system had become, and how vulnerable debt-burdened families were to a plunge in housing prices -- the clean little secret of recent years is that, since the fall of Lehman Brothers, basic textbook macroeconomics has performed very well.
But policy makers and politicians have ignored both the textbooks and the lessons of history. And the result has been a vast economic and human catastrophe, with trillions of dollars of productive potential squandered and millions of families placed in dire straits for no good reason.
In what sense did economics work well? Economists who took their own textbooks seriously quickly diagnosed the nature of our economic malaise: We were suffering from inadequate demand. The financial crisis and the housing bust created an environment in which everyone was trying to spend less, but my spending is your income and your spending is my income, so when everyone tries to cut spending at the same time the result is an overall decline in incomes and a depressed economy. And we know (or should know) that depressed economies behave quite differently from economies that are at or near full employment.
For example, many seemingly knowledgeable people -- bankers, business leaders, public officials -- warned that budget deficits would lead to soaring interest rates and inflation. But economists knew that such warnings, which might have made sense under normal conditions, were way off base under the conditions we actually faced. Sure enough, interest and inflation rates stayed low.
And the diagnosis of our troubles as stemming from inadequate demand had clear policy implications: as long as lack of demand was the problem, we would be living in a world in which the usual rules didn't apply. In particular, this was no time to worry about budget deficits and cut spending, which would only deepen the depression. When John Boehner, then the House minority leader, declared in early 2009 that since American families were having to tighten their belts, the government should tighten its belt, too, people like me cringed; his remarks betrayed his economic ignorance. We needed more government spending, not less, to fill the hole left by inadequate private demand.
But a few months later President Obama started saying exactly the same thing. In fact, it became a standard line in his speeches. Nor was it just rhetoric. Since 2010, we've seen a sharp decline in discretionary spending and an unprecedented decline in budget deficits, and the result has been anemic growth and long-term unemployment on a scale not seen since the 1930s.
So why didn't we use the economic knowledge we had?
One answer is that most people find the logic of policy in a depressed economy counterintuitive. Instead, what resonates with the public are misleading analogies with the finances of an individual family, which is why Mr. Obama began echoing Mr. Boehner.
And even supposedly well-informed people balk at the notion that simple lack of demand can wreak so much havoc. Surely, they insist, we must have deep structural problems, like a work force that lacks the right skills; that sounds serious and wise, even though all the evidence says that it's completely untrue.
Meanwhile, powerful political factions find that bad economic analysis serves their objectives. Most obviously, people whose real goal is dismantling the social safety net have found promoting deficit panic an effective way to push their agenda. And such people have been aided and abetted by what I've come to think of as the trahison des nerds -- the willingness of some economists to come up with analyses that tell powerful people what they want to hear, whether it's that slashing government spending is actually expansionary, because of confidence, or that government debt somehow has dire effects on economic growth even if interest rates stay low.
Whatever the reasons basic economics got tossed aside, the result has been tragic. Most of the waste and suffering that have afflicted Western economies these past five years was unnecessary. We have, all along, had the knowledge and the tools to restore full employment. But policy makers just keep finding reasons not to do the right thing.

Full text:   For years, Americans have told Gallup pollsters that China was the world's pre-eminent economy. They were mistaken. The United States has held that spot for more than a century. A new report suggests they may soon be mistaken no more.
New data released on Wednesday by the International Comparison Program, a World Bank body, appeared to suggest that, by one measure, China is on track to overtake the United States this year as the world's biggest economy, years sooner than many economists had previously forecast.
The group compiles gross domestic product figures from 199 world economies and then attempts to estimate their size on the basis of purchasing power parity, or P.P.P., a measure that seeks to determine the comparative size of an economy after adjusting for price differentials and the local buying power of a currency. Generally, prices are lower in developing countries, so a dollar there can buy more goods and services than in expensive developed countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany.By this measure, China's economy stood at $13.5 trillion as of 2011 -- the base year for the data in the new I.C.P. report. That is nearly 90 percent the size of the United States economy, which was estimated at $15.5 trillion on a P.P.P. basis. The 104-page summary report also showed that by 2011, India had overtaken Japan as the world's third-biggest economy, with a G.D.P. of $5.8 trillion in purchasing-power terms. Given that China's economy has grown much faster than that of the United States since 2011, it should eclipse the United States this year, according to an extrapolation of those figures based on growth projections from the International Monetary Fund.
The new figures mark a significant downward revision in previous estimates of the prices of goods and services in many developing countries, pushing down their cost of living. The result is that their economies, when adjusted for purchasing power, appear to be much larger than those derived from the previous baseline in 2005. That study, released in 2007, went in the opposite direction, revising prices in countries like China and India upward and lowering their estimated G.D.P. levels.
Those dramatic swings from one survey to the next are one reason Louis Kuijs, the chief China economist for the Royal Bank of Scotland, who for years worked for the World Bank in Beijing, finds himself using the P.P.P. measure less often, instead using exchange rates to compare the size of economies.
"Having observed these huge changes in estimates, I've become a bit wary of these estimates," Mr. Kuijs said in a telephone interview. "The market can be wrong but at least it's a pretty objective measurement, and nobody can quibble about whether it was that number or whether it was 10 percent higher."
By the exchange rate measure, China has an economy barely half the size of the United States economy. The G.D.P. of the United States -- in nominal terms, meaning not adjusted for inflation -- was $16.2 trillion in 2012, nearly twice as much as China's $8.2 trillion, based on data from the I.M.F. Even with China's higher growth rate, barring a collapse in the value of the United States dollar against the renminbi, China won't overtake the United States until well into the next decade.
And because China's population is more than four times that of the United States, per capita incomes in the United States are more than four times as high as in China, even under the P.P.P. comparison. Using exchange rates, United States per capita incomes are more than seven times as high, Mr. Kuijs estimates.
Using the exchange rate comparison is a better way for economists and executives to calculate the size of markets and the economic power of a country, Mr. Kuijs said. It does little good, for example, to estimate sales of iPhones in Pakistan based on the country's P.P.P.-adjusted exchange rates and G.D.P., because customers will still have to buy the phones at market prices using market exchange rates.
"For things like living standards, it's very important to know that a haircut in China is still cheaper than in the U.S., but for many other economic and financial aggregates, market exchange rates are still what you want to look at," he said.
The I.C.P. itself cautions against using its purchasing power estimates to compare developed economies, like the United States, with developing ones, like China, India and Brazil. According to the report, the margin of error when making such comparisons can be as much as plus or minus 15 percent. The P.P.P. measure is much more useful when comparing economies at similar levels of economic development in order to determine whether exchange rates are overvalued or undervalued, Mr. Kuijs said.
And since 2011, the base year for the new figures released on Wednesday, prices in China, for everything from homes to education, have risen faster than in the United States, even as the renminbi strengthened against the dollar. That means the price differentials between the two countries have since narrowed.
Still, many things in China are cheaper than in the United States -- such as home delivery from Ikea, taxi rides and even Big Mac sandwiches from McDonald's. The Big Mac is used by The Economist magazine to gauge the relative strength of currencies around the world. A McDonald's in eastern Beijing offered a sandwich for 17 renminbi on Wednesday, or $2.71 at current exchange rates. That compares to an average price of $4.62 in the United States, according to the magazine. In Hong Kong, where per capita incomes are among the highest in the world, a Big Mac sold on Wednesday for the equivalent of $2.17
Many Chinese spurn Big Macs for more traditional -- and cheaper -- fare. One favorite in the Chinese capital is the jianbing, a Chinese crepe made with eggs, flour, a crispy wonton cracker, cilantro and scallions and lathered in spicy sauce. On Wednesday, Lu Ying, 45, was selling jianbing from a stand in front of a Starbucks in eastern Beijing. Her price: 6 renminbi, or 96 cents. In Seattle, a similar jianbing -- albeit with a cage-free egg -- is sold by the Bing of Fire food cart for $7.
Do ordinary Chinese appreciate that they pay so much less for the same product? Does it make them feel as if they've finally reclaimed the title as top economy after two centuries of British and American dominance?
"If China's economy has surpassed the U.S.A., why do I have to get up every morning at 4 a.m.?" Ms. Lu asked. "In a few years, I will be 50 years old. If China's economy has surpassed the U.S.A., it certainly hasn't had anything to do with me."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Inflation in the euro zone rose slightly in April, according to a preliminary official estimate, but probably not enough to ease fear of a damaging downward price spiral, nor enough to take pressure off the European Central Bank to undertake new measures to stimulate the economy.
The annual rate of inflation in the euro zone rose to 0.7 percent in April, from 0.5 percent in March, according to an estimate by Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency. The rate remains well below the central bank's official target of slightly less than 2 percent.
Very low inflation is considered bad for the economy, in part because it becomes more difficult for borrowers to repay their debts. People who owe money benefit from modest inflation, which erodes the value of debt. In Europe, excess debt remains a problem for governments as well as for many businesses and individuals.
There is fear that persistently low inflation could add to the woes of countries like Greece that face a crushing debt burden. Some economists also warn that the euro zone is at risk of deflation, a broad, sustained decline in prices that can undercut the profits of corporations and make them reluctant to invest or hire.
Analysts had expected inflation to rise at a faster rate during April because providers of package vacations, a component of the Consumer Price Index, typically raise their prices after Easter. But expectations of a larger increase faded after Germany, which has Europe's largest economy, reported Tuesday that inflation in April was 1.3 percent, lower than expected.
At the same time, however, a survey conducted by the central bank indicated that it could become slightly easier for companies and individuals in the euro zone to get bank loans, thus removing an impediment to growth.
For the first time since 2007, banks became more willing to issue credit to companies, according to loan officers questioned by the central bank. But the increase was small. Demand for loans has increased, according to the survey conducted in late March and early April, while banks expect credit to become more available in coming months.
The inflation report raised expectations that the European Central Bank will take action soon to stimulate the economy. Mario Draghi, the bank's president, has said several times this month that the bank is considering using the same method as the United States Federal Reserve to stimulate borrowing -- namely by buying up bonds as way to push down market interest rates, a process known as quantitative easing.
But economists at Nomura in London said the central bank would probably cut interest rates once more before resorting to large-scale bond purchases. And the E.C.B. will probably wait until its June meeting to act, rather than next week, Nick Matthews, an economist at Nomura, said in a note to clients. The central bank's Governing Council will meet in Brussels on May 8.
"While pressure for action may be high going into the 8 May meeting, we expect the Governing Council to defer any interest rate action until the June meeting, to allow for a more complete assessment," Mr. Matthews wrote. He predicted the central bank would cut its benchmark rate to 0.15 percent in June, from 0.25 percent.
In the United States, the Fed, under its quantitative easing program, has purchased Treasury bonds and other securities to push down market interest rates. A quantitative easing program by the European Central Bank would be much more complicated because each country has its own bonds and there is no Pan-European government debt that the bank could buy in large enough quantities to have an effect.
"Large-scale purchases of sovereign debt still remain the nuclear option for the E.C.B.," Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING, said in a research note, "and is only likely if the recovery scenario completely falls apart."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve continued to retreat from its stimulus campaign on Wednesday, saying it was looking past the economic slowdown during an unusually cold winter because growth already was rebounding.
As expected, the Fed announced after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee that it would pare its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by another $10 billion, to $45 billion a month beginning in May.
"Growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions," the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement announcing the unanimous decision.
The statement, while affirming the Fed's intent to stop buying bonds later this year, offered no new insight into the next decision the Fed must make: when to start raising short-term interest rates, which it has held near zero since December 2008.
There was, however, a hint that the Fed's deliberations were more interesting than its declaration. The Fed also said on Wednesday that its board held an unscheduled meeting Tuesday morning to discuss "medium-term monetary policy issues."
The last such meetings, in 2011, were followed by an announcement of the Fed's plans for the retreat that is now in progress. Officials have said that some adjustments are necessary, and analysts said they expected more information on the discussions in an account of the meeting the Fed will release in three weeks.
The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said in a recent speech that the Fed was focused on three issues in determining how much longer to suppress interest rates, and how quickly to return rates to a level closer to the historical norm. She named the extent of slack in the labor market, the sluggish pace of inflation, and the chances that growth would be undermined by unexpected events -- as has happened repeatedly since the end of the Great Recession, and most recently during a season of freezes and snowstorms that chilled buying and selling across a broad swath of the country.
The Fed has largely discounted the economy's slow growth during the winter months in charting its retreat. The government said on Wednesday that the economy grew just 0.1 percent during the first three months of the year. Officials have concluded the slowdown was largely a result of the unusually cold weather.
"The main takeaway from this report is simply that the Fed continues to feel confident about the economic recovery, notwithstanding the disappointing growth performance" in the first three months of the year, Millan Mulraine, deputy head of United States research at TD Securities, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.
Markets showed little interest in the Fed's latest statement, which was largely the same as the statement the policy committee released after its last meeting in March.
"Nothing to see here," was the summary offered by Barclays Capital.
The committee has reduced monthly bond purchases by $10 billion at each meeting since December, reducing the volume of purchases to $55 billion in April from $85 billion each month last year. It is on pace to end the purchases with a single cut of $15 billion when the policy committee meets in October, or a final cut of $5 billion in December.
It has been less clear about what happens next. Indeed, officials decided in March to preserve some ambiguity about the timing of a first increase in interest rates, substituting a vague description of economic goals in place of a commitment to wait at least as long as unemployment was above 6.5 percent. The Fed also has left some uncertainty about its plans for its bond holdings; its portfolio has swelled fourfold to more than $4 trillion since the financial crisis.
"Tying the response of policy to the economy necessarily makes the future course of the federal funds rate uncertain," Ms. Yellen said in a recent speech explaining the change. "But by responding to changing circumstances, policy can be most effective at reducing uncertainty about the course of inflation and employment."
The Fed has failed since the Great Recession to achieve its stated goals both for inflation and employment, and it is likely to be reminded of those failures in the coming days. The government will provide a new estimate Thursday of the Fed's preferred measure of price inflation, followed Friday by the April jobs report.
Yet Ms. Yellen and other officials forecast that the Fed's current policies would return both to healthy levels by the end of 2016.
The official unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent in March, well above the minimum sustainable level, which the Fed estimates as between 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent. But officials have expressed satisfaction with the trend of declining unemployment, even as they acknowledge it most likely overstates the health of the labor market. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively looking for work, and many people without jobs have stopped looking for new ones.
In the weeks before this meeting, some Fed officials instead emphasized their concern about the slow pace of inflation. The Fed's preferred measure increased just 1.1 percent over the 12 months through February, well below the Fed's 2 percent annual target, although the Fed continues to forecast that inflation will rebound as the economy recovers.

Full text:   As has happened so many times since the recovery began nearly five years ago, the economy turned in another disappointing quarterly performance, surprising even the most pessimistic observers as growth in the first three months of 2014 slowed to a near-standstill.
But looking past the weak report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday morning, policy makers at the Federal Reserve said they believed that activity was already rebounding from the deep winter dive, and are sticking with their plan to gradually reduce monthly bond purchases aimed at stimulating the economy.
While that optimism was reassuring for Wall Street, which rallied after the Fed announcement, the view in the rear-view mirror was as bleak as a January walk along the Hudson River. In their initial estimate for growth in the months of January, February and March, government statisticians said output expanded at an annual rate of just 0.1 percent, although experts noted that figure was affected by one-time headwinds like unusually cold weather and slower inventory gains after businesses aggressively built up stockpiles in the second half of 2013.
With more volatile factors like trade and inventory swings excluded, the pace of growth in domestic demand was about 1.5 percent in the first quarter, just slightly below where it was in the fourth quarter of 2013, while consumer spending increased at a healthy 3 percent rate.
For all the attention devoted to the quarterly fluctuations, the current underlying rate of expansion is not much different from the frustratingly slow trajectory in place ever since the economy began to recover from the Great Recession. The average quarterly rate of growth since the summer of 2009 stands at 2.2 percent.
Even if activity picks up in the current quarter and the second half of the year, said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, a large insurer, the annual growth rate in 2014 will most likely still be below the post-World War II average just over 3 percent.
"We've been living in sub 3-percent land, and people have gotten used to that as the new normal," Mr. North said. "But it's not. It's anemic."
With midterm congressional elections on the horizon in November, the seeming inability of the economy to gain any sustained momentum is also likely to weigh on the fortunes of Democrats up for re-election on Capitol Hill, since their prospects are in many ways tied to voter attitudes toward the performance of President Obama. His poll numbers have been sinking, and although there have been some encouraging economic signs recently, like a surging stock market and a gradual fall in the unemployment rate, much of the electorate remains very skeptical that things are getting any better.
Part of the reason for that is because so much slack is left in the labor market that wage growth is only improving very slowly. For example, a separate report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday on the employment cost index showed that private sector wages and salaries in the first quarter of 2014 increased at the slowest rate since the bureau began tracking the data in March 1980.
Moreover, the rebound of the housing market after the crisis in the middle part of the last decade seems to be fading. For the second quarter in a row, private residential real estate investment fell, shaving 0.2 percent off total economic growth last quarter.
"Weather was a factor, but it has become increasingly clear that the housing recovery has lost steam over the past six months, as higher mortgage rates and higher prices have weighed on buyer demand for new homes," Ryan Wang, United States economist at HSBC, said in a note to clients.
Corporate investment in equipment, which jumped sharply in the fourth quarter of 2013, reversed course in the first quarter, a major reason overall business investment slackened, shaving 0.4 percent off growth. Other major sources of weakness included a slower buildup in inventories, which reduced the pace of expansion by 0.6 percent, and a weakening trade balance, cutting 0.8 percent off total growth.
For all the controversy over Mr. Obama's health care reform efforts, the rollout of the program actually made the difference between a stall and an outright contraction last quarter, as a surge in health care spending added 1.1 percent to growth. Although prices for health care have not been rising sharply at all, consumption has, and economists expect the sector to continue to gain strength in the months ahead.
Wednesday's report was the first of three estimates of growth by government statisticians, and subsequent revisions could move the final figure up or down sharply as more data comes in, with the next report by the Commerce Department on gross domestic product scheduled for May 29.
The fresh economic indicators and the Fed announcement Wednesday afternoon kicked off a busy few days for economists and investors, and Wall Street will be glued to the flow of data. On Thursday, the Commerce Department will report new figures on personal income and spending in March, followed on Friday by the Labor Department's latest data on the job market in April. The consensus among economists calls for a jump in payrolls of 215,000, with the unemployment rate falling by 0.1 percent to 6.6 percent.
On Wednesday, the payroll processor ADP said that American businesses increased hiring in April, adding 220,000 jobs in April, the most since November and up from 209,000 in March. The ADP numbers cover only private businesses and often diverge from the government's more comprehensive report.

Full text:   The behavior gap between rich and poor children, starting at very early ages, is now a well-known piece of social science. Entering kindergarten, high-income children not only know more words and can read better than poorer children but they also have longer attention spans, better-controlled tempers and more sensitivity to other children.
All of which makes the comparisons between boys and girls in the same categories fairly striking: The gap in behavioral skills between young girls and boys is even bigger than the gap between rich and poor.
By kindergarten, girls are substantially more attentive, better behaved, more sensitive, more persistent, more flexible and more independent than boys, according to a new paper from Third Way, a Washington research group. The gap grows over the course of elementary school and feeds into academic gaps between the sexes. By eighth grade, 48 percent of girls receive a mix of A's and B's or better. Only 31 percent of boys do.
And in an economy that rewards knowledge, the academic struggles of boys turn into economic struggles. Men's wages are stagnating. Men are much more likely to be idle -- neither working, looking for work nor caring for family -- than they once were and much more likely to be idle than women.
We reported last week that the United States had lost its once-enormous global lead in middle-class pay, based on international income surveys over the last three decades. After-tax median income in Canada appears to have been higher last year than the same measure in this country. The poor in Canada and much of western Europe earn more than the poor here.
These depressing trends have many causes, but the social struggles of men and boys are an important one. If the United States is going to build a better-functioning economy than the one we've had over the last 15 years, we're going to have to solve our boy problems.
To put it another way, the American economy -- for all its troubles (and all of the lingering sexism) -- looks to be doing pretty well when you focus on girls. The portion of women earning a four-year college degree has jumped more than 75 percent over the last quarter-century, in line with what has happened in other rich countries. Median inflation-adjusted female earnings are up almost 35 percent over the same span, census data show -- while male earnings, incredibly, haven't risen at all.
"We know we've got a crisis, and the crisis is with boys," said Elaine Kamarck, a resident scholar at Third Way and a former Clinton administration official. "We're not quite sure why it's happening."
Two of the leading theories involve single-parent families and schools. The number of single-parent families has surged over the last generation, and the effect seems to be larger on boys in those families than girls. Girls who grow up with only one parent -- typically a mother -- fare almost as well on average as girls with two parents. Boys don't.
But the trends seem too broad for family structure to be the only cause. That's where schools come in.
Girls enter school with a lead on boys, and schools then fail to close the gaps. Instead, they increase. The behavioral advantage that girls have over boys in kindergarten, based on teachers' assessments of their students, are even larger in fifth grade.
By then, the average girl is at the 60th percentile of an index of social and behavioral skills, while the average boy is at only the 40th percentile, according to Claudia Buchmann of Ohio State and Thomas DiPrete of Columbia, the authors of the new paper. That gap of 20 percentage points is larger than the 14-point gap between poor and not poor children or the 15-point gap between white and black children.
These behavior measures are subjective, of course, based on the views of teachers across the country in very different classrooms. Yet it's clear that the measures reflect something real, because the behavior differences later translate into academic differences. By high school, even advanced math and science classes now have more girls than boys. At college graduation ceremonies around the country this spring, women in caps and gowns will easily outnumber men.
The experts who study the subject disagree on the solutions. Some, like Ms. Buchmann and Mr. DiPrete, point out that boys still do quite well in the best-performing schools. When good grades bring high status, boys respond. To the researchers in this camp, the answer involves improving schools, which will have a disproportionate effect on boys, rather than changing schools to be more attuned to boys' needs.
Others, like Christina Hoff Sommers, argue that today's education system fails to acknowledge the profound differences between boys and girls. It asks boys to sit still for hours every day and provides them with few role models in front of the classroom. Just as the dearth of female science professors hampers would-be female science majors in college, the dearth of male fourth-grade teachers creates problems for 10-year-old boys.
My own sense is that both sides have a point -- and that their ideas aren't mutually exclusive. Experimenting with all kinds of solutions will offer better answers than we now have.
The problems that stem from gender have become double-edged. The old forms of sexism, while greatly diminished, still constrain women. The job market exacts harsh financial and career penalties on anyone who decides to work part time or take time off, and the workers who do so are overwhelmingly female. That's a big part of the reason that the top ranks of corporate America, Silicon Valley and the government remain dominated by men.
But men have their own challenges. As the economy continues to shift away from brawn and toward brains, many men have struggled with the transition.
"Boys are getting the wrong message about what you need to do to be successful," Ms. Buchmann says. "Traditional gender roles are misguiding boys. In today's economy, being tough and being strong are not what leads to success."
The problem doesn't simply involve men trying to overcome the demise of a local factory or teenage boys getting into trouble. It involves children so young that most haven't even learned the word "gender." Yet their gender is already starting to cast a long shadow over their lives.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is tiptoeing away from its economic stimulus campaign, and so far the broader economy has barely noticed.
The Fed's policy-making committee, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, is widely expected to announce another $10 billion cut in its monthly bond purchases, to $45 billion, en route to ending the purchases this autumn.
Fed officials, meanwhile, have focused on assuring markets that interest rates will remain near zero for the next year or so, and stay low thereafter.
And after a rocky start to the Fed's retreat last summer, investors generally have accepted the official line, to judge by the prices of financial assets.
"We're exactly on the right track," John C. Williams, the centrist president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told Bloomberg News last week.
Things are going well enough that a management issue is rising up the list of the Fed's concerns. The Fed's seven-person board in Washington will be reduced to just three members at the end of May, for the first time in its hundred-year history, unless the Senate moves quickly to confirm two additions. A preliminary vote on the nominations of Stanley Fischer and Lael Brainard is scheduled for Tuesday morning.
If the Senate does not act in time, three people will be left to do the work of seven. Moreover, the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her two remaining colleagues would be allowed to converse with one another only at scheduled public meetings, because any such interaction would involve a majority of the board.
Other challenges are looming. Forecasters, including the Fed's own staff and its officials, generally expect the economy to grow more quickly in the coming months, rebounding from a cold winter that suppressed first-quarter activity.
An early indication will come Friday, when the government is scheduled to release an initial estimate of job creation in April.
Faster growth could lead some investors to conclude that the Fed will decide to start raising rates sooner, or more quickly, than it has forecast.
"The Yellen-led Fed has not yet been tested," Vincent Reinhart, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in an analysis last week. "The data thus far in 2014 have been soft enough to make it plausible that the policy interest rate can be kept low for a considerable period, but not so soft as to raise significant concerns about the economic expansion. Fed officials, however, will be pressed to speak more clearly about policy sometime soon as economic data firm."
While this week's meetings are likely to pass quietly -- the Fed's next round of economic projections will be released after its June meeting, which is also the next time that Ms. Yellen is scheduled to hold a news conference -- officials are likely to discuss some of the issues that will determine the speed of their retreat from the extraordinary stimulus measures that followed the financial crisis.
In a recent speech, Ms. Yellen named three considerations that will affect their timing: the extent of slack in the labor market, the outlook for inflation and downside risks to growth.
The Fed has chosen to leave open the course of policy once it discontinues its huge bond-buying program. Ms. Yellen said that uncertainty was a consequence of its commitment to take the necessary steps to reduce unemployment and to restore inflation to a healthy pace.
"Tying the response of policy to the economy necessarily makes the future course of the federal funds rate uncertain," she told the Economic Club of New York. "But by responding to changing circumstances, policy can be most effective at reducing uncertainty about the course of inflation and employment."
Since the start of the Great Recession at the end of 2007, the Fed has had a full complement of seven governors just 20 percent of the time. During most of that period, it operated with only five governors. Since early March, there have been only four.
And soon, there could be three. Jeremy C. Stein, who has raised concerns about the stimulus campaign, said earlier this month he would resign at the end of May, preserving his position as a tenured professor of economics at Harvard.
Mr. Fischer, a former head of the Bank of Israel, and Ms. Brainard, a former Treasury official, are both expected to get the banking committee's support, along with Jerome H. Powell, a board member since 2012 nominated to serve a new term.
But they would then join a logjam of scores of presidential nominees for positions across the government who are awaiting action by the full Senate. While Democrats prevented indefinite delays by changing the Senate's procedural rules last year, Republicans have responded by slowing each confirmation process.
And even the confirmation of Mr. Fischer and Ms. Brainard would leave a pair of vacancies on the Fed's board. The White House is under considerable pressure from community bankers and their political supporters to choose someone with small-bank experience to the board.
Fifteen Democratic and Republican senators -- including eight members of the banking committee, which screens nominees -- sent a letter to President Obama this month requesting that Mr. Stein be replaced by someone who has served as a community banking regulator or an executive of a smaller bank.
The administration also would like to nominate at least one more woman; the Fed's board had three women when it was most recently at full strength.
Two people involved with the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations, said the White House was considering, among others, Diana L. Preston, a lawyer who recently left the American Bankers Association, where she worked on securities issues; Ann Marie Mehlum, an official at the Small Business Administration who ran a small bank in Oregon; and Rebeca Romero Rainey, chief executive of Centinel Bank of Taos in New Mexico.

Full text:   VALENCIA, Venezuela -- Clipso Martínez was shot at such close range by a soldier at a protest that his surgeon said he had to remove pieces of the plastic shotgun shell buried in his leg, along with the shards of keys Mr. Martínez had in his pocket, shattered by the blast.
Jorchual Gregory was detained with 10 others who said that over three days they were kicked, pistol whipped, doused with pepper spray and battered with helmets and shotgun butts.
"They wanted to make people afraid so we wouldn't stay in the streets," said Mr. Gregory, 19. "But what happened was more protests and more deaths."
Venezuela has been shaken by more than two months of often violent protests that President Nicolás Maduro says are designed to overthrow him. He has held the opposition responsible for violence that the government says has claimed more than 40 lives, including those of protesters, bystanders and six National Guard soldiers.
Until recently, most countries in the region had either supported Mr. Maduro, said little about the protests or gently urged him toward moderation. But there were growing signs that support for Mr. Maduro in the region was weakening, as some of Venezuela's neighbors showed unease with the government's response to the crisis, including the aggressive treatment of protesters.
This month, foreign ministers from the Union of South American Nations, a group that Venezuela was instrumental in creating, pressed Mr. Maduro to hold face-to-face talks with opposition parties. With diplomats from Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador sitting in, the government and opposition agreed to create a truth commission to look into allegations of human rights abuses during the protests, which were fueled by frustration with rampant crime, soaring inflation, shortages of basic goods and a government crackdown on dissent.
Adding to the pressure, the former president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, voiced unusual public criticism of Mr. Maduro this month, saying that he should "establish a coalition policy" and "lower the tension."
The comments were particularly noteworthy because Mr. da Silva -- a staunch supporter of Mr. Maduro's mentor and predecessor, Hugo Chávez, who died last year -- made a videotaped endorsement for Mr. Maduro when he ran for president last April. Mr. Maduro won the election by a narrow margin.
Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington, said the intervention by other South American countries was prompted by the escalating violence.
"The primary concern is that without any moderation, without any space for dialogue, there was a likelihood of continued crackdown and repression that would spur more violence," Mr. Shifter said.
The growing concerns in the region coincided with increasing evidence of a pattern of violent behavior by the security forces here. Mr. Maduro has said that "a very small number of security forces personnel" have been "accused of engaging in violence," and that the government has arrested them. Yet abuse allegations continued to mount, particularly against the National Guard, a military branch at the forefront of the government response to the protests.
Soldiers have been accused of firing shotguns loaded with hard plastic buckshot at point-blank range, injuring numerous demonstrators and killing a 23-year-old woman. Soldiers and police officers have also been widely accused of beating detainees, often severely, with many people saying the security forces then robbed them, stealing cellphones, money and jewelry.
The government -- which has faced violent tactics from protesters, including Molotov cocktails -- said it is committed to protecting human rights while maintaining order. Last month, Mr. Maduro created a Council of State for Human Rights to investigate wrongdoing. Critics complained that the council included the same government officials responsible for the security forces implicated in abuses: the defense minister and the interior minister.
"There have been police excesses but we are investigating," the national prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, said in a television interview last month. She defended the National Guard, saying that allegations against it amounted to "a disproportionate attack."
"If it's true that there have been excesses by some police personnel, it's not that the commander of the National Guard gets his people together and tells them, 'You're going to go out and violate human rights,' " she said.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had voiced concern over reports of security force abuses in Venezuela, and this month the Venezuelan conference of Roman Catholic bishops objected to "the brutal repression of political dissent."
"The government is wrong to want to resolve the crisis through force," the bishops said.
Here in Valencia, Venezuela's third largest city, Geraldín Moreno, a student, was standing outside her apartment complex on Feb. 19, banging a pot in protest, when soldiers rode up on motorcycles, according to her father, Saúl Moreno. She fell trying to run into the complex.
Witnesses said that a soldier got off his motorcycle, pointed his shotgun at her head and fired. The hard plastic buckshot slammed through her eye socket into her brain, her father said. She died after a lengthy surgery on Feb. 22, eight days shy of her 24th birthday.
"The pain will never go away," Mr. Moreno said. "Every day her absence is greater."
Mr. Gregory, who said he had been detained with 10 others, had gone to a protest here on Feb. 13 with friends Juan Carrasco, 21, and Jorge León, 25, but when they saw soldiers shooting tear gas and shotguns they ran back to Mr. León's car. According to the men, soldiers surrounded the car, broke the windows and tossed a tear gas canister inside. Mr. Gregory said that a soldier fired a shotgun at him at close range while he sat in the passenger seat, hitting him in the arms and the back of the head.
The men said they were then pulled from the car and beaten viciously. At one point, Mr. Gregory said, a soldier smashed their hands with the butt of his shotgun, telling them it was punishment for protesters' throwing rocks. The men said that the soldiers set fire to Mr. León's car.
They were loaded into a truck with other detainees and driven to a National Guard post. One of the detainees, Oswaldo Torres, 25, a salesman in a brake shop, said that the soldiers pretended he was a soccer ball and kicked him over and over again. The men said they were handcuffed together, threatened with an attack dog, made to crouch for long periods, pepper sprayed and beaten.
Mr. Torres said he was hit so hard on the head with a soldier's helmet that he heard it crack. "Everything went black," he said.
The Penal Forum, a legal group, said it had documented 70 cases of alleged abuse so far. "It is continuous and systematic," said Gonzalo Himiob, a director for the group. "The way they are mistreated is very similar in all parts of the country."
Interviews with more than two dozen people who said they were mistreated by security forces revealed similar patterns of abuse. In San Antonio de los Altos, outside Caracas, Luis Gutiérrez, 26, said that he and others were cornered in a parking lot on Feb. 19 by soldiers who ordered them to lie down and began kicking them.
Mr. Gutiérrez said one of them kicked him in the face. Surgeons later used screws and metal plates to mend his fractured forehead and broken nose.
"They have the right to detain us because we were blocking the road," said Mr. Gutiérrez. "But there's no justification for doing this to us, causing these injuries."
The prosecutor's office said it was investigating 145 allegations of abuse and that 17 security officials are in jail. Critics questioned the aggressiveness of the investigations. The number of jailed security personnel had not changed in more than a month. According to the prosecutor's count last month, only one member of the National Guard, the force that had been most widely accused of abuses, was in jail.
The soldier who fatally shot Ms. Moreno in the face had not been arrested, said Rafael Ramírez, a lawyer for her father. "While it's true that prosecutors have been receptive to us we have seen a brake" on the progress of the investigation, Mr. Ramírez said.
Like many of the protesters, Mr. Martínez, whose shattered keys pierced his leg when he was shot here on March 20, faced charges of disrupting public order.
"It was easy for them to give me house arrest and say you face so many charges," he said. "But they never said, 'We're going to go find the soldier who shot you.' "
Keyla Brito, 41, a housewife in Barquisimeto, said she had been on her way to the butcher shop with her 17-year-old daughter on March 12 when they were swept up by National Guard soldiers, taken with six other women to a military post and handed over to female soldiers.
The soldiers beat them, kicked them and threatened to kill them, according to Ms. Brito, her daughter and two of the other women. Male soldiers threatened to rape them, they said.
Ms. Brito said that a soldier cut off her waist-length hair, leaving it ragged. Her daughter and the other women underwent similar haircuts, they said.
The women said they were released only after being made to sign a paper stating that they had not been mistreated.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The deep recession wiped out primarily high-wage and middle-wage jobs. Yet the strongest employment growth during the sluggish recovery has been in low-wage work, at places like strip malls and fast-food restaurants.
In essence, the poor economy has replaced good jobs with bad ones. That is the conclusion of a new report from the National Employment Law Project, a research and advocacy group, analyzing employment trends four years into the recovery.
"Fast food is driving the bulk of the job growth at the low end -- the job gains there are absolutely phenomenal," said Michael Evangelist, the report's author. "If this is the reality -- if these jobs are here to stay and are going to be making up a considerable part of the economy -- the question is, how do we make them better?"
The report shows that total employment has finally surpassed its pre-recession level. "The good news is we're back to zero," Mr. Evangelist said.
But job losses and gains have been skewed. Higher-wage industries -- like accounting and legal work -- shed 3.6 million positions during the recession and have added only 2.6 million positions during the recovery. But lower-wage industries lost two million jobs, then added 3.8 million.
With 10.5 million Americans still looking for work -- the unemployment rate is 6.7 percent -- employers feel no pressure to raise wages for those who are working. As a result, the average household's take-home pay has declined through the recession and the recovery to $51,017 in 2012 from $55,627 in 2007, after adjusting for inflation.
With joblessness high and job gains concentrated in low-wage industries, hundreds of thousands of Americans have accepted positions that pay less than they used to make, in some cases, sliding out of the middle class and into the ranks of the working poor.
That includes Connie Ogletree, a former administrative and executive assistant who now earns $7.25 an hour at a McDonald's in Atlanta. "It was 40 years ago that I had my first fast-food job, at a Dairy Queen," said Ms. Ogletree, 55. "This is my second."
Ms. Ogletree is in school working toward a bachelor's degree, in the hope of returning to a white-collar position. But in the meantime, she and her older sister have scrimped and saved to make ends meet on her meager earnings.
She said that she appreciated her job -- many do not have one -- but that she found the work tough.
"When you go into a fast-food restaurant, you want to be sure the people in the back are doing the best job they can," she said. "You want them not to be worried about missing a day if they're sick, to be able to go to a child's play at school or a P.T.A. meeting. I'd like a vacation once a year, but my employer doesn't offer that, or sick days."
The National Employment Law Project study found that there were about a million fewer jobs in middle-wage industries -- including parts of the health care system, loan servicing and real estate -- than there were when the recession hit.
Economists worry that even a stronger recovery might not bring back jobs in traditionally middle-class occupations eroded by mechanization and offshoring. The American work force might become yet more "polarized," with positions easier to find at the high and low ends than in the middle.
The swelling of the low-wage work force has led to a push for policies to raise the living standards of the poor, including through job training, expansion of health care coverage and a higher minimum wage.
President Obama has supported a Democratic proposal to lift the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from its current level of $7.25.
"Nobody who works full-time should ever have to live in poverty," Mr. Obama said on Saturday in his weekly address. "That's why nearly three in four Americans support raising the minimum wage."
Raising it to $10.10 would "lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country," he said. "We're not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum-wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs."
But with congressional inaction stalling that proposal, many state and local governments have forged ahead on their own. States including Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California and Rhode Island have raised their local minimum wages. And a total of 34 states are considering lifting their wage floors, while activists in other states are pushing for ballot referendums to do so.
"They're actually getting the job done, so that workers get a raise," said Thea Lee, the deputy chief of staff of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "The hope is that it creates momentum nationally and builds an activist base."
But many Republicans oppose raising the wage floor while the economy remains weak. And many businesses staunchly oppose higher minimum wages because of the threat to their bottom lines.
The National Employment Law Project study found especially strong growth in restaurants and food services, administrative and waste services and retail trades. Those industries -- which often pay wages at the federal minimum -- accounted for about 40 percent of the increase in private sector employment over the past four years.
There has also been strong jobs growth in some high-paying industries, like professional, scientific and technical services -- a category that includes accountants, lawyers, software developers and engineers. That sector accounted for about 9 percent of the private-sector job gains in the recovery.

Abstract: At the height of the crisis, with Germany blocking proposals for even more deficit spending to stimulate demand, and the European Central Bank unwilling to take the sort of expansionary monetary stimulus pursued by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England in Britain, austerity budgeting was one of the few policy options on the table.

Full text:   PARIS -- Euro zone governments have hit an important goal, bringing their combined budget deficits for 2013 in line with their target for the first time since 2008, official data showed on Wednesday. But for some economists, meeting that cost-cutting goal has not been worth the price paid in lost jobs and feeble growth.
The 18 countries that use the euro as their currency reduced their deficits, on average, to 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, down from 3.7 percent in 2012. However, some individual governments did not meet the deficit target, according to preliminary data from Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union. France, for example, came in at 4.3 percent.
And while the deficit picture over all has improved, the euro zone's total debt has mounted, as countries continue to run deficits and add to their borrowing. The debt rose to 92.6 percent of euro zone gross domestic product -- well above the 60 percent target in the 1992 treaty that created the euro.
Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a research group in London, said the euro zone's deficit reduction, through what critics have come to call austerity budgeting, had come "at an enormous cost" in lost economic growth.
Deficit financing by issuing bonds is a normal part of operations for most sovereign governments, used when revenues fall short of expenditures. But continued heavy deficit financing can lead to a situation in which the interest costs on the accumulating debt eat up so much of the budget that a country enters a self-reinforcing cycle of greater borrowing and more indebtedness that eventually becomes unsustainable.
That happened to some euro zone governments after they borrowed heavily to keep their countries' banking sectors afloat after the 2008 financial crisis, only to experience a sharp downturn in tax receipts as economies slowed or fell into recession. Beginning in 2010, those problems broke open. Investors began dumping euro zone bonds, ultimately leading Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus to seek bailouts, and also raising concerns about whether Spain or Italy might be next, threatening the euro union itself.
That year, the euro zone's deficit figure hit more than 6 percent of G.D.P.
The 3 percent figure reported Wednesday, the deficit level that the countries agreed to under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, had not been achieved since the onset of the global financial crisis.
At the height of the crisis, with Germany blocking proposals for even more deficit spending to stimulate demand, and the European Central Bank unwilling to take the sort of expansionary monetary stimulus pursued by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England in Britain, austerity budgeting was one of the few policy options on the table. The euro zone embraced that option, agreeing to recommit to the "Maastricht criteria."
During a time of economic weakness, the resulting tax increases and cuts in government spending, which reduced overall demand, invited criticism that the austerity policy was counterproductive, since a faster-growing economy could help achieve the same goal. Economists in the school of John Maynard Keynes say it would have been better for Germany, which runs a trade surplus with many of its euro zone partners, to stimulate demand at home to pick up the slack, rather than calling on weaker neighbors to make spending cuts that placed further drags on their economies. But other experts saw few alternatives, given the financial realities.
"It's a religious question, not an economic question," Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING in Brussels, said of the austerity debate. "There is no real right or wrong answer."
Mr. Brzeski noted that investors this year had been once again willing to take the risk of buying bonds of weaker euro zone economies that they would not touch during the sovereign debt crisis. Ireland, Portugal and even Greece have re-entered the bond markets, finding ready buyers. "In 2010, there was no appetite for risk," he said.
"In purely economic terms, it might not have been worth it," Mr. Brzeski said. "But you had to ask if these countries needed sustainable finances or not. And if some sort of action had not been taken, it would have meant leaving it in the hands of the markets. Europe didn't want to do that."
Whatever the economic effects of the austerity pact, it did provide political cover for the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi. He promised that monetary officials would do "whatever it takes" to support embattled sovereign lenders, eventually stepping into the bond market to hold down yields for Italy and Spain when their borrowing costs appeared to be reaching unsustainable levels.
Today, yields for Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds are around 3.1 percent, less than half their peak in 2012 and not far above yields for United States Treasuries. Greece two weeks ago met heavy demand as it sold $4.2 billion of bonds in its first foray into the market in four years.
The data released Wednesday also included a major step for Greece, the worst-hit of the euro zone countries. The country in 2013 achieved a primary budget surplus -- a surplus before debt payments and excluding aid to its banking sector -- of 1.5 billion euros, or about $2.1 billion, according to Simon O'Connor, a spokesman for the European Commission in Brussels.
That is equivalent to 0.8 percent of G.D.P. and paves the way for possible talks on granting Greece some debt relief. Euro zone officials said in November 2012 that such a surplus was necessary before any such discussions could be held. Greek officials, facing a debt burden equivalent to 175 percent of G.D.P., are planning to broach the subject as early as May 5, when euro zone finance ministers are to meet.
In Athens, the government was preparing to distribute the bulk of its hard-won surplus to unemployed people and low-income households. By Wednesday, more than 300,000 Greeks had applied for the so-called social dividend that the government is eager to offer austerity-weary Greeks ahead of municipal and European elections next month.
In Greece, "austerity was overdone," said Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, noting that it had contributed to a nearly 25 percent decline in G.D.P. since the crisis. But, he added, "the Greek death spiral is about to be broken," with the country doing much of what is needed to meet the Maastricht criteria by 2030.
The austerity debate continues to bedevil France. President François Hollande is fighting record unpopularity and trying to contain a rebellion within his own Socialist Party over a proposed plan to cut [euro]50 billion from spending to meet the deficit target -- even as he reduces employment taxes in hopes that doing so will spur hiring. On Wednesday, facing criticism from the European Commission over its failure to reach the target on time, the French government said its new plan would allow it to reduce the deficit to 3.8 percent of G.D.P. this year and to 3 percent next year.
The Eurostat report came as a private sector survey of purchasing managers' activity pointed to a 10th straight month of economic growth in the euro zone. The April composite index from Markit Economics rose to 54 in April from 53.1 in March -- the highest reading since May 2011 -- with growth in the weaker so-called peripheral euro members beginning to pick up. A number above 50 suggests expansion.
Mr. Tilford of the Center for European Reform said it appeared that Europe, having been in a long slump, was now experiencing a cyclical pickup. The outlook remains poor, however, he said, "when the recovery we're seeing is so weak and patchy, especially considering the losses of output we have seen in the euro zone."
With inflation now "exceptionally low," at less than 1 percent in the euro zone, Mr. Tilford said: "The only way to be optimistic about euro zone debt would be to see a period of strong growth and a pickup in inflation. There's no prospect of that at the moment."

Full text:   The American middle class, long the most affluent in the world, has lost that distinction.
While the wealthiest Americans are outpacing many of their global peers, a New York Times analysis shows that across the lower- and middle-income tiers, citizens of other advanced countries have received considerably larger raises over the last three decades.
After-tax middle-class incomes in Canada -- substantially behind in 2000 -- now appear to be higher than in the United States. The poor in much of Europe earn more than poor Americans.
The numbers, based on surveys conducted over the past 35 years, offer some of the most detailed publicly available comparisons for different income groups in different countries over time. They suggest that most American families are paying a steep price for high and rising income inequality.
Although economic growth in the United States continues to be as strong as in many other countries, or stronger, a small percentage of American households is fully benefiting from it. Median income in Canada pulled into a tie with median United States income in 2010 and has most likely surpassed it since then. Median incomes in Western European countries still trail those in the United States, but the gap in several -- including Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden -- is much smaller than it was a decade ago.
In European countries hit hardest by recent financial crises, such as Greece and Portugal, incomes have of course fallen sharply in recent years.
The income data were compiled by LIS, a group that maintains the Luxembourg Income Study Database. The numbers were analyzed by researchers at LIS and by The Upshot, a New York Times website covering policy and politics, and reviewed by outside academic economists.
The struggles of the poor in the United States are even starker than those of the middle class. A family at the 20th percentile of the income distribution in this country makes significantly less money than a similar family in Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland or the Netherlands. Thirty-five years ago, the reverse was true.
LIS counts after-tax cash income from salaries, interest and stock dividends, among other sources, as well as direct government benefits such as tax credits.
The findings are striking because the most commonly cited economic statistics -- such as per capita gross domestic product -- continue to show that the United States has maintained its lead as the world's richest large country. But those numbers are averages, which do not capture the distribution of income. With a big share of recent income gains in this country flowing to a relatively small slice of high-earning households, most Americans are not keeping pace with their counterparts around the world.
"The idea that the median American has so much more income than the middle class in all other parts of the world is not true these days," said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist who is not associated with LIS. "In 1960, we were massively richer than anyone else. In 1980, we were richer. In the 1990s, we were still richer."
That is no longer the case, Professor Katz added.
Median per capita income was $18,700 in the United States in 2010 (which translates to about $75,000 for a family of four after taxes), up 20 percent since 1980 but virtually unchanged since 2000, after adjusting for inflation. The same measure, by comparison, rose about 20 percent in Britain between 2000 and 2010 and 14 percent in the Netherlands. Median income also rose 20 percent in Canada between 2000 and 2010, to the equivalent of $18,700.
The most recent year in the LIS analysis is 2010. But other income surveys, conducted by government agencies, suggest that since 2010 pay in Canada has risen faster than pay in the United States and is now most likely higher. Pay in several European countries has also risen faster since 2010 than it has in the United States.
Three broad factors appear to be driving much of the weak income performance in the United States. First, educational attainment in the United States has risen far more slowly than in much of the industrialized world over the last three decades, making it harder for the American economy to maintain its share of highly skilled, well-paying jobs.
Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have literacy, numeracy and technology skills that are above average relative to 55- to 65-year-olds in rest of the industrialized world, according to a recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international group. Younger Americans, though, are not keeping pace: Those between 16 and 24 rank near the bottom among rich countries, well behind their counterparts in Canada, Australia, Japan and Scandinavia and close to those in Italy and Spain.
A second factor is that companies in the United States economy distribute a smaller share of their bounty to the middle class and poor than similar companies elsewhere. Top executives make substantially more money in the United States than in other wealthy countries. The minimum wage is lower. Labor unions are weaker.
And because the total bounty produced by the American economy has not been growing substantially faster here in recent decades than in Canada or Western Europe, most American workers are left receiving meager raises.
Finally, governments in Canada and Western Europe take more aggressive steps to raise the take-home pay of low- and middle-income households by redistributing income.
Janet Gornick, the director of LIS, noted that inequality in so-called market incomes -- which does not count taxes or government benefits -- "is high but not off the charts in the United States." Yet the American rich pay lower taxes than the rich in many other places, and the United States does not redistribute as much income to the poor as other countries do. As a result, inequality in disposable income is sharply higher in the United States than elsewhere.
Whatever the causes, the stagnation of income has left many Americans dissatisfied with the state of the country. Only about 30 percent of people believe the country is headed in the right direction, polls show.
"Things are pretty flat," said Kathy Washburn, 59, of Mount Vernon, Iowa, who earns $33,000 at an Ace Hardware store, where she has worked for 23 years. "You have mostly lower level and high and not a lot in between. People need to start in between to work their way up."
Middle-class families in other countries are obviously not without worries -- some common around the world and some specific to their countries. In many parts of Europe, as in the United States, parents of young children wonder how they will pay for college, and many believe their parents enjoyed more rapidly rising living standards than they do. In Canada, people complain about the costs of modern life, from college to monthly phone and Internet bills. Unemployment is a concern almost everywhere.
But both opinion surveys and interviews suggest that the public mood in Canada and Northern Europe is less sour than in the United States today.
"The crisis had no effect on our lives," Jonas Frojelin, 37, a Swedish firefighter, said, referring to the global financial crisis that began in 2007. He lives with his wife, Malin, a nurse, in a seaside town a half-hour drive from Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city.
They each have five weeks of vacation and comprehensive health benefits. They benefited from almost three years of paid leave, between them, after their children, now 3 and 6 years old, were born. Today, the children attend a subsidized child-care center that costs about 3 percent of the Frojelins' income.
Even with a large welfare state in Sweden, per capita G.D.P. there has grown more quickly than in the United States over almost any extended recent period -- a decade, 20 years, 30 years. Sharp increases in the number of college graduates in Sweden, allowing for the growth of high-skill jobs, has played an important role.
Elsewhere in Europe, economic growth has been slower in the last few years than in the United States, as the Continent has struggled to escape the financial crisis. But incomes for most families in Sweden and several other Northern European countries have still outpaced those in the United States, where much of the fruits of recent economic growth have flowed into corporate profits or top incomes.
This pattern suggests that future data gathered by LIS are likely to show similar trends to those through 2010.
There does not appear to be any other publicly available data that allows for the comparisons that the LIS data makes possible. But two other sources lead to broadly similar conclusions.
A Gallup survey conducted between 2006 and 2012 showed the United States and Canada with nearly identical per capita median income (and Scandinavia with higher income). And tax records collected by Thomas Piketty and other economists suggest that the United States no longer has the highest average income among the bottom 90 percent of earners.
One large European country where income has stagnated over the past 15 years is Germany, according to the LIS data. Policy makers in Germany have taken a series of steps to hold down the cost of exports, including restraining wage growth.
Even in Germany, though, the poor have fared better than in the United States, where per capita income has declined between 2000 and 2010 at the 40th percentile, as well as at the 30th, 20th, 10th and 5th.
More broadly, the poor in the United States have trailed their counterparts in at least a few other countries since the early 1980s. With slow income growth since then, the American poor now clearly trail the poor in several other rich countries. At the 20th percentile -- where someone is making less than four-fifths of the population -- income in both the Netherlands and Canada was 15 percent higher than income in the United States in 2010.
By contrast, Americans at the 95th percentile of the distribution -- with $58,600 in after-tax per capita income, not including capital gains -- still make 20 percent more than their counterparts in Canada, 26 percent more than those in Britain and 50 percent more than those in the Netherlands. For these well-off families, the United States still has easily the world's most prosperous major economy.

Abstract: Grass-roots environmental movements have stopped natural gas drilling in New York State and Quebec, and they threaten the expansion of oil company operations, pipelines and port terminals in the Western United States and Canada.

Full text:   At a time when Russia is saber-rattling and the Middle East is in turmoil, a welcome geopolitical trifecta could be in the making. The United States is poised to surpass Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's top oil producer. Canada's oil sands have vaulted the country to energy superpower status. Mexico is embarking on a historic constitutional energy overhaul that its president promises will propel the country's economy.
And there is no shortage of cheerleaders. "The North American production outlook is incredibly bright," said Jason Bordoff, a former senior energy adviser in President Obama's White House. "Everything we see on the ground suggests reasons to be optimistic."
But as bright as the future may appear, energy executives and other experts say it is time for a reality check before declaring energy independence for the United States and its continent. Gushing oil and gas give North America hopes of becoming what some call "Saudi America," but fossil fuels development is always contentious for its environmental costs. The Keystone XL pipeline, intended to connect Canada's oil sands to American refineries, has been tangled in politics and regulatory concerns for years. Grass-roots environmental movements have stopped natural gas drilling in New York State and Quebec, and they threaten the expansion of oil company operations, pipelines and port terminals in the Western United States and Canada.
Bigger challenges face Mexico, still a fading producer for United States demand. Even as Mexico is pressing ahead with constitutional changes that promise to open exploration and production to international oil companies for the first time since the 1930s, the fine print of the legislation to carry this out is still in doubt, while raging drug violence continues to worry investors.
Perhaps most important, the economics of oil and natural gas extraction on the continent are challenging: Deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil drilling, oil sands extraction and shale drilling are all expensive and require high petroleum prices that are far from assured. Most of the easy-to-drill oil is gone. But should North America produce too much oil too quickly, and exports surge from Iraq (which is already happening) and Iran (should talks with the West over its nuclear program succeed), global oil prices could soften considerably.
There is also the possibility that the pace of shale drilling in places like Argentina, China and Russia, which have so far lagged North America, could take off, producing sizable new sources of oil and gas on the world market. As unlikely as it may seem, a price collapse, like the one that happened to domestically produced natural gas after 2008, is something every oil executive fears.
History has a way of throwing surprises at the energy patch. After the Arab oil embargoes raised oil prices in the 1970s, few foresaw the sudden collapse of oil prices just a few years later that drove Mexico and parts of Texas into an economic tailspin. Just a decade ago, companies spent tens of billions of dollars on natural gas import terminals that turned out to be useless when an unexpected boom in shale drilling led to a glut of domestic gas. Now those terminals are being converted for export at a cost of many billions of dollars more.
"There's reason for optimism," said Mark Finley, BP's general manager for global energy markets and United States economics, speaking of North America's oil and gas prospects, "but we cannot take it for granted."
The big wild card is Mexico, whose energy fortunes have been tied to the United States ever since the late 1970s, when the country discovered great riches offshore. Over the next couple of decades, United States refiners retooled to process heavy oil from Mexico and Venezuela, but over the last decade or so production in both countries has plummeted. In the case of Mexico, oil exports to the United States have declined from 1.7 million barrels a day in 2006 to one million barrels a day in recent months.
The problem for Mexico is a sclerotic national oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos, commonly known as Pemex, which has had a monopoly on production and gasoline sales since the 1930s. Known more for corruption than expertise, the company has been forced for decades to hand over its revenue to the government while underinvesting in known oil and gas fields.
President Enrique Peña Nieto has proposed to end the monopoly by allowing foreign private oil companies to explore and produce in Mexico and share in the profits. Energy experts hope Mexico can finally exploit its riches in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and in the oil- and gas-rich shale fields that cross from the United States border. Most experts say that the deepwater gulf offers the most promising results over the next five to 10 years, since international oil companies have so much experience drilling in waters adjacent to Mexican waters, and Mexican wells could be hooked up to gulf pipelines that already exist.
The words coming out of Mexico are positive. "Mexican society wants change," Pemex's director general, Emilio Lozoya Austin, told energy executives in March at the IHS Energy Ceraweek conference in Houston. "There is room for any kind of company to come and invest."
Citi Research estimated last year that Mexico could have 29 billion barrels of oil and gas reserves in the gulf, and an additional 13 billion barrels of recoverable oil shale reserves. Experts say production could increase by 25 percent by 2024 to nearly four million barrels a day, potentially vaulting Mexico to the fifth or sixth position among the biggest oil-producing countries.
The United States would stand to be the big beneficiary from a Mexican bonanza, both in terms of having an extraordinary new resource on its border and from added trade with a richer neighboring partner. But foreign oil executives remain cautious.
"The positive news in Mexico will help supplies in North America," Ryan Lance, the ConocoPhillips chief executive, told a recent Rice University energy conference. But he expressed uncertainty about how effectively Mexico would change its energy laws to attract foreign investment, asking, "Are they going to put regulations in place that will make them competitive internationally?" He did not answer his own question.
Industry executives express many concerns. They wonder how thoroughly Pemex will share its rich trove of seismic data and whether they will have to take Pemex on as a partner on projects they would rather explore on their own or with other companies. They wonder if government regulators will enforce the new energy laws fairly and if the court system will fairly adjudicate disputes between oil companies, especially where Pemex is involved.
"You can go ahead and draft all the regulations that you wish, but if those regulations are not enforced, they are totally worthless," said Jorge R. Piñon, former president of Amoco Latin America. "We need rule of law, governance and transparency."
The rule of law has always been in short supply in Mexico, and American oil executives express concern about deploying money and manpower south of the border as long as there is so much drug gang violence.
"They are making some promising signals," said Chris Faulkner, chief executive of Breitling Energy, an independent oil and gas producer, "but that doesn't mean I'm rushing down there with an armored car."
Only a decade ago Canada's oil sands were little more than an afterthought in the energy world, with oil prices just beginning to drive high enough to make mining in the subarctic boreal forest economically viable. But while Mexico has been in decline as an oil producer in recent years, Canadian production has soared.
The biggest oil find in the world last year occurred in deep waters off the coast of Newfoundland. And the oil sands in Western Canada represent one of the top three oil reserves in the world, after Venezuela's and Saudi Arabia's. According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, Canada will increase its oil production from 3.2 million barrels a day in 2012 to 4.9 million barrels a day in 2020 to 6.7 million barrels a day in 2030.
But many energy executives and experts doubt that Canada will reach its full potential because of the costs of extracting the oil sands, high royalty and tax payments and environmental concerns. The latter have jeopardized Obama administration acceptance of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would connect the resource to United States refineries on the Gulf Coast.
The Keystone pipeline, if eventually approved, could bring 800,000 barrels a day south to the United States. But several other pipelines will need to be built if producers are going to scale up to industry targets, and pipeline companies face opposition in Canada as well as in the United States. Rail transport can replace some pipelines, but at a higher cost.
The lack of transport has stranded the oil sands from markets, making the oil cheaper to buy than almost any other crude on the continent. That might not be a major problem if the oil sands were less expensive to produce, but they tend to be more expensive, whether mined or steamed out of the ground.
"It's tough to make a buck," said Bill Maloney, executive vice president for North American exploration and production at Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, a major producer in Canada. "Without infrastructure, why should that change?"
Executives say that the "easy barrels" have already been exploited and that more complex projects are driving up costs. There are shortages of skilled labor and competition for materials, problems made all the more complicated by the need to transport equipment and otherwise operate in a frigid sub-Arctic climate. Rising costs have already put a damper on development of natural gas export terminals in British Columbia.
Reaction in the industry to the challenges has been mixed. Capital spending in the oil sands is still rising this year, driven by investments from Exxon Mobil, Canadian Natural Resources, Suncor, ConocoPhillips and Cenovus Energy. But others are slowing their commitments. This February, Royal Dutch Shell halted work on its Pierre River mine in Alberta, which was to produce 200,000 barrels a day, and more project delays are considered probable.
Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of Total, the French oil giant and a major oil sands producer, said that only seven years ago most oil sands projects could break even with an oil price of $65 to $70, but higher taxes, royalties, regulations and labor costs had driven the break-even price to $90 to $95 a barrel -- just a few dollars lower than the current price.
"The Alberta government increased taxes and royalties at the same time we were faced with this tremendous inflation in costs," Mr. Margerie said. "And we told them, 'Careful, you are going to kill the beast even before it is alive.' "
The United States has been the jewel of global petroleum in recent years, increasing its oil production by more than 50 percent since 2008, and most energy analysts say they believe the good fortunes are sustainable for at least another decade. Natural gas production has been so plentiful that the price of the commodity has plunged, giving consumers and manufacturing industries a financial break, while gas import terminals are being turned around to export. The country has already replaced almost all imports of high-quality African oil with the booming production of the Texas and North Dakota shale oil fields.
The outlook for energy security would even be better if expectations of increasing Mexican and Canadian supplies came to pass. Talk of energy independence has become conventional wisdom, with the Energy Department reporting that the percentage of imported oil and petroleum products the United States consumes dropped to 40 percent in 2012, from 60 percent in 2005.
But the department warns that while the imported share should drop to 25 percent in 2016, it will rise again, to about 32 percent in 2040, as domestic production from shale fields begins to decline in 2022. Some oil executives say that the government is not optimistic enough and that technological improvements will continue to allow their companies to increase production at a profit. But few think that is a sure thing, and they list a number of concerns, most of which appear to be improbable -- but not impossible.
There have already been problems. BP's Deepwater Horizon rig disaster four years ago slowed development in the Gulf of Mexico, a critical component of domestic oil and gas production. Shell Oil's attempts to explore in the Arctic waters off Alaska were undercut by a series of embarrassing accidents. Oil companies are fighting off challenges across Texas and the West by environmentalists opposed to fracking or trying to protect endangered species whose habitat includes oil fields.
In Colorado last year, three municipalities banned or suspended hydraulic fracturing in their communities, and environmentalists want to put broader restrictions on the statewide ballot in the fall. And in gas-rich Pennsylvania, the State Supreme Court recently ruled that local communities could limit drilling with zoning regulations.
One concern is that an oil glut could develop in the middle of the country that could depress prices so much it would be difficult for producers to justify sustaining production. Refineries on the Gulf of Mexico are not designed to process large quantities of "sweet" lighter oil from the new shale fields, and the oil could be left stranded -- unless Washington reverses the current ban on most domestic oil exports, or refineries find it profitable enough to retool their plants to refine lighter oil.
Other concerns, outlined in a recent presentation by the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, include the possibility of a global drop in oil prices; the failure of drilling technology to expand extraction from core shale areas to more marginal, peripheral parts of the fields; stiffer rail transport standards; and bans on hydraulic fracturing. The firm concluded that those risks were unlikely to undercut the United States boom, but oil executives still express some wariness.
"If there is more aggressive regulation, a ban on trade," Mr. Finley, BP's analyst, cautioned, "it's just important to recognize and appreciate the range of factors that have led to this boom and not take them for granted."
But the biggest concern is the oil price, which has a history of gyrating in unexpected ways. Just a couple of years after the natural gas drilling boom took off, the ensuing glut caused prices to drop so sharply from 2009 to 2012 that producers were forced to stop drilling in several shale fields until prices partly recovered this year.
"Industry took the rig count down, production down and investment down," Mr. Maloney, the Statoil executive, recalled. "So why couldn't the same thing happen with oil?"
Industry executives note that the typical oil shale well needs a price of roughly $50 a barrel to break even, given the expense of drilling horizontally and hydraulic fracturing. "Bankers don't want to see oil near $65," said Mr. Faulkner, the chief executive of Breitling Energy, an active shale driller in Oklahoma and Texas. "Capital would dry up quickly like it did for gas."
In September, Royal Dutch Shell announced its intention to sell 100,000 acres it had leased in the Eagle Ford shale field of South Texas because of out-of-control costs. An analyst at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies has estimated asset write-downs approaching $35 billion in recent years among 15 of the main operators in the shale gas and oil fields, a tiny percentage of the total investment but a sign that shale field development is sensitive to market shifts and drilling disappointments.
What makes shale drilling particularly challenging is that wells produce most of their oil and gas in the first years of production, requiring more and more drilling in lower-quality zones of the fields.
"If W.T.I. prices come down hard," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, referring to West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, "investment will fall off, and you need constant investment for production just to stand still." He added: "I am very optimistic, but only if we continue to invest."

Full text:   Three years ago Sweden was widely regarded as a role model in how to deal with a global crisis. The nation's exports were hit hard by slumping world trade but snapped back; its well-regulated banks rode out the financial storm; its strong social insurance programs supported consumer demand; and unlike much of Europe, it still had its own currency, giving it much-needed flexibility. By mid-2010 output was surging, and unemployment was falling fast. Sweden, declared The Washington Post, was "the rock star of the recovery."
Then the sadomonetarists moved in.
The story so far: In 2010 Sweden's economy was doing much better than those of most other advanced countries. But unemployment was still high, and inflation was low. Nonetheless, the Riksbank -- Sweden's equivalent of the Federal Reserve -- decided to start raising interest rates.
There was some dissent within the Riksbank over this decision. Lars Svensson, a deputy governor at the time -- and a former Princeton colleague of mine -- vociferously opposed the rate hikes. Mr. Svensson, one of the world's leading experts on Japanese-style deflationary traps, warned that raising interest rates in a still-depressed economy put Sweden at risk of a similar outcome. But he found himself isolated, and left the Riksbank in 2013.
Sure enough, Swedish unemployment stopped falling soon after the rate hikes began. Deflation took a little longer, but it eventually arrived. The rock star of the recovery has turned itself into Japan.
So why did the Riksbank make such a terrible mistake? That's a hard question to answer, because officials changed their story over time. At first the bank's governor declared that it was all about heading off inflation: "If the interest rate isn't raised now, we'll run the risk of too much inflation further ahead ... Our most important task is to ensure that we meet our inflation target of 2 percent." But as inflation slid toward zero, falling ever further below that supposedly crucial target, the Riksbank offered a new rationale: tight money was about curbing a housing bubble, to avert financial instability. That is, as the situation changed, officials invented new rationales for an unchanging policy.
In short, this was a classic case of sadomonetarism in action.
I'm using that term (coined by William Keegan of The Observer) advisedly, not just to be colorful. At least as I define it, sadomonetarism is an attitude, common among monetary officials and commentators, that involves a visceral dislike for low interest rates and easy money, even when unemployment is high and inflation is low. You find many sadomonetarists at international organizations; in the United States they tend to dwell on Wall Street or in right-leaning economics departments. They don't, I'm happy to say, exert much influence at the Federal Reserve -- but they do constantly harass the Fed, demanding that it stop its efforts to boost employment.
And when I say that the dislike for low rates is visceral, I mean just that. While sadomonetarists may offer what sound like coherent analytical rationales for their policy views, they don't change their policy views in response to changing conditions -- they just invent new rationales. This strongly suggests that what we're looking at here is a gut feeling rather than a thought-out position.
Indeed, the Riksbank's evolving justifications for rate hikes were mirrored at international organizations like the Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements, an influential bankers' bank that is a sadomonetarist stronghold. Just like the Riksbank, the bank changed its rationale for rate hikes -- It's about inflation! It's about financial stability! -- but never its policy demands.
Where does this gut dislike for low rates come from? At some level it has to reflect an instinctive identification with the interests of wealthy creditors as opposed to usually poorer debtors. But it's also driven, I believe, by the desire of many monetary officials to pose as serious, tough-minded people -- and to demonstrate how tough they are by inflicting pain.
Whatever their motives, sadomonetarists have already done a lot of damage. In Sweden they have extracted defeat from the jaws of victory, turning an economic success story into a tale of stagnation and deflation as far as the eye can see.
And they could do much more damage in the future. Financial markets have been fairly calm lately -- no big banking crises, no imminent threats of euro breakup. But it would be wrong and dangerous to assume that recovery is assured: bad policies could all too easily undermine our still-sluggish economic progress. So when serious-sounding men in dark suits tell you that it's time to stop all this easy money and raise rates, beware: Look at what such people have done to Sweden.

Abstract: Advocates of free enterprise must remember that the system's moral core is neither profits nor efficiency. According to research from Pew's Economic Mobility Project, men in their 30s in 2004 were earning 12 percent less in real terms than their fathers' generation at the same point in their lives.

Full text:   WHAT can Washington, D.C., learn from a Buddhist monk?
In early 2013, I traveled with two colleagues to Dharamsala, India, to meet with the Dalai Lama. His Holiness has lived there since being driven from his Tibetan homeland by the Chinese government in 1959. From his outpost in the Himalayan foothills, he anchored the Tibetan government until 2011 and continues to serve as a spiritual shepherd for hundreds of millions of people, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike.
Very early one morning during the visit, I was invited to meditate with the monks. About an hour had passed when hunger pangs began, but I worked hard to ignore them. It seemed to me that such earthly concerns had no place in the superconscious atmosphere of the monastery.
Incorrect. Not a minute later, a basket of freshly baked bread made its way down the silent line, followed by a jar of peanut butter with a single knife. We ate breakfast in silence, and resumed our meditation. This, I soon learned, is the Dalai Lama in a nutshell: transcendence and pragmatism together. Higher consciousness and utter practicality rolled into one.
That same duality was on display in February when the Dalai Lama joined a two-day summit at my institution, the American Enterprise Institute. At first, his visit caused confusion. Some people couldn't imagine why he would visit us; as Vanity Fair asked in a headline, "Why Was the Dalai Lama Hanging Out with the Right-Wing American Enterprise Institute?"
There was no dissonance, though, because the Dalai Lama's teaching defies freighted ideological labels. During our discussions, he returned over and over to two practical yet transcendent points. First, his secret to human flourishing is the development of every individual. In his own words: "Where does a happy world start? From government? No. From United Nations? No. From individual."
But his second message made it abundantly clear that he did not advocate an every-man-for-himself economy. He insisted that while free enterprise could be a blessing, it was not guaranteed to be so. Markets are instrumental, not intrinsic, for human flourishing. As with any tool, wielding capitalism for good requires deep moral awareness. Only activities motivated by a concern for others' well-being, he declared, could be truly "constructive."
Tibetan Buddhists actually count wealth among the four factors in a happy life, along with worldly satisfaction, spirituality and enlightenment. Money per se is not evil. For the Dalai Lama, the key question is whether "we utilize our favorable circumstances, such as our good health or wealth, in positive ways, in helping others." There is much for Americans to absorb here. Advocates of free enterprise must remember that the system's moral core is neither profits nor efficiency. It is creating opportunity for individuals who need it the most.
Historically, free enterprise has done this to astonishing effect. In a remarkable paper, Maxim Pinkovskiy of M.I.T. and Xavier Sala-i-Martin of Columbia University calculate that the fraction of the world's population living on a dollar a day -- after adjusting for inflation -- plummeted by 80 percent between 1970 and 2006. This is history's greatest antipoverty achievement.
But while free enterprise keeps expanding globally, its success may be faltering in the United States. According to research from Pew's Economic Mobility Project, men in their 30s in 2004 were earning 12 percent less in real terms than their fathers' generation at the same point in their lives. That was before the financial crisis, the Great Recession, and years of federal policies that have done a great deal for the wealthy and well-connected but little to lift up the bottom half.
The solution does not lie in the dubious "fair share" class-baiting of politicians. We need to combine an effective, reliable safety net for the poor with a hard look at modern barriers to upward mobility. That means attacking cronyism that protects the well-connected. It means lifting poor children out of ineffective schools that leave them unable to compete. It entails pruning back outmoded licensing laws that restrain low-income entrepreneurs. And it means creating real solutions -- not just proposing market distortions -- for people who cannot find jobs that pay enough to support their families.
In other words, Washington needs to be more like the Dalai Lama. Without abandoning principles, we need practical policies based on moral empathy. Tackling these issues may offend entrenched interests, but this is immaterial. It must be done. And temporary political discomfort pales in comparison with the suffering that vulnerable people bear every day.
At one point in our summit, I deviated from the suffering of the poor and queried the Dalai Lama about discomfort in his own life. "Your Holiness," I asked, "what gives you suffering?" I expected something quotably profound, perhaps about the loss of his homeland. Instead, he thought for a moment, loosened his maroon robe slightly, and once again married the practical with the rhapsodic.
"Right now," he said, "I am a little hot."

Abstract: Some analysts said that Russia's annexation of Crimea had proved that Mr. Putin puts politics ahead of reasonable economic decisions, and that there was little reason for economic optimism, particularly given his inward, xenophobic turn, including his vow to create Russia's own cashless pay systems and even its own credit rating agency so it would not have to rely on the global financial system.\n

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Margarita R. Zobnina, a professor of marketing here, has been watching the Russian economy's gathering woes with mounting alarm: friends who have moved abroad with no plans to return; others who put off new business ventures because of rising uncertainty. Meanwhile, Ms. Zobnina and her husband, Alexander, also a professor, have rented a safe deposit box to hold foreign cash as a hedge against the declining ruble.
Most shocking, she says, is that her local grocery is now selling anchovies packed in sunflower oil rather than olive oil, an obvious response to the soaring cost of imports. "That really freaks me out," she said.
While the annexation of Crimea has rocketed President Vladimir V. Putin's approval rating to more than 80 percent, it has also contributed to a sobering downturn in Russia's economy, which was in trouble even before the West imposed sanctions. With inflation rising, growth stagnating, the ruble and stock market plunging, and billions in capital fleeing the country for safety, the economy is teetering on the edge of recession, as the country's minister of economic development acknowledged on Wednesday.
Mr. Putin, who just lavished $50 billion on the Sochi Olympics, also must now absorb the costs of integrating Crimea, which economists and other experts say has its own sickly economy and expensive infrastructure needs. The economic costs have been masked by recent patriotic fervor but could soon haunt the Kremlin, as prices rise, wages stall and consumer confidence erodes.
Even before the Crimean episode, and the resulting imposition of sanctions by the West, Russia's $2 trillion economy was suffering from stagflation, that toxic mix of stagnant growth and high inflation typically accompanied by a spike in unemployment. In Russia, joblessness remains low, but only because years of population decline have produced a shrunken, inadequate labor force.
In recent weeks, international and Russian banks have slashed their growth projections for 2014, with the World Bank saying the economy could shrink by 1.8 percent if the West imposes more sanctions over Ukraine. By some accounts, more than $70 billion in capital has fled the country so far this year and the main stock market index fell by 10 percent in March -- and a dizzying 3 percent just on Tuesday over fears of greater Russian involvement in Ukraine.
"This is our fee of sorts for conducting an independent foreign policy," Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former Russian finance minister, said at a recent investor conference in Moscow. He added that the sanctions and the fallout from Mr. Putin's foreign policy moves would drain hundreds of billions of dollars from the national economy and strangle growth for the remainder of the year.
But Mr. Kudrin, who quit his post in a dispute over the Kremlin's economic policies, said the population had yet to confront the full bill, which he predicted would grow as a result of the steep costs of absorbing Crimea, a geographically isolated peninsula. "Society has not yet seen the final result, and that will be when this puts the brakes on real incomes," he said. "For now, society accepts this fee."
From a textbook perspective, the deep-rooted ills in Russia's economy have been clear for years: The decade-long skyrocketing in energy prices that buoyed Mr. Putin's popularity has flatlined, exposing the country's dangerous over-reliance on revenues from oil and natural gas. Efforts to diversify into manufacturing, high technology and other sectors have failed, and officials have been unable, or unwilling, to stop the rampant, corrosive corruption that scares off foreign investors.
Consumer demand, which had been a primary driver of the Russian economy in recent years, stalled hard in 2013. Surveys by the Levada Center, Russia's only independent polling institute, show that consumer sentiment has been on a slow, steady decline since 2010, while fears of inflation -- especially rising prices for basic necessities, which have persisted since the 1990s -- have grown along with new anxiety about a potential drop in wages or rising unemployment.
"If you want to open your eyes, you would admit that it is a slow, downward trend of social optimism and consumer optimism," said Marina Krasilnikova, who leads income and consumer research for the Levada Center.
"The situation with Ukraine and Crimea has resulted in patriotic and imperialistic optimism," Ms. Krasilnikova said. But, she added, "this optimism will not last long."
Some analysts said that Russia's annexation of Crimea had proved that Mr. Putin puts politics ahead of reasonable economic decisions, and that there was little reason for economic optimism, particularly given his inward, xenophobic turn, including his vow to create Russia's own cashless pay systems and even its own credit rating agency so it would not have to rely on the global financial system.
Miljenko Horvat, a private equity investor who ran Citibank's office in Russia in the 1990s, said that Russia had simply failed to make itself economically relevant beyond its energy supplies.
Mr. Horvat, who now lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, said that he often challenged his Russian friends by making the following point: "I wake up in the morning and drink coffee from a machine made by a Swiss company, Nescafé. I wear something that was designed in France or Italy but probably made in Turkey. I get into a German car, look at a Korean phone, use a computer that was designed in California but made in Japan or Korea. Russia just doesn't touch me in my daily life. It just doesn't matter. It's just not relevant. So where is the economic engine going to come from?"
Mr. Horvat said that he had lived in Russia through defaults in 1991, 1993 and 1998 and that he expected another one. "I am not long in Russia," he said, invoking the financial term for betting on a rising stock, "neither in my portfolio, nor in life."
Given the recent turmoil, a catastrophe has been averted so far largely because the price of oil has remained stubbornly high, at nearly $110 per barrel of Brent crude on Wednesday, even as production steadily rises in the United States. For now, that has kept the federal budget in decent shape with still no deficit projected for the year.
But even without a shock, it is not clear how Russia will manage to climb out of the current quagmire. Stagflation is among the most confounding economic problems that policy makers can face, and officials here seem flummoxed, with the Central Bank, Finance Ministry and Economics Ministry urging contradictory steps.
Last month, the bank raised its key interest rate to 7 percent from 5.5 percent to combat inflation and support the ruble, a step that could slow growth. Meanwhile, the Economics Ministry, worried about growth, favors borrowing and government spending as a stimulus and to reduce capital flight, a possibly inflationary strategy that is opposed by the Finance Ministry, which wants to keep debt low and reserve funds available to weather any unexpected drop in oil prices.
"All of them have their clear priorities, and they stick to their priorities," said Alexei Deviatov, the chief economist for Uralsib Capital, an investment bank here, "and there is very little coordination between these authorities."
While Russian and global investors and businesses have been moving billions of dollars out of Russia to places perceived as less risky, it is not just money that is fleeing. Ms. Zobnina, who teaches at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said that one of her classmates had left for the United States after college 10 years ago, and that another friend followed three years ago to pursue a Ph.D., with no plans to return. Still another friend, a journalist, moved to London last summer with her husband and three children.
Ms. Zobnina, 32, said that she and her husband, 30, were thinking about finding posts in Europe or the United States, and for now were keeping their savings in dollars and euros. In an interview, she conceded that putting cash in a safe deposit box hardly amounted to sophisticated financial planning, particularly for two economics professors.
"It's absolutely not rational to prefer safe box than deposit because you lose interest," she said. "But in this unpredictable situation, when the ruble is falling and banks are unstable -- and who knows when we'll be cut off from the global financial system or which bank will be next to be closed -- it's better to have this small bird in hand."

Full text:   The stock market advanced for a third straight session on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, reaffirmed that the central bank was committed to keeping interest rates low.
Investors were also encouraged by a second monthly increase in industrial production and data showing that Chinese economic growth had exceeded expectations. The three main market indexes rose 1 percent or more.
Ms. Yellen said the Fed would keep interest rates low, even after its bond-buying program ends, as long as inflation is below target and unemployment is high.
Speaking in New York, Ms. Yellen largely restated the central bank's stance, emphasizing that it would respond to shifting economic conditions as it judges when to tighten monetary policy after years of stimulus.
"These comments, while nothing out of the ordinary, reiterated the Fed's commitment to accommodative monetary policy, which is helping investors remember that there are more tailwinds than headwinds in the economy," said Kristina Hooper, head of United States capital markets research and strategy at Allianz Global Investors.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 162.29 points, or 1 percent, to close at 16,424.85. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 19.33 points, or 1.05 percent, to 1,862.31. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 52.06 points, or 1.29 percent, to 4,086.23.
Yahoo was the S.&P. 500's biggest gainer, rising $2.14, or 6.3 percent, to $36.35, even though the company gave a tepid revenue outlook late Tuesday. Investors were more excited that revenue growth accelerated in the last quarter of 2013 for Alibaba, in which Yahoo holds a 24 percent stake.
Shares in the chip maker Intel briefly hit their highest point since June 2012 a day after the company posted a quarterly net profit that exceeded Wall Street's estimates. The stock later pulled back and ended up 16 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $26.93.
On the downside, Bank of America slid 26 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $16.13 after it surprised investors with a quarterly loss. CSX, the freight transportation company, fell 50 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $27.79, despite earnings that beat analysts' expectations.
"We don't expect a great earnings season, given the negative impact of weather in the first quarter, but investors with a long enough timeline should be able to look past that," Ms. Hooper of Allianz said.
Only 9 percent of S.&P. 500 companies have reported results; 57.4 percent have exceeded earnings expectations, below the long-term average of 62 percent. Only 53.2 percent have topped revenue expectations, below the long-term average of 61 percent.
The stock market has bounced back from last week's pummeling, when the S.&P. 500 posted its largest weekly decline since mid-2012. This week, the major market indexes climbed after Citigroup and Coca-Cola reported positive results and as biotechnology shares rebounded.
Recent trading has been volatile. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq opened higher, then turned sharply negative before rallying in the afternoon to end higher. According to Bespoke Investment Group, this kind of action has happened only 18 times since 2000, and a week after each instance, "the Nasdaq has averaged a decline of 2.84 percent," Bespoke wrote to clients.
In the bond market, interest rates were little changed. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 2.64 percent, from 2.63 percent late Tuesday, while its price dipped 1/32, to 101.

Full text:   Even as a number of indicators point to better economic times ahead, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, reiterated on Wednesday that she expected interest rates to remain very low until the recovery is on a more secure footing and the American economy is more fully involving available workers and other resources.
In one of her first major public speeches since assuming the top job at the Fed in February, Ms. Yellen said that while "the recovery has come a long way" -- citing a rebounding housing sector and a resurgent auto industry as examples -- a robust and healthy job market still appeared to be "more than two years away."
As a result, she said, the central bank believed that "economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping short-term interest rates below levels" that are "likely to prove normal in the longer run." Her speech seemed intended, in part, to clarify her remarks last month during her first news conference as Fed chairwoman that suggested the central bank might begin to lift rates as early as the middle of 2015. In her speech, which was given to the Economic Club of New York, Ms. Yellen also said that the risk of inflation rising above the Fed's 2 percent target remained less of a threat than the danger posed by too little inflation. She emphasized that even as the headline unemployment rate, now at 6.7 percent, has been falling, other measures of the job market's health -- like the number of people forced to take part-time positions because they can't find full-time work, the still-sizable ranks of the long-term unemployed and the proportion of the population that has dropped out of the work force entirely -- all point to weakness.
Optimism about the economy's prospects has increased in recent weeks, with some experts arguing that the end of an unusually cold and icy winter will encourage more retail activity, hiring and construction in the months ahead, after a weak patch at the end of 2013 and the very beginning of 2014. Ms. Yellen said she and fellow Fed policy makers shared that basic outlook and "generally believe that a significant part of the recent softness was weather-related."
Throughout her speech and in the question-and-answer session afterward, Ms. Yellen emphasized that under her watch, the Fed must remain nimble enough to respond to what she called the "twists and turns" of a still-recovering economy, noting unexpected roadblocks in recent years like the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and large federal budget cuts in Washington.
"So we have, indeed, had a disappointingly slow recovery, and our consistent expectations for a pickup in growth have been dashed over a number of years," she said. "And the labor market is behaving in some perplexing ways and showing patterns that are novel."
Shortly after Ms. Yellen finished her remarks, the Federal Reserve released its April survey of economic activity in its 12 districts around the country, noting that there had been a pickup in most areas. In particular, the Fed reported, "Consumer spending increased in most districts, as weather conditions improved and foot traffic returned."
There were some other encouraging signals from the Fed earlier on Wednesday, with better than expected data on industrial production in March, and the highest reading for capacity utilization among companies in nearly six years.
Ms. Yellen's remarks on monetary policy, the signs of a spring thaw in the Fed's survey and the robust manufacturing data all helped to push stocks sharply higher in later trading. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average both rose about 1 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which has dropped sharply recently, rebounded by 1.3 percent.
"Meaningful progress has been made toward recovery," said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners. "Although this business cycle has been slow, it has been steady."
While more hawkish policy makers and some prominent economists have worried aloud that a prolonged period of loose monetary policy, with short-term interest rates near zero, might ultimately unleash too much inflation, Ms. Yellen seemed to offer a pointed rejoinder to this group.
"Once it starts, deflation can become entrenched and associated with prolonged periods of very weak economic performance," she said. "With longer-term inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent in recent years, persistent inflation well below this expected value increases the real burden of debt for households and firms, which may put a drag on economic activity."
In recent months, she noted, the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.7 percent, while one closely-followed measure of inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, ran at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in February. Nevertheless, by the end of 2016, Ms. Yellen said, she was hopeful the economy would be able to match Fed projections for unemployment to fall to 5.2 to 5.6 percent, while inflation would come in at 1.7 to and 2 percent.
"If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price stability for the first time in nearly a decade," she said. "I find this baseline outlook quite plausible."
After serving as vice chairwoman of the Fed since 2010, Ms. Yellen succeeded Ben S. Bernanke as the nation's top central banker at the beginning of February. Her task in the coming months will be delicate, as she must slowly unwind the extraordinary steps Mr. Bernanke took in the wake of the financial crisis and deep recession without moving so quickly as to hurt the fragile recovery.
In particular, Ms. Yellen repeatedly emphasized the still-soft nature of the labor market during her speech on Wednesday -- a crucial reason not to tighten monetary policy too rapidly. But as nearly every central banker traditionally does, she also sought to reassure listeners during the question-and-answer session that came after that she was committed to the Fed's traditional role in combating inflation.
Asked whether inflationary pressures might mount more quickly than expected if the labor market finally gained steam and many more unemployed workers found jobs, Ms. Yellen acknowledged that was possible, if not probable.
An uptick in inflation is "one of the surprises we could see -- I wouldn't rule it out," she said. "It is not what I anticipate will happen, but, again, the purpose of my remarks today is to emphasize that there can be a lot of twists and turns."

Growth Rate Rose 7.4% in 1st Quarter, China Reports

Abstract: Louis Kuijs, a China economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland, said the service sector's resilience and recently announced government initiatives like an acceleration of railroad construction and redevelopment of shantytowns meant it was still possible for economic growth in all of 2014 to meet his forecast of 7.7 percent.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- Confirming the concerns of investors and economists, the Chinese government announced on Wednesday morning that the country's inflation-adjusted economic output in the first quarter was up 7.4 percent from a year ago -- and had risen much less than that, compared with the previous quarter.
Beijing officials have set a growth target for the whole year of about 7.5 percent; unlike growth targets in previous years, this year's target has not been set as a floor, giving the government some political leeway if the final figure falls slightly short. But for the first quarter by itself, the annualized growth rate compared with that in the fourth quarter appears to have been less than 6 percent, economists said.
Sheng Laiyun, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said the latest figures nonetheless represented an economy showing considerable strength.
"Despite the economic slowdown, China's economy is still growing at a medium to high speed," he said during a news conference in Beijing.
Weak exports and a plunge in housing starts, down 27.2 percent from the first quarter of last year, were powerful brakes on growth in the first quarter. A credit squeeze has hurt many developers, as well as smaller exporters that struggle to borrow enough money to finance purchases of raw materials and sales of finished goods.
Troubles in the housing market have also created broad nervousness about the sustainability of high home prices, with small, outlying apartments costing more than an entire decade's salary for a recent college graduate.
But the service sector, which includes industries like hotels and restaurants and which has emerged as a big job creator in recent years, fared better than expected in the first quarter.
Louis Kuijs, a China economist in the Hong Kong office of the Royal Bank of Scotland, said the service sector's resilience and recently announced government initiatives like an acceleration of railroad construction and redevelopment of shantytowns meant it was still possible for economic growth in all of 2014 to meet his forecast of 7.7 percent.
Industrial production, which is not adjusted for inflation, was up 8.8 percent in March from a year ago, the government also announced on Wednesday morning. Retail sales climbed 12.2 percent in March.
Both were weak figures by Chinese standards but suggested some improvement from January and February.
Fixed-asset investment for the first three months of the year was 17.6 percent higher than for the first quarter of last year, the weakest year-to-date figure since November 2001, as the home building sector's troubles offset extensive construction of infrastructure.
Much of the year-on-year growth in the Chinese economy reflected by the 7.4 percent growth figure released on Wednesday morning was the result of economic expansion that actually took place during the second, third and fourth quarters of last year. Although the United States and many other industrialized countries release annualized economic growth figures for each quarter compared with the previous quarter, China does not provide this statistic, preferring year-on-year figures that show less volatility.
Private economists estimated that the annualized, quarter-on-quarter growth was between 5.2 and 5.7 percent, depending on what seasonal adjustment was used.
Some private economists had expected year-on-year growth to be slightly weaker, at 7.3 percent. The Shanghai stock market was up 0.33 percent in the first hour and a half after the figures were released, while the Hong Kong market was up 0.74 percent.
The year-on-year growth of 7.4 percent was the slowest since the third quarter of 2012, also 7.4 percent; the last time year-on-year growth was slower was in the third quarter of 2009, during the global financial crisis, when it was 6.6 percent.
Even three or four years ago, growth of less than 8 percent would have alarmed Chinese officials. But the Chinese economy needs somewhat less growth to maintain nearly full employment these days, because the labor force has begun to shrink, Mr. Sheng said.
The falling number of Chinese ages 16 to 55 reflects the increasingly strict enforcement of the "one child" policy through the 1990s and has produced surging blue-collar incomes that are helping to sustain growth in the services sector.

Full text:   RIO DE JANEIRO -- No company has embodied Brazil's rise like the oil giant Petrobras.
Bolstered by some of this century's largest oil discoveries, Petrobras soared into the top ranks of global energy producers. Executives at the state-controlled company boasted that it could even outstrip Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company. Political leaders here said Brazil was on the cusp of energy independence.
Now Petrobras is coming to symbolize something else entirely: the disarray afflicting Brazil's sluggish economy and the reassessment of growth prospects in emerging markets around the world.
Instead of surging, Petrobras's oil production has stagnated, heightening Brazil's reliance on imported oil. Petrobras finds itself mired in corruption investigations and claims of managerial incompetence. And its debt load is exploding: Petrobras now ranks as the world's most indebted company, dependent, more or less, on United States mutual funds to finance its ambitious investment plans.
"The decline of Petrobras has been stunning, swift and painful," said Fábio Fuzetti, a partner at Antares Capital Management, a São Paulo investment firm. "This is the energy company that served as the model for others in developing countries," he said. "Now it's the example of precisely what not to do."
Despite these problems, executives at Petrobras point out that the company still has clear strengths. The company, which remains profitable over all despite mounting losses from importing fuel, is a pioneer in deep-sea exploration. And Petrobras commands coveted assets around the world, including oil and gas reserves of about 13 billion barrels.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for Petrobas said that debt levels had climbed as the company invests in offshore oil and expanding refining capacity. "We'll have an inflection point in our debt starting in 2015, when revenue generation will surpass investment, initiating a trajectory of debt reduction," said Paula Almada, the spokeswoman.
Pointing to the tension building over Petrobras's woes, senators grilled the company's chief executive, Maria das Graças Foster, on Tuesday. She contended that losses related to a controversial Houston refinery deal were being overestimated. Defending the company's strategies, she said, "No operation is 100 percent safe."
So far foreign bondholders, who now fund a record 43 percent of the company's giant investment program, have been remarkably patient. But analysts warn that much of this largess has been driven by the global liquidity glut. If Petrobras's troubles continue to mount, it could run into resistance on international markets.
The ills that plague Petrobras -- too much debt and spending for too little return -- reflect a larger concern that the golden age for Brazil, China, Russia and Turkey, once the vanguard of the emerging-market boom, is coming to an end.
"The problem with Brazil is that the days of 4 percent growth are gone," said Tony Volpon, a Latin America expert at Nomura Securities, who expects the country's economy to expand at well below 2 percent this year.
The problems at Petrobras, which is 60.5 percent owned by Brazil's government, have come into sharp relief in recent weeks as the company grapples with a simmering scandal over its acquisition of a Houston refinery, beginning in 2006 and completed years later, at an estimated cost of $1.19 billion from Astra, a Belgian oil trading company that bought the refinery for just $42.5 million in 2005.
Police here also recently arrested one of Petrobras's most powerful former executives, Paulo Roberto Costa, who led refining operations until 2012. Investigators say he was involved in a sprawling money-laundering scheme and may have received bribes related to the construction of a refinery that has ballooned in cost to $18.5 billion from $2.5 billion.
The list goes on. Petrobras faces scrutiny over claims that its employees received $139 million in bribes from SBM Offshore, a Dutch supplier of oil rigs. Petrobras said this month that an internal audit had not found evidence of the bribes, but federal investigators are still examining the matter. Another investigation is looking into claims of gross overbilling in an $825 million contract with Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction and oil services giant.
Despite the scandals, Petrobras remains Brazil's most powerful company. Even as the company aims to invest about $220 billion over the next five years, Mr. Volpon points out that most other companies in Brazil are not following suit. On the global stage, he says, Brazilian companies, hobbled by high interest rates, inflation and an expensive currency, are becoming less competitive.
Meanwhile, Petrobras, in the last five years, has sold $51 billion worth of bonds to yield-starved global investors, nearly a quarter of all corporate bonds emanating from Brazil and the most of any emerging-market company, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.
But the munificence of foreign investors is not bottomless. As interest rates in the United States creep up and as Brazil's finances come under greater stress, Petrobras's top creditors -- which include mutual fund giants like Pimco, Fidelity and BlackRock -- may well view their exposure as too risky and begin to unload their bonds.
"It's just such a big issuer," said Gary N. Kleiman, an emerging-market investment consultant who says that a Petrobras sell-off could ignite a broader emerging-market pullback. "We are just waiting for this thing to blow up."
Citing the increasing debt load, Moody's downgraded the company's debt last October to Baa1, the third-lowest investment grade rating offered by the credit agency.
The effect on Petrobras's financing ambitions has been minimal.
Nearly a year after setting an emerging-market record with an $11 billion bond sale, the company tapped the bond market last month for yet another monster offering. Petrobras raised $8.5 billion, the biggest corporate debt offering of the year, period.
Meanwhile, as corruption scandals ensnare Petrobras, the company is struggling to lift oil and gas production, which fell 2.2 percent in 2013 to an average of 2.55 million barrels a day. There are signs this year that Petrobras may finally be succeeding in reversing such declines; the company's oil production in Brazil climbed 0.3 percent in February from the previous month.
Perhaps Petrobras's biggest challenge is that it is not just an energy company. It is also at the heart of a fierce debate here over the extent of the Brazilian government's use of its wealth to achieve political and economic goals.
In an effort to keep inflation from accelerating during an election year, President Dilma Rousseff's government has prevented Petrobras from raising fuel prices to meet the cost of importing refined gasoline and diesel. At the same time, domestic fuel consumption has surged since the Brazilian authorities offered incentives to car manufacturers to raise production.
The result is that Petrobras's losses in its refining, transportation and marketing operations reached $8 billion in 2013.
Throughout the economy, examples abound of Petrobras being stretched thin by policies aimed at asserting greater state control over the oil industry, like measures requiring Petrobras to buy equipment domestically, effectively propping up inefficient industries in Brazil like shipbuilding.
Speaking at a Brazilian shipyard on Monday, Ms. Rousseff lashed out a critics of Petrobas and her government's energy policies, describing the oil giant as Brazil's "mother company." Contending that any corruption at Petrobas would be rooted out by investigators, she accused political opponents of a "smear campaign" against the company.
Still, as these so-called local content rules make Petrobras's costs skyrocket -- and increase the company's debt -- energy analysts here are also growing dismayed over the crisis in Brazil's once-envied ethanol industry, which has been shuttering dozens of plants as producers fail to compete in price with Petrobras's subsidized gasoline.
Facing budgetary pressures, the authorities have also quietly stopped strengthening Brazil's sovereign wealth fund. Created in 2008 soon after Petrobras announced its major oil discoveries, the fund was viewed as a pillar of efforts to establish greater financial stability in Brazil, as commodities exporters like Norway, Chile and Canada have done.
But in an attempt to meet a budget target for the 2012 fiscal year, officials withdrew about 80 percent of the money in the fund, leaving it with just $1.3 billion. Instead of replenishing the fund with proceeds from oil exports, Petrobras has grown more dependent on importing fuel and building costly projects, forcing its debt up.
Petrobras remains far from approaching the levels of political tension and opaque dealings that now characterize Petróleos de Venezuela, the acutely politicized oil producer owned by Venezuela's government that was once considered an industry leader and a bastion of technical expertise.
But some contend that Petrobas is also being stretched by Brasília's political ambitions. "Petrobras's woes are the result of well-defined government policies," said John Forman, a former head of the regulatory agency overseeing Brazil's oil industry. "That's where things get complicated, because changing the policies is challenging indeed."

Abstract: Stuart Kennedy, 29, a senior program officer at a nonprofit group, said he and his girlfriend, a lawyer, will be losing their $2,300 a month rental house in Buena Vista in June. Since they found the place a year ago, rents in the area have increased sharply. Part of the reason for the squeeze on renters is simple demand -- between 2007 and 2013 the United States added, on net, about 6.2 million tenants, compared with 208,000 homeowners, said Stan Humphries, the chief economist of Zillow.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDMIAMI -- For rent and utilities to be considered affordable, they are supposed to take up no more than 30 percent of a household's income. But that goal is increasingly unattainable for middle-income families as a tightening market pushes up rents ever faster, outrunning modest rises in pay.
The strain is not limited to the usual high-cost cities like New York and San Francisco. An analysis for The New York Times by Zillow, the real estate website, found 90 cities where the median rent -- not including utilities -- was more than 30 percent of the median gross income.
In Chicago, rent as a percentage of income has risen to 31 percent, from a historical average of 21 percent. In New Orleans, it has more than doubled, to 35 percent from 14 percent. Zillow calculated the historical average using data from 1985 to 2000.
Nationally, half of all renters are now spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing, according to a comprehensive Harvard study, up from 38 percent of renters in 2000. In December, Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan declared "the worst rental affordability crisis that this country has ever known."
Apartment vacancy rates have dropped so low that forecasters at Capital Economics, a research firm, said rents could rise, on average, as much as 4 percent this year, compared with 2.8 percent last year. But rents are rising faster than that in many cities even as overall inflation is running at little more than 1 percent annually.
One of the most expensive cities for renters is Miami, where rents, on average, consume 43 percent of the typical household income, up from a historical average of just over a quarter.
Stella Santamaria, a divorced 40-year-old math teacher, has been looking for an apartment in Miami for more than six months. "We're kind of sick of talking about it," she said of herself and fellow teachers in the same boat. "It's like, are you still living with your mom? Yeah, are you? Yeah." After 11 years as a teacher, Ms. Santamaria makes $41,000, considerably less than the city's median income, which is $48,000, according to Zillow.
Even dual-income professional couples are being priced out of the walkable urban-core neighborhoods where many of them want to live. Stuart Kennedy, 29, a senior program officer at a nonprofit group, said he and his girlfriend, a lawyer, will be losing their $2,300 a month rental house in Buena Vista in June. Since they found the place a year ago, rents in the area have increased sharply.
"If you go by a third of your income, that formula, even with how comfortable our incomes are, it looks like it's going to be impossible," Mr. Kennedy said.
Part of the reason for the squeeze on renters is simple demand -- between 2007 and 2013 the United States added, on net, about 6.2 million tenants, compared with 208,000 homeowners, said Stan Humphries, the chief economist of Zillow.
That trend is continuing as young people and doubled-up families move out on their own. "They're creating a lot of incremental demand," Mr. Humphries said. But new households rarely plunge straight into homeownership, especially given that mortgages are much harder to obtain than they were before the financial crisis. "The expectation is that when they strike out into their own units they'll be moving into rental as opposed to the owner side," he said.
And as rents head higher in the tightest markets, many are discovering that living on their own is proving unaffordable, forcing them to double up again. Arturo Breton, a 37-year-old waiter in Miami Beach, said that after years living on his own, he was joining forces with a roommate who works as a manager at J. C. Penney. "I've come down to the conclusion that in this country, it's easier for two people to pay the rent than for one person," he said.
For many middle- and lower-income people, high rents choke spending on other goods and services, impeding the economic recovery. Low-income families that spend more than half their income on housing spend about a third less on food, 50 percent less on clothing, and 80 percent less on medical care compared with low-income families with affordable rents, according to a new report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. And renters amass less wealth, even non-housing wealth, than homeowners do.
The problem threatens to get worse before it gets better. Apartment builders have raced to build more units, creating a wave of supply that is beginning to crest. Miami added 2,500 rental apartments last year, and 7,500 more are expected in the next two years, according to the CoStar Group, a real estate research firm.
But demand has shown no signs of slackening. And as long as there are plenty of upper-income renters looking for apartments, there is little incentive to build anything other than expensive units. As a result, there are in effect two separate rental markets that are so far apart in price that they have little impact on each other. In one extreme case, a glut of new luxury apartments in Washington has pushed high-end rents down, even while midrange rents continue to rise.
"Increasing the supply is not going to increase the number of affordable units; that is a complete and utter fallacy," said Jaimie Ross, the president of the Florida Housing Coalition. "People say if there really was a great need, the market would provide it; the market would correct itself. Well, the market has never corrected itself and it's only getting worse."
Money for affordable housing has dried up at a time when it is needed most. Federal housing funds, in a form now known as HOME grants, have been cut in half over the last decade. The percentage of eligible families who receive rental subsidies has shrunk, to 23.8 percent from 27.4 percent, the Harvard study found. And Florida, which like other states faced large budget shortfalls after the financial crisis, has raided its housing trust fund, funded by a real estate transfer tax, for several years running. This year, the Legislature has proposed restoring at least part of the money.
Cities have been left to address the problem on their own, with some granting exceptions to their own zoning laws to allow for things like micro-apartments. Miami has allowed some variances to its urban plan for projects like Brickell View Terrace, which will have 176 units in a prime location near a Metrorail station. Ninety of the units will be affordable for people making 60 percent of the median income, 10 for people making less, and the rest will be market rate.
But a seemingly insatiable demand for luxury condos in Miami, created in part by wealthy Latin Americans, has caused land prices to soar, making affordable housing projects harder to build anywhere close to downtown. Moving farther out is cheaper, but the cost savings on housing can be quickly wiped out by transportation costs. A 2012 study by the Center for Housing Policy found that Miami was the most expensive metropolitan area in the country when housing and transportation costs were combined.
In many markets, buying a home is considerably cheaper than renting, and Miami is no exception. But many people are shut out of buying because their income is too low, they don't qualify for a mortgage or they are burdened by other debt. In 2008, a quarter of rental applicants were still paying off student loans, according to CoreLogic, but as of last fall half of them were doing so.
Steve Gunn, 25, the marketing director for a Miami real estate brokerage firm, said he could certainly afford an apartment on his salary of $52,500 -- if he weren't paying more than $800 a month in student loan debt. Instead, he commutes 90 minutes to work. From his mother's house.

Abstract: At the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual spring meetings, concerns about crisis have given way to concerns about complacency. Underlying the discussions of inflation, interest rates, fiscal balance and trade policy among the assembled ministers were concerns about Ukraine, as news of pro-Russian activists seizing official buildings in the eastern part of the former Soviet republic sent jitters through the meetings.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- At the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual spring meetings, concerns about crisis have given way to concerns about complacency.
The euro zone has re-emerged from recession. Emerging-market jitters have quieted. The fiscal battles in the United States have abated. But the recovery remains fragile and in many cases, growth remains sluggish, leaving a jobs gap of 62 million.
"The overriding topic for discussion will be the topic of growth, quest for higher growth, better quality growth, more inclusive growth and sustainable growth," said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the fund, speaking with reporters on the eve of the weekend conference. "We need to act now."
Underlying the discussions of inflation, interest rates, fiscal balance and trade policy among the assembled ministers were concerns about Ukraine, as news of pro-Russian activists seizing official buildings in the eastern part of the former Soviet republic sent jitters through the meetings. Officials said they hoped that the situation would not escalate. But if it did, it might pose serious consequences to Europe's fragile recovery.
"We are monitoring the economic situation in Ukraine, mindful of any risks to economic and financial stability, and welcome the I.M.F.'s recent engagement with Ukraine," said a communiqué from the Group of 20, which consists of the world's biggest economies.
The fund is preparing a financial rescue package for Kiev that would come with stringent conditions, including tax increases and cuts in government spending. The package would be worth $14 billion to $18 billion, Ms. Lagarde said. The World Bank, the fund's sister organization, is also offering Ukraine billions in aid, with individual countries preparing bilateral packages, as well.
Finance ministers and central bankers also discussed the possibility of new penalties for Russia, said Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary. "There is broad and strong unity within the G-7 on increasing the sanctions and costs in response to escalating action from Russia," he said, referring to the Group of 7, meaning Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. "There was no dissent in the room that it was essential that there be unity in taking action if necessary."
On Monday, Mr. Lew plans to sign a declaration "moving forward" $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine.
At the meetings, the United States also took heated criticism for Congress's failure to agree to a 2010 reform package that would give emerging-market countries more say within the fund. The Obama administration has repeatedly urged leaders on Capitol Hill to ratify the package, which requires no new money from the United States, to no avail. "The end of the year for me is the final limit," said Guido Mantega, Brazil's finance minister, according to Reuters. "Four years waiting for me is just too much."
The Group of 20 gave a year-end deadline for Congress to act -- saying that at that point, the monetary fund might move on without the United States' assent. It gave no further details. "If the 2010 reforms are not ratified by year-end, we will call on the I.M.F. to build on its existing work and develop options for next steps," a communiqué said.
Much of the rest of the talks focused on creating jobs and strengthening growth now that the world has made its way out of crisis. "Short-term risks to the global economy have eased," said Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. "Increasingly, our worries are focused on the medium term. Our concern is that the pace of reform could be slowing in this postcrisis period. The focus must return urgently to the structural reform agenda. Even a small setback can result in leaving millions of families in destitution rather than escaping poverty."
With that, the conversation among the world's finance ministers and central bankers generally atomized into individual prescriptions for individual countries.
Growth has picked up in many rich countries, especially in the United States, and Europe has started growing again, too. But the Continent seems to have settled into a period of low inflation and low growth, with widespread concern that the will to make the major economic changes necessary for a stronger recovery might have faded along with the crisis.
"We remain concerned by inflation rates consistently below target and weak demand," Mr. Lew said. "More needs to be done to support growth and guard against further disinflation in the euro area."
The effect of Japan's major stimulus package -- called "Abenomics," after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- might also be waning. The I.M.F. cut its estimates of the country's growth shortly before the meetings. It has urged Tokyo to make structural reforms to bolster its labor market, by, for instance, bringing women into the work force.
At a meeting in Sydney at the end of February, members of the Group of 20 major economies -- which include rich countries like Canada and developing economies like Brazil and China -- agreed to commit to policies to increase growth. The specific target is to lift economic output 2 percent beyond its current trajectory over the coming five years.
Without policies to enhance growth and create jobs, inequality might intensify and tens of millions of workers might remain jobless.
"A massive global jobs gap which opened at the height of the financial crisis continues to widen and will do so in the years ahead unless growth both accelerates and is also job-rich," said Guy Ryder, the director general of the International Labor Organization. "Creating jobs and narrowing inequalities are essential."

Full text:   RETIREMENT is a financial obligation that today's younger generations are not handling well. That may be through no fault of their own -- they suffer from lower incomes, after being adjusted for inflation, and student debt that makes it a struggle to save. But regardless of the reason, the failure to save for retirement is setting up Americans in their 20s and early 30s for financially stressed golden years.
The statistics are startling: Only 43 percent of eligible workers under 25, and 62 percent of those between 25 and 34 participate in 401(k) plans, compared with 70 percent or more of those over 45. And the young contribute less -- 4.3 percent of income for those under 25 and 5.5 percent for ages 25 to 34. In contrast, Americans between 55 and 64 direct 8.7 percent of their incomes to these plans.
Skimpy retirement assets might be manageable if they were being offset by other wealth accumulation. But that hasn't happened. In fact, adjusted for inflation, members of Gen Y -- those born after 1980 -- are poorer than their parents were at similar ages.
We should address this looming crisis via a radical restructuring of our retirement plans, including mandated savings.
While the saving problem may be acute for young people, it's hardly limited to them. After rising during the financial crisis, the overall savings rate of Americans has once again declined to paltry levels. For those who have saved and invested in equities, the surge in stock market prices since the recession ended has helped, which has pushed up the value of retirement holdings.
But in an unfortunate irony, many millennials, who watched share prices collapse in 2008, then steered clear of the market, thereby missing out on its rise. Typically, these young Americans keep about half of their portfolios in cash -- not a sensible long-term investment strategy.
Earlier this year, to take a stab at addressing the retirement issue, President Obama proposed a new form of Individual Retirement Account that would allow Americans with household incomes below $191,000 to put aside money that would accumulate tax free. Unfortunately, the Obama idea is only a symbolic and inadequate gesture. For one thing, its cap of $5,500 per year is too small, and it lacks automatic enrollment or mandatory employer-contribution.
For another, contributions would initially be invested at low Treasury rates. Younger workers should be investing mostly in equities, which, over time, should provide higher returns.
Under the Obama plan, when an individual's account reached $15,000, funds would be moved into an investment offering from the private sector, which would confront people with the same daunting and unfamiliar choices that face holders of 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts.
A better idea, but still offering only marginal improvement, is the one proposed annually by the president and ignored annually by Congress: requiring employers who do not provide 401(k) programs to offer automatic enrollment in I.R.A.s.
I'd love to see the restoration of defined benefit pensions, which combined automatic saving and sensible, long-term investment strategies. But that's not going to happen. So at the least, we should take the responsibility for managing retirement funds away from ill-equipped individuals.
To that end, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, has proposed a plan that would offer a more certain retirement benefit than existing individual plans provide, together with automatic enrollment, universal coverage, portability from employer to employer and professional management.
However, Senator Harkin's plan has its own flaws -- it doesn't require any employer participation, and participants would be allowed to reduce their contributions or opt out entirely.
The best solution would take up the question of mandated savings. I understand that in today's world of stagnant incomes, forced savings mean less money for individuals to spend now. But would we seriously prefer that our children become impoverished senior citizens? The approach I like is Australia's superannuation program, which requires that 9 percent of workers' pay be diverted into retirement accounts. Tax incentives are also provided, to encourage additional deposits.
The superannuation funds collectively have $1.7 trillion in investment assets. Adjusted for population, that's the equivalent of $25 trillion for the United States, over twice what Americans have parked in 401(k)s and I.R.A.s. That's an idea worth considering.
Young Americans are on track to be worse off in retirement than their parents. Let's not just sit by and watch that happen.

Abstract: Worse, future growth is likely to be lopsided, because the foundation for broad prosperity is arguably the weakest it has been since World War II. According to the latest census data, nearly 16 percent of those in their mid-20s to mid-30s were in poverty in 2012, compared with just above 10 percent of Gen Xers in 2000 and baby boomers in 1980.

Full text:   The Federal Reserve, increasingly optimistic about the economy, is dialing back its stimulus efforts. The International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast for growth in the United States. Congress has long since reduced aid to the economy, with many lawmakers, mostly Republicans, adamant that the economy is better off with less government involvement.
The official line is clear: The worst is over, and recovery has given way to expansion.
But that's not the whole story. Economic gains so far have mostly benefited those at the top of the income and wealth ladder. Worse, future growth is likely to be lopsided, because the foundation for broad prosperity is arguably the weakest it has been since World War II.
Take, for example, Americans age 25 to 34, the leading edge of the so-called millennials, the generation born in the 1980s and 1990s. They are worse off than Gen Xers (born from the mid-1960s to the late-1970s) were at that age and the baby boomers before them by nearly every economic measure -- employment, income, student loan indebtedness, mobility, homeownership and other hallmarks of "household formation," like moving out on their own, getting married and having children.
This group had the bad luck of entering the work force in the depressed and slow-growth years that started when the recession hit in 2007. Instead of spending the crucial early years of their work lives laying the groundwork for a solid economic future, many of them have struggled with unemployment and underemployment, and many have fallen so far behind where they would hope to be that recovering lost ground may well be impossible.
According to the latest census data, nearly 16 percent of those in their mid-20s to mid-30s were in poverty in 2012, compared with just above 10 percent of Gen Xers in 2000 and baby boomers in 1980. Nearly 14 percent of that age group were living with their parents in 2013, a higher percentage than in previous generations. And of those living at home, 43 percent (2.5 million people) would be counted as being in poverty if they were on their own. Only 38 percent of those who were on their own were homeowners, compared with 46 percent from this age group who were on their own in 2000.
The median household income of this age group -- $51,381 in 2012 -- is nearly $8,000 less than the median for the same age group in 2000 and virtually unchanged from 1980, adjusted for inflation. The older millennials are also less likely to move; in 2013, only 20 percent of people in their mid-20s to mid-30s had relocated recently, compared with 27 percent who were the same age in 2000 and 26 percent in 1980.
Some of the trends in the latest data were evident before the recession, especially stagnating wages, delayed marriage and later childbearing. But the poor economy has intensified those conditions. For instance, in a study by the Pew Research Center of the entire millennial generation, 74 percent were unmarried; many of them said they wanted to marry but lacked the economic wherewithal. Even among those age 25 to 34, only 44 percent were married in 2013, compared with 55 percent in 2000 and 66 percent in 1980.
These patterns should not come as a shock. Evidence and experience from before the recession show that starting one's work life in a poor economy can translate into lower earnings and less career attainment over a lifetime.
What is shocking is that despite the known danger and despite the prolonged bad economy, more government resources have not been used to prevent and reverse such a huge waste of human capital. Instead, public resources for job creation and even for unemployment benefits have been too little and too late, if available at all.
Another shocker is that those in the 25-to-34 age group are the best educated cohort in American history, with more than a third having a bachelor's degree or higher. Education is important. But clearly, education alone does not create jobs and opportunities that lead to prosperity. For that, a fair and functional economy is needed -- one in which the government plays a robust role, alongside consumers and businesses, to promote full employment and to ensure a just distribution of gains.
Americans who began their careers in the teeth of the recession are not the only ones bearing economic scars. Younger millennials are not appreciably better off than their older peers, though they have not yet lost as much ground. At the other end of the spectrum, many older Americans who lost jobs and assets in the recession also face an uncertain future.
Certain sectors of the economy, especially the financial markets, are indeed turning a corner. But true prosperity is impossible when the productive potential of young adults is being squandered.

Better Insurance Against Inequality

Abstract: There have been big increases in taxes on the rich in the past, but he points out that these tax increases were put in place only in response to wars -- specifically, World War I and World War II. Taxes should be indexed to income inequality so that they automatically become more progressive -- meaning that the marginal tax rate for the highest-income people will rise -- if income inequality becomes much worse.

Full text:   Paying taxes is rarely pleasant, but as April 15 approaches it's worth remembering that our tax system is a progressive one and serves a little-noticed but crucial purpose: It mitigates some of the worst consequences of income inequality.
If any of us, as individuals, are unfortunate enough to have income drop significantly, the tax on that income will plummet as well -- and a direct payment, or negative tax, might even be received from the government, thanks to the earned-income tax credit. In this way, the tax system can be viewed as a colossal insurance system, guarding against extreme income inequality. There are similar provisions in other countries.
But it's also clear that while income inequality would be much worse without our current tax system, what we have isn't nearly enough. It's time -- past time, actually -- to tweak the system so that it can respond effectively if income inequality becomes more extreme.
I made this argument in 2003 in my book "The New Financial Order" (Princeton University Press). And now there is substantial evidence that inequality has been rising rapidly. In his monumental new book, "Capital in the 21st Century" (Belknap Press), Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics documents a sharp increase in such inequality over the last 25 years, not only in the United States, but also in Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, China, India, Indonesia and South Africa, with people with the highest incomes far outstripping the rest of society. The book is impressive in its wealth of information but it is short on solutions.
Professor Piketty talks about instituting a "global tax on capital" but acknowledges that it is a utopian idea and says that "it is hard to imagine the nations of the world agreeing on any such thing anytime soon." He talks about raising the rate of the top tax brackets and raising inheritance taxes but sees "little reason for optimism" that this will happen. There have been big increases in taxes on the rich in the past, but he points out that these tax increases were put in place only in response to wars -- specifically, World War I and World War II.
Let's try not to have another major war. Instead, there are some positive things we can do now. As I said in my 2003 book, it would be wise to start amending the tax system immediately. I suggested this fundamental reform: Taxes should be indexed to income inequality so that they automatically become more progressive -- meaning that the marginal tax rate for the highest-income people will rise -- if income inequality becomes much worse. Ian Ayres of Yale and Aaron Edlin of the University of California, Berkeley, made a similar argument in 2011 in The New York Times.
There is a practical reason for starting now. If we wait until income inequality is much more severe, we will have a whole class of new superrich who will probably feel entitled to their wealth and will have the means to defend their interest. That's already gone far enough. We shouldn't let it become more extreme.
There is also a theoretical reason. It is what the psychologists Yaacov Trope of New York University and Nira Liberman of Tel Aviv University called temporal construal theory. They showed that people are more idealistic and generous when dealing hypothetically with the distant future than they are about actions they need to take today. That's why it pays to ask people to decide on measures to uphold egalitarian ideals when they don't have to cough up the money immediately.
In a draft research paper in 2006, Leonard Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center; Jeffrey Rohaly, also of the policy center, and I analyzed a kind of inequality-indexed tax system. (We called it the "Rising-Tide Tax System.") With the benefit of hindsight, we came up with a system that could have been put in place in 1979 -- when inequality was much milder in the United States -- and that could have prevented any increase in after-tax inequality through 2006.
Though our proposal worked in theory, we found that putting it into effect would encounter difficulties. For the system to be effective, the top tax bracket would have had to rise to well over 75 percent -- a political nonstarter, in our view. We also believed that there would have been negative economic effects, including more tax avoidance. So we concluded that the proposal wasn't ready for advocacy. We held off from finishing and publishing that paper.
Today, though, there are some possibilities that might alleviate, at least partially, any increasing inequality in future years.
In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee last month, Mr. Burman proposed a version of inequality indexing that might be politically acceptable today. His idea was to integrate inequality indexing with inflation indexing: Instead of just linking tax brackets to inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index, as we have done for years, he proposed that the adjustments also take account of rising inequality, if it occurred. He proposed a system to offset the loss in tax revenue that inflation indexing would produce, in a way that would get us closer to a target distribution of after-tax income; if inequality worsened, higher tax brackets would bear a bit more of the burden, and people at the bottom would bear less.
A relatively minor change like this should be politically acceptable. It is a reframing of inflation indexing, which is already a sacrosanct principle, and would be revenue-neutral. By 2025, Mr. Burman argued, it could pay for a doubling of the earned-income tax credit, "with more than $100 billion left over to adjust middle-income tax liabilities."
Such a plan would be a nice first step toward making our tax system manage the risk of future increases in inequality.

Nasdaq Falls Below 4,000 as Wall Street Sell-Off Continues

Full text:   Stocks slid in a volatile session on Friday, pushing the Nasdaq below the 4,000 mark for the first time since early February.
Selling accelerated late in the afternoon; the biotech and other fast-growing sectors again led the Nasdaq sharply lower. Disappointing earnings from JPMorgan Chase also gave investors a reason to sell some bank stocks.
For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.6 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 3.1 percent, the biggest weekly decline for both indexes since June 2012.
"Today's decline is what we've been seeing all week. The weakness in the biotech and momentum names is getting investors worried about where the market is headed in the near term, eventually triggering a sell-off in everything," said Robert G.

"Our long-term outlook on the market hasn't changed because if you understand why the market is selling off, you know it's not rational, that it doesn't make sense," he added.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 143.47 points, or 0.89 percent, to 16,026.75. The S.&P. 500 lost 17.39 points, or 0.95 percent, falling to 1,815.69.
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 54.37 points, or 1.34 percent, to 3,999.73. The Nasdaq composite fell below 4,000 for the first time since early February. Many former market darlings are now down substantially from records reached only six or seven weeks ago.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase fell 3.66 percent, or $2.10, to $55.30. The stock was the biggest drag on the S.&P. 500 after the bank reported a far weaker-than-expected quarterly profit because of falling revenue from securities trading.
The Nasdaq biotech index fell 2.84 percent after rising as much as 1 percent earlier. The Global X social media index, which includes Facebook and LinkedIn, slid 2.3 percent. Facebook shares fell 1.06 percent, to $58.53. LinkedIn shares fell 2.48 percent, to $165.78.
In contrast to the day's sharp downturn, shares of Wells Fargo rose 0.78 percent, to $48.08, after the bank -- the biggest mortgage lender in the United States -- reported a 14 percent increase in first-quarter net profit.
Shares of Herbalife sold off late in the day after The Financial Times reported that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. had begun an investigation into the company. The stock tumbled 13.97 percent, to $51.48.
The latest economic data showed that consumers felt more optimistic as April got underway. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary April reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 82.6, the highest since July, as both current conditions and expectations brightened.
The seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index for final demand increased 0.5 percent last month, the largest increase in nine months, pointing to some pockets of inflation at the factory gate.
In the bond market, interest rates declined. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell slightly, to 2.63 percent from 2.65 percent late Thursday, while its price rose 5/32, to 101 2/32.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Each of the three previous presidents -- two Republicans, one Democrat -- signed an increase in the federal minimum wage.
Why not President Obama?
Given Mr. Obama's emphasis on income inequality, and the popularity of an increase in opinion polls, you would think he would. But the story of recent increases underscores the indispensable ingredient he so far lacks: a Republican leader strongly motivated to make a deal over the party's philosophical objections.
In 1989, it was a new Republican in the White House. President George Bush, while campaigning to succeed Ronald Reagan, had promised "a kinder, gentler America." The Democrats then controlling both houses of Congress set out to take him up on it.
Mr. Bush drove a hard bargain on the minimum wage. He vetoed the first version Congress sent on grounds that it raised the wage by 30 cents an hour too much. But he eventually accepted a two-stage increase to $4.25 an hour on the condition that lawmakers include a lower "training wage" for teenagers.
In 1996, it was a new Republican Senate leader. Trent Lott took over after Bob Dole, then running for president against the incumbent Democrat, Bill Clinton, resigned his Senate seat.
Mr. Clinton, who had battled fiercely with the House speaker, Newt Gingrich, and Mr. Dole, emerged with the upper hand after a government shutdown. Mr. Lott sought to get the legislative wheels turning again to help Republicans preserve their Senate majority in that November's elections.
"The thing that was completely balled up in the spokes was the minimum wage," Mr. Lott, now a lobbyist, recalled in an interview. So he shepherded a two-stage rise to $5.15 an hour that included some tax breaks for businesses.
Mr. Lott got what he wanted. Two days after signing the minimum-wage increase, Mr. Clinton signed a separate compromise overhauling the welfare system. Republicans added two seats to their Senate majority in November.
Eleven years later, President George W. Bush was the Republican in need. Raising the minimum wage did not come naturally to Mr. Bush, who promoted a more conservative, market-oriented economic agenda than his father.
But by 2007, he had suffered grievous political damage from setbacks in the Iraq war and his administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina. Democrats, who had recaptured both houses of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections, set out to end the longest period without a minimum wage increase since its inception during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
"We were getting jammed," said Tony Fratto, then a White House aide. Mr. Bush ultimately accepted a two-stage increase to $7.25 an hour as part of a bill to finance his most urgent priority, the Iraq war.
Now Mr. Obama seeks a Republican partner. The minimum wage remains at $7.25 -- in inflation-adjusted terms, more than $2 below where it stood 40 years ago.
But there is little sign that any critical mass of Republicans wants to make it happen, much less Speaker John A. Boehner or the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell.
Their position does not surprise Democrats in Congress and the White House. National polling and midterm election geography point toward a larger House Republican majority, and perhaps a new majority in the Senate.
Republicans see more to lose among conservative core supporters and business donors with a wage increase than there might be to gain among swing voters who may not show up at the polls. Midterm election turnout is sure to be much lower than in a presidential year.
"They believe they'll recapture the majority," said Ed Pagano, who recently left a White House job as Senate liaison for Mr. Obama. "Why would they want to upset the status quo?"
Republicans cite substantive reasons for holding back, too. Since the labor market is still soft and the economic recovery tepid, Republicans say they remain concerned about job losses from a higher minimum wage.
At the same time, many of the most populous states -- including New York, California, New Jersey, Illinois and Ohio -- have raised the minimum wage on their own. Although Mr. Obama has encouraged that trend, it paradoxically lessens the urgency of his call for Congress to act.
"The administration imagines a pressure on Republicans that simply does not exist," said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. "It may exist in their coalition, but not ours."
The Democratic coalition itself represents another political obstacle. In presidential years, Mr. Obama's party relies heavily on young voters, minorities and unmarried women, all of whom would be disproportionately affected by a minimum-wage increase.
The need to persuade more of those voters to turn out for this fall's midterm elections encourages Democratic leaders to hold out for the president's requested $2.85-an-hour increase rather than compromise, while pushing state-level minimum-wage ballot measures.
The White House could yet succeed in bludgeoning Republican lawmakers to give in. If Mr. Obama can inch up poll ratings for himself and for his health care law, Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell -- who is up for re-election in Kentucky -- may find accomplishing something with a Democratic president as useful as Mr. Lott and Mr. Gingrich once did.
If the White House does not succeed, Mr. Obama could yet find a different, postelection path to a minimum-wage increase.
The common thread of the last three wage increases is a president of one party forging agreement with a Congress controlled by the other. "Our system works best" for bipartisan compromise with that alignment, Mr. Fratto said.
If Republicans emerge in 2015 with control of both the House and the Senate, they might even find a motivation to make a deal.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- There is a commodity creating ravenous demand among China's growing consumer class, one whose pricing is so important that it influences the Chinese central bank's monetary policy. The commerce ministry even maintains strategic reserves and has been piling them higher in recent weeks in an attempt to stabilize prices.
Pork prices, that is.
Fresh, chilled and frozen; salted, smoked and brined; chops, bellies, rumps, feet -- nobody consumes pigs like the Chinese. The country accounts for about half of the 109 million tons of pork that will be produced and eaten globally this year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.
Now, one company is trying to marry China's apparently insatiable demand for the meat with the efficiency of American pork production. On Thursday, the Chinese pork company that bought Smithfield Foods, America's biggest pork producer, formally began an attempt to raise as much as 41.2 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $5.3 billion, by listing the enlarged business in Hong Kong.
When Shuanghui International paid $4.7 billion in cash for Smithfield last year, it was the biggest buyout ever of an American company by a Chinese company. The combined business has since been renamed WH Group, and its initial public offering would be the largest in the world since that of a Brazilian insurer, BB Seguridade Participacoes, in April 2013.
With the deal, WH Group is betting that it can take advantage of lower costs in the United States. Despite the tremendous size of China's pork market and the lower cost of labor, China greatly lags the United States in the efficiency with which it can produce the meat.
"Costs in the U.S. are 60 percent of China's; in the beginning I thought that was counterintuitive," Wu Shangzhi, chairman of the Chinese private equity group CDH Investments, said in January at an investment forum in Hong Kong. CDH bought a minority stake in Shuanghui in 2006 alongside Goldman Sachs and today is the biggest single shareholder of WH Group, with a 38 percent stake before the I.P.O., according to the company's preliminary listing document.
Mr. Wu told the forum he had been struck by the opportunity to export pork from the United States. Average hog prices in China were 1.65 times as high as those in the United States from 2010 to 2012, according to WH's stock exchange filings.
"During the Cultural Revolution I went to the countryside," Mr. Wu said. "I raised my pig in the backyard. The cost was zero to me at that time. But times change. In an integrated global economy the comparative advantage certainly points in a different direction."
WH also wants to leverage the Smithfield acquisition in an operational way, to increase the efficiency of its slaughtering plants in China. Last year, the company's utilization rate at its Chinese slaughtering plants was only 72 percent of their capacity. In the United States, the comparable rate at Smithfield's plants was 97 percent, according to WH's listing document.
Pork costs more in China because feed grain prices are higher and hogs are raised on a much smaller scale than in the United States. In the United States, farms with an annual production of 3,000 hogs or more account for about 83 percent of overall production. In China, such large-scale hog farms account for only about 2.5 percent of the country's production.
At the same time, worsening soil and water pollution and rising urbanization rates are threatening China's supply of arable land for growing hog feed, which contributes to increasingly volatile pork prices. Food safety scandals remain an almost daily concern for ordinary Chinese, and the domestic pork industry has been no exception.
Securing a safe and stable supply of pork and closely monitoring prices have become important tasks for policy makers in China. Pork is a major component of consumer price inflation there, and as such, it is a factor that affects how the country's central bank sets monetary policy.
Domestic hog prices have fallen about 50 percent in the last two months, according to a report on Monday on China's central television broadcaster. This is easing inflationary pressures in China, giving policy makers more room to provide liquidity to other struggling areas of the economy as growth falls to its slowest pace in over a decade -- for now, at least.
"Ample pig stocks suggest that pork prices, the most important determinant of food inflation, are likely to remain weak over the coming months," Qinwei Wang and Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economists at Britain's Capital Economics, wrote in a research note this week. "Beyond that, the outlook is less promising. Pig farmers, many of whom are making losses at current prices, have begun to cut pig numbers, which suggests that a rebound in pork prices late this year is possible."
In recent months, local ministry of commerce officials across China's interior provinces have been seizing on falling hog prices to increase the country's strategic reserves of chilled and frozen pork. But because such reserves are generally tiny when compared with China's overall consumption of the meat, and because frozen pork lasts only for several months, the commerce ministry's buying tends not to have a major effect on domestic pork price trends.
Despite the opportunities, WH Group faces a number of challenges. For one, it is heavily indebted from the money it borrowed to acquire Smithfield last year. WH's total debt rose from $194 million at the end of 2012 to $7.4 billion at the end of last year as a result of the deal. The proceeds from the I.P.O., which is expected to value the company at $15.1 billion to $21.2 billion, will help pay that down, but the most the company stands to pocket would be $4.2 billion. Anything else would go to existing shareholders who are selling.
The term sheet was unclear on which shareholders were selling. In addition to CDH Investments, Goldman Sachs and the company's management, WH's other big shareholders include the Singapore state investor, Temasek Holdings, and New Horizon Capital, a private equity firm co-founded by the son of the former Chinese prime minister Wen Jiabao.
Another complicating factor is China's recent record of food safety scandals, which have made the public increasingly wary of domestic meat, produce and other foodstuffs -- and spurred regulators to action. In 2011, reports in the local Chinese media accused one of WH's factories of sourcing hogs whose feed included clenbuterol hydrochloride, an adrenal nervous stimulant known as "lean meat powder" in China, but which is banned in the country. The company closed the plant for more than two months for inspections but found no traces of the adulterant. Still, WH says, sales slumped that year.
More recently, Chinese regulators have imposed temporary restrictions on the importation of live hogs from the United States because of an outbreak of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus that started to take hold among American pigs last year. Media reports this month said that China would suspend imports of such hogs until stricter testing protocols are developed, a move that applies only to live animals, not meat.
WH must also wean itself off the use of an adulterant that is widespread in the United States but banned in China. Ractopamine, a feed additive that makes meat leaner, is currently used in more than 80 percent of hogs raised in the United States and has been said to increase instances of injury among live pigs. WH plans to reduce its use of the chemical, but the company warns that the transition will increase costs that may not be recouped.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: While Ms. Yellen and her allies see evidence that the supply of workers remains much larger than the demand for their services, a few Fed officials -- and a number of prominent economists outside the Fed -- say the labor market is nearing a new equilibrium, implying the Fed should wind down its stimulus campaign more quickly or risk higher inflation.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- When the Federal Reserve changed the guidelines for its stimulus campaign last month, it did not change its commitment to supporting the economy, according to an account of the decision that the Fed published on Wednesday.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's new chairwoman, convened a secret meeting in early March to discuss the shift, the Fed disclosed on Wednesday. Two weeks later, at their regularly scheduled policy-making session, officials voted to replace a specific focus on a target for unemployment with a longer list of less specific objectives. Officials fretted that the decision would be misunderstood, but they concluded the change was necessary and the moment opportune.
The account, released after a standard three-week delay, reinforces other efforts by Fed officials to play down the significance of the March shift. And investors, at first flustered by the change and Ms. Yellen's initial explanation, appear to have accepted the Fed's assurances. Interest rates that rose immediately after the March announcement continued to retrace those changes Wednesday; the stock market also took off after the minutes were released at 2 p.m.
The Fed is dialing back its stimulus campaign as it gains confidence in the strength of the economic recovery. At the March meeting, it reduced its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, to $55 billion, and indicated that it planned to continue cutting back at the same pace, ending the purchases this fall.
It also replaced its previous guidance on short-term interest rates -- that it would keep rates near zero well past the time that the unemployment rate, 6.7 percent in March, fell below 6.5 percent -- with a vaguer commitment to a particular jobless threshold and an explicit reminder of its stated goal of pushing inflation higher so that it is close to its goal of a sustained 2 percent annual pace.
The account said most officials on the Federal Open Market Committee were increasingly optimistic about the growth of the economy, viewing weakness in recent months as a result of bad weather. Officials regard the new guidance as a less powerful but more accurate description of their plans, which will be highly influenced by how the economy actually performs in coming months.
"As the Fed becomes more convinced of the economic acceleration this spring and thereafter, the committee's forward guidance has become decidedly less Odyssean," Michael Dolega, a TD Bank economist, wrote Wednesday. "The F.O.M.C. appears far less willing to publicly commit to a future action or tie itself to the mast."
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the policy consensus concealed the fragmented internal debate about other critical questions. "Beyond the broad agreement to continue tapering the pace of asset purchases and the dropping of the 6.5 percent threshold," he wrote in an email Wednesday, "committee members disagree on just about everything else."
Officials disagree, for example, about the extent of slack in the labor market, a debate that continued at the March meeting. While Ms. Yellen and her allies see evidence that the supply of workers remains much larger than the demand for their services, a few Fed officials -- and a number of prominent economists outside the Fed -- say the labor market is nearing a new equilibrium, implying the Fed should wind down its stimulus campaign more quickly or risk higher inflation.
Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and one of Ms. Yellen's main allies, said in an interview on Wednesday that he was frustrated by the persistence of concerns about inflation at a time when the immediate problem is a lack of inflation.
"I'm not quite sure why we would want to raise interest rates with 1 percent inflation no matter what the unemployment rate is," Mr. Evans said.
Officials also disagree about the health of financial markets. Some officials see growing risks to financial stability, including a downward trend in risk premiums, while a majority continues to see those risks as modest and secondary.
Fed officials expressed satisfaction in the weeks before the March meeting that investors seemed to share their expectations about the evolution of monetary policy, including a view that the Fed was most likely to start raising interest rates in the second half of 2015, assuming that growth fulfilled their expectations.
In the account, some officials worried the change in guidance would disrupt that mutual understanding. The pressure to move had also eased somewhat. The unemployment rate, which fell steadily last year, has flattened out in recent months. Labor force participation increased in March, and if that trend continues, it may be some time before unemployment falls below the 6.5 percent threshold.
According to the account, they hoped to set the issue at rest by appending a single sentence to the end of the longest policy statement the Fed has ever issued: "The change in the committee's guidance does not indicate any change in the committee's policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements," it said.
Still, Fed officials were aware that their own policy forecasts were likely to increase the confusion, as their combined predictions showed a modest increase in the likelihood that the Fed would start to raise rates in the first half of 2015. Ms. Yellen then appeared to reinforce that shift at her inaugural news conference, an impression that she and other Fed officials have since sought to dispel.
The Fed also has sought to shape investor expectations in recent months by emphasizing that it intends to raise interest rates slowly, as it did during its most recent tightening cycle. Beginning in 2004, it raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point at 17 consecutive policy meetings.
Some experts have since argued that the Fed moved too slowly, and that changes in monetary policy often need to be sharp rather than gradual. That view gained traction among Fed officials immediately after the 2007-8 financial crisis, when it seemed that it might be necessary to unwind the Fed's stimulus campaign quickly to keep inflation under control.
But the pendulum has swung back to the slow-and-steady approach, reflecting the Fed's assessment that the weakness of the economy remains its primary concern.
"Just a few years ago, many forecasters -- in and out of the Federal Reserve -- were projecting growth rates at an annualized rate of 4 percent or greater for at least a year. That expectation raised the question of whether a reasonably rapid tightening in monetary policy might at some point be needed," Daniel K. Tarullo, a member of the Fed's board, said in a Wednesday evening speech to an economic conference.
Given the sluggish pace of growth, he continued, "it seems less likely that we will experience a growth spurt in the next couple of years that would engender concerns about rapid wage pressures and changes in inflation expectations."

Full text:   Federal safety regulators fined General Motors $28,000 on Tuesday, saying it had not provided much of the information requested for an investigation into a recall of about 2.6 million cars with an ignition switch defect that G.M. has linked to 13 deaths.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on March 4 demanded answers to 107 questions related to why G.M. waited until February to start recalling the cars, even though it had been alerted to the problem as early as 2001. The cars contain a faulty ignition switch that is prone to turn off while driving, shutting off the engine and disabling the air bags.
The deadline for that information was April 3.
The agency fined General Motors $7,000 for each day it did not provide the information, the maximum allowed, with the current total being $28,000.
"This penalty will continue to accrue by $7,000 for each additional day," the agency told G.M. in a letter.
The $7,000 maximum penalty has been in effect since November 2012, when it was increased from $6,000 to account for inflation.
Unless the automaker provides the information immediately, the agency said it might refer the matter to the Justice Department for a civil action to "compel" compliance.
The company defended its response.
"General Motors has produced nearly 21,000 documents totaling over 271,000 pages through a production process that spans a decade and over five million documents from 75 individual custodians and additional sources," Greg A. Martin, a company spokesman, wrote by email.
Mr. Martin said G.M. had "fully cooperated with the agency to help it have a full understanding of the facts."
The safety agency said in its letter that "G.M. did not respond to over a third of the requests" and also failed "to answer under oath as required."
The agency said that it had agreed to give G.M. additional time to answer some technical questions but that there were many other questions that the automaker should have answered by the deadline.
For example, the agency said it wanted to know if G.M. had changed the design of the switch at any time other than in 2006. "It is deeply troubling that two months after recalling the vehicles G.M. is unwilling or unable to tell N.H.T.S.A. whether the design of the switch changed at any other time," the agency said.
It also said that G.M. had said it did not fully respond because of its internal investigation into the issue. But such an investigation "is irrelevant to G.M.'s legal obligation to timely respond," the agency said.
Mr. Martin said that the investigation mentioned in the letter was looking for information the agency wanted.

Full text:   What happened to the I.M.F.?
Stay with me. Don't go. This is not another column about global financial bureaucracy.
To suffering government officials from developing countries who have knocked on its door seeking cash over the years, the abbreviation for the International Monetary Fund has long been understood to mean "It's Mostly Fiscal" -- a play on the lending institution's single-minded focus on spending cuts.
As guarantor of global economic stability, the I.M.F. long defined success narrowly: sustained growth, low inflation and a balanced budget. The distribution of income, its many critics charged, ranked far too low on its list of interests, if it appeared at all.
But lately the fund's definition of success has broadened. Last week I interviewed the I.M.F.'s managing director, Christine Lagarde, ahead of its spring meetings in Washington this week, which are held in conjunction with the World Bank.
"I hear people say, 'Why do you bother about inequality? It is not the core mandate.' Well, sorry, it is also part of the mandate," Ms. Lagarde told me. "Our mandate is financial stability. Anything that is likely to rock the boat financially and macroeconomically is within our mandate."
The new emphasis is hugely important. The International Monetary Fund is the standard-bearer of the so-called Washington Consensus, promoting open markets, small government and limited regulation as the secret sauce of success for the developing world -- however the fruits of this success happened to be distributed.
Its new leanings suggest the emergence of perhaps a new consensus: Economic policy cannot be only about promoting low inflation and robust growth. Healthy, stable economies also depend on a reasonably equitable distribution of the rewards.
Ms. Lagarde rejects the notion that the I.M.F. didn't care about income distribution before. She noted that over the last two decades the institution has put emphasis on ensuring that its programs don't hurt the neediest. The fund's own research concludes that its programs have increased spending on education and health in poor countries.
Still, she acknowledges that the I.M.F. is paying more attention now. "Because inequality rose, we had to look at it more carefully and look at whether rising inequality in those societies in the postcrisis period in particular was relevant for the macroeconomic analysis that we do."
The I.M.F.'s new interest in income distribution meshes with a spate of seemingly unorthodox positions coming from the fund and some of its experts since the financial crisis of 2008. It has come to support some controls on cross-border capital flows. Its research has argued in favor of fiscal stimulus, pointing out its positive impacts on economic growth.
In the latest edition of the World Economic Outlook, the fund subtly makes the case that inflation in the United States and other developed nations should be higher to help pull the world economy out of its morass.
But the newfound attention to income inequality isn't just another facet of a more liberal, Keynesian economic worldview. The fund's economists have been producing research that suggests that inequality could make the world economy less stable.
Ms. Lagarde echoes an I.M.F. staff paper issued in January, which suggested that policies recommended by the fund should also be judged for their impact on inequality. "Income inequality can be of macroeconomic concern for country authorities, and the fund should accordingly seek to understand the macroeconomic effects of inequality," it says.
Jonathan D. Ostry, the I.M.F.'s deputy head of research, and Andrew Berg, another economist at the fund, published a study three years ago suggesting that inequality makes growth less durable: The average stretch of robust growth among relatively equitable industrial countries lasted more than 24 years. In Africa, a much more unequal place, the average was less than 14 years.
A flatter distribution of income, the study concluded, contributes more to sustainable economic growth than the quality of a country's political institutions, its foreign debt and openness to trade, its foreign investment and whether its exchange rate is competitive.
Earlier this year Mr. Ostry, Mr. Berg and another fund economist, Charalambos G. Tsangarides, published another study about the relationship between inequality, redistribution and growth, in which they took on the argument that what hamstrings growth is not inequality, but government efforts to redistribute income in unequal societies.
"Redistribution can cut both ways," Mr. Ostry told me. "If the government safety net is going to rule out the really bad outcomes, I might take more risk and thus help the economy grow. But if the government is going to take away my wealth if I take risks, then I won't take the risks."
Mr. Ostry and his colleagues found in the data that efforts at redistribution were generally benign. Extreme efforts at redistribution might hamper growth, but even then the pro-growth effects of greater equality cancel out its growth-slowing impact.
And while the links between inequality, redistribution and stability may be hard to pin down with certainty, they are not hard to imagine.
Deep inequality breeds resentment and political instability, discouraging investment. It can lead to political polarization and gridlock, as it cleaves the political system between the interests of the haves and the have-nots. And it can make it more difficult for governments to deal with brewing crises and economic imbalances.
Work by Carol Graham and Soumya Chattopadhyay at the Brookings Institution finds that recent episodes of unrest around the world, including the Arab Spring, Brazilian street protests and the uprising in Ukraine, were fueled not by the poor but by a middle class frustrated by a lack of opportunity to progress further.
It would be a mistake "to focus on growth and let inequality take care of itself," Mr. Ostry and colleagues wrote, "not only because inequality may be ethically undesirable but also because the resulting growth may be low and unsustainable."
The I.M.F.'s new emphasis could make a difference for the fund's clients. Mexico, where I grew up, was run for much of the 1980s under the aegis of some agreement or other with the fund, aimed at restoring the country's finances and preventing a default on its foreign debt.
It is a period known to Mexicans as "the lost decade." Public payrolls were culled. Unemployment soared. Wages collapsed. Poverty jumped.
And Mexico's lopsided distribution of income got worse. According to the World Bank, the share of income taken by the top 10 percent of Mexicans rose to 40 percent in 1992, from 35 percent in 1984. The portion of the pie going to the poorest tenth shrank to 1.6 percent, from 1.9 percent.
An analysis published last year by economists in the I.M.F.'s fiscal affairs department concluded that efforts to curb budget deficits increase inequality, especially if they take the form of spending cuts. It suggested that targeted government spending and progressive taxes could offset some of these effects.
Ms. Lagarde said the fund was taking this new awareness to heart. "When a country member asks for help and we design together with that country a program, we have that in mind," she said. "When we redesign energy subsidies with that country, we have that in mind. When we try to put in place a social safety net for the poor, we have that in mind. When we recommend better financing of pension schemes, we have that in mind."
The world may be a safer place for it.

Abstract: "For the past five years the emerging market and developing economies have been shouldering the burden of recovery, accounting for 75 percent of the increase in global growth since 2009," said Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund's managing director, speaking in Washington last week.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The rich countries whose property bubbles and collapsing banks plunged the world into recession in 2009 are now helping to lead the still-halting recovery out of it.
That is the view from the International Monetary Fund's latest forecast, released as economic and financial leaders from around the world are gathering here in Washington for the annual spring meetings of the fund and the World Bank.
"The recovery is strengthening," Olivier Blanchard, the fund's chief economist, said at a generally upbeat news conference on Tuesday.
As growth has slackened in the big emerging economies, it has strengthened in rich countries, the fund said, especially in the United States. It now sees the world economy as growing about 3.6 percent this year and 3.9 percent next year, up from 3 percent in 2013. That is down slightly from its early forecast in January, when it predicted the world economy would grow about 3.7 percent this year.
"For the past five years the emerging market and developing economies have been shouldering the burden of recovery, accounting for 75 percent of the increase in global growth since 2009," said Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund's managing director, speaking in Washington last week. "The recovery is finally becoming a bit more balanced, in an overall economic landscape that has changed significantly."
The forecast is one of the sunniest that the fund has offered since the global recession. But it warned that growth, in many cases, remained fragile and that many economies remained significantly depressed. "Downside risks continue to dominate the global growth outlook, notwithstanding some upside risks in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany," it said.
Even as the I.M.F. stressed that things were looking up in general, it reduced some countries' growth forecasts to account for lingering sluggishness, internal financial problems or new geopolitical strife, as in Ukraine.
The primary effect "is clearly on Ukraine first, but then on Russia," Mr. Blanchard said. There are two main channels: "The first one is an investment climate, which was not perfect to start with and is probably a bit worse. And more hesitation on the part of investors to put their money in Russia or leave it in Russia, so that one can expect fairly substantial capital outflows."
The bank cut its forecast of Russian growth this year to 1.3 percent, down from nearly 2 percent.
Rich countries are increasingly helping to power the global recovery, with fiscal austerity and budget cuts slowing, banks becoming stronger and investors taking on more risk, the fund said. The uptick has been particularly strong in the United States because of factors including the Federal Reserve's extra efforts to stimulate investment, improving household finances and the nascent real estate recovery.
The American economy is providing a "major impulse to global growth." After a slow start last year, it picked up some momentum in the second half of 2013 and the monetary fund now expects the American economy to expand about 3 percent both this year and next, up from 1.9 percent in 2013.
Even the euro area has finally stopped contracting, the fund said, and relief from government-imposed fiscal austerity might help that growth take seed. The drag from steep government cutbacks has dropped to 0.25 percent of economic output this year, from 1 percent last year. Economists at the International Monetary Fund anticipate that the euro area will grow about 1.2 percent this year and 1.5 percent next year, after having shrunk for the last two years.
"For the first time in two years, southern periphery countries are forecast to have positive, if admittedly quite low, growth," Mr. Blanchard said, referring to such euro zone nations as Italy, Portugal and Spain. "But while their exports are generally quite strong, internal demand is still weak. And it has to become stronger if the recovery is to be sustained in those countries."
A senior Treasury official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic issues involved, said that the United States remained concerned that chronic low inflation and weak demand in Europe were holding back the recovery. The Treasury has repeatedly recommended that strong economies in Europe -- in particular, those with big current-account surpluses like Germany -- bolster demand to help the regional economy as a whole.
"There are signs that the global economy is regaining momentum, and this is welcome news," the Treasury official said. "But there are downside risks, including new geopolitical risks, and global economic activity remains weak and uneven."
The recovery in rich countries poses new risks to emerging economies, too, the fund warned, as conditions return closer to normal and the Fed moves to scale down its stimulus efforts. "Stronger growth in advanced economies implies increased demand for their exports," Mr. Blanchard said in the report. "The normalization of monetary policy, however, implies tighter financial conditions and a tougher financial environment. Investors will be less forgiving, and macroeconomic weaknesses will become more costly."
For the major emerging economies -- including China, Latin American nations like Brazil, Middle Eastern countries and South Africa -- growth should be solid, if unremarkable, the fund said, peppering its report with terms like "modest" and "moderate."
The fund left many of its economic projections unchanged from its January forecast, though it cut its forecasts for near-term growth in sub-Saharan Africa, Russia and the lower-income countries in Europe. It also tamped down its projections for growth in Latin America, the Caribbean and the Middle East.

Abstract: For years, the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, a watchdog group of academic leaders and others, has been documenting, and deploring, the race in sports expenditures at the most competitive level, Division I. But this report is believed to be the first that also compares educational spending and athletic spending, over time, at Division II and III schools and at community colleges.

Full text:   Even as their spending on instruction, research and public service declined or stayed flat, most colleges and universities rapidly increased their spending on sports, according to a report being released Monday by the American Association of University Professors.
"Increasingly, institutions of higher education have lost their focus on the academic activities at the core of their mission," the association said in its report. "The spending priority accorded to competitive athletics too easily diverts the focus of our institutions from teaching and learning to scandal and excess."
For years, the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, a watchdog group of academic leaders and others, has been documenting, and deploring, the race in sports expenditures at the most competitive level, Division I. But this report is believed to be the first that also compares educational spending and athletic spending, over time, at Division II and III schools and at community colleges.
"Many of us have had the concern that the out-of-control expenditures in Division I would have a cascading effect, and this report suggests that our worst fears are coming to pass," said William Kirwan, co-chairman of the Knight Commission and chancellor of the University System of Maryland. "The American culture is so in love with athletics that even though many people know the right thing to do, they can't do it."
Using data from the United States Department of Education, the N.C.A.A., and its own surveys, the association paints a sobering picture in its report, titled "Losing Focus," of a sector in which the growth in educational spending trails far behind that of athletic spending -- especially at community colleges and Division II and III institutions.
From 2004 to 2011, community colleges' inflation-adjusted educational spending -- on instruction, public service and academic support -- declined, while their athletic spending increased 35 percent per athlete, the report said. Overall spending per student grew 2.6 percent.
Inflation-adjusted athletic spending also increased, by 24.8 percent, at public four-year colleges in all divisions in those years, while spending on instruction and academic support remained nearly flat, and public service and research expenditures declined, the report said. Their overall spending per student grew 1.6 percent.
The fastest growth in athletic spending was at Division III schools without football programs, where median inflation-adjusted spending for each student-athlete more than doubled from 2004 to 2012.
"Something has gone awry, something's mismatched, between the mission of colleges and universities and their athletic spending," said John Curtis, director of research for the American Association of University Professors and a co-author of the report.
A spokeswoman for Mark Emmert, the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, said he would not be available for comment on the report.
Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, which represents the leaders of colleges and universities, said that the numbers in the report, viewed in context, may not be alarming.
"This comes from the American Association of University Professors, which has a vested interest in finding that too little money is going to faculty and too much to sports and administration," Mr. Hartle said. "If you just look at the percentage increases, without the base they're working from, it's hard to tell what it means."
Saranna Thornton, the other co-author of the university professors report, said athletic spending by the Division II and III schools and community colleges has attracted little notice because the teams are not a television staple.
"We all see college football, we know the shiny helmets at the University of Tennessee. We know March madness, but we don't see Division III games, or the community colleges," said Ms. Thornton, an economics professor and coach of men's rugby at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. Even colleges without powerhouse sports programs, she said, are racing to build their athletic programs as a recruitment tool.
"My hypothesis, and it's not yet fully proven, is that these are mostly schools that are very tuition-dependent, and they're spending more on sports to recruit more students," Ms. Thornton said. "But I think it's ludicrous."
The report also said that the ranks of administrators and adjunct professors are growing many times faster than full-time tenured, or tenure-track faculty. Faculty salaries increased 2.4 percent last year, on average, while top administrators received large raises.

Abstract: In particular, Chapter 3 -- although billed as an analysis of trends in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates -- in effect makes a compelling case for raising inflation targets above 2 percent, the current norm in advanced countries. Furthermore, as the latest I.M.F. report shows, there's strong evidence that changes in the global economy are increasing the tendency of investors to hoard cash rather than put funds to work, thereby increasing the risk of liquidity traps unless the inflation target is raised.

Full text:   Econonerds eagerly await each new edition of the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook. Never mind the forecasts, what we're waiting for are the analytical chapters, which are always interesting and even provocative. This latest report is no exception. In particular, Chapter 3 -- although billed as an analysis of trends in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates -- in effect makes a compelling case for raising inflation targets above 2 percent, the current norm in advanced countries.
This conclusion fits in with other I.M.F. research. Last month the fund's blog -- yes, it has one -- discussed the problems created by "lowflation," which is nearly as destructive as outright deflation. An earlier edition of the World Economic Outlook analyzed historical experience with high debt, and found that countries that were willing to let inflation erode their debt -- including the United States -- fared much better than those, like Britain after World War I, that clung to monetary and fiscal orthodoxy.
But the I.M.F. evidently doesn't feel able to say outright what its analysis clearly implies. Instead, the report resorts to euphemisms that preserve deniability: the analysis "could have implications for the appropriate monetary policy framework."
So what makes the obvious unsayable? In a direct sense, what we're seeing is the power of conventional wisdom. But conventional wisdom doesn't come from nowhere, and I'm increasingly convinced that our failure to deal with high unemployment has a lot to do with class interests.
First, let's talk about the case for higher inflation.
Many people understand that a falling price level is a bad thing; nobody wants to turn into Japan, which has struggled with deflation since the 1990s. What's less understood is that there isn't a red line at zero: an economy with 0.5 percent inflation is going to have many of the same problems as an economy with 0.5 percent deflation. That's why the I.M.F. warned that "lowflation" is putting Europe at risk of Japanese-style stagnation, even though literal deflation hasn't happened (yet).
Moderate inflation turns out to serve several useful purposes. It's good for debtors -- and therefore good for the economy as a whole when an overhang of debt is holding back growth and job creation. It encourages people to spend rather than sit on cash -- again, a good thing in a depressed economy. And it can serve as a kind of economic lubricant, making it easier to adjust wages and prices in the face of shifting demand.
But how much inflation is appropriate? European inflation is below 1 percent, which is clearly too low, and U.S. inflation isn't that much higher. But would it be enough to get back to 2 percent, the official inflation target in both Europe and the United States? Almost certainly not.
You see, monetary experts have long known about the case for moderate inflation, but back in the 1990s, when the 2 percent target was hardening into policy orthodoxy, they thought that 2 percent was high enough to do the job. In particular, they thought it was enough to make liquidity traps -- periods when even an interest rate of zero isn't low enough to restore full employment -- very rare. But America has now been in a liquidity trap for more than five years. Clearly, the experts were wrong.
Furthermore, as the latest I.M.F. report shows, there's strong evidence that changes in the global economy are increasing the tendency of investors to hoard cash rather than put funds to work, thereby increasing the risk of liquidity traps unless the inflation target is raised. But the report never dares to say this outright.
So why is the obvious unsayable? One answer is that serious people like to prove their seriousness by calling for tough choices and sacrifice (by other people, of course). They hate being told about answers that don't involve more suffering.
And behind this attitude, one suspects, lies class bias. Doing what America did after World War II -- using low interest rates and inflation to erode the debt burden -- is often referred to as "financial repression," which sounds bad. But who wouldn't prefer modest inflation and a bit of asset erosion to mass unemployment? Well, you know who: the 0.1 percent, who receive "only" 4 percent of wages but account for more than 20 percent of total wealth. Modestly higher inflation, say 4 percent, would be good for the vast majority of people, but it would be bad for the superelite. And guess who gets to define conventional wisdom.
Now, I don't think that class interest is all-powerful. Good arguments and good policies sometimes prevail even if they hurt the 0.1 percent -- otherwise we would never have gotten health reform. But we do need to make clear what's going on, and realize that in monetary policy as in so much else, what's good for oligarchs isn't good for America.

Full text:   CORPORATE profits are at their highest level in at least 85 years. Employee compensation is at the lowest level in 65 years.
The Commerce Department last week estimated that corporations earned $2.1 trillion during 2013, and paid $419 billion in corporate taxes. The after-tax profit of $1.7 trillion amounted to 10 percent of gross domestic product during the year, the first full year it has been that high. In 2012, it was 9.7 percent, itself a record.
Until 2010, the highest level of after-tax profits ever recorded was 9.1 percent, in 1929, the first year that the government began calculating the number.
Before taxes, corporate profits accounted for 12.5 percent of the total economy, tying the previous record that was set in 1942, when World War II pushed up profits for many companies. But in 1942, most of those profits were taxed away. The effective corporate tax rate was nearly 55 percent, in sharp contrast to last year's figure of under 20 percent.
The trend of higher profits and lower effective taxes has been gaining strength for years, but really picked up after the Great Recession temporarily depressed profits in 2009. The effective rate has been below 20 percent in three of the last five years. Before 2009, the rate had not been that low since 1931.
The statutory top corporate tax rate in the United States is 35 percent, and corporations have been vigorously lobbying to reduce that, saying it puts them at a competitive disadvantage against companies based in other countries, where rates are lower. But there are myriad tax credits, deductions and preferences available, particularly to multinational companies, and the result is that effective tax rates have fallen for many companies.
The Commerce Department also said total wages and salaries last year amounted to $7.1 trillion, or 42.5 percent of the entire economy. That was down from 42.6 percent in 2012 and was lower than in any year previously measured.
Including the cost of employer-paid benefits, like health insurance and pensions, as well as the employer's share of Social Security and Medicare contributions, the total cost of compensation was $8.9 trillion, or 52.7 percent of G.D.P., down from 53 percent in 2012 and the lowest level since 1948.
Benefits were a steadily rising cost for employers for many decades, but that trend seems to have ended. In 2013, the figure was 10.2 percent, the lowest since 2000.
One way to look at the current situation is to compare 2013 with 2006, the last full year before the recession began. Adjusted for inflation, corporate profits were 28 percent higher, before taxes, last year. But taxes were down by 21 percent,so after-tax profits were up by 36 percent. At the same time, total employee compensation was up by 5 percent, or less than the 7 percent increase in the working-age population over the same period.
Several reasons that have been offered as explanations for the declining share of national income going to workers, including the effects of globalization that have shifted some jobs to lower-paid overseas workers and the declining bargaining power of unions.
The accompanying charts compare President Obama's administration with each of his predecessors, going back to Herbert Hoover. After-tax corporate profits in President Obama's five years in office have averaged 9.3 percent of G.D.P. That is a full two percentage points higher than the 7.2 percent averages under Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush, previously the presidents with the highest ratios of corporate profits.
The stock market has reflected that strong performance. Through the end of March, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 133 percent since Mr. Obama's inauguration in 2009. Of the 13 presidents since 1929, only Bill Clinton and Franklin D. Roosevelt saw a larger total increase. On an annualized basis, the Obama administration gains come to 17.7 percent a year, higher than any of the previous presidents. The figures reflect price changes, and are not adjusted for dividends or inflation.

Full text:   Jeff Dworkin, a Dallas builder, was surprised to find someone he didn't recognize inside a half-finished house this winter where crews were about to texture the home's drywall.
And that's how Mr. Dworkin, the president of JLD Custom Homes, discovered that the chief of a rival subcontractor was there trying to steal his workers.
"He was driving around and saw a rig, and he went inside to offer our guys more money," Mr. Dworkin said. "These guys know, even though they may not be well educated or even speak the language, that they can work for the next guy and make $150 a day instead of $100."
Even as the unemployment rate moves slowly downward, wage growth remains sluggish nearly five years after the recovery officially began, and has become one of the economy's most conspicuous weak spots.
But there are now signs that the labor market is starting to tighten enough that workers may finally get some real raises that significantly outpace inflation.
"I do think there are signs wage growth is picking up," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Earlier this year, Mr. Zandi was pessimistic about any acceleration in wage gains before 2016, but now he predicts that last year's after-inflation growth of 0.8 percent will rise to 1 percent this year and 1.1 percent in 2015. "I think we can say definitely the slowing in wage growth is over."
Those gains are still modest, especially considering that median family incomes, adjusted for inflation, fell about 10 percent during and after the recession. So far, the typical worker is recovering only slowly from that loss. Over the last 12 months, nominal hourly wages are up a modest 2.1 percent, which works out to an after-inflation rate of about 1 percent.
In the second half of the 1990s, when unemployment fell as low as 4 percent, competition for workers helped drive up real wages and salaries for the worker at the middle of the income ladder roughly 1.5 percent a year, the fastest sustained pace in decades. With the labor market so tight, wages for workers at the bottom of the income scale rose even faster, about 2 percent a year above the rate of inflation.
But with the jobless rate now at 6.7 percent, the labor market is still not nearly as favorable to ordinary workers as it was at the end of the last century.
The idea that wages are about to accelerate is far from unanimous among economists. Among those who believe the evidence is still lacking is Janet L. Yellen, the newly installed chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, who said at her first news conference after taking the helm that most measures of income growth had shown little movement. She said 3 to 4 percent nominal wage growth would be normal if inflation, now running barely over 1 percent on the Fed's crucial measure, rose to the central bank's target of 2 percent.
Moreover, even as the economic cycle continues to advance, powerful underlying forces -- including a relatively strong dollar that contributes to an outsourcing of jobs abroad -- are helping to hold down pay increases.
"The upward pressure on wages will be there, but I'm not sure it will be fulfilled in a competitive worldwide market," said Bob Funk, chief executive of Express Employment Professionals in Oklahoma City, one of the nation's largest staffing firms. At Express, which places mostly light-industrial workers, the average hourly wage of its job finders rose only 7 cents in 2013, or less than 1 percent, to $11.41, he said.
The March unemployment rate showed average hourly wages dropping a penny, to $24.30, after a 9 cent gain in February, but with hours worked increasing, total pay continued to gain ground.
And there are signs of region-by-region, industry-by-industry wage moves percolating under the surface. In early March, the Fed's Beige Book, a survey of conditions in various regions around the nation, reported that a third of the businesses in the St. Louis Federal Reserve district reported that pay picked up in the last three months.
It also cited multiple reports of labor shortages in construction, even though the building industry is still down 1.8 million jobs from 2007. Wages in home construction are up 5 percent in the last year. And some companies in the hottest regions of the economy are having to pay even more to attract capable workers.
"In the last five months, the labor price went up 20 to 25 percent," said Daniel Esqueda, whose Wallco Drywall in Lewisville, Tex., has been losing workers to Texas's booming oil patch. "It's a nightmare right now."
A nightmare to him, perhaps, but encouraging news for workers. And other regions with rapidly improving economies are reporting sharp movements in pay as well, especially if they are home to a hot sector like the technology industry.
In Northern California, wages are beginning to soar, not just for software engineers but even for people employed in fast food and retailing. In San Mateo County, at the northern end of Silicon Valley, average wages rose 9.9 percent in the year ending Sept. 30, the most recent data available, and the fastest wage growth for a county in the nation, according to the Labor Department. San Francisco is close behind, ranking 10th of 335 counties tracked, with 4.8 percent wage growth.
"You walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto and you see help-wanted signs in all the low-wage service shops," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. "That's the first sign people have moved on to better jobs."
Across the country, the number of metropolitan regions at or near the 5.5 percent unemployment rate -- a signal that an area is moving closer to the full employment zone -- is growing rapidly, said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors outside Philadelphia.
"Labor supply is like housing or anything else: It's local," Mr. Naroff said.
Madison, Wis., has 4.5 percent unemployment and the nation's second-fastest wage growth, Labor Department statistics show. Collier County, Fla., anchored by Naples, has the nation's third-highest wage growth, as rebounding housing and stock markets have pushed local unemployment down to 5.6 percent from 9.8 percent in the summer of 2012.
And several cities in Texas and North Dakota, buoyed by the shale oil and gas drilling boom, reported raises well above the national trend in the third quarter of 2013, the most recent period for which detailed statistics are available.
For all the encouraging signs in especially tight local markets, however, wages in the vast array of low-paying services generally remain modest. Don Fox, the chief executive of Fire House of America, a 750-store sandwich chain based in Jacksonville, Fla., says his franchisees in the Texas oil belt have had to pay $10 to $15 an hour to get workers. But at company-owned stores in North Florida, where unemployment is about 6 percent, there is not much wage pressure yet and he is able to get away with paying little more than the state minimum wage of $7.93 an hour, which went up 14 cents at the beginning of the year.
But even there, he is feeling a greater need to make his jobs more appealing. This year, he offered health insurance to lower-ranking store workers, and twice as many people signed up as he expected.
"That was a $4,000-a-year raise right there," Mr. Fox said.
Signs of wage pressure concern some experts, who worry that it may lead to inflation. But many analysts, including the middle-of-the-road Mr. Zandi and Jared Bernstein, a left-leaning economist who served as an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., dismiss the inflation threat, arguing that growing business investment to enhance productivity and expand sales will offset higher labor costs.
One example is the Gap, which is raising the pay of its 65,000 lower-wage workers (out of its total of 90,000 in the United States) to $9 an hour this year and will increase it to $10 an hour in June 2015.
The Gap acted partly because a shift to more business online made it essential to have higher-skilled and better-trained workers in its stores. The retailer's expansion into selling clothes online for customers to try on in the stores, said Bill Chandler, senior vice president of corporate affairs, means the company will rely on employees to encourage customers to buy accessories and other clothes when they pick up their orders.
"We're not quantifying the cost," Mr. Chandler said, "but we're confident we can meet it while continuing to deliver results for our shareholders."
In the end, however, only a growing scarcity of qualified workers -- not the generosity of employers -- will lift pay more broadly.
"You can always get workers," Mr. Naroff said. "You just have to pay them."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Jeremy C. Stein, a member of the Federal Reserve's board who has raised concerns about its stimulus campaign, will resign at the end of May and return to his previous role at Harvard.
Mr. Stein, who joined the Fed in 2012, needed to return within two years to preserve his tenured professorship.
"During my time here, the economy has moved steadily back in the direction of full employment, and a number of important steps have been taken to make the financial system stronger and more resilient," Mr. Stein wrote in a letter informing President Obama of his resignation, which was released by the Fed. He added, "There is undoubtedly more work to be done on both dimensions."
Mr. Stein, an economist and noted academic, has helped to provide an intellectual rationale for the cautious evolution of the Fed's stimulus campaign, which has not succeeded in returning either unemployment or inflation to normal levels.
He has argued that the Fed should temper its efforts to minimize unemployment because those policies encourage financial risk-taking, which can undermine long-term growth by destabilizing markets and causing new crises.
"Monetary policy should be less accommodative -- by which I mean that it should be willing to tolerate a larger forecast shortfall of the path of the unemployment rate from its full-employment level -- when estimates of risk premiums in the bond market are abnormally low," he said in a speech last month.
His views remain controversial. Many of Mr. Stein's colleagues, including the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, have said that they see no signs of dangerous overheating in financial markets. Some critics say Mr. Stein is focused on the last crisis instead of the present problem: high unemployment.
There is also a continuing debate about whether it ever makes sense to correct overheating in financial markets by raising interest rates. Many officials regard that as a crude tool, at best, because the effects are felt throughout the economy. Mr. Stein, however, sees this as a potential benefit, because the higher rates would potentially solve even problems that regulators did not notice.
Mr. Stein's tenure will be among the shortest in recent Fed history; he had about four years left on his term. Frederic S. Mishkin, who resigned in 2008, was the last governor to serve less than two years.
"Jeremy has made important contributions and served as an intellectual leader during his time at the board," Ms. Yellen said in a statement. "His understanding of monetary policy and markets as well as his expertise in banking and financial regulation has proven invaluable in his service to the Federal Reserve and the country."
His departure could create a fourth vacancy on the seven-member board. Two nominees, Stanley Fischer and Lael Brainard, are awaiting Senate confirmation. Mr. Obama has not announced a nominee for a third vacancy, created last month when Sarah Bloom Raskin became deputy Treasury secretary.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The debate over repairs to the nation's federal highways could be simplified as this: Will improved Interstates force people into bypassing their Big Macs?
There is not much disagreement on the need to fill the yawning potholes, strengthen the deteriorating bridge supports or repave vast stretches of the federally maintained road system. The fight is over how those extensive, and expensive, fixes would be financed. And the Highway Trust Fund, which usually shoulders such costs, is teetering on bankruptcy.
Lawmakers and some business groups are pushing to lift the ban on new tolls along existing Interstate highways, a move that would provide additional revenue for road maintenance and repair.
But a coalition of some of the nation's biggest companies, including FedEx and McDonald's, are fighting to keep the Interstates as toll-free as possible. They argue that tolls would add significantly to the expense of moving their goods across the country.
There is also a hidden cost, they say, for restaurants, convenience stores, gas stations and other businesses that depend on Interstate highway traffic. The tolls could cost them customers as travelers choose other routes.
"People aren't going to stop at a McDonald's or a hotel if they have to get off the Interstate and pay a toll, then pay a toll to get back on," said Jay B. Perron, vice president of government affairs for the International Franchisee Association, which is part of the toll opposition. "It's a significant economic hit for these businesses, if people chose to avoid them because of tolls."
On the other side is the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, a group that represents toll companies and their vendors. It says adding tolls to highways that do not have them and increasing tolls that are already in place are the most sensible solutions for financing repairs to the nation's deteriorating infrastructure.
"Tolling is a proven, effective funding and financing method that works," said Patrick D. Jones, the association's executive director. "We're not saying every state needs to set up tolls, just give them the flexibility to do so when it makes sense."
The fight is being waged as Congress prepares to rewrite the surface transportation bill, which expires Oct. 1. Highway construction and repair projects are typically paid for by the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by a gasoline tax that has for decades been the chief source of revenue in the construction of American highways.
The tax, which is set at 18.4 cents per gallon, is not indexed to inflation and has not been raised since 1993. In addition, the rise of hybrid vehicles and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks has caused the tax revenues to fall. The Highway Trust Fund will be bankrupt next year unless Congress acts, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The pro-toll effort has the support of many state and local transportation officials. They argue that local officials, who can raise their own fuel and sales taxes, cannot come up with the trillions of dollars needed to repair, or in some cases rebuild, sections of the federal Interstate System.
"If Congress is not going to sufficiently fund transportation, and there is no appetite to increase the gas tax, we have to have the ability to add tolls," said former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, co-chairman of the Building America's Future Educational Fund, a bipartisan group that is intended to address transportation issues.
The opponents, under an umbrella group called the Alliance for a Toll-Free Interstate, include the American Trucking Association, UPS, FedEx, McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts. The companies say that adding tolls would cause drivers to be taxed twice for driving on the same road -- once in paying federal gasoline taxes and again by tolls.
And they argue that the new tolls could hurt states that would have to pay for repairs on secondary roads that would deteriorate faster if enough drivers used them as alternatives. By law, money from the Highway Trust Fund cannot be used for state roads.
"Tolling existing Interstate lanes is the least efficient, least effective mechanism to fund transportation in the long term," said Hayes Framme, a spokesman for the alliance.
Congress banned tolls on Interstate highways in 1956 when it created the national system under President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Some Northeast states, like Delaware, were allowed to keep tolls on existing highways that became a part of the national system. Other states were allowed to create tolls on new highways and on lanes added to existing Interstates, but that revenue can be used only for repair and maintenance of those roads.
Congress created a pilot project in 1998 that allowed Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia to add new tolls, but efforts in those states have run into political opposition.
Last year, the North Carolina House voted unanimously to ban new tolls on any existing Interstate highway, which ended the state's plan to add tolls on the parts of Interstate 95 that run through eight counties in the state. Gov. Pat McCrory also opposed the tolls.
A proposal in Virginia to add tolls to parts of I-95 was also killed by legislators. And a similar proposal in Missouri to add tolls on I-70 between St. Louis and Kansas City also failed to advance in the Legislature.
Still, despite the setback in states, toll supporters say the continuing deterioration of roads is forcing members of Congress to reconsider the bans.
"Tolling is an integral part of the debate right now," said Mr. Jones of the tunnel and turnpike association. "It's on the menu in a way that it hasn't been before because Congress and state legislatures are running out of options."
Mr. Framme, from the antitolling group, said it had urged Congress to increase the gasoline tax, rather than add tolls, to finance transportation projects because the overhead costs are far lower, although toll supporters disagree.
"Tolling is not this painless option that proponents say it is," Mr. Framme said. "This misguided, knee-jerk response would cost fast-food restaurants, convenience stores and other businesses along Interstate routes billions."

Abstract: Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, said that members of the bank's Governing Council, which met Thursday, had a "rich and ample" discussion about so-called quantitative easing, purchases of government or corporate bonds on a grand scale as a way of reducing market interest rates. Mr. Draghi said that the Governing Council had grown concerned about some of the negative effects of subdued price increases, which make it harder for euro zone countries like Greece or Italy to reduce their huge debts.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank gave its strongest signal yet that it was considering action to stimulate the euro zone economy. But the bank immediately faced criticism that talk of large-scale bond purchases -- the same method used by the Federal Reserve to help restart the United States economy -- was little more than a bluff.
Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, said that members of the bank's Governing Council, which met Thursday, had a "rich and ample" discussion about so-called quantitative easing, purchases of government or corporate bonds on a grand scale as a way of reducing market interest rates.
In addition, the central bank left its benchmark rate at 0.25 percent on Thursday, already a low.
Inflation in the euro zone was 0.5 percent in March, its lowest level since 2009. Mr. Draghi said that the Governing Council had grown concerned about some of the negative effects of subdued price increases, which make it harder for euro zone countries like Greece or Italy to reduce their huge debts.
The Governing Council "is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments" to confront the risks of a prolonged period of low inflation, Mr. Draghi said, reading from a prepared statement.
The statement was the central bank's most explicit indication yet that it was ready to deploy quantitative easing. Use of the word "unanimous" in the statement was evidently intended to show that such a move would not face dissent within the council from conservative members like Jens Weidmann, who is also president of the German central bank, the Bundesbank.
At a news conference, though, Mr. Draghi declined to give specifics about how quantitative easing might be carried out in Europe, where most credit comes from banks rather than from corporate bonds as in the United States. That means the central bank would have fewer assets to buy as a way of pumping money into the economy.
The lack of detail caused some analysts to conclude that Mr. Draghi, whose most effective monetary tool has often been his spoken words, was bluffing.
"It's hard to say how much of the rhetoric is a genuine signaling of Q.E. intent and how much is just trying to talk down the euro," Luke Bartholomew, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said in an email.
The euro dipped against the dollar after Mr. Draghi's remarks to $1.37, down 0.37 percent from earlier in the day.
Mr. Draghi said inflation was expected to pick up this month. That was probably one reason that the Governing Council decided not to take any steps now to stimulate the economy. And while Mr. Draghi said the council expected inflation to remain low in the midterm, the bank still expects inflation to approach the 2 percent level, which the bank sees as its target, in 2016.
Mr. Draghi may be hoping that an increase in inflation in April will remove pressure on the central bank to be more aggressive. Mr. Draghi betrayed some annoyance Thursday with outsiders, including top officials of the International Monetary Fund, who have been exerting such pressure.
"The I.M.F. has been recently extremely generous with its suggestions of what we should do or not do," Mr. Draghi said with sarcasm. "We are really thankful for that."
The central bank's council, he said, is unanimous in its commitment to taking steps to address low inflation if it deems them necessary. But for now, he said, "We need more information."
Some economists have begun to warn of the perils of "lowflation," a term used to describe the phenomenon affecting the euro zone.
Lowflation is not as damaging as deflation, a broad-based decline in prices that undercuts corporate revenue and often leads to higher unemployment because companies stop creating jobs.
But very low inflation has other negative effects. When inflation falls, borrowers effectively pay more interest on existing loans. For example, a company that took out a loan when inflation was 2 percent, the European Central Bank's official inflation ceiling, would expect the effective cost of the loan to decline over time as price rises eroded the value of the principal.
But if inflation falls, the cost of the loan is higher than the company expected. If the company is not able to raise its prices, it might have trouble paying its debts. In Europe, this negative effect is especially damaging because the countries with the highest debts tend to have low or negative inflation. In Greece, Portugal and Spain, prices are falling.
"With low inflation, the real value of this debt doesn't go down as fast as it would if inflation were higher," Mr. Draghi said. "It makes the adjustment of imbalances much more difficult."
Mr. Draghi also argued, though, that low inflation was largely the result of falling energy prices and other one-time factors and would pick up in May.
He acknowledged that deflation had posed problems in Japan in the 1990s, but added, "We don't see those risks now in the euro area."
The problem for the central bank is that the measures available to stimulate the euro zone economy are all risky and controversial.
Extensive purchases of corporate or government bonds, the same tool used by the Federal Reserve to pump money into the American economy, would be more difficult in Europe. The Fed can buy United States Treasury bonds, the most widely traded debt in the world. The E.C.B. would have to choose among different bonds from its member countries. In addition, the corporate bond market in Europe is much smaller because companies tend to get credit directly from banks.
"Our institutional and financial setup is considerably different from what it is in the United States," Mr. Draghi said. "The program has to be carefully designed."
Mr. Draghi's specific talk of quantitative easing on Thursday may have raised expectations that will be difficult to meet, some analysts said.
"From here on, a further verbal stepping up seems impossible," Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. "In a way it's a gamble, either the recovery continues and inflation picks up again, or the E.C.B. will have to act."

Abstract: In Berlin, even as the coalition government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was formally proposing a national minimum wage of 8.50 euros an hour, or about $11.70, the Lufthansa strike gave new momentum for separate legislation that would curtail the ability of small but powerful unions -- like the 9,300-member pilots' union, which represents the majority of Lufthansa's 5,500 pilots -- to shut down whole economic sectors. According to figures compiled by the German Confederation of Trade Unions, the average annual number of days lost to strikes in Germany from 2005 to 2012 was 16 per 1,000 employees, only slightly higher than in the United States, where the average was 10.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDFRANKFURT -- As with so many situations in Germany, there is an orderly way to do things and then there are ways that are not socially acceptable. That principle, it turns out, applies even to labor strikes.
A three-day work stoppage by Lufthansa pilots, which began on Wednesday, appears to belong in the unacceptable category, breaking the unwritten rules of German workplace relations and disrupting what was otherwise a feel-good week for organized labor.
On Tuesday, public service workers won a 3 percent raise. On Wednesday, a proposal to institute a nationwide minimum wage gained broad-based political support. After a decade of almost no pay increases, German workers have been demanding, and getting, their share of the country's economic revival.
But Lufthansa pilots, who paralyzed Europe's largest airline and interrupted the travel plans of 400,000 passengers, may have gone too far for some in the labor movement.
In Berlin, even as the coalition government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was formally proposing a national minimum wage of 8.50 euros an hour, or about $11.70, the Lufthansa strike gave new momentum for separate legislation that would curtail the ability of small but powerful unions -- like the 9,300-member pilots' union, which represents the majority of Lufthansa's 5,500 pilots -- to shut down whole economic sectors. Mainstream unions, with tens of thousands of members, fear that such legislation could threaten their right to strike.
The pilots' strike "is a bit against the German tradition of a fair balancing of interests," said Werner Eichhorst, director for European labor policy at the Institute for the Study of Labor in Bonn.
"The small unions are trying to exploit their power to blackmail," he said. "The big unions see themselves threatened."
The pilots argue that they are fighting for the rights of all Lufthansa employees. Efforts by the airline to raise the retirement age for pilots to 61 from 58 -- with a minority allowed to retire as young as 55 -- are the main point of contention in the current dispute. But these efforts are part of a wider assault on employee privileges, the union, known as Vereinigung Cockpit, argues. This may be a hard sell to other Lufthansa workers, who have already endured pay cuts and must work until 65.
"The sympathy for the pilots is certainly limited," Mr. Eichhorst said. "They are well paid and retire early."
Average annual pay for Lufthansa pilots is [euro]180,000, and experienced pilots can easily earn more than [euro]200,000, or about $275,000 a year. The average German wage is the equivalent of only about $45,000 a year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The Lufthansa strike has created a quandary for mainstream labor groups, which do not want to be seen opposing fellow unions but also fear becoming targets of the public criticism being heaped on the pilots.
At the Frankfurt Airport on Wednesday, Uwe Heinz, 59, of Dresden, said that he was not inconvenienced by the strike on his way to a two-week vacation in Cuba because he was traveling on another airline. Still, he reflected what seemed to be widespread outrage toward the pilots' demands.
"When I see what the pilots earn, and what I have to live on, they are complaining at a very high level," Mr. Heinz said. "The rest of us have to work until we're 65."
German unions usually prefer short, carefully focused warning strikes that demonstrate their power without squandering public sympathy.
When members of the Ver.Di union, which represents service workers, like ticket agents, went on strike at the Frankfurt Airport last week, they began the stoppage at 3:30 a.m. and were back on the job by early afternoon.
This approach is part of the social consensus that has guaranteed political stability since World War II. According to figures compiled by the German Confederation of Trade Unions, the average annual number of days lost to strikes in Germany from 2005 to 2012 was 16 per 1,000 employees, only slightly higher than in the United States, where the average was 10. In France, the corresponding number was 150.
Much of Germany's economic renaissance in the last decade was a result of restraint by unions, which accepted pay raises that barely covered inflation in return for promises of job security. That self-discipline helped Germany regain lost competitiveness.
But as German unemployment has fallen to 5.1 percent, the second-lowest in the European Union after Austria, labor leaders have been pushing more aggressively for a share of the country's prosperity.
The government led by Ms. Merkel, a coalition with the labor-friendly Social Democrats, has been sympathetic, as demonstrated Wednesday when her cabinet sent draft legislation for a minimum wage to Parliament. Germany does not currently have a legal minimum wage, though most workers are covered by agreements between unions and employer groups.
A spokesman for Ver.Di would not comment Wednesday on the strike by the Lufthansa pilots, but it is likely that the big unions do not approve of strikes with the power to cripple essential infrastructure, like hospital workers or locomotive drivers. A spokesman for the German Confederation of Trade Unions also would not comment, but he acknowledged that the group preferred that all employees of a company be represented by the same union. The confederation is opposed, however, to any limits on the right to strike.
Mr. Eichhorst said that the pilots' strike could eventually strengthen the big unions if Parliament passed legislation curtailing the power of small unions like Vereinigung Cockpit. The mainstream unions would then have a de facto monopoly in the sectors they represent.
The situation may also work to Lufthansa's advantage. The airline appeared determined to tough out the three-day strike, even though it is likely to cost the company tens of millions of euros. German news media coverage of the airline was generally positive Wednesday.
There was little sense of chaos at the Frankfurt Airport because Lufthansa had managed either to reroute passengers or warn them not to show up for flights that would be canceled. For those who did show up, the airline handed out free drinks and snacks near its check-in counters, where lines were short.
At a news conference at company headquarters at the airport Wednesday, airline executives said that as many as 100 pilots chose not to observe the strike and were still flying, and they pointed out that Lufthansa crews were also inconvenienced. More than 1,500 are stuck at airports overseas until Saturday.
Perhaps hoping that the pilots had overplayed their hand, Werner Knorr, the head of flight operations for Lufthansa, expressed hope that this strike would be the last of its kind. "I'm optimistic we won't have endless strikes," he said.
Correction: April 4, 2014, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about criticism of a strike by pilots at Lufthansa airlines referred incorrectly to Germany's ranking in unemployment. At 5.1 percent, its jobless rate is the second-lowest in the European Union, not in Europe over all.

Love the Tender? $2 Bill Is Still an Oddity

Abstract: The $2 bill, like the $1 bill, was introduced in 1862, but both were slow to replace dollar coins. Because of rising inflation, paper money eventually gained popularity for everyday transactions, yet the two always lagged behind the one. On its website, the United States Treasury advises, "The key for successfully circulating the $2 bill is for retailers to use them just like any other denomination in their daily operations," adding, as if sick of being pestered by $2 fans, "Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System can force the distribution or use of any denomination of currency on banks, businesses or individuals."

Full text:   Move over, Bitcoin. There is another uncommon tender angling for a spotlight, or in this case, a comeback: the $2 bill.
Heather McCabe is on a one-woman mission to revitalize the quirky greenback through deliberate casual use.
For others like Matthew Zaklad, who pours roughly 7,000 notes into circulation each year, the goal is to create meaningful interactions in otherwise mundane encounters.
In Ms. McCabe's 15 years as an ambassador of the deuce, she has been flatly rejected at a bowling alley on Staten Island, was told to pay with something else at a bar in the East Village and is constantly solicited by people who want to buy her bills.
"Americans in America want to pay American money to buy American money?" she wrote on her blog, Two Buckaroo, where she documents reactions to twos.
There are one billion $2 bills in circulation, which may sound like a lot. But they account for only 3 percent of the total volume of notes, according to the Federal Reserve. The most plentiful denominations, the $1 and $100 bills, each number about 10 billion.
Twos continue to be printed every few years, based on demand. Forty-five million more of the bills, which have images of Thomas Jefferson on one side and the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the other, went into production last October at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing outpost in Fort Worth, the first run since 2009.
On a recent Friday afternoon, armed with her little black notebook and a heap of twos, Ms. McCabe, 39, a copy editor, bought a sandwich in Park Slope, Brooklyn, using a five, some ones and a two.
"I want to disabuse Americans of the idea that the $2 bill isn't printed anymore," she said.
"Hey, a two!" the cashier exclaimed. Ms. McCabe slid poker-faced out the door.
In 1992, Mr. Zaklad, 41, who works in the automotive industry, once covered his entire $400 rent in twos. More recently, he said, he dropped 200 twos on a dinner tab at WD50 on the Lower East Side. He tries to use the bills exclusively.
"The real benefit of the twos are in interacting with humanity," Mr. Zaklad said. "It triggers memories of love, of other generations, of childhood."
On a recent Saturday morning at the Union Square Greenmarket, Mr. Zaklad was on hand as a customer named Mark Matza, a bus driver who was off duty, refused a two from Andrew Cote, a beekeeper who intentionally doles out hundreds of twos a week through his honey business. Mr. Zaklad eventually persuaded Mr. Matza that it was legitimate tender.
Last year the owner of Mr. Zaklad's local deli near Union Square pulled him aside.
"Hey Mr. $2 Bill, not everyone wants your money," Mr. Zaklad recalls him saying. "Look up your history on Jefferson and slavery."
Still, many enthusiasts are working to see the bill flourish, a potentially quixotic labor as Americans overwhelmingly treat $2 notes as keepsakes or remain skeptical of their legitimacy.
River Allan, 32, a bartender in the East Village, receives several twos a month from customers.
"We'll get into fights over who gets to keep the $2 bills," Mr. Allan said of his fellow bartenders. He plans to create an art project from his stack of about 100. A co-worker sends them to friends in Europe who think it's "funny money."
On eBay, an ordinary two can fetch double its actual worth or a stack of 50 might go for $120.
The $2 bill, like the $1 bill, was introduced in 1862, but both were slow to replace dollar coins. Because of rising inflation, paper money eventually gained popularity for everyday transactions, yet the two always lagged behind the one.
On its website, the United States Treasury advises, "The key for successfully circulating the $2 bill is for retailers to use them just like any other denomination in their daily operations," adding, as if sick of being pestered by $2 fans, "Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System can force the distribution or use of any denomination of currency on banks, businesses or individuals."
The first film to look in depth at this note is expected out later this year. John Bennardo of Delray Beach, Fla., the filmmaker, is crossing the country to document the $2 bill, which continues to be associated with vice: strip clubs, gambling, bars.
Mr. Bennardo came to New York last month to film Ms. McCabe and others for his movie, "The 2 Dollar Bill Documentary."
"This bill is a beautiful underdog. I think they appreciate its value as a United States artifact," Mr. Bennardo said of this spirited community.
But as Mr. Zaklad attests, twos are often linked to deeply personal stories.
Myrta Gschaar recalls her parents' saving $2 bills and half-dollar coins in a drawer at her childhood home; her mother earned many of them as a seamstress at a women's underwear factory on Spring Street.
When her husband, Robert Gschaar, proposed to her at a restaurant on Wall Street in the late 1980s, he did not have an engagement ring to offer. He was a history devotee, and this would be the second marriage for them both. That night he pulled a pair of twos from his wallet, giving one to her. He explained that as long as they carried these twos, they would be united.
Four years after the Sept. 11 attacks, her husband's remains had yet to be found. A special property recovery unit at the Police Department notified Mrs. Gschaar that it had recovered personal items of Mr. Gschaar's at ground zero. The items were a wedding ring and a wallet containing a neatly folded $2 bill.
"His $2 bill gave me some closure that he was gone, that he wasn't wandering around with amnesia," Mrs. Gschaar said in a phone call from Ohio, where she now lives. "Because a lot of family members were saying, 'What if he's still out there?' "
Mrs. Gschaar donated both bills, the wallet and the ring to the Sept. 11 museum, where they are to be displayed.
"It was well fitted for him, since he loves his history, and now he is a part of history," she said.

Abstract: Since 1998, the movement founded by Hugo Chávez has won more than a dozen presidential, parliamentary and local elections through an electoral process that former American President Jimmy Carter has called "the best in the world." According to this narrative, the American government is siding with the people of Venezuela; in reality, it is on the side of the 1 percent who wish to drag our country back to when the 99 percent were shut out of political life and only the few -- including American companies -- benefited from Venezuela's oil.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- THE recent protests in Venezuela have made international headlines. Much of the foreign media coverage has distorted the reality of my country and the facts surrounding the events.
Venezuelans are proud of our democracy. We have built a participatory democratic movement from the grass roots that has ensured that both power and resources are equitably distributed among our people.
According to the United Nations, Venezuela has consistently reduced inequality: It now has the lowest income inequality in the region. We have reduced poverty enormously -- to 25.4 percent in 2012, on the World Bank's data, from 49 percent in 1998; in the same period, according to government statistics, extreme poverty diminished to 6 percent from 21 percent.
We have created flagship universal health care and education programs, free to our citizens nationwide. We have achieved these feats in large part by using revenue from Venezuelan oil.
While our social policies have improved citizens' lives over all, the government has also confronted serious economic challenges in the past 16 months, including inflation and shortages of basic goods. We continue to find solutions through measures like our new market-based foreign exchange system, which is designed to reduce the black market exchange rate. And we are monitoring businesses to ensure they are not gouging consumers or hoarding products. Venezuela has also struggled with a high crime rate. We are addressing this by building a new national police force, strengthening community-police cooperation and revamping our prison system.
Since 1998, the movement founded by Hugo Chávez has won more than a dozen presidential, parliamentary and local elections through an electoral process that former American President Jimmy Carter has called "the best in the world." Recently, the United Socialist Party received an overwhelming mandate in mayoral elections in December 2013, winning 255 out of 337 municipalities.
Popular participation in politics in Venezuela has increased dramatically over the past decade. As a former union organizer, I believe profoundly in the right to association and in the civic duty to ensure that justice prevails by voicing legitimate concerns through peaceful assembly and protest.
The claims that Venezuela has a deficient democracy and that current protests represent mainstream sentiment are belied by the facts. The antigovernment protests are being carried out by people in the wealthier segments of society who seek to reverse the gains of the democratic process that have benefited the vast majority of the people.
Antigovernment protesters have physically attacked and damaged health care clinics, burned down a university in Táchira State and thrown Molotov cocktails and rocks at buses. They have also targeted other public institutions by throwing rocks and torches at the offices of the Supreme Court, the public telephone company CANTV and the attorney general's office. These violent actions have caused many millions of dollars' worth of damage. This is why the protests have received no support in poor and working-class neighborhoods.
The protesters have a single goal: the unconstitutional ouster of the democratically elected government. Antigovernment leaders made this clear when they started the campaign in January, vowing to create chaos in the streets. Those with legitimate criticisms of economic conditions or the crime rate are being exploited by protest leaders with a violent, antidemocratic agenda.
In two months, a reported 36 people have been killed. The protesters are, we believe, directly responsible for about half of the fatalities. Six members of the National Guard have been shot and killed; other citizens have been murdered while attempting to remove obstacles placed by protesters to block transit.
A very small number of security forces personnel have also been accused of engaging in violence, as a result of which several people have died. These are highly regrettable events, and the Venezuelan government has responded by arresting those suspected. We have created a Human Rights Council to investigate all incidents related to these protests. Each victim deserves justice, and every perpetrator -- whether a supporter or an opponent of the government -- will be held accountable for his or her actions.
In the United States, the protesters have been described as "peaceful," while the Venezuelan government is said to be violently repressing them. According to this narrative, the American government is siding with the people of Venezuela; in reality, it is on the side of the 1 percent who wish to drag our country back to when the 99 percent were shut out of political life and only the few -- including American companies -- benefited from Venezuela's oil.
Let's not forget that some of those who supported ousting Venezuela's democratically elected government in 2002 are leading the protests today. Those involved in the 2002 coup immediately disbanded the Supreme Court and the legislature, and scrapped the Constitution. Those who incite violence and attempt similar unconstitutional actions today must face the justice system.
The American government supported the 2002 coup and recognized the coup government despite its anti-democratic behavior. Today, the Obama administration spends at least $5 million annually to support opposition movements in Venezuela. A bill calling for an additional $15 million for these anti-government organizations is now in Congress. Congress is also deciding whether to impose sanctions on Venezuela. I hope that the American people, knowing the truth, will decide that Venezuela and its people do not deserve such punishment, and will call upon their representatives not to enact sanctions.
Now is a time for dialogue and diplomacy. Within Venezuela, we have extended a hand to the opposition. And we have accepted the Union of South American Nations' recommendations to engage in mediated talks with the opposition. My government has also reached out to President Obama, expressing our desire to again exchange ambassadors. We hope his administration will respond in kind.
Venezuela needs peace and dialogue to move forward. We welcome anyone who sincerely wants to help us reach these goals.

Abstract: A drop in euro zone inflation, to the lowest rate since 2009, has raised new questions about whether its economy is stuck in doldrums that could last for years and, if so, whether the European Central Bank can or will do anything about it. The central bank, which will meet to discuss monetary policy on Thursday, now faces intensified criticism that it is not fulfilling its mandate to keep inflation below, but close to, 2 percent.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- A drop in euro zone inflation, to the lowest rate since 2009, has raised new questions about whether its economy is stuck in doldrums that could last for years and, if so, whether the European Central Bank can or will do anything about it.
Official data Monday showing that annual inflation in March was just 0.5 percent, according to preliminary estimates, inflamed an issue that had already polarized economists and policy makers.
Some say there is nothing to worry about, that slumping prices in countries like Greece and Portugal are part of a necessary correction in competitiveness.
Another camp, though, says it sees Europe slipping over the precipice of deflation, an especially pernicious species of economic woe because it is so hard to reverse. When prices are falling on a broad front, consumers delay major purchases because they expect prices to drop even more. Companies suffer declines in sales and cannot invest or create jobs.
The new figures provide ammunition for those who are pressing for the European Central Bank to try to stimulate the euro zone economy. Still, few specialists expect the central bank to do so this week -- whether because the evidence of deflation is still not suitably compelling, or because the bank's remaining weapons are too limited to risk firing too soon.
The situation will have to get much worse before the central bank will take that risk, Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING Bank, said on Monday. "Is the situation bad enough? We don't think so."
Members of the too-soon-to-panic camp note that much of the unexpectedly low inflation the European Union statistics office reported resulted from falling energy prices, not slow growth.
Some analysts even dismissed the drop in annual inflation in March, which compared with a rate of 0.7 percent in March 2013, to the so-called Easter bunny effect. Easter is when travel companies typically raise their prices for package tours, a component of the Consumer Price Index. Easter is in April this year, meaning any such price increases also will come later than last year, when the holiday was in March.
But even people who do not expect deflation warn that very low inflation has other ill effects on a region still emerging from a debt crisis.
Subdued inflation means that governments, businesses and individuals in the vulnerable countries will find it even more difficult to repay their debts. A little inflation is good for borrowers, because it chips away at the overall debt burden.
"For me that's the biggest concern," said José Manuel Campa, former secretary of state for finance in Spain and now a professor at the IESE Business School in Barcelona and Madrid. Low inflation "just puts a much larger burden on the adjustment that needs to take place," he said.
Economists had expected prices to soften in March, after official data last week showed inflation in Germany at an unexpectedly low annual rate of 0.9 percent. In Spain, prices fell 0.2 percent. But analysts were surprised how much the rate fell.
The central bank, which will meet to discuss monetary policy on Thursday, now faces intensified criticism that it is not fulfilling its mandate to keep inflation below, but close to, 2 percent. Economists consider a little inflation a good thing, in part because it creates a buffer against deflation.
If inflation was as far above the 2 percent target as it now is below it, critics say, the central bank would have long ago raised interest rates to slow the economy.
"The E.C.B. should be concerned that they are losing their credibility," Mr. Campa said.
The problem for the central bank and its president, Mario Draghi, is that it has run out of easy options to influence the economy. The benchmark interest rate is already at a record low of 0.25 percent. The next step would have to be more radical and risky, like huge purchases of government or corporate bonds to pump money into the economy.
The Federal Reserve has used such quantitative easing to stimulate growth in the United States. But in the euro zone a similar strategy faces more problems. The euro zone does not have an equivalent to United States Treasury securities or a unified bond market. The central bank would have to buy bonds or other assets in the 18 countries that belong to the euro zone. Its decisions about how to distribute the purchases could easily expose the bank to charges it was favoring one country over another.
Measures like quantitative easing, said Mr. Brzeski, the ING economist, "are still controversial, and they are not easy to use." It is more likely that the central bank will focus on how much of the slowdown in inflation resulted from falling energy costs, and not from economic malaise, he said.
The core inflation rate, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose at a slightly more robust 0.8 percent rate in March. Still, that was down from a 1 percent rate in February. Energy prices dropped 2.1 percent in March from a year earlier, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics office.
Mr. Draghi has said low inflation is concentrated in crisis countries where falling prices are welcome and necessary to regain competitiveness on world export markets.
But that argument becomes more difficult to make when countries like Germany, where unemployment is low and growth is solid, also have very low inflation.
Mr. Brzeski predicted that the central bank would continue to offer assurances that it remained ready to act if necessary, while hoping that inflation picks up in coming months.
Recently even the German central bank, the Bundesbank, which is notoriously vigilant against inflation, has softened its tone. Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank's president and a member of the European Central Bank governing council, said recently that he did not rule out some form of quantitative easing as a last resort.
Such talk is intended to demonstrate European Central Bank resolve, and speech alone is likely to be the preferred policy for the time being. "The big balancing act for the E.C.B. right now is getting this message across without doing anything," Mr. Brzeski said, "and keeping their fingers crossed."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission approved measures on Monday that will free up more airwaves for Wi-Fi and wireless broadband. The agency also moved to help curb increasing cable rates for consumers, but in doing so cracked down hard on the ability of broadcast stations to negotiate jointly in competition with cable systems.
Perhaps the most significant move by the commission was to allow a broad swath of airwaves to be used for outdoor unlicensed broadband, clearing the way for a new generation of Wi-Fi networks and other uses of freely available airwaves.
Unlike the airwaves used for mobile phone traffic, which are licensed to a specific company, unlicensed spectrum can be used by anyone. Previous establishments of unlicensed airwaves led to innovations like garage-door openers, baby monitors, wireless microphones and Wi-Fi networks.
"This will make it easier for all of us to consume a wide range of content on our mobile devices, most notably high-definition video, without frustrating lags or delays," Mary L. Brown, director of technology and spectrum policy at Cisco Systems, said in a post on the company's blog.
The commission freed up 100 megahertz of airwaves in a very high frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum, known as the 5 gigahertz band, where another unlicensed band of similar size already exists.
The commission also approved rules to allow it to sell a separate band of licensed high-frequency spectrum to the highest bidder in an auction this year. A total of 65 megahertz of airwaves in three segments across what is known as the Advanced Wireless Services bands will be put up for sale under new technical rules that make the segments more compatible.
Last month, the commission wrapped up one auction of recently cleared airwaves and it is now preparing for at least two more. Together, the auctions will make large amounts of spectrum -- the airwaves on which mobile phones and wireless broadband operate -- available to consumers.
That, the commission hopes, will help ease the congestion that leads to dropped calls and slow loading of online material. The proceeds of the auctions will go to help build a nationwide emergency radio network for police, fire and other public safety workers.
"It was 2008 the last time the commission conducted an auction this significant," said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, "when the iPhone was in its infancy."
In a third action, the five-member commission approved new rules that prohibit the top four broadcast stations in a single market from acting together to negotiate fees with cable networks, a process that can result in higher consumer prices.
Cable networks generally pay local affiliates of the major broadcast networks for the right to distribute the broadcast signals in their cable service area. The commission said that the increasingly common practice of unaffiliated broadcasters' banding together to negotiate the deals has raised fee levels, which ultimately raise consumer prices.
But the National Association of Broadcasters said that the rules were unneeded or at least too restrictive. F.C.C. rules require broadcasters and cable companies to negotiate "in good faith," and the association noted that no local broadcaster had ever been found in violation.
"We would also note that broadcasters are not responsible for higher pay-TV bills," Dennis Wharton, an executive vice president of the association, said in a statement. "Pay-TV companies have been raising rates more than twice the rate of inflation for the last 20 years, according to Consumer Reports. The notion that a punitive crackdown on local TV stations will lead to lower cable rates is simply not credible."
While the retransmission measure was approved unanimously, the commission split 3-2, along party lines, on another proposal that directly affects broadcasters. The commission voted to close a loophole in television station ownership rules by clamping down on a practice known as joint sales agreements.
Those agreements allow one station to sell advertising time on another station in the same market even though the two broadcasters have different owners. Stations use the agreements to cut operating expenses, but the F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, said that it appeared that companies were using the agreements to get around rules that limit the number of stations a single owner can control in a given market.

Can We Close the Pay Gap?

Abstract: According to a report by the French academic Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, incomes for the top 1 percent in the United States grew by 31.4 percent from 2009 to 2012, but the bottom 99 percent saw their wages go up by only 0.4 percent during the same period.\n

Full text:   LONDON -- The issue of pay ratios has become the latest front in a worldwide debate about inequality and the widening gap between the top 1 percent and everyone else. In the United States, the financial reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act contained a provision that would force American companies to disclose the ratio of the compensation of their chief executive officer to the median compensation of their employees. Yet fierce criticism from the business sector has succeeded in delaying this measure for four years -- and counting.
Now the European Commission in Brussels has weighed in, with a proposal currently under discussion that the European Union's 10,000 listed companies reveal their pay ratios and allow shareholders to vote on whether they are appropriate. This has unleashed howls of protest against the European Union's unpopular, unelected commissioners. Fund managers have called the plan weird, and business leaders have objected that shareholders don't want such power.Pay ratio proposals, in fact, have a venerable history. In his 1941 essay "The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius," George Orwell advocated a limitation of incomes so that the best-paid would earn no more than 10 times the lowest-paid. But this was controversial territory, even for Orwell. A few paragraphs on, he retreated and wrote: "In practice it is impossible that earnings should be limited quite as rigidly as I have suggested."
Several decades earlier, that Gilded Age titan John Pierpoint Morgan had endorsed a 20 to 1 ratio between the head of a company and its average worker. That same ratio was recommended in the 1970s by the American management guru Peter F. Drucker.
Yet look where we are now: In 2012, the compensation received by chief executives of companies in the S.&P. 500 index was 354 times that of rank-and-file staff.
Companies are sensitive about revealing the pay differential between the bosses and the work force partly because the gap has become so extreme. Business leaders argue that they have to offer high rewards in order to compete in a global talent pool for well-qualified executives.
After big corporations threatened to quit the country, voters in Switzerland last year rejected a referendum that would have restricted the pay gap to a ratio of 12 to 1. But the proposition still garnered 35 percent support amid a heated campaign.
The idea of a global talent pool for chief executives is, however, largely a myth. Not one of the chief executives heading up the 142 American companies in the Fortune Global 500 at the end of 2012, for example, was an external hire from overseas. There was a little movement within Europe, but over all, poaching of chief executives from abroad accounted for only 0.8 percent of C.E.O. appointments in the Fortune Global 500.
Business leaders also argue that senior managers need incentives to drive the business forward, so their compensation must be linked to the performance of the corporation, usually through the offer of big share awards for meeting certain targets. The argument that chief executive pay must be linked to the performance of the company has driven share awards ever higher -- in Britain, as high as 700 percent of salary. But there is scant evidence to show a definite link between executive remuneration and a company's success.
On the contrary, some economists say that the practice of rewarding chief executives for boosting the share price (and consequently their own compensation) makes them too short-term in their focus. The way they are paid is thus at odds with the long-term success of the company.
Moreover, the manner in which chief executives are rewarded means that it is in their interests to keep work-force wages low, in order to contain costs. This may help to explain why we have seen executive remuneration continue to rise sharply during and after the financial crisis, while work-force wages have stagnated, struggling to keep up with inflation.
Last year, the top 10 most highly paid chief executives in the United States took home more than $100 million each; most of these rewards came from shares or stock options. The survey of 2,259 American chief executives found that, on average, their remuneration had risen by 8.47 percent. At the same time, the average family income was $51,017 -- little changed from the year before, and 9 percent less than its inflation-adjusted peak in 1999 of $56,080.
According to a report by the French academic Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, incomes for the top 1 percent in the United States grew by 31.4 percent from 2009 to 2012, but the bottom 99 percent saw their wages go up by only 0.4 percent during the same period. The economists conclude that the top 1 percent captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first two years of the recovery.
Widening pay gaps have added to concerns about inequality and economic instability. This is one reason regulators are struggling to find ways of making remuneration fairer or, failing that, enforcing disclosure that shows how unfair it is.
Brussels has tried to do this by introducing a law that comes into effect next year that will cap bankers' bonuses. Europe's highest-paid bankers will have their bonuses restricted to 100 percent of salary, or 200 percent with prior approval of shareholders. This is largely a British issue, since most of Europe's best-paid bankers reside in Britain.
But the bank bonus rule has seen banks making big efforts to get around it by allocating monthly allowances to their top bankers and executives to make up for lost bonuses. Banks argue that without global action on bonuses, they risk losing their top performers to Wall Street or Hong Kong.
There is probably some truth in this since bankers specifically tend to be more mobile than corporate chief executives. There is, however, a counterargument that bankers will now be more attracted to working in the European Union since their pay will generally be just as high and far more predictable than an annual bonus.
The European Union bonus saga is helpful in illustrating the often perverse consequences of trying to impose laws and regulations to limit top remuneration. In a similar fashion, President Bill Clinton's campaign pledge in 1991 to restrict top salaries to $1 million is often cited as the point at which chief executive pay started to skyrocket in America -- precisely because companies introduced payments of stock options to circumvent the rule.
A regulatory crackdown on high pay ratios can also hurt the very people it is trying to help. The imposition of a maximum pay ratio, for example, might see companies outsourcing the work of their lowest-paid employees, purely to make their figures look better.
But business is not immune to the public debate about inequality and pay distribution. There is evidence that big pay gaps can undermine employee morale, leading to strikes, more sick days and higher staff turnover. And pressure on corporate leaders to address large pay disparities because it would help their business perform more effectively can be persuasive.
There is an outside chance that business will reform itself, as some business leaders bemoan the pay scandals for inflicting damage on their sector's reputation. But expecting multimillionaires to take a voluntary pay cut is a long shot. It might be more effective to introduce structures that will tackle egregious pay awards before they are made.
In Germany, for example, the unusual system of a two-tier board structure for company governance has helped prevent top pay rising as fast as it has in other developed nations. A supervisory board, consisting half of shareholders and half of employees elected by the work force, has the ultimate power over executives and sets top pay.
In 2012, employee board members at Volkswagen forced through a 20 percent pay cut for the chief executive even though the company was making record profits. They felt the C.E.O.'s pay was too high, his bonus targets too easy and that work-force wages had been held down. This was widely seen in Germany as a response to the controversy over inequality after the financial crisis.
There is a growing chorus of voices in Britain arguing for the election of employees onto company boards or remuneration committees. This could become an important theme in the run-up to the next general election in 2015, given the way public debate has already focused on falling living standards.
Top chief executives worldwide often take home far more in one year than most people will earn in their entire lifetime. Yet the International Monetary Fund has recognized that reducing inequality leads to "faster and more durable growth." It is important that we put pressure on businesses and policy makers to develop measures to stop pay gaps opening up even further, and to share the rewards of success more fairly -- for everyone's benefit.

Abstract: The sharp drop in federal spending, which shaved a full percentage point off growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 amid the government shutdown in the fall and the automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress, should also moderate in 2014 because of a budget deal reached on Capitol Hill in January.

Full text:   The American economy grew by 2.6 percent in the final months of 2013, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, a slight uptick from its previous estimate but still well below the pace of growth recorded in the third quarter.
The revised data for last quarter, in what was the government's third and final estimate of economic growth for the period, reflected slightly healthier consumer spending than first thought.
The previous estimate for the months of October, November and December, reported in late February, was 2.4 percent. Thursday's slight upward adjustment was in line with expectations among economists on Wall Street. The pace in the third quarter was 4.1 percent.
Still, the 3.3 percent increase in personal consumption expenditures last quarter was the healthiest showing since the fourth quarter of 2010, when consumption rose 4.3 percent.
It also came despite wintry weather in many parts of the country during the final weeks of the holiday shopping season, which prompted some economists to conclude that underlying consumer behavior was somewhat more robust than recent data had suggested.
"The number for gross domestic product is good," said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in Rochester, N.Y. "It is not the exciting number that is typical of postrecession recoveries, but it is good enough. This has been a stumbling sort of recovery all along, and this number is a continuation of that pattern."
One part of the economy that has grown over all in recent years, the housing sector, seems to be slowing markedly.
The National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday that its index of pending home sales dropped 0.8 percent in February to 93.9, the eighth straight monthly decline and the lowest level for the index since October 2011.
The drop, showing demand for previously owned homes rather than new construction, reflects the impact of cold weather as well as the rise in interest rates since the spring of 2013.
As the Federal Reserve gradually eases up on its stimulus efforts and reduces the pace of its monthly bond purchases, 10-year note yields have crept up, pushing up rates for most mortgages. Housing was crushed in the recession of 2007 to 2009, but has rebounded in many parts of the country more recently.
One headwind for the economy in the first half of 2014, at least in terms of the picture provided by coming economic data, will be from the aftereffects of the big inventory gains recorded by businesses in the third quarter of 2013.
Unless demand turns out to be stronger than expected, those stockpiles will be drawn down gradually, reducing the rate of reported growth now.
On the other hand, some experts believe that consumer activity has been inhibited by the cold so far in 2014, so some catching-up might help growth as shoppers venture out again in April, May and June.
The sharp drop in federal spending, which shaved a full percentage point off growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 amid the government shutdown in the fall and the automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress, should also moderate in 2014 because of a budget deal reached on Capitol Hill in January.
That budget agreement also provides a bit more certainty for businesses in terms of what Washington will be laying out, something that has been lacking over the past few years because of repeated standoffs over government spending and the federal borrowing limit.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for unemployment dropped by 10,000 last week to 311,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Economists had been expecting a slight increase in initial claims, so that figure represented a potential bright spot for the labor market.
The four-week moving average for unemployment claims, which tends to be a bit more reliable than the more volatile week-to-week numbers, fell to 318,000, also an improvement from previous weeks and the healthiest rate in six months.
For the quarter, many economists predict the economy will expand at an annual rate of 1 to 2 percent.
Corporate profits rose by 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter, but for the year were up 4.6 percent, which suggested companies continued to improve profits at a slightly faster rate than overall economic growth, thanks in part to efficiency gains. While the stock market and corporate profits have been healthy in recent years, those gains have not translated into the kind of hiring experienced in previous recoveries.
With the arrival of spring and better weather, the thinking goes, the economy's momentum could pick up slightly. One indicator of what lies ahead will come next week, when the Labor Department reports figures for job creation and the unemployment rate in March.
Job creation was anemic in December and January, and came in well below expectations, but picked up a bit in February.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- Seeking to confront the deep economic problems that have helped fuel weeks of protests here, Venezuela's socialist-inspired government took a step on Monday toward easing strict currency controls and opened what it says will be a free market for the sale of dollars to Venezuelans.
The new exchange rate mechanism is intended to reduce the black market price of dollars, which had soared in recent months.
Yet the impact of the measure, which is similar to a system that was shut down in 2010, depends on how much money the government allows to change hands in the new market and how freely it allows the market to operate. Alejandro Grisanti, an economist for Barclays, said the change "makes the exchange rate system more flexible," adding, "And in that sense it's very positive for Venezuela."
The new system will operate in tandem with a base exchange rate of 6.3 bolívars to the dollar, which is reserved mainly for essential goods like food and medicine, and a secondary rate of about 11 bolívars to the dollar, used for some other types of imports.
The central bank said that the average rate of transactions on the system's first day was 51.86 bolívars to the dollar. In the black market, bolívars had been selling for close to 90 to the dollar but dropped to less than 60 in recent days after the government, which gets its dollars from selling oil, the nation's chief export, announced it would put the new system in effect.
The sharp difference between the official rate and the black market rate created an incentive to buy dollars from the government at the official rate -- claiming they were to be used for imports -- and then resell them at the black market rate, at an enormous profit. It was not clear if the move would add significantly to inflation by making it more costly to import goods. Venezuela has one of the world's highest rates of inflation, at more than 57 percent a year.
Also on Monday, the president of the National Assembly said a prominent opposition lawmaker was disqualified from serving in the Assembly because she had sought to speak at a meeting last week of the Organization of American States in Washington at the invitation of the Panamanian government, which allowed her to appear as a special representative of Panama.
The Assembly president, Diosdado Cabello, said that the lawmaker, María Corina Machado, had violated a prohibition against holding other public offices.
Ms. Machado "is no longer a deputy," said Mr. Cabello, who also repeated a previous call for a criminal investigation of Ms. Machado for her role in organizing the protests.
The move by Mr. Cabello, one of the country's most powerful politicians, was the latest in a crackdown on opposition leaders since protests began last month.
President Nicolás Maduro last month ordered the arrest of Leopoldo López, the leader of the Popular Will Party and an ally of Ms. Machado. He was accused of inciting violence in the protests.
And last week, the authorities arrested the mayor of San Cristóbal, the western city where the protests have been most intense, while another opposition mayor was sentenced to 10 and a half months in prison for failing to carry out a court order to remove street barricades.
At the same time, the death toll linked to the protests rose, with the government saying on Monday that a soldier and a pregnant woman had been shot to death in separate episodes near the barricades. The government says that more than 30 people have died.
The United States Embassy in Caracas announced that it would stop scheduling appointments with Venezuelans applying for new tourist visas because it was understaffed. It said the problem was a result of the expulsion of three consular officials last month by Venezuela, which had accused them of recruiting students for training in violent tactics.

Full text:   KIGALI, Rwanda -- On the 12th floor of the Kigali City Tower, a modern blue-glass office building on the side of one of this capital's famous hills, the latest endeavor in the effort to transform a tiny rural economy into a financial and high-tech hub is trying to find its footing.
A commodity exchange, with its dozen terminals and state-of-the-art software provided by Nasdaq, held its first six auctions over the past year -- a fledgling venture, but the kind that helps explain how a nation with no oil, natural gas or other major natural resources has managed to grow at such a rapid clip in recent years.
"The feeling was that it could serve the region and perhaps be a springboard for the rest of Africa," said Paul Kukubo, the chief executive of the commodity East Africa Exchange.
The swirl of potential, outsized ambitions and lingering problems like yawning income divides is typical of the story of booming Africa, which has caught the eye of foreign governments and corporations alike as a rich frontier for business. The International Monetary Fund said that economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa would average 6.1 percent this year, compared with 3.7 percent worldwide.
Critics respond that those gaudy numbers spring mostly from the sale of oil and gas reserves or valuable metals and minerals, and that the gains have been divvied up between the offshore accounts of the continent's plutocrats and foreign conglomerates.
Rwanda offers an alternative model, analysts say, a country where the economy has grown an average of nearly 8 percent over the last four years because of increased agricultural productivity, tourism and government spending on infrastructure and housing. Despite having a population of just around 12 million, the consulting firm A.T. Kearney last week named Rwanda the most attractive African market for retailers in its first ever African Retail Development Index.
"I can't imagine how they could have made better progress than they have over the past 20 years," said Michael Lalor, lead partner at the EY Africa Business Center in Johannesburg.
That 20-year starting point is not arbitrary, but the zero hour for a country once consumed by violence.
Outside the Finance Ministry here stands a memorial with a small purple flame dedicated to the 1994 genocide that serves as a reminder of the urgency behind the government's economic efforts. While preventing any semblance of a repeat of instability has been the principal justification for President Paul Kagame's tight grip on power, rising living standards have helped keep a lid on renewed tension.
"In terms of the economic model, I think it's a good example for the rest of Africa," said Amadou Sy, senior fellow in the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution. "Everybody has a vision but these guys have been successful. The record is there."
He said that Rwanda has outperformed most others in the region in terms of indebtedness, inflation and growth. "The only downside I see," he added, "I would really consult the political side."
Rwanda is heavily dependent on foreign assistance, which got slashed after a United Nations report accused the country of fostering a recent rebellion in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, squeezing the budget. The World Bank warned last year that the aid shock "clouds the economic outlook for Rwanda."
So now, more than ever, Rwanda is on the hunt for investors rather than donors. Last April, it sold $400 million in bonds to investors from around the globe, part of a record year for African bonds that underscored how a continent once known for debt relief found a world eager to take a stake in it.
The slowdown in China, tapering of bond buying by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the flight of capital from emerging markets have jeopardized some of the gains on the continent. But some analysts say that Rwanda has held up better than many and has continued to make tangible headway in living standards.
The nation has reduced the percentage of people living below the poverty line from 59 percent to 45 percent between 2001 and 2011, with the share of people living in extreme poverty falling faster. Life expectancy, literacy, primary school enrollment and spending on health care have all gained in recent years.
Beneath the heights of Kigali City Tower, the rusty corrugated iron roofs on the ramshackle one- and two-story buildings below testify to the challenge of Rwanda's goal: becoming a middle-income country. Beyond the city limits, an estimated 90 percent of the population is still employed in the country's terraced green hills, growing bananas, sorghum, potatoes and other crops, much of it subsistence farming.
Rwanda hopes to turn itself into an information-technology hub for the roughly 135 million people in the East African Community, a regional common market. The nation has wired itself with well over 1,000 miles of fiber optic cables, and last year the government signed a deal to build a 4G network that would cover 95 percent of the country.
"The strategic vision behind this is a knowledge economy," said Jean Philbert Nsengimana, the minister in charge of youth and information technology. "That's where we want to go, shifting from an agrarian base to a knowledge base, leapfrogging the industrial."
Rwanda faces stiff competition. Kenya has a thriving start-up scene and offices for Google, Intel and Microsoft, not to mention a much larger consumer market attracting foreign companies. But the smooth roads and lack of violent crime make Kigali ever more appealing compared with the gridlocked, more dangerous streets of Nairobi.
The Rwandan government famously banned plastic bags from the country to cut down on pollution. Motorcycle taxi drivers wear numbered vests and carry spare helmets for passengers without exception. As part of a modernization drive, the government demolished tens of thousands of huts with traditional grass-thatched roofs. To curb population growth, it offered free vasectomies and is embarking on a wide-ranging circumcision drive to reduce the number of HIV infections.
Elettra Pauletto, an analyst at Control Risks, a business-intelligence consultancy in London, said that while the country's rigidly enforced stability and efficiency can attract investment, it can be a double-edged sword for those, including businesses, that run afoul of it. The government took control of Kigali's Union Trade Center shopping mall after its principal owner went into exile in South Africa.
"It is a very authoritarian political environment," said Ms. Pauletto. "There can be a failure to respect the sanctity of contracts."
Human rights groups continue to assail the government for repressive political policies. The country has been engaged in a high-profile diplomatic dispute with South Africa over attacks on Rwandan dissidents living there, including the murder in January of the country's former spy chief, found strangled in a Johannesburg hotel room.
Meanwhile, nongovernmental organizations focused on development have praised the country's economic reforms, with the World Bank giving it high marks for the ease of doing business here, ranking Rwanda 32 out of 189 worldwide. It also put Rwanda above the United States for the simplicity of starting a new business.
"Getting started is really easy," said Clarisse Iribagiza, one of the founders of a technology company called HeHe. She said it took them one day to set up the company, for less than $40. Help from a government official is available through social media.
"If I need to get in touch with a minister, it's so much easier than when we started out," said Ms. Iribagiza, at a shared space called the Office where she worked alongside other young entrepreneurs. "Basically I've tweeted them and gotten feedback."
Like the commodities exchange, the Rwanda Stock Exchange, which opened its doors in 2011, is still finding its footing. Pierre Celestin Rwabukumba, 39, chief executive of the stock exchange and a former stockbroker in New York, returned to Rwanda in 2004, working first at the country's central bank.
"We started from blank paper nine years ago," he said of the stock exchange. Three years after getting its start, only two domestic companies, the brewer Bralirwa and Bank of Kigali, have had initial public offerings. But Mr. Rwabukumba said the Rwandan share index rose 44 percent last year, a sign in his view that the exchange, like the country itself, is headed in the right direction.
"We have order; we are straightforward, clear, clean -- it's a country governed by law," said Mr. Rwabukumba, sitting in his second-floor office in the Kigali City Tower.
A few floors up, Ara Nashera, 27, creative director at Zilencio Creativo, was working on a crowd-funding platform like Kickstarter called eNkunga, which seeks to harness the money exchanged via cellphones in Africa. The technology may be new to Rwanda but the concept is anything but.
"Community contributions are how people get a child to university, pay for a wedding," said Mr. Nashera. The city sprawled out behind him, with new office buildings springing up in the nascent downtown. "It's the old way," he said, "made new."

Full text:   Imagine a world in which the United States government -- not the private sector -- is the economy's indispensable entrepreneur, innovating at the frontiers of science and technology, able and willing to take risks and to persevere through uncertainty.
That is the world depicted in "The Entrepreneurial State," a recent book by Mariana Mazzucato, an economist at the University of Sussex who specializes in innovation. And it is, in fact, the way the United States has operated since World War II. Through the National Institutes of Health, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and other agencies and departments, the government has for decades gone beyond financing research and creating the conditions for innovation to occur; it has also envisioned the future, engaged in the riskiest experimentation and overseen the commercialization process.
Professor Mazzucato documents the leading role of the government in, for example, "all the technologies which make the iPhone smart," including the Internet, wireless systems, global positioning, voice activation and touch-screen displays. That is not to detract from Apple's role, but to put it into context. Without government, the technological revolution that has allowed iProducts to exist would not have happened.
Ditto the leading role of government in aviation and space technologies, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and more recently, in nanotechnology, which could be the next "general purpose" breakthrough, akin to electricity or computers.
The private sector never has been and never will be up to tasks like that. Even in the bygone heyday of Bell Labs, corporate investment was alongside, not in place of, government investment. Today, the scope, duration and cost of breakthrough research is either beyond the private sector's corporate and philanthropic resources or outside its profit model. A salient point in "The Entrepreneurial State," amplified in a review by Martin Wolf, the chief economics commentator of The Financial Times, is that corporations today often spend surplus cash on share buybacks rather than on fundamental innovation.
In brief then, it is an essential role of the federal government -- in the interest of tomorrow's prosperity -- to invest and engage in scientific and technological discovery. And it is a role the government has played well, until now. After rising steadily for decades, federal financing for research and development peaked in 2009, at $165.5 billion, bolstered by that year's stimulus spending. It has since sunk to levels last seen almost a decade ago, falling to $133.7 billion this fiscal year.
That roughly $32 billion drop is even greater when adjusted for inflation, and it encompasses both defense- and nondefense fields, including health, energy, the environment, climate, technology and electronics. One key area, basic science, received about $40 billion in the peak year 2009. Since then, it has fallen, to $30 billion last year, one of the sharpest declines ever. The future does not look much brighter. Constrained by austerity-induced budget caps, the research and development budget recently proposed by President Obama for fiscal year 2015 was only $135.4 billion, the lowest request of his presidency. Chances for more money on top of the budget caps, as Mr. Obama has called for, are virtually nil. And given that Congress invariably enacts less than the president asks for, the trend is all downhill.
Worse, the direction is unlikely to reverse as long as prevailing rhetoric reinforces the notion of an inefficient government sector versus a dynamic private sector. To win budget battles going forward, Democratic policy makers and administration officials must also win the debate in favor of entrepreneurial government. The fact that they have not successfully made that case in recent years is a result of both implacable Republican opposition and their own tendencies to exalt the private sector while ignoring its many roots in public spending.
Correcting that misimpression is crucial to building and sustaining support for public involvement in science and technology. Equally important is developing ways to ensure that taxpayers share in private-sector profits that ensue from government efforts. Fair and adequate corporate taxation is the obvious way, but that is currently a political non-starter. Non-tax models also need to be considered -- for instance, requiring recipients of federal grants to pay a portion of subsequent profits to the government or establishing a federally backed innovation fund that lets the government retain an equity stake in companies that use the fund.
The goal, as expressed by Professor Mazzucato, is not for taxpayer-provided research to spare the private sector from risks, but for government and the private sector to take risks together and enjoy the rewards as one.

Abstract: Since the mid-1980s, states in every region of the country have raised the local minimum wage, often numerous times. Minimum wage increases do lead to small price increases, mainly in restaurants, which are intensive users of low-paid workers.

Full text:   In the face of congressional inaction, the debate on raising the minimum wage is moving to the local level. As more cities and counties consider setting their own wage standards, they can learn from the policy experiments already underway.
Since the mid-1980s, states in every region of the country have raised the local minimum wage, often numerous times. Twenty-one states (and Washington, D.C.) currently have wage floors above the federal level ($7.25), and 11 of these raise them every year to account for inflation. Washington State currently has the highest, at $9.32; California's is set to increase to $10 on July 1, 2016.
More than 120 cities and counties have adopted living wage laws that set pay standards, many of them in the $12 to $15 range. These higher standards usually apply only to employees of city service contractors, like security guards, landscapers and janitors. In some cities, living wage laws cover workers at publicly owned airports or stadiums, as well as at shopping malls subsidized by local development funds. While the impact on the individual workers covered under these laws is often quite significant, their reach is rarely broad enough to affect the local low-wage labor market as a whole.
For this reason, cities and counties are now enacting higher local minimum wage policies that cover all work performed in the area. Cities as varied as Albuquerque, San Francisco, San Jose, Calif., Santa Fe, N.M., and Washington, D.C., have minimum wages ranging from $8.60 in Albuquerque to $10.74 in San Francisco. The District of Columbia, which is raising its minimum wage to $11.50 in 2016, wisely joined with two neighboring Maryland counties to create a regional standard.
Many more cities are getting ready to follow suit. Richmond, Calif., Oakland and Seattle are seriously considering setting their own minimum wage. The Richmond City Council just voted an increase that will go to $12.30 by 2017. Advocates in Oakland are aiming for $12.25. Seattle is discussing $15. Prodded by its new mayor, New York City is seeking the right to set its own minimum wage rate, instead of using New York State's.
With the national debate stuck in the same old rut, states and cities have again become laboratories of democracy. Are they on the right path? For the last 15 years we have been doing research on just this question.
One city we have studied in detail, San Francisco, has passed a dozen labor standards laws since the late 1990s. After adding the effects of other local laws mandating employers to pay for sick leave and health spending, the minimum compensation standard at larger firms in San Francisco reaches $13. Our studies show that the impact of these laws on workers' wages (and access to health care) is strong and positive and that none of the dire predictions of employment loss have come to pass. Research at the University of New Mexico on Santa Fe's floor (now $10.66) found similar results.
These are not isolated cases. Research on the effects of differing minimum wage rates across state borders confirms the results of the city studies. But how can minimum wage increases not have negative effects on employment? After all, according to basic economic theory, an increase in the price of labor should reduce employer demand for labor.
That's not the whole story, though. A full analysis must include the variety of other ways labor costs might be absorbed, including savings from reduced worker turnover and improved efficiency, as well as higher prices and lower profits. Modern economics therefore regards the employment effect of a minimum-wage increase as a question that is not decided by theory, but by empirical testing.
Our research and that of other scholars illuminates how businesses actually absorb minimum wages at low-wage industries. Higher standards have an immediate effect in reducing employee turnover, leading to significant cost savings. Minimum wage increases do lead to small price increases, mainly in restaurants, which are intensive users of low-paid workers. How much? A 10 percent minimum wage increase adds 0.7 cents on the dollar to restaurant prices. Price increases in most other sectors, like retail, are too small to be visible, partly because retail pays more than restaurants.
Even if Congress finally acts to raise the federal minimum wage, higher standards at the state and local level still make sense. It will surprise no one that living costs are generally higher in cities than in rural areas. They often vary among cities in the same state. The New York City metro area is 26 percent more expensive than upstate Utica; costs in the San Jose metro area are 30 percent higher than in El Centro, in southeastern California. Policy makers need to take these variations into account. This is not just a theoretical idea. It has long been policy in Japan. Minimum wages in Tokyo and Osaka are as much as 30 percent higher than they are in regions with the lowest cost of living.
Here's another way to think about it. One measure of employers' latitude to absorb higher wages compares the minimum wage to the median wage. From the 1960s into the 1970s, the minimum-median ratio in the United States varied between 41 and 55 percent. Since the mid-1980s, it has been much lower, varying between 33 and 39 percent. A minimum wage increase to $10.10 by 2016, as President Obama proposed earlier this year, would restore the national ratio to 50 percent. By comparison, San Francisco's $10.74 minimum wage is 40 percent of the city's median wage. In other words, although some of the proposed rates may seem high by national standards, they look more reasonable when measured against local wage levels.
Local minimum wages also represent a response to growing inequality within cities, in too many of which a growing army of low-paid workers -- maids, gardeners, janitors, restaurant and security workers -- provide personal services to an increasingly well-heeled minority.
The record is clear. Employers can afford to pay higher wages that raise families out of poverty and bear a closer relation to local living costs. And there's a moral value, too. An increase in the local minimum wage restores, on a very personal level, some of our notion of fairness.

Full text:   There don't seem to be any major economic crises underway right this moment, and policy makers in many places are patting themselves on the back. In Europe, for example, they're crowing about Spain's recovery: the country seems set to grow at least twice as fast this year as previously forecast.
Unfortunately, that means growth of 1 percent, versus 0.5 percent, in a deeply depressed economy with 55 percent youth unemployment. The fact that this can be considered good news just goes to show how accustomed we've grown to terrible economic conditions. We're doing worse than anyone could have imagined a few years ago, yet people seem increasingly to be accepting this miserable situation as the new normal.
How did this happen? There were multiple reasons, of course. But I've been thinking about this question a lot lately, in part because I've been asked to discuss a new assessment of Japan's efforts to break out of its deflation trap. And I'd argue that an important source of failure was what I've taken to calling the timidity trap -- the consistent tendency of policy makers who have the right ideas in principle to go for half-measures in practice, and the way this timidity ends up backfiring, politically and even economically.
In other words, Yeats had it right: the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.
About the worst: If you've been following economic debates these past few years, you know that both America and Europe have powerful pain caucuses -- influential groups fiercely opposed to any policy that might put the unemployed back to work. There are some important differences between the U.S. and European pain caucuses, but both now have truly impressive track records of being always wrong, never in doubt.
Thus, in America, we have a faction both on Wall Street and in Congress that has spent five years and more issuing lurid warnings about runaway inflation and soaring interest rates. You might think that the failure of any of these dire predictions to come true would inspire some second thoughts, but, after all these years, the same people are still being invited to testify, and are still saying the same things.
Meanwhile, in Europe, four years have passed since the Continent turned to harsh austerity programs. The architects of these programs told us not to worry about adverse impacts on jobs and growth -- the economic effects would be positive, because austerity would inspire confidence. Needless to say, the confidence fairy never appeared, and the economic and social price has been immense. But no matter: all the serious people say that the beatings must continue until morale improves.
So what has been the response of the good guys?
For there are good guys out there, people who haven't bought into the notion that nothing can or should be done about mass unemployment. The Obama administration's heart -- or, at any rate, its economic model -- is in the right place. The Federal Reserve has pushed back against the springtime-for-Weimar, inflation-is-coming crowd. The International Monetary Fund has put out research debunking claims that austerity is painless. But these good guys never seem willing to go all-in on their beliefs.
The classic example is the Obama stimulus, which was obviously underpowered given the economy's dire straits. That's not 20/20 hindsight. Some of us warned right from the beginning that the plan would be inadequate -- and that because it was being oversold, the persistence of high unemployment would end up discrediting the whole idea of stimulus in the public mind. And so it proved.
What's not as well known is that the Fed has, in its own way, done the same thing. From the start, monetary officials ruled out the kinds of monetary policies most likely to work -- in particular, anything that might signal a willingness to tolerate somewhat higher inflation, at least temporarily. As a result, the policies they have followed have fallen short of hopes, and ended up leaving the impression that nothing much can be done.
And the same may be true even in Japan -- the case that motivated this article. Japan has made a radical break with past policies, finally adopting the kind of aggressive monetary stimulus Western economists have been urging for 15 years and more. Yet there's still a diffidence about the whole business, a tendency to set things like inflation targets lower than the situation really demands. And this increases the risk that Japan will fail to achieve "liftoff" -- that the boost it gets from the new policies won't be enough to really break free from deflation.
You might ask why the good guys have been so timid, the bad guys so self-confident. I suspect that the answer has a lot to do with class interests. But that will have to be a subject for another column.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDRobert S. Strauss, who rose from the Texas Plains to become an influential Washington insider, leading the Democratic Party and hopscotching among White House posts when not making millions as a lobbyist and deal maker, died on Wednesday in Washington. He was 95.
His law firm, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, confirmed his death.
Mr. Strauss was known for a quick wit and a rough-hewn persuasiveness that recalled his small-town roots and enhanced his prowess among a vanishing breed of back-room power brokers. His knowledge, contacts and instincts -- reaching across parties and administrations -- ran so deep that he was almost invariably included in the tiny, powerful fraternity known as Washington's "wise men."
He called himself a "centrist, a worker, a doer, a putter-together."
As chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Strauss helped mastermind his party's recapture of the White House in 1976 with the election of Jimmy Carter after Senator George McGovern's resounding defeat in 1972. He went on to become a trusted adviser to Mr. Carter, serving as special trade representative, a negotiator in Middle East peace talks and chief adviser to Mr. Carter's anti-inflation campaign.
It was Mr. Strauss whom Nancy Reagan asked to tell her husband, President Ronald Reagan, that the Iran-contra arms-for-hostages scandal was corroding his administration and that he had to make changes. It was Mr. Strauss whom President George Bush in 1991 appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union, even after he told the president that he had never voted for him for anything. Mr. Strauss became ambassador to the newly non-Communist Russian Federation.
Bob Woodward wrote in his book "Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate" (1999) that when some Republican leaders in the House of Representatives were having second thoughts about impeaching President Bill Clinton, they turned to Mr. Strauss to ask other Republican leaders to consider censure instead.
Through the law firm he co-founded -- Akin, Gump -- Mr. Strauss deftly navigated the territory where business and government intersect and deals are made. Over Thanksgiving dinner in 1990 at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan, he brokered final details of Matsushita Electric's takeover of MCA for $6.6 billion. His reported $8 million fee was split between both sides, because he had represented both.
Afterward, he told a Washington Post reporter that, as usual, he had not counted hours to arrive at his fee. "I don't do windows," he said.
Mr. Strauss's effectiveness owed much to his vivid personality. In 1978, as special trade representative, he startled Nobuhiko Ushiba, his Japanese counterpart, by embracing him and shouting: "Brother Ushiba, you're crazy as hell!" The laughter lowered tensions.
When Mr. Carter ordered White House personnel to fly coach, reporters asked Mr. Strauss if he would still fly first-class. "Yes," he said, "unless there is something better."
Others joked about Mr. Strauss's cultivation of the role of "insider's insider." Jim Wright, the former House speaker and a fellow Texan, said of him, "It's an honor to have with us a close friend of the next president of the United States -- whoever the hell he may be."
Some sneered at such dexterity. Michael Kinsley, writing in The New Republic in 1988, questioned whether Mr. Strauss had any ideology whatsoever or had ever had a principled disagreement with anyone. He called Mr. Strauss "99 percent hot air."
But few disagreed that Mr. Strauss operated as a sort of human political switchboard. (He sent candy to the real switchboard operators at the White House and Christmas cards to 4,000 close friends.)
"People call Bob back," Harry McPherson, a White House aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson, said in an interview with The New York Times in 1987. "He's inside the circuit, he's a conveyor of information. He's got a lot of ideas, not all of them good, but he's part of the flow. That's why you want him at your meeting."
Robert Schwarz Strauss was born on Oct. 19, 1918, in Lockhart, Tex. His father, Charles, immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1915 hoping to become a concert pianist, but the closest he came was selling pianos on the road. He met Edith V. Schwarz on a sales trip. They married and remained in Texas, moving first to Hamlin and then to nearby Stamford, where they had a general store.
Mr. Strauss's mother had lofty ambitions for him, predicting he would be the first Jewish governor of Texas. He said he did not remember anti-Semitism growing up in a town with almost no Jews.
While attending the University of Texas, Mr. Strauss worked for the successful campaign of Travis B. Dean for the State Legislature and was rewarded with a patronage job as a committee clerk. He went on to help Lyndon B. Johnson in a congressional campaign and John B. Connally, a future governor of Texas, in his campaign for student body president.
After graduating from the University of Texas School of Law in 1941, Mr. Strauss was recruited by the F.B.I. to be an agent. "It was a way of not getting drafted," he told The New Yorker in 1979.
With his friend Richard Gump he formed the Akin, Gump law firm in Dallas in 1945, specializing in energy law. (They opened a Washington office in 1971. "Washington looked like a sitting duck," he told The Washington Post Magazine in 1982.)
His political stock rose in 1962, when he helped elect Mr. Connally governor of Texas; the new governor named him to the state bank board. He attracted larger notice in 1968 by managing Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey's presidential campaign in Texas. Mr. Strauss persuaded Mr. Connally and his archrival, the more liberal Senator Ralph Yarborough, to set aside their feud and join forces to help Mr. Humphrey. The vice president carried Texas by one percentage point, though he lost the election narrowly to Richard M. Nixon.
Mr. Connally named Mr. Strauss that year to Texas' slot on the Democratic National Committee. Within a year Mr. Strauss was a member of its executive committee. Elected party treasurer in 1970, he cut the Democrats' $9 million debt by two-thirds and found new ways to raise money, like direct mail.
After serving as chairman of the National Committee to Re-elect a Democratic Congress in 1972, he was elected Democratic national chairman that December, after Mr. McGovern's defeat. He strove to unite the party's bitterly divided factions.
A seemingly minor decision had large import: Mr. Strauss named Mr. Carter, then governor of Georgia, to be chairman of the Democrats' 1974 Congressional campaign effort. Mr. Carter used the job to travel the nation and lay the groundwork for his own 1976 presidential campaign.
Mr. Strauss then smoothed Mr. Carter's path to the White House by running the Democrats' 1976 convention at Madison Square Garden in New York as a well-received television extravaganza -- a sharp contrast with the ideological blood battles of the 1968 and '72 conventions. Such disparate figures as Coretta Scott King and former Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama addressed the delegates.
After Mr. Carter's election Mr. Strauss resigned as the unpaid party chairman to practice law, but he joined the administration in March 1977 as special representative for trade negotiations with the rank of ambassador. He pushed to complete the Tokyo round of trade talks, culminating in the Trade Act of 1979. Soon he was appointed Mr. Carter's chief anti-inflation adviser.
"His program was to pick up the phone and swear -- and he was very good at it," Alfred E. Kahn, chairman of the Council on Wage and Price Stability at the time, told The New Yorker.
In April 1979 Mr. Strauss became Mr. Carter's personal representative to the Middle East peace talks, which then concerned Palestinian autonomy in the Israeli-occupied territories. Years later, speaking to The Los Angeles Times, an unidentified friend quoted Mr. Strauss's response to getting the assignment.
"The first thing I'm going to do is go to Israel and court Premier Begin's wife like she was an 18-year-old schoolgirl," Mr. Strauss said, according to the friend, referring to Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
"Then I'll go to Egypt and court Sadat's wife the same way," he continued, referring to President Anwar el-Sadat. Before long, Mr. Strauss predicted, "one of those ladies is going to turn around in bed to her husband and say: 'You know, that little Bobby Strauss is not such a bad guy. Why don't you do something nice for him?' "
Five months later he resigned to become chairman of Mr. Carter's 1980 re-election campaign. After Mr. Carter lost to Reagan, Mr. Strauss slipped into the role of unofficial adviser to the new president and a lunchtime companion of Mrs. Reagan's.
"Bob Strauss is a very loyal friend," Mr. Carter remarked. "He waited a whole week after the election before he had dinner with Ronald Reagan."
Mr. Carter awarded Mr. Strauss the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981.
Mr. Strauss's wife of 65 years, the former Helen Jacobs, died in 2006. He is survived by his sons, Robert and Richard; his daughter, Susan Strauss Breen; his brother, Theodore; and seven grandchildren.
If Mr. Strauss sometimes seemed glib, he insisted it served a purpose. Speaking to The New Yorker, he readily conceded that his influence came from knowing the right people.
"I have a pretty good encyclopedia of America, but I couldn't recite it," he said. "If you mention a town to me, I know who the mayor or the sheriff or the commissioner is, and whether he is reliable or unreliable."
Correction: March 21, 2014, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Thursday about the former Democratic Party chairman and White House official Robert S. Strauss misidentified the president who awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It was Jimmy Carter, not Ronald Reagan.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve further curtailed its economic stimulus campaign on Wednesday, even as it said the effort would continue for the foreseeable future given the enduring consequences of the Great Recession.
The Fed, as expected, announced it would reduce its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by $10 billion, to $55 billion, because of its confidence that the four-year-old recovery is finally becoming self-sustaining.
The Fed also signaled its intention to keep short-term interest rates near zero after the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. Investors, however, drew the conclusion that the central bank might begin to raise short-term interest rates, which it has held near zero since December 2008, well before the end of 2015.
But Janet L. Yellen, in her first news conference as the Fed's new chairwoman, sought to offset that optimism, saying the committee intended to raise short-term rates only gradually, because the economic environment remains weak. Importantly, she said, the Fed expected to conclude the process with rates still below the historically normal level of 4 percent.
Noting that growth had repeatedly disappointed expectations in recent years, Ms. Yellen said that some Fed officials had concluded "that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower at least for a time." She cited the lingering effects of the recession, including unpaid debts and difficulties in obtaining loans. It was the first time the Fed officially predicted that the economy might not recover completely.
The Fed is taking two different tacks in its approach to its stimulus campaign. The central bank's retreat from its bond-buying campaign has been clear and consistent, and it remains on track to end the current round of bond buying this fall. But its plans for interest rates only created confusion on Wednesday.
The Federal Open Market Committee said on Wednesday, in a statement issued after a two-day meeting, that it planned to keep short-term rates near zero "for a considerable time" after the bond buying ends, particularly if inflation remains sluggish. That guidance replaced the Fed's 15-month-old declaration that it planned to wait at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent.
The latest statement -- the longest one the committee has ever published -- was careful to say that the change in guidance was not intended to alter the possible timing of a rate increase. Instead, Ms. Yellen said that new measuring sticks were necessary because the unemployment rate had fallen more quickly than expected, while other economic indicators, like inflation, remained weak.
"The purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the past, even though it is qualitative information, as the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 percent," Ms. Yellen said.
But the Fed also released a separate set of economic forecasts showing that officials had raised their expectations for the level of their benchmark rate at the end of 2015 to 1 percent from 0.75 percent.
And, when asked to define "a considerable time," Ms. Yellen responded, "This is the kind of term that's hard to define, but it probably means something on the order of around six months or that kind of thing." She added that the exact timing of a rate increase would depend on economic conditions. Investors, however, focused on the words "six months," which suggested a first rate increase in the spring of 2015 -- six months after the expected end of bond purchases, and considerably earlier than the timing they previously expected.
The stock market fell on her words. The S.&P. 500 was down 0.61 percent on the day. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.77 percent.
"It is hard to know if Yellen wanted the market, which has taken it hard on the chin following that particular remark, to start thinking of a mid-2015 hike, but that is what was implied by her statement," Millan L. Mulraine, deputy head of research at TD Securities, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday afternoon.
The strategy shift has prompted internal debate.
Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and one of the most ardent proponents of the view that the Fed is not doing enough to stimulate the economy, voted against the new guidance. He has argued that the Fed should adopt a new unemployment threshold of 5.5 percent. Mr. Kocherlakota said that the Fed's move called into question its commitment to reviving inflation and created uncertainty "that hinders economic activity."
The Fed's predictions that the economy would grow more quickly in 2014 have not come true so far. Cold weather and winter storms in some parts of the country appear to have suppressed economic activity. Car sales, for example, fell sharply in January in the coldest parts of the country, according to a recent analysis.
But it is not clear whether the cold is a complete explanation, and officials have said that judging the cold's impact will take time -- and warmer weather.
"We probably overdid the optimism in January," Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday.
The focus of the Fed's concern is shifting from the high level of unemployment to the low pace of inflation. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, an index of personal consumption expenditures, rose 1.1 percent in the 12 months ending in January, below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed has made its target.
Officials see this as a symptom of the broader malaise, and they expect inflation to rebound alongside the economy. Ms. Yellen also noted on Wednesday that monetary policy affects the economy slowly, a point she often makes to emphasize that current conditions are not the right scorecard.
But the committee's statement once again ratcheted up the Fed's focus on inflation, and Ms. Yellen said that even the continued retreat from bond buying depended on the Fed's confidence that inflation would rise. "We need to see evidence that leaves us feeling satisfied that inflation will move up over time," she said.
Still, the Fed's statement and the economic projections of its officials made it clear that the central bank remained basically optimistic about the economy.
The Fed appeared "to be more confident about the transitory nature of the recent slowing in economic activity and in the sustainability of the underlying economic recovery," said Gennadiy Goldberg, United States strategist at TD Securities.
The economic forecasts of Fed officials pointed to slightly softer growth and a marginally faster decline in unemployment. They predicted that growth would be no greater than 3 percent in 2014, compared to a December ceiling of 3.2 percent; unemployment was predicted to fall as low as 6.1 percent, rather than 6.3 percent.
Those two trends would ordinarily move in opposite directions. But economic weakness since the recession has steadily reduced the unemployment rate by convincing people without jobs to stop looking for work.
Fed officials now forecast that the unemployment rate in 2016 will reach a new equilibrium between 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent, meaning that they do not believe the rate can be further reduced without precipitating inflation. That is about a percentage point higher than the prerecession rate.

Abstract: A shift toward looser guidance also reflects the reality that Fed officials do not agree about the end point for their campaign, because they have different views about how much of the damage wrought by the Great Recession, in particular the sharp drop in labor force participation, can still be fixed by encouraging borrowing and other forms of financial risk.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen is taking over the leadership of the Federal Reserve on the cusp of a more challenging period for the central bank.
For the last several years, Fed officials largely agreed that more had to be done to reduce unemployment and revive inflation. As the economy recovers, however, there are signs that old differences are returning as the Fed emphasizes clear communication as its primary policy tool.
"It's a much tougher job to manage this committee than Bernanke had, because we're at more of a transitional point," said Julia Coronado, chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas, referring to Ben S. Bernanke, Ms. Yellen's predecessor. "We're not in a crisis, we're kind of recovering to a degree -- and then the question is, How much can monetary policy do?"
The immediate challenge confronting Ms. Yellen, who as Fed chairwoman will lead her first meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee on Tuesday and Wednesday, is to overhaul the Fed's forward guidance for short-term interest rates.
The Fed is gradually ending the expansion of its bond holdings, one aspect of its economic stimulus campaign. It is widely expected to announce on Wednesday that it will add $55 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in April, down from $65 billion in March and $85 billion each month last year. Fed officials say they intend to end purchases in the fall unless the economic outlook changes sharply.
But officials have offered much less clarity about the policy they regard as the centerpiece of the stimulus campaign, the Fed's effort to suppress borrowing costs for businesses and consumers not just by holding short-term interest rates near zero, but also by convincing investors that rates will remain low for some time.
In December 2012, the Fed said that it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as unemployment, which was 7.9 percent at the time, remained above 6.5 percent. Officials have since concluded that the rapid fall in the official unemployment rate -- to 6.7 percent in February -- overstates the labor market's recovery. They agree that the Fed should tell investors that rates will remain low well past that threshold, but a small minority of officials are pushing for a clearly defined new threshold. Most officials instead want to provide a more general description of the economic objectives for the policy.
They argue that the task of calibrating monetary policy is inherently becoming more complicated as the economy recovers, like the difference between sailing quickly toward an island and then maneuvering slowly into the harbor.
John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that describing the Fed's plans in terms of a broader set of economic indicators would be more vague, but also more accurate. "How to do that without going to dates and using numbers, that will be the art of crafting how we communicate," he said.
The Bank of England last month made a similar shift, replacing a statement that it intended to keep interest rates at a low level at least as long as British unemployment remained above 7 percent with a long description of the factors it planned to consider before raising rates, emphasizing that the economy still had considerable "spare capacity." Some Fed officials, including William C. Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have cited a "qualitative rather than quantitative" approach as a useful model.
A shift toward descriptive guidance could diminish the potency of the Fed's effort to suppress interest rates if investors find the goals less clear or more likely to shift. The Bank of England has struggled to dissuade investors who continue to bet that it will raise rates sooner than the timetable implied by its forecasts.
But the Fed is unlikely to face an immediate test of its credibility because the economy remains weak. "Their job is being made easier by the fact that the data is reinforcing their message of patience," Ms. Coronado said. "In contrast to the Bank of England, which is fighting strong data and trying to convince the market that they're going to be low for long, everyone believes the Fed right now."
A shift toward looser guidance also reflects the reality that Fed officials do not agree about the end point for their campaign, because they have different views about how much of the damage wrought by the Great Recession, in particular the sharp drop in labor force participation, can still be fixed by encouraging borrowing and other forms of financial risk. As the debate moves, in effect, from picking a neighborhood to picking a house, disagreements are likely to intensify.
"When unemployment was so high and inflation was so low, it was just a debate about how much we should do, and eventually we'll be in a situation where it won't be so obvious what we should do," Mr. Williams said.
He added that Ms. Yellen, who hired him as research director when she was president of the San Francisco Fed, was well suited to the challenge.
"She's seen as and is a fair person, and she'll be listening to counterarguments, she'll be trying to find a consensus, but at the same time she has strong views and a very determined sense of what our purpose is at the Fed and how we can be set to achieve it," he said. "Her willingness to entertain conflicting views, accept differences of opinion but at the same time say, 'Here's where we are coming out at the end of the day,' that will be her strong suit."
Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, said that growing divisions would also be a cause for celebration, because they would show the economy was returning to health.
"The only time it should be obvious and you should be seeing unanimous votes is when you're far away from where you want to be," Mr. Posen said. When the economy is closer to normal health, "You should expect lots of split votes, if people are really voting their conscience, because you should be close to the right policy and therefore there should be fine judgments."

Abstract: Russia is facing its own fiscal challenges in the months and years ahead, as revenue growth from oil and natural gas is projected to slow precipitously and the Kremlin confronts big bills from salary increases for the police, the military and other public workers that preceded Mr. Putin's return to the presidency in 2012.

Full text:   YALTA, Crimea -- Many A.T.M.s in this sun-dappled seaside resort city in Crimea, and across the region, have been empty in recent days, with little white "transaction denied" slips piling up around them. Banks that do have cash have been imposing severe restrictions on withdrawals.
All flights, other than those to or from Moscow, remain canceled in what could become the norm if the dispute over Crimea's political status drags on, a chilling prospect just a month before tourist season begins in a place beloved as a vacation playground since czarist times.
Even with the West imposing sanctions to punish Russia's invasion of Crimea, President Vladimir V. Putin faces a far steeper financial liability as he pushes to annex the peninsula, which lacks a self-sustaining economy and depends heavily on mainland Ukraine for vital services, including electricity and fresh water.
"Ukraine can quite easily cut off Crimea," said Oleksandr Zholud, an economist with the International Center for Policy Studies in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. "From an economic point of view it looks like a sinkhole."
In January, the Crimean Parliament adopted a 2014 budget of about $540 million, of which about $300 million was expected to come from the central government in Kiev. Crimean officials in recent days have said they now expect Moscow to fill the gap.
The potentially large price tag has arisen at a time when Russia itself is bracing for a severe economic slowdown, making annexation a far more complicated calculation for Mr. Putin and his advisers despite huge public support for reclaiming primacy over Crimea.
Crimea and Russia have deep linguistic, historic and cultural ties, and the peninsula holds a nostalgic place in the minds of many Russians as a summer destination and popular retirement spot, where czars and Politburo chairmen kept vacation homes -- including the last Soviet president, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was briefly exiled to his dacha in the Crimean town of Foros, overlooking the Black Sea, during a coup attempt in 1991.
Russia's regional development minister, Igor N. Slyunayev, has offered a sobering assessment of the peninsula's infrastructure needs.
"The peninsula is not self-sufficient when it comes to the entire group of vitally important resources -- first of all, electricity and water," Mr. Slyunayev said in a question-and-answer interview with the Russian newspaper Kommersant. "About 80 percent of water comes to its territory through the northern Crimean canal from the Dnieper River. Also, 80 percent of Crimea depends on imports of electricity."
In a bleak bottom-line assessment that many residents here would dispute, Mr. Slyunayev said, "Today, our Crimea looks no better than Palestine."
The authorities here have waved aside concerns about public salaries, pensions and other costs, saying Moscow will cover them. But while Mr. Putin and Russian lawmakers have made reassuring statements, including some promises of more than $1 billion in immediate aid, there are no guarantees.
Russia is facing its own fiscal challenges in the months and years ahead, as revenue growth from oil and natural gas is projected to slow precipitously and the Kremlin confronts big bills from salary increases for the police, the military and other public workers that preceded Mr. Putin's return to the presidency in 2012.
The financial costs are just one reason that annexation is easier said than done.
Fully absorbing Crimea is a potentially herculean undertaking, which would require issuing new passports, changing the currency to rubles from Ukrainian hryvnias, and integrating completely distinct systems for property records, taxes, legal disputes and more.
The process is also fraught with risks, including the possibility that the Ukrainian government could move to further isolate the geographically remote peninsula by shutting vital transportation lines.
There is no overland transportation link between Russia and Crimea, and building a bridge across the shortest waterway, near the Crimean city of Kerch, would take years and cost an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion.
The costs for Russia -- and for Crimeans -- could also rise sharply, experts said, if political instability disrupts the peninsula's major industries, particularly tourism and banking, which are already suffering.
A.T.M.'s have been empty as banks, most based in mainland Ukraine, face obstacles delivering currency, and grapple with mounting concerns about long-term business risks. If world leaders refuse to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, flights could be restricted for years, as they are in northern Cyprus, which has direct air links only with Turkey.
At a minimum, Kiev's strong leverage over utilities and other vital services stands to force the Kremlin into negotiations with the new Ukrainian leaders whom Mr. Putin has denounced as illegitimate and has so far refused to meet.
Last week, in a meeting with the country's top economic officials, including the ministers of finance and economics and the head of the central bank, Mr. Putin expressed his own concerns about Russia's financial prospects.
"Let me say that the current and forecast growth rates the government has given cannot satisfy us in any way," he said, according to a Kremlin transcript. "We must step up the pace of development.
"Above all, we need to maintain the existing general macroeconomic stability," Mr. Putin said. "We need to be ready to respond rapidly to both internal and external risks -- and they are not getting any fewer -- ensure that the budgets at all levels are executed and keep inflation at an acceptably low level."
Mr. Slyunayev, the regional development minister, said he believed that the government in Kiev would be reasonable and not cut off essential services but might begin charging for water and electric service. "Ukrainian authorities will not provoke a humanitarian crisis," he told Kommersant.
While financial markets reacted with tentative calm to the Crimean secession vote, the economic sanctions announced by the United States and Europe, and the prospect of a renewed cold war with the West, present just the type of external risk that could destabilize the Russian economy at a moment of vulnerability, experts said.
One immediate risk is a continued decline in foreign investment, though the fear of sanctions may result in a positive effect for Russia by driving home assets that Russian citizens and businesses had stockpiled overseas.
"Private sector capital flight may have been partially neutralized by the return of official assets," Timothy Ash, an analyst with Standard Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Monday offering analysis in the aftermath of the referendum here.
Some Crimeans said they were already feeling the financial sting from political instability.
As crowds in the cities of Simferopol and Sevastopol held raucous celebrations well into Monday morning after the vote, here in Yalta, Ihor B., the owner of a small travel business, went to bed with a growing sense of dread: The roughly two dozen bookings that he had received since the start of the year had all disappeared.
"I got 10 requests from Germany, and 10 assignments from Ukrainian agencies for Western tourists; a couple of requests from Dutch tourists and cruise ships," said Mr. B, who asked that his last name not be used for fear of reprisal by the new Russian government. "At the moment, all of them, absolutely all of them, are canceled."
Mr. B., whose two grown children live and work in Kiev, said the majority of tourists who visited Crimea came from mainland Ukraine. They are likely to go to Odessa or other destinations this year, because of fear over the political unrest, he said.
Boris Perederko, the deputy director of the Bristol Hotel here, said he supported the outcome of the referendum, even though guest bookings were down.
"This year will be a very complicated, very unclear year," Mr. Perederko said. "A revolution has happened, figuratively speaking."
As for Crimea's future as a resort destination, he said: "People come here to spend their money and we try to earn this money. That's normal. Now, it is just a moment of high suspicion."

Full text:   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. -- At 7 in the morning, they are already lined up -- poultry plant workers, housekeepers, discount store clerks -- to ask for help paying their heating bills or feeding their families.
And once Metropolitan Ministries opens at 8 a.m., these workers fill the charity's 40 chairs, with a bawling infant adding to the commotion. From pockets and handbags they pull out utility bills or rent statements and hand them over to caseworkers, who often write checks -- $80, $110, $150 -- to patch over gaps in meeting this month's expenses or filling the gas tank to get to work.
Just off her 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. shift, Erika McCurdy needed help last month with her electricity and heating bill, which jumped to $280 in January from the usual $120 -- a result of one of the coldest winters in memory. A nurse's aide at an assisted living facility, Ms. McCurdy said there were many weeks when she couldn't make ends meet raising her 19-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter.
"There's just no way, making $9 an hour as a single parent with two children, that I can live without assistance," said Ms. McCurdy, 40, a strong-voiced, solidly built Chattanooga native.
She was so financially stretched, she said, that she and her daughter often sneaked into her son's high school football games free during halftime because she couldn't afford the $6 tickets. (She proudly noted that her son, Charles, had made the All State football team.) As for her daughter Jer'Maya, who mimics Beyoncé's every move on her mother's iPhone, Ms. McCurdy said, "She'd love to take ballet and piano lessons, but there's no way I can afford that."
Having worked as a nurse's aide for 15 years, Ms. McCurdy has been among the nearly 25 million workers in the United States who make less than $10.10 an hour -- the amount to which President Obama supports increasing the minimum wage. Of those workers, 3.5 million make the $7.25 federal minimum wage or less.
And like many of them, Ms. McCurdy hasn't been able to rely on steady full-time hours -- she has often been assigned just 20 hours a week. Even if she worked full time year-round, her $9 hourly wage would put her below the poverty threshold of $19,530 for a family of three.
Climbing above the poverty line has become more daunting in recent years, as the composition of the nation's low-wage work force has been transformed by the Great Recession, shifting demographics and other factors. More than half of those who make $9 or less an hour are 25 or older, while the proportion who are teenagers has declined to just 17 percent from 28 percent in 2000, after adjusting for inflation, according to Janelle Jones and John Schmitt of the Center for Economic Policy Research.
Today's low-wage workers are also more educated, with 41 percent having at least some college, up from 29 percent in 2000. "Minimum-wage and low-wage workers are older and more educated than 10 or 20 years ago, yet they're making wages below where they were 10 or 20 years ago after inflation," said Mr. Schmitt, senior economist at the research center. "If you look back several decades, workers near the minimum wage were more likely to be teenagers -- that's the stereotype people had. It's definitely not accurate anymore."
In Chattanooga, the prevalence of low-wage jobs has contributed to the high poverty rate: 27 percent of the city's residents live below the poverty line, compared with 15 percent nationwide. Women head about two-thirds of the city's poor households, and 42 percent of its children are poor, nearly double the rate statewide.
"The face of poverty in this community is women, especially women of color," said Valerie L. Radu, a professor of social work at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga.
This city was not always a magnet for low-wage jobs. For much of the last century, the city, which hugs the Tennessee River, was a manufacturing hub with dozens of apparel factories, textile mills and metal foundries.
During the last quarter of the 20th century, almost all the factories and foundries were shuttered, and with them disappeared thousands of manufacturing jobs that had once lifted workers, even ones without high school degrees, into the middle class or to the cusp of it. In their place have come thousands of service-sector jobs: at the aquarium and Imax theater built to lure tourists and at hotels, nursing homes, big-box stores, brew pubs, fast-food restaurants, beauty salons and hospitals.
Discount stores dot the landscape, including a Family Dollar downtown near the upscale Bluewater Grille, reflecting how much American cities have experienced a hollowing-out of the middle class.
"Chattanooga has a twofold problem: the low level of educational attainment and the traditional jobs that these people move into have largely disappeared," said Matthew N. Murray, an economist at the University of Tennessee. Just 23 percent of Tennessee adults have a bachelor's degree.
JeraLee Kincaid, 23, is an $8.50-an-hour cashier who works at the checkout booth at a parking garage next to the Marriott Courtyard hotel downtown. A solid student in high school, Ms. Kincaid, who lives with her mother, planned to study computer programming in college, but instead her family decided that she needed to help pay the medical bills of a 5-year-old niece who has leukemia.
"She can't eat, talk or walk by herself," said Ms. Kincaid. She says she feels stuck, but also grateful that her boss is trying to help find her a scholarship to attend college.
When Volkswagen opened a $1 billion assembly plant in 2011, 80,000 people applied for 2,000 jobs paying an average of $19.50 an hour. Many low-wage workers, like Ms. McCurdy -- a high school dropout who later obtained her high school equivalency diploma -- would have loved to work there, but they faced difficulty mastering the math tests given for jobs that involve advanced machinery.
"We understand that more individuals have to get some kind of higher education degree or certificate to have a chance in this world," said Chattanooga's mayor, Andy Berke. "We don't want the South to be a place where businesses go to find low-wage, low-education jobs. That's a long-term problem that midsized cities in the South face."
Here as well as elsewhere, a college degree cannot guarantee a good job.
Landon Howard graduated from the University of Tennessee campus here four years ago with a bachelor's degree in social work, but has been unable to find a job in that field. Instead he is a prep cook at the trendy Tupelo Honey Cafe. Often scheduled for just 15 to 20 hours a week at $9.50 an hour, he usually takes home less than $200 a week.
"I've had to move back in with my parents," Mr. Howard said. His most urgent concern is his lack of dental insurance. "One of my teeth is cracked," he said. "There's a big gaping hole. I don't know if I'm going to lose it."
Ms. McCurdy, as a parent in a modest income bracket, would not usually be eligible for the state's Medicaid program, although her children would, but she was accepted because of a heart condition requiring costly medications.
Her family has had to make many sacrifices since she was laid off in 2012 from her job as a full-time nurse's assistant in the emergency room of Memorial Hospital.
Her fall to $9 an hour at the assisted living facility from $13.75 at the hospital forced her to give up a 2,000-square-foot home in Harrison, a local suburb, "which is beautiful, and you have better schools," she said.
"It was a good life," she added. "You didn't have to worry about violence or anyone breaking in."
After being laid off, "I realized I couldn't afford to stay in a house where the rent was $625 a month," she said. So she found a $400-a-month, 1,100-square foot house in Brainerd, known for its gangs and violence. "I stay in at night," she said. "I put bars on the windows."
The new house has two modest bedrooms, a largely unfurnished living room, a bathroom and a small shotgun kitchen "where I got to move the table when my son gets up from dinner," she said. "Imagine being in a two-bedroom place with a 6-2, 280-pound boy and a little girl. Me and my little girl share a room."
They also share a bed, but Jer'Maya keeps her dolls, books and clothes in Charles's room, among his footballs and athletic gear. Ms. McCurdy receives $400 a month in food stamps. Without it, she said, "we wouldn't be eating."
Still, Ms. McCurdy worries about her children's future.
"I have a son that's graduating in May," she said. "He's looking at college. My heart is pounding 99 miles per hour. If he goes on full scholarship, I'll still need to support him -- how to pay his cellphone bill, how to pay for transportation and food during vacations."
Her February utility bill just arrived and it stunned her: $320. She may again turn to Metropolitan Ministries for help, although she says she hopes the $3,000 or so she expects to receive from the earned-income tax credit will help her pay that bill -- and also buy a new living room couch.
Rebecca Whelchel says she has seen big changes in the clientele since she became the executive director of Metropolitan Ministries eight years ago.
"It used to be that folks came in with a single issue -- it was like, 'I have to buy a new tire because my tire blew out,' or, 'I'm short on my electrical bill,' " Ms. Whelchel said. "Now they come in with a rubber band around a bunch of bills and problems. Everything is wrong. Everything is tangled with everything else."
At age 34, Nick Mason earns $9 an hour as an assistant manager for a Domino's, overseeing a crew of six. "I don't think $9 is fair -- I've been working in the pizza business for 19 years, since I was 15," he said.
He attended the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, studying to become a registered nurse, but he dropped out as a sophomore when his marriage fell apart. He returned to work full time, and he and his children moved in with his parents in the suburb of Hixson.
"I just wish we could have our home, but I can't afford to," said Mr. Mason, father of 7-year-old Halle and 5-year-old Eli. "That's what the kids keep asking for."
"We've had to sacrifice a lot of things," he continued. "I'd love nothing more than to give them what they deserve. As a single father, it's impossible. I put my kids in karate about a year ago. They loved it, but I got to the point where it was a choice between paying for a cellphone or karate, and as a manager, I need a cellphone for people to keep in touch with me."
Mr. Mason has heard the criticisms: Stop complaining about your pay; just go back to school and that way you'll find a better-paying job.
"I would love to go back to school," he said. "It's easy for people to say that because they haven't been in my shoes. I'm already busy every minute of the day. I already don't get to see my kids enough. I doubt I'll be able to afford school, and I don't know where I would find the time."
His big hope is to be promoted to run a Domino's, which might mean earning $15 an hour.
Ms. McCurdy, who applied for two dozen jobs this winter, delivered good news with a big smile. She was offered a job as a full-time nurse's aide on the transition medical floor at Erlanger Health System, a hospital.
"They're paying me $10.64," she said, an improvement over the $9 an hour she had been earning. "That gives me a little room to breathe."

Abstract: Just to be clear, there's no evidence that Mr. Ryan is personally a racist, and his dog-whistle may not even have been deliberate. Because American conservatism is still, after all these years, largely driven by claims that liberals are taking away your hard-earned money and giving it to Those People.

Full text:   There are many negative things you can say about Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and the G.O.P.'s de facto intellectual leader. But you have to admit that he's a very articulate guy, an expert at sounding as if he knows what he's talking about.
So it's comical, in a way, to see Mr. Ryan trying to explain away some recent remarks in which he attributed persistent poverty to a "culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working." He was, he says, simply being "inarticulate." How could anyone suggest that it was a racial dog-whistle? Why, he even cited the work of serious scholars -- people like Charles Murray, most famous for arguing that blacks are genetically inferior to whites. Oh, wait.
Just to be clear, there's no evidence that Mr. Ryan is personally a racist, and his dog-whistle may not even have been deliberate. But it doesn't matter. He said what he said because that's the kind of thing conservatives say to each other all the time. And why do they say such things? Because American conservatism is still, after all these years, largely driven by claims that liberals are taking away your hard-earned money and giving it to Those People.
Indeed, race is the Rosetta Stone that makes sense of many otherwise incomprehensible aspects of U.S. politics.
We are told, for example, that conservatives are against big government and high spending. Yet even as Republican governors and state legislatures block the expansion of Medicaid, the G.O.P. angrily denounces modest cost-saving measures for Medicare. How can this contradiction be explained? Well, what do many Medicaid recipients look like -- and I'm talking about the color of their skin, not the content of their character -- and how does that compare with the typical Medicare beneficiary? Mystery solved.
Or we're told that conservatives, the Tea Party in particular, oppose handouts because they believe in personal responsibility, in a society in which people must bear the consequences of their actions. Yet it's hard to find angry Tea Party denunciations of huge Wall Street bailouts, of huge bonuses paid to executives who were saved from disaster by government backing and guarantees. Instead, all the movement's passion, starting with Rick Santelli's famous rant on CNBC, has been directed against any hint of financial relief for low-income borrowers. And what is it about these borrowers that makes them such targets of ire? You know the answer.
One odd consequence of our still-racialized politics is that conservatives are still, in effect, mobilizing against the bums on welfare even though both the bums and the welfare are long gone or never existed. Mr. Santelli's fury was directed against mortgage relief that never actually happened. Right-wingers rage against tales of food stamp abuse that almost always turn out to be false or at least greatly exaggerated. And Mr. Ryan's black-men-don't-want-to-work theory of poverty is decades out of date.
In the 1970s it was still possible to claim in good faith that there was plenty of opportunity in America, and that poverty persisted only because of cultural breakdown among African-Americans. Back then, after all, blue-collar jobs still paid well, and unemployment was low. The reality was that opportunity was much more limited than affluent Americans imagined; as the sociologist William Julius Wilson has documented, the flight of industry from urban centers meant that minority workers literally couldn't get to those good jobs, and the supposed cultural causes of poverty were actually effects of that lack of opportunity. Still, you could understand why many observers failed to see this.
But over the past 40 years good jobs for ordinary workers have disappeared, not just from inner cities but everywhere: adjusted for inflation, wages have fallen for 60 percent of working American men. And as economic opportunity has shriveled for half the population, many behaviors that used to be held up as demonstrations of black cultural breakdown -- the breakdown of marriage, drug abuse, and so on -- have spread among working-class whites too.
These awkward facts have not, however, penetrated the world of conservative ideology. Earlier this month the House Budget Committee, under Mr. Ryan's direction, released a 205-page report on the alleged failure of the War on Poverty. What does the report have to say about the impact of falling real wages? It never mentions the subject at all.
And since conservatives can't bring themselves to acknowledge the reality of what's happening to opportunity in America, they're left with nothing but that old-time dog whistle. Mr. Ryan wasn't being inarticulate -- he said what he said because it's all that he's got.

Abstract: Industry watchers acknowledge the creeping reality of a zero-marginal-cost economy, but argue that free products and services will entice a sufficient number of consumers to purchase higher-end goods and specialized services, ensuring large enough profit margins to allow the capitalist market to continue to grow.

Full text:   WE are beginning to witness a paradox at the heart of capitalism, one that has propelled it to greatness but is now threatening its future: The inherent dynamism of competitive markets is bringing costs so far down that many goods and services are becoming nearly free, abundant, and no longer subject to market forces. While economists have always welcomed a reduction in marginal cost, they never anticipated the possibility of a technological revolution that might bring those costs to near zero.
The first inkling of the paradox came in 1999 when Napster, the music service, developed a network enabling millions of people to share music without paying the producers and artists, wreaking havoc on the music industry. Similar phenomena went on to severely disrupt the newspaper and book publishing industries. Consumers began sharing their own information and entertainment, via videos, audio and text, nearly free, bypassing the traditional markets altogether.
The huge reduction in marginal cost shook those industries and is now beginning to reshape energy, manufacturing and education. Although the fixed costs of solar and wind technology are somewhat pricey, the cost of capturing each unit of energy beyond that is low. This phenomenon has even penetrated the manufacturing sector. Thousands of hobbyists are already making their own products using 3-D printers, open-source software and recycled plastic as feedstock, at near zero marginal cost. Meanwhile, more than six million students are enrolled in free massive open online courses, the content of which is distributed at near zero marginal cost.
Industry watchers acknowledge the creeping reality of a zero-marginal-cost economy, but argue that free products and services will entice a sufficient number of consumers to purchase higher-end goods and specialized services, ensuring large enough profit margins to allow the capitalist market to continue to grow. But the number of people willing to pay for additional premium goods and services is limited.
Now the phenomenon is about to affect the whole economy. A formidable new technology infrastructure -- the Internet of Things -- is emerging with the potential to push much of economic life to near zero marginal cost over the course of the next two decades. This new technology platform is beginning to connect everything and everyone. Today more than 11 billion sensors are attached to natural resources, production lines, the electricity grid, logistics networks and recycling flows, and implanted in homes, offices, stores and vehicles, feeding big data into the Internet of Things. By 2020, it is projected that at least 50 billion sensors will connect to it.
People can connect to the network and use big data, analytics and algorithms to accelerate efficiency and lower the marginal cost of producing and sharing a wide range of products and services to near zero, just as they now do with information goods. For example, 37 million buildings in the United States have been equipped with meters and sensors connected to the Internet of Things, providing real-time information on the usage and changing price of electricity on the transmission grid. This will eventually allow households and businesses that are generating and storing green electricity on-site from their solar and wind installations to program software to take them off the electricity grid when the price spikes so they can power their facilities with their own green electricity and share surplus with neighbors at near zero marginal cost.
Cisco forecasts that by 2022, the private sector productivity gains wrought by the Internet of Things will exceed $14 trillion. A General Electric study estimates that productivity advances from the Internet of Things could affect half the global economy by 2025.
THE unresolved question is, how will this economy of the future function when millions of people can make and share goods and services nearly free? The answer lies in the civil society, which consists of nonprofit organizations that attend to the things in life we make and share as a community. In dollar terms, the world of nonprofits is a powerful force. Nonprofit revenues grew at a robust rate of 41 percent -- after adjusting for inflation -- from 2000 to 2010, more than doubling the growth of gross domestic product, which increased by 16.4 percent during the same period. In 2012, the nonprofit sector in the United States accounted for 5.5 percent of G.D.P.
What makes the social commons more relevant today is that we are constructing an Internet of Things infrastructure that optimizes collaboration, universal access and inclusion, all of which are critical to the creation of social capital and the ushering in of a sharing economy. The Internet of Things is a game-changing platform that enables an emerging collaborative commons to flourish alongside the capitalist market.
This collaborative rather than capitalistic approach is about shared access rather than private ownership. For example, 1.7 million people globally are members of car-sharing services. A recent survey found that the number of vehicles owned by car-sharing participants decreased by half after joining the service, with members preferring access over ownership. Millions of people are using social media sites, redistribution networks, rentals and cooperatives to share not only cars but also homes, clothes, tools, toys and other items at low or near zero marginal cost. The sharing economy had projected revenues of $3.5 billion in 2013.
Nowhere is the zero marginal cost phenomenon having more impact than the labor market, where workerless factories and offices, virtual retailing and automated logistics and transport networks are becoming more prevalent. Not surprisingly, the new employment opportunities lie in the collaborative commons in fields that tend to be nonprofit and strengthen social infrastructure -- education, health care, aiding the poor, environmental restoration, child care and care for the elderly, the promotion of the arts and recreation. In the United States, the number of nonprofit organizations grew by approximately 25 percent between 2001 and 2011, from 1.3 million to 1.6 million, compared with profit-making enterprises, which grew by a mere one-half of 1 percent. In the United States, Canada and Britain, employment in the nonprofit sector currently exceeds 10 percent of the work force.
Despite this impressive growth, many economists argue that the nonprofit sector is not a self-sufficient economic force but rather a parasite, dependent on government entitlements and private philanthropy. Quite the contrary. A recent study revealed that approximately 50 percent of the aggregate revenue of the nonprofit sectors of 34 countries comes from fees, while government support accounts for 36 percent of the revenues and private philanthropy for 14 percent.
As for the capitalist system, it is likely to remain with us far into the future, albeit in a more streamlined role, primarily as an aggregator of network services and solutions, allowing it to thrive as a powerful niche player in the coming era. We are, however, entering a world partly beyond markets, where we are learning how to live together in an increasingly interdependent, collaborative, global commons.

Full text:   March has been an up-and-down stretch for the stock market, but it is turning into a month of milestones nonetheless. The bull market reached its fifth anniversary last weekend, and if the trend continues this week, on Saturday it will become the fifth-longest bull market since 1928.
Already, it's the fourth-strongest bull, with a gain of more than 172 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Perhaps most significantly, Federal Reserve figures released this month show that levitating stock prices were the primary cause of a surge in total household wealth to $80.7 trillion in 2013 -- the highest level in American history, even after inflation is taken into account.
All of this is undoubtedly reason for celebration, especially for the affluent households that hold the bulk of the wealth and have benefited most from the stock market's big rebound. But for anyone with even a modest stake in the market -- as well as for Janet L. Yellen and the other Fed policy makers who are at least partly responsible for the market's rise -- the startling increase in asset prices also raises difficult questions.
For market strategists, chief among them may be this: How will the bull market respond as the Fed throttles its accommodative monetary policy?
When the Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, with Ms. Yellen at the helm for the first time, policy makers are expected to discuss how to proceed with the tightening of monetary policy without causing serious problems for financial markets.
In December, the Fed began to wean the markets off the extraordinary monetary stimulus that has swelled the central bank's balance sheet above $4.1 trillion from a relatively meager $869 billion in August 2007. The central bank has been gradually reducing its monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities; it is expected to continue holding interest rates near zero for many months, and it may try to more clearly signal its intentions to the markets. It is reining in its stimulus program, not ending it.
Unleashing that policy in the first place had powerful effects, which the central bank has acknowledged. After the stock market hit bottom, Ben S. Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, and other Fed officials said repeatedly that by bringing down bond yields and making credit more available, they hoped to increase the appeal of riskier assets like stocks, stimulating the economy. By the Fed's own criteria, the economic recovery is still incomplete. But the restoration of prices to their pre-financial-crisis levels has already occurred in many asset categories, and then some.
(As big as the stock market rally has been, it's far from the strongest or the longest we've seen. The rally from Dec. 4, 1987, to March 24, 2000, has a lock on first place in both categories, with a gain of 582 percent over that period, according to figures from the Bespoke Investment Group going back to 1928.)
Central bank policies that lead to higher stock prices can distort financial markets, said Joseph G. Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein.
"Household debt and corporate debt have been reduced sharply," Mr. Carson said. "But the Fed has effectively moved the debt onto its own balance sheet. It's crucial that they unwind it, but the question is, how?"
The Fed has helped to sustain the bull market in stocks, and because home values have also risen in the last year, many middle-class people have begun to spend more freely, spurring short-term economic growth, he said. But one effect of Fed policies has been to widen wealth inequality. That's because the wealthy hold a high proportion of their assets in the stock market and benefit when the market rises, he said.
What's more, stock market prices have increased far more rapidly than housing prices, and the net worth of less wealthy Americans is heavily concentrated in the value of their homes. In a note to clients, Mr. Carson pointed out that average home prices rose roughly 10 percent in 2013 while the S.&P. 500 index surged more than 30 percent, disproportionately benefiting those who held stock. And, of course, those with neither home equity nor financial assets fell further behind those who own both.
The Fed's report, "Financial Accounts of the United States," broke down the figures this way: While the total value of real estate in the United States increased $2.3 trillion, the total value of stocks grew by $5.6 trillion.
Even if such issues provide a subtext for Fed discussions, the direct effects of Fed policy on the stock and housing markets may not be an explicit part of the Fed's agenda this week.
That's partly because Congress didn't include financial asset prices in the Fed's mandate, which is "to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates." Those stable prices referred to items like cars, food and shoes, not to financial assets like stocks and bonds, whose price levels fall outside the Fed's traditional purview.
Still, the Fed closely monitors financial market price levels, and it has taken on growing responsibility for maintaining the stability of the entire financial system. In congressional testimony, Ms. Yellen has said that the central bank needs to "attempt to detect asset bubbles" in both the stock and the housing markets. She has also said that she sees no such bubbles in evidence now.
There may not be full-blown bubbles at this moment. But valuations have become much less attractive as prices have risen. Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is among those who have argued vigorously that the Fed needs to cut back sharply on its monetary stimulus because it has, in his view, been feeding speculative bubbles.
In a speech in Mexico City on March 5, Mr. Fisher said, "There are increasing signs quantitative easing has overstayed its welcome: Market distortions and acting on bad incentives are becoming more pervasive." He listed a series of stock valuation measures and said they were "at eye-popping levels not seen since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s."
Mr. Fisher's view appears to be a minority one at the Fed, but he makes some telling points. Certainly, as the stock market reaches ever more impressive milestones, it's important, as he says, to monitor market indicators very carefully, "to ensure that the ghost of 'irrational exuberance' does not haunt us again."

Full text:   SHANGHAI -- In the latest sign that China is loosening its tight grip over the economy, the government said on Saturday that the value of its currency would now be allowed to fluctuate more widely against the United States dollar.
China's Central Bank said in a statement on its website that beginning on Monday, the daily trading band on the Chinese currency, the renminbi, would double to 2 percent on either side of a government-set parity rate, a move that could lead to wider daily price fluctuations. The announcement is the latest indication that Beijing is determined to make the renminbi an international currency and to give market forces a larger role in what is now the world's second-largest economy after the United States'.
Although the government still maintains tight control over large aspects of the economy, including interest rates and the exchange rate, there appears to be a growing recognition among policy makers that the state's heavy-handed role is distorting prices, intensifying inefficiencies and giving an unfair advantage to state-run enterprises, government banks and exporters.
Widening the daily trading band on the currency is likely to reduce the government's control over the price of the renminbi and to signal to investors and businesses that even bolder moves are imminent.
"This is a fairly significant indication of the government's commitment to market-oriented reforms," said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor at Cornell and a former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. "The government has been intervening in the currency markets for some time, but this means they will probably intervene less."
Although China's economy is growing at close to 7 percent, the rate of growth has fallen sharply over the last few years, and there are concerns that banks and local governments are masking huge liabilities. To lower the risk of a serious downturn, and to strengthen the country's long-term prospects, Beijing is trying to push through market reforms without severely damaging those who have benefited most from state dominance of the economy.
Under President Xi Jinping, the government has stepped up plans to liberalize interest rates; to open the country's capital account, allowing more capital to flow in and out of China; and to reform the financial system.
The government recently said that it planned to allow more private banks to operate in the country. One official also said that within two years, China planned to free up bank deposit rates, which for years have punished savers with returns sometimes below the rate of inflation. By widening the daily trading band, the government is signaling it plans to reduce its role there, too.
The government still has the power to set the daily parity rate, and it could prevent big swings in the value of the renminbi.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve paid $79.6 billion to the Treasury Department in 2013 as the Fed's enormous investment campaign to stimulate economic growth continued to generate windfall profits for taxpayers.
Since 2008, the Fed has expanded its holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities from less than $1 trillion to more than $4 trillion in an effort to suppress interest rates and encourage risk-taking.
Its earnings from those holdings have increased apace. The Fed, required by law to put most of its profit in the government's coffers, has contributed almost $323 billion in the last four years. The Fed invests exclusively in federal government bonds. In returning the money, it is effectively reducing the government's borrowing costs.
Some Republican politicians argue that the Fed, by reducing the short-term cost of borrowing, is enabling the growth of the federal debt. Fed officials respond that Congress itself is responsible for making those decisions -- and that abandoning the policy would be counterproductive, in all likelihood.
"I don't think it would be helpful, either in terms of achieving the objectives that Congress has assigned to us or in terms of Congress's deficit-reduction efforts, for us to purposely raise interest rates in order to weaken the economy," the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, testified before Congress in February. "The likely impact of that in a weaker economy would be larger deficits."
Ms. Yellen also expressed confidence that the investments would not impede the Fed's ability to control inflation as the economy strengthens.
The Fed buys bonds from banks by crediting accounts that are kept at the Fed. To keep that money from circulating, the Fed paid the banks $5.2 billion in interest last year. That could become a political liability as the economy grows, because the Fed would have to pay substantially higher rates to persuade the banks to leave the money on deposit. In effect, the Fed would be sending tens of billions of dollars to a handful of large banks rather than to the Treasury.
Still, Fed officials insist that this is exactly what they will do.
With lawmakers from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party as well as the Tea Party ranks of the Republican Party pressing the Fed on a variety of issues, the resulting image problem could be compounded by a decline in the profits from the Fed's investments. The central bank has transferred something to the Treasury every year since 1934. But some analysts, and the Fed itself, see a risk that transfers might have to be suspended later this decade as interest rates rise, reducing the value of low-rate bonds like those held by the Fed.
The Fed spent about $5.6 billion on its own operations last year. It also provided $563 million in funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which assumed some of the Fed's regulatory responsibilities after the financial crisis.
Correction: March 19, 2014, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the Federal Reserve's $79.6 billion payment to the federal Treasury, representing profits from its investments in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, described the Fed's relationship to the Treasury incorrectly. The Fed invests in Treasuries, but it does not buy them from the Treasury. It is thus not "lending to the Treasury."

Full text:   In the month since mass demonstrations began in Venezuela, at least 25 people have died in the protests. No end to the crisis is in sight, and each day the grievances grow, the arrests multiply, positions harden and moderates retreat.
There is no easy solution. The government of President Nicolás Maduro still commands strong loyalty from followers of the populist revolutionary Hugo Chávez, who died a year ago, while the opposition is divided and lacking in a common platform beyond despair over the economic mess left behind by "Chavismo." This is not a "Venezuelan Spring" to be resolved by the exit of a discredited tyrant. Though Mr. Maduro lacks his predecessor's charisma, his narrow victory in the presidential election last April is not in dispute, and no elections are scheduled before 2015. This is a bitterly divided population in urgent need of mediated dialogue.
The protests began in early February with a march by students in the western state of Tachira demanding increased security after an attempted rape. The protests turned violent; several students were arrested; demonstrators turned out in Caracas demanding their release. Three people were killed, and the dam broke.
People hit the streets -- driven to despair by rampant crime, including one of the highest murder rates in the world; chronic shortages of basic staples, often including milk and toilet paper; raging inflation, which last year reached an annual rate of 56.2 percent; and frequent blackouts. Mr. Maduro's predictable response in the government-controlled news media has been to blame it all on "fascists" and the United States.
The profound polarization of Venezuelan society certainly poses a major obstacle to any negotiated solution. But, after a month of street battles, Mr. Maduro must be aware that he will not calm the streets through force; most of the protesters' demands are about releasing jailed leaders and restoring democratic norms. The protesters, for their part, must be aware that week after week of flaming barricades only makes life harder for their countrymen. There are, moreover, viable precedents for resolving such confrontations through dialogue, notably Tunisia.
Mr. Maduro's Chavismo would reject any mediation by the United States or any Latin American organization it belongs to, such as the Organization of American States. But there must be moderate forces within Venezuela -- like the labor unions -- or countries and institutions outside Venezuela acceptable to both sides, such as Brazil or Unasur (Union of South American Nations), that could act as mediators. That is, if the confrontation does not escalate out of control.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

De Blasio Pushes a 9-Year Contract for Teachers

Full text:   Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration, seeking to be generous to its allies in labor without jeopardizing New York's finances, is pushing for what would be the longest-ever contract with the teachers' union: a nine-year deal that would let the city stretch out potentially huge retroactive pay increases.
In intense negotiations over the past week, people briefed on the talks say, the city has asserted that it cannot afford the $3.4 billion in retroactive raises that the union is demanding for two of the four and a half years it has been working without a contract -- let alone for the other years.
The administration's dealings with the union have become all the more tricky, and pivotal, because whatever deal the teachers receive could set a pattern for the city's other municipal unions, which want billions in retroactive raises of their own.
A meager settlement could enrage the other unions, all 151 of which are seeking new contracts with City Hall after working under expired ones for several years. Taken together, some city officials say, the demands for back pay alone could cost more than $8 billion, with any prospective raises adding further to the tab.
Municipal union leaders voiced bitterness toward former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for not reaching contracts with them, and were clearly expecting better from Mr. de Blasio.
A nine-year deal for teachers would actually date to Nov. 1, 2009, when the union's contract expired. But it would extend for another four and a half years -- after Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, would face re-election in 2017.
Indeed, the city's negotiations with the teachers could ultimately expand to include officials from other unions in hopes of forging a kind of ambitious grand bargain with municipal labor.
"These discussions are just one part of the process," said a senior de Blasio administration official, who requested anonymity to avoid antagonizing participants in the talks. "They're an important part of a much larger conversation that still has a long way to go. We're looking at a comprehensive approach to labor negotiations."
The teachers' union first sought a six-year contract. Mr. de Blasio proposed an eight-year deal. But when officials realized it would have expired a week before Election Day in 2017, the city proposed nine years.
For the city, a lengthy contract would assure predictability in budgeting and years of labor peace.
For now, the other unions have been waiting for the teachers' union, which represents more than 100,000 educators and other workers, to reach a settlement over its demand for 4 percent annual raises from Nov. 1, 2009, through Oct. 31, 2011. Fully acceding to that demand alone would cost $3.4 billion, officials say.
The teachers' union is insisting that it is owed that much because other municipal unions received 4 percent pay increases in 2009 and 2010, before their contracts expired.
City negotiators, people briefed on the talks say, argue that they simply do not have the money for all of the raises the unions are seeking. To make more money available, the city is pressing the teachers and other unions to agree to major savings in health-insurance costs, like filling prescriptions through the mail.
But union negotiators are resisting any agreement on health savings until disputes over back pay are resolved for the teachers and several smaller unions, including principals and nurses at city hospitals.
"It's an Alphonse-and-Gaston situation," one city official said.
Harry Nespoli, the chairman of the Municipal Labor Committee, said, "We can't reach an agreement on any health deal without those outstanding contracts resolved."
Every 1 percent raise for the city's unionized work force costs about $350 million, budget documents show.
The current talks had their origins when the Bloomberg administration and the teachers reached a stalemate several years ago. The state appointed a fact-finding panel of three labor experts to issue a nonbinding recommendation on a deal for the teachers on retroactive raises and other matters. In the past, such recommendations had generally been accepted.
People briefed on the talks said that Martin F. Scheinman, a mediator and arbitrator named the panel's chairman, had recently asked the parties to try one more time to hammer out the details of a deal with him as the mediator.
The city and teachers met last Friday, Saturday and Sunday and again on Wednesday at the Midtown Manhattan offices of Proskauer Rose. The two sides, led by Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, and Robert Linn, the city's labor commissioner, met again on Friday and were to meet over the weekend, although the people briefed on the talks said no one anticipated a deal soon.
The negotiators discussed raises, length of the school day, performance evaluations for teachers and revamping the Absent Teacher Reserve, a pool of about 1,000 teachers who are still being paid even though their jobs have been eliminated because of school closings or other reasons.
While Mr. Mulgrew wants the fact-finding panel to award the full 4 percent retroactive raises for 2009 and 2010, that could also hurt him by leaving the city with little money to award teacher raises for 2011, 2012 and subsequent years.
And if no raises, or meager ones, are awarded to the teachers for 2011 and more recent years, that pattern will upset other municipal unions.
Some officials say the city may look for a model to a three-year wage freeze that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, reached with the two largest unions of New York State employees. Those five-year contracts include 2 percent raises in Years 4 and 5. But city union leaders say state contracts have not served as patterns for the city before and that such a lengthy wage freeze would leave city workers even further behind inflation.
If the fact-finders recommend less than 4 percent in back pay for 2009 and 2010, that could make life easier, in a way, for the teachers' union by freeing up more money for subsequent raises.
But Mr. Mulgrew said in an interview that his union wanted the two full 4 percent raises.
The Bloomberg administration told the fact-finding panel that if the panel were to agree to full retroactive raises, accounting rules would require that the $3.4 billion cost be fully included in the current city budget, creating a huge deficit.
To avoid that, people briefed on the talks said, one idea being floated is to convert the retroactive raises into payments made over a few years. The city would avoid the big hole in its budget and city employees might at least feel as if they were receiving more substantial raises.
Mr. Mulgrew disputed the city's claims that it could ill afford the teachers' demands.
"There is more money than the city is saying," he said.
"We want a contract that's fair," he added, "We're not trying to bankrupt the city."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Three nominees to the Federal Reserve's board sailed through a brief confirmation hearing on Thursday, assuring senators of their commitment to strengthen financial regulation and stimulate the economy.
Stanley Fischer, nominated as vice chairman, Lael Brainard and Jerome H. Powell, a current Fed governor nominated to a new term, were all warmly endorsed by Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, who control the confirmation process. There was little sign of strong Republican opposition to the White House's choices. As a result, it appeared likely that the three would soon be confirmed, joining Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's new chairwoman.
The nominees hewed closely to the Fed's official position on important issues, broadly endorsing its efforts to reduce unemployment and emphasizing their commitment to maintain low inflation. But their statements, as well as the hearing, focused primarily on the Fed's role as a financial regulator.
"The Great Recession has driven home the lesson that the Fed has not only to fulfill its dual mandate, but also to contribute its part to the maintenance of the stability of the financial system," said Mr. Fischer, who led the Bank of Israel for eight years before returning to the United States last year. "Almost always, these goals are complementary. But each of them must be an explicit focus of Fed policy."
Mr. Fischer, 70, was the target of most questions and the recipient of the most praise. Asked by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, whether the Fed could do more to stimulate the economy, he said that Fed policy was "approximately appropriate." He said the crucial question confronting policy makers was not whether but how quickly to exit its stimulus campaign.
Current Fed board members generally say they believe that the central bank is reducing the expansion of its stimulus campaign, not retreating. But the effect on the economy is identical and Mr. Fischer, more bluntly, said the exit "has begun."
The Fed's policy-making committee, scheduled to meet next week, is widely expected to continue the trend by cutting another $10 billion from the bank's monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Officials also must agree on a new way to describe the Fed's plans for short-term interest rates.
Ms. Brainard and Mr. Powell, who consistently voted in support of Fed policy during his first two years in office, both endorsed the need to stimulate the economy but were not asked about the Fed's specific policies and did not volunteer opinions.
The three nominees all spoke about the importance of constraining the largest banks, and ensuring that mechanisms exist to dismantle banks that fail.
Mr. Powell, a Treasury official under the first President George Bush and later a successful financier, was the most assured and specific in his remarks.
Mr. Powell, 60, said large banks were able to borrow money more cheaply because of the perception they enjoyed government protection, and that new measures were necessary to offset that advantage.
"There's a great deal more left to do here that we're working on," he said.
He offered as an example the possibility that the Fed would impose a capital surcharge on banks that rely more heavily on short-term wholesale funding -- in effect, limiting borrowing by banks that rely on less stable funding sources.
Ms. Brainard, 51, was more cautious, saying she lacked the necessary information to assess the extent of the problem, or to evaluate potential responses.
Ms. Brainard, previously the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said better coordination of financial regulation across borders was necessary to make sure that banks operating in multiple countries could be safely dismantled.
"It would be a high priority to make sure that other financial jurisdictions have the capacity and the will to resolve their largest financial institutions and that they have legal systems in place to do so," she said.
Both Democrats and Republicans expressed concern that in Mr. Fischer and Ms. Brainard, a pair of economists and veteran policy makers, the Fed is adding more of the kinds of officials it already has in abundance. There is one more vacancy on the Fed's board and Senator Michael Crapo, Republican of Idaho, said he hoped the president would nominate someone with community banking experience.
"I'm concerned that a lack of diverse views on the F.O.M.C. could affect its ability to serve all Americans," Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. "What perspective do you bring that actually will matter to families in Cleveland and Mansfield, Ohio?"
The nominees took turns reassuring the senator.
"I have worked all my professional career on making sure that Americans have economic opportunity," Ms. Brainard said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, also pressed Mr. Fischer about his experience as a Citigroup executive, wondering aloud about the implications of asking a government well stocked with the alumni of large banks to rein in those same companies.
Mr. Fischer responded that his experience at Citigroup was his most important training to be a financial regulator, because it gave him an education in the way that financial markets actually work.

Abstract: [...]there's a very good case for raising the Fed's inflation target, which would mean seeking faster wage growth, say 5 percent or 6 percent per year.

Full text:   Four years ago, some of us watched with a mixture of incredulity and horror as elite discussion of economic policy went completely off the rails. Over the course of just a few months, influential people all over the Western world convinced themselves and each other that budget deficits were an existential threat, trumping any and all concern about mass unemployment. The result was a turn to fiscal austerity that deepened and prolonged the economic crisis, inflicting immense suffering.
And now it's happening again. Suddenly, it seems as if all the serious people are telling each other that despite high unemployment there's hardly any "slack" in labor markets -- as evidenced by a supposed surge in wages -- and that the Federal Reserve needs to start raising interest rates very soon to head off the danger of inflation.
To be fair, those making the case for monetary tightening are more thoughtful and less overtly political than the archons of austerity who drove the last wrong turn in policy. But the advice they're giving could be just as destructive.
O.K., where is this coming from?
The starting point for this turn in elite opinion is the assertion that wages, after stagnating for years, have started to rise rapidly. And it's true that one popular measure of wages has indeed picked up, with an especially large bump last month.
But that bump is probably a snow-related statistical illusion. As economists at Goldman Sachs have pointed out, average wages normally jump in bad weather -- not because anyone's wages actually rise, but because the workers idled by snow and storms tend to be less well-paid than those who aren't affected.
Beyond that, we have multiple measures of wages, and only one of them is showing a notable uptick. It's far from clear that the alleged wage acceleration is even happening.
And what's wrong with rising wages, anyway? In the past, wage increases of around 4 percent a year -- more than twice the current rate -- have been consistent with low inflation. And there's a very good case for raising the Fed's inflation target, which would mean seeking faster wage growth, say 5 percent or 6 percent per year. Why? Because even the International Monetary Fund now warns against the dangers of "lowflation": too low an inflation rate puts the economy at risk of Japanification, of getting caught in a trap of economic stagnation and intractable debt.
Over all, then, while it's possible to argue that we're running out of labor slack, it's also possible to argue the opposite, and either way the prudent thing would surely be to wait: Wait until there's solid evidence of rising wages, then wait some more until wage growth is at least back to precrisis levels and preferably higher.
Yet for some reason there's a growing drumbeat of demands that we not wait, that we get ready to raise interest rates right away or at least very soon. What's that about?
Part of the answer, I'd submit, is that for some people it's always 1979. That is, they're eternally vigilant against the danger of a runaway wage-price spiral, and somehow they haven't noticed that nothing like that has happened for decades. Maybe it's a generational thing. Maybe it's because a 1970s-style crisis fits their ideological preconceptions, but the phantom menace of stagflation still has an outsized influence on economic debate.
Then there's sado-monetarism: the sense, all too common among in banking circles, that inflicting pain is ipso facto good. There are some people and institutions -- for example, the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements -- that always want to see interest rates go up. Their rationale is ever-changing -- it's commodity prices; no, it's financial stability; no, it's wages -- but the recommended policy is always the same.
Finally, although the current monetary debate isn't as openly political as the previous fiscal debate, it's hard to escape the suspicion that class interests are playing a role. A fair number of commentators seem oddly upset by the notion of workers getting raises, especially while returns to bondholders remain low. It's almost as if they identify with the investor class, and feel uncomfortable with anything that brings us close to full employment, and thereby gives workers more bargaining power.
Whatever the underlying motives, tightening the monetary screws anytime soon would be a very, very bad idea. We are slowly, painfully, emerging from the worst slump since the Great Depression. It wouldn't take much to abort the recovery, and, if that were to happen, we would almost certainly be Japanified, stuck in a trap that might last decades.
Is wage growth actually taking off? That's far from clear. But if it is, we should see rising wages as a development to cheer and promote, not a threat to be squashed with tight money.

Obama Orders Rule Changes to Expand Overtime Pay

Abstract: "The president's plan to increase overtime pay demonstrates another antibusiness policy -- coming on the heels of a proposal to increase the minimum wage, increase the minimum tipped wage, rising health care costs, as well as ever-growing, costly and unwieldy regulations," Eric Reller, a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobby, said in a written statement.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama, declaring that "Americans have spent too long working more and getting less in return," ordered the Labor Department on Thursday to revise federal rules on overtime pay to make millions more workers eligible for extra pay when they work more than 40 hours a week.
"Unfortunately today, millions of Americans aren't getting the extra pay they deserve," Mr. Obama said in an 11-minute ceremony in the East Room of the White House. He said that a federal rule meant to limit overtime "for highly paid, white-collar employees" now covers workers earning as little as $24,000 a year.
"Overtime is a pretty simple idea," Mr. Obama said. "If you have to work more, you should get paid more."
It is the latest in a series of executive actions Mr. Obama has taken recently to sidestep Congress, where Republicans have blocked Democratic proposals to reduce economic inequality. For example, he has ordered an increase in the minimum wage paid by companies that do business with the federal government and has established a new type of tax-sheltered retirement plan for young workers.
Administration officials have said these actions are needed because wages have stagnated despite soaring corporate profits, especially since the economic recovery began five years ago. Among the companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, profits have doubled since then, even as the portion of the economy that goes to worker pay has dropped to an all-time low.
Business lobbying groups denounce the changes as regulatory overreach, saying that they will crimp economic growth and leave companies with no choice but to shed workers as their costs rise.
"The president's plan to increase overtime pay demonstrates another antibusiness policy -- coming on the heels of a proposal to increase the minimum wage, increase the minimum tipped wage, rising health care costs, as well as ever-growing, costly and unwieldy regulations," Eric Reller, a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobby, said in a written statement.
The White House said that as many as 88 percent of salaried workers are not guaranteed "time and a half" overtime pay because they earn more than the cap of $455 a week (roughly $24,000 per year). Those workers can be denied overtime pay if they spend any time supervising other workers -- the so-called white-collar exemption.
"If your salary is even a dollar above the current threshold, you may not be guaranteed overtime," Mr. Obama said. "It doesn't matter if what you do is mostly physical work like stocking shelves. It doesn't matter if you're working 50 or 60 or 70 hours a week. Your employer doesn't have to pay you a single extra dime."
The proportion of workers who are not guaranteed overtime is up from 82 percent in 2004, when the current salary threshold was set, and just 35 percent in 1975. The cap has not kept up with inflation, administration officials say. It was $250 in 1975, equivalent to roughly $1,000 today, or more than double the current cap.
The president's order does not prescribe a new salary threshold, and it does not take effect immediately. Instead, he has instructed Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez to come up with a plan that would expand the number of workers eligible for overtime pay. During a period of public comment, business groups will almost surely seek to pare it back by limiting the number of employees who might benefit from the change.
Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress are trying to make inequality a centerpiece of their election-year debate with Republicans. The president's proposed budget for the 2015 fiscal year, for example, includes a more generous tax credit for the working poor, a reduction in tax exemptions for corporations and new spending on early education.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama this week will seek to force American businesses to pay more overtime to millions of workers, the latest move by his administration to confront corporations that have had soaring profits even as wages have stagnated.
On Thursday, the president will direct the Labor Department to revamp its regulations to require overtime pay for several million additional fast-food managers, loan officers, computer technicians and others whom many businesses currently classify as "executive or professional" employees to avoid paying them overtime, according to White House officials briefed on the announcement.
Mr. Obama's decision to use his executive authority to change the nation's overtime rules is likely to be seen as a challenge to Republicans in Congress, who have already blocked most of the president's economic agenda and have said they intend to fight his proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from $7.25.
Mr. Obama's action is certain to anger the business lobby in Washington, which has long fought for maximum flexibility for companies in paying overtime.
In 2004, business groups persuaded President George W. Bush's administration to allow them greater latitude on exempting salaried white-collar workers from overtime pay, even as organized labor objected.
Conservatives criticized Mr. Obama's impending action. "There's no such thing as a free lunch," said Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute, who warned that employers might cut pay or use fewer workers. "If they push through something to make a certain class of workers more expensive, something will happen to adjust."
Marc Freedman, the executive director of labor law policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the nation's overtime regulations "affect a very wide cross section of employers and our members."
"I expect this is an area we will be very much engaged in," Mr. Freedman said.
Mr. Obama's authority to act comes from his ability as president to revise the rules that carry out the Fair Labor Standards Act, which Congress originally passed in 1938. Mr. Bush and previous presidents used similar tactics at times to work around opponents in Congress.
The proposed new regulations would increase the number of people who qualify for overtime and continue Mr. Obama's fight against what he says is a crisis of economic inequality in the country. Changes to the regulations will be subject to public comment before final approval by the Labor Department, and it is possible that strong opposition could cause Mr. Obama to scale back his proposal.
Cecilia Muñoz, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the effort was part of Mr. Obama's pledge to help workers thrive. "We need to fix the system so folks working hard are getting compensated fairly," she said on Tuesday evening. "That's why we are jump-starting this effort."
The overtime action by Mr. Obama is part of a broader election-year effort by the White House to try to convince voters that Democrats are looking out for the middle class. White House officials hope the focus on lifting workers' pay will translate into support for Democratic congressional candidates this fall.
Since the mid-1980s, corporate profits have soared, reaching a post-World War II record as a share of economic output. The profits of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 have doubled since the recession ended in June 2009, but wages have stagnated for a vast majority of workers in the same period. Recently, workers' wages fell close to an all-time low as a share of the economy.
In 2012, the share of the gross domestic income that went to workers fell to 42.6 percent, the lowest on record.
Under current federal regulations, workers who are deemed executive, administrative or professional employees can be denied overtime pay under a so-called white-collar exemption.
Under the new rules that Mr. Obama is seeking, fewer salaried employees could be blocked from receiving overtime, a move that would potentially shift billions of dollars' worth of corporate income into the pockets of workers. Currently, employers are prohibited from denying time-and-a-half overtime pay to any salaried worker who makes less than $455 per week. Mr. Obama's directive would significantly increase that salary level.
In addition, Mr. Obama will try to change rules that allow employers to define which workers are exempt from receiving overtime based on the kind of work they perform. Under current rules, if an employer declares that an employee's primary responsibility is executive, such as overseeing a cleanup crew, then that worker can be exempted from overtime.
White House officials said those rules were sometimes abused by employers in an attempt to avoid paying overtime. The new rules could require that employees perform a minimum percentage of "executive" work before they can be exempted from qualifying for overtime pay.
"Under current rules, it literally means that you can spend 95 percent of the time sweeping floors and stocking shelves, and if you're responsible for supervising people 5 percent of the time, you can then be considered executive and be exempt," said Ross Eisenbrey, a vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington.
Jared Bernstein, the former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the former executive director of the White House Task Force on the Middle Class, embraced Mr. Obama's move.
"I think the intent of the rule change is to make sure that people working overtime are fairly treated," he said. "I think a potential side effect is that you may see more hiring in order to avoid overtime costs, which would be an awfully good thing right about now."
Mr. Bernstein, now a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, and Mr. Eisenbrey wrote a paper last year urging the administration to raise the salary threshold for overtime to $984 a week. Their study estimated that in any given week, five million workers earning more than the current threshold of $455 a week and less than $1,000 a week are likely to be exempted from overtime. President Bush raised the threshold to $455 in 2004.
Mr. Bernstein said, "Remember, inflation has eroded this threshold a great deal over the years, so it's hard to see why it's unfair to make that adjustment."
White House officials said that in California an employer cannot deny overtime pay to a salaried worker who makes less than $640 a week. In New York, the threshold is $600 a week. Under recently passed laws, the California threshold is set to rise to $800 per week in 2016, and the New York threshold to $675.
If the changes to the overtime regulations are made, it will fall to the Labor Department's wage and hour administrator to put them into effect. That position has been vacant since Mr. Obama took office. David Weil, a professor at the Boston University School of Management, is the latest nominee for the post. He is awaiting confirmation.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWhat if inequality were to continue growing years or decades into the future? Say the richest 1 percent of the population amassed a quarter of the nation's income, up from about a fifth today. What about half?
To believe Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics, this future is not just possible. It is likely.
In his bracing "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," which hit bookstores on Monday, Professor Piketty provides a fresh and sweeping analysis of the world's economic history that puts into question many of our core beliefs about the organization of market economies.
His most startling news is that the belief that inequality will eventually stabilize and subside on its own, a long-held tenet of free market capitalism, is wrong. Rather, the economic forces concentrating more and more wealth into the hands of the fortunate few are almost sure to prevail for a very long time.
It is possible to slow, or even reverse, the trend, if political leaders like President Obama, who proposed that income inequality was the "defining challenge of our time," really push.
"Political action can make this go in the other direction," Professor Piketty told me. But he also adds that history does not offer much hope that political action will, in fact, turn the tide: "Universal suffrage and democratic institutions have not been enough to make the system react."
Professor Piketty's description of inexorably rising inequality probably fits many Americans' intuitive understanding of how the world works today. But it cuts hard against the grain of economic orthodoxy that prevailed throughout the second half of the 20th century and still holds sway today. It was shaped during the early years of the Cold War by the Belorussian-born American economist Simon Kuznets.
Painstakingly assembling data from tax returns, Mr. Kuznets estimated that between 1913, when the income tax was first introduced in the United States, and shortly after the end of World War II in 1948, the slice of the nation's income absorbed by the richest 10 percent of Americans declined sharply, to about a third, from a little under half.
In his presidential address at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Detroit in 1954, he sketched out what came to be known as inequality's "Kuznets curve": "Widening in the early phases of economic growth when the transition from the preindustrial to the industrial civilization was most rapid; becoming stabilized for a while; and then narrowing in the later phases."
Mr. Kuznets's conclusion provided a huge moral lift to capitalism as the United States faced off with the Soviet Union. It suggested that the market economy could distribute its fruits equitably, without any heavy-handed intervention of the state.
And it more or less put an end to economists' interest in the topic. Economic theorists assumed that in a balanced economy, wages and profits rose at the same pace and turned their attention to the ups and downs of the business cycle.
The deep concern about the distribution of income and wealth that inspired 19th-century thinkers like David Ricardo and Karl Marx was attributed to a misunderstanding of the dynamics of growth leavened with the natural pessimism that would come from living in a time of enormous wealth and deep squalor, an era that gave us "Les Misérables" and "Oliver Twist."
Today, of course, it's far from obvious that the 19th-century pessimists were entirely wrong.
Glancing back across history from the present-day United States, it looks as if Kuznets's curve swerved way off target. Wages have been depressed for years. Profits account for the largest share of national income since the 1930s. The richest 10 percent of Americans take a larger slice of the economic pie than they did in 1913, at the peak of the Gilded Age.
This is not solely an American phenomenon. Across many other developed nations, the distribution of economic rewards in the 21st century is taking on decidedly 19th-century features.
In "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," Professor Piketty offers a general theory of capitalism that returns distribution to the center of the analysis. Branko Milanovic, an expert on the global distribution of income at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, called it "one of the watershed books in economic thinking."
Like Kuznets's analysis, Mr. Piketty's is based on data. He just has much more: centuries' worth, from dozens of countries. He distills from them a simple historical regularity. The rate of return to capital -- understood broadly to include machinery, land, financial instruments, housing and everything else -- is usually higher than economic growth.
This was particularly true before the Industrial Revolution, when economies didn't really grow, but it prevailed even after economic growth took off in the 19th century.
This means that the income from wealth usually grows faster than wages. As returns from capital are reinvested, inherited wealth will grow faster than the economy, concentrating more and more into the hands of few. This will go on until capital owners decide to consume most of their income and stop reinvesting as much.
Kuznets's misleading curve is easy to understand in this light. He used data from one exceptional period in history, when a depression, two world wars and high inflation destroyed a large chunk of the world's capital stock. Combined with fast growth after World War II and high taxes on the rich, this flattened the distribution of income until the 1970s.
But this exceptional period long ago ran its course.
During the Gilded Age -- a period of enormous concentration of income and wealth -- the stock of the world's privately held capital amounted to some five years' worth of global income, by Professor Piketty's estimate. By 1950, it had fallen to below three, but by 2010, it was back at four. And by the end of this century, Mr. Piketty projects, it will amount to almost seven.
Americans will argue that this description does not fit the United States. Wealth here is largely earned, not inherited, we say. The American rich are "creators," like Bill Gates of Microsoft or Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, rewarded for their economic contributions to society.
Mr. Piketty doubts that the enormous remuneration of top executives and financiers in the United States -- enhanced by the decline of top income tax rates since the 1980s -- really reflects their contributions. What's more, he points out, inherited inequality has been lower in the United States mainly because its population has grown so fast -- from three million at the time of independence to 300 million today -- driving a vast economic expansion.
But this population boom will not repeat itself. The share of national income absorbed by corporate profits, a major component of capital's share, is already rising sharply.
If anything, this means future inequality in the United States will be driven by two forces. A growing share of national income will go to the owners of capital. Of the remaining labor income, a growing share will also go to the top executives and highly compensated stars at the pinnacle of the earnings scale.
Is there a politically feasible antidote? Professor Piketty notes that the standard recipe -- education for all -- is no match against the powerful forces driving inherited wealth ever higher.
Taxes are, of course, the most feasible counterweight. Progressive wealth taxes could reduce the after-tax return to capital so that it equaled the rate of economic growth.
But politically, "the fiscal institutions to redistribute incomes in a balanced and equitable way have been badly damaged," Professor Piketty told me.
The holders of wealth, hardly a powerless bunch, will oppose any such move, even if that's what is needed to preserve capitalism against the populist impulses of those left behind.
Professor Piketty offers early-20th-century France as an example. "France was a democracy and yet the system did not respond to an incredible concentration of wealth and an incredible level of inequality," he said. "The elites just refused to see it. They kept claiming that the free market was going to solve everything."
It didn't.
Correction: March 15, 2014, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A chart on Wednesday with the Economic Scene column, about an economist's belief that economic inequality will widen and prevail for a long time, misstated a year on the horizontal axis in showing the value of private capital as a percentage of national income. The year at the far right was 2100, not 3000.

Full text:   TOKYO -- The loose change in Yusa Nishimura's purse could be undermining Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic recovery plan for Japan.
As often as she can, Ms. Nishimura tucks away 500-yen coins, worth a little under $5. Ms. Nishimura, 23, even has a folder that displays them so Japan's highest-denomination coins are easier to count.
Cash nest eggs like Ms. Nishimura's made sense in slow-growing Japan, where during 15 years of deflation her money was worth more as time went on. The spa getaway she planned to splurge on was likely to get cheaper if she waited longer.
But as Mr. Abe faces pressure to show results in his fight to lead Japan out of deflation, he is urging cash hoarders like Ms. Nishimura to change their modest mind-sets -- for the economy's sake, as well as for their own.
Ms. Nishimura, like many Japanese, is unconvinced. "I've never experienced inflation. It doesn't seem real to me," said Ms. Nishimura, who works at a technology company in the port city of Kobe.
The result of this uncertainty could be a sputtering economic recovery in Japan, which has experienced a resurgence of sorts under Mr. Abe.
Just as Europe's investors are getting nervous because of the rising possibility of deflation, more people are doubting Japan's much-trumpeted fight to escape it. These concerns have been heightened by recent data suggesting unexpectedly weak economic growth in the fourth quarter. On Monday, the government said the economy had grown even more slowly than estimated, just 0.7 percent on an annualized basis, hurt by weaker-than-expected consumer spending and capital expenditures.
If more people expected a future of rising prices and wages instead of falling ones, Mr. Abe's reasoning goes, they would spend now before goods became more expensive. To beat rising prices, they would also invest their money in higher-yielding investments. Companies, confident of a new era of higher sales and profits, would raise prices and wages, completing a positive economic cycle.
A big obstacle in Japan's path, Mr. Abe says, has been the entrenched attitudes and behaviors in the country after so many years of falling prices. "It is not easy to alter a deflation mind-set that has been in place here for over 15 years," Mr. Abe told Parliament last month.
For most countries, moderately rising prices are a normal part of life. A Big Mac hamburger in the United States, which went for about $2.50 in 1998, now costs over $4.50. Since the turn of the century, American consumer prices have risen from 1.5 to 4 percent a year.
But in Japan, overall prices have not risen since the late 1990s. The Big Mac still costs about the same here as it did in 1998: about 300 yen, or almost $3. The price of another popular fast-food offering -- the beef-and-rice bowl from the Yoshinoya restaurant chain -- has fallen from 400 yen in the late 1990s to 280 yen today. During that time, average worker incomes have also fallen.
Mr. Abe hopes his policies will change that. Since coming to power in late 2012, he has pursued aggressive economic and monetary policies to bring an end to deflation. His first measure, a blast of monetary policy that has doubled the country's money supply, has already elevated prices by weakening the yen and pushing up the cost of energy and food imports.
Signs of a broader rise in prices are mixed. Japan's Consumer Price Index rose just 0.4 percent in 2013. Discounting energy and food prices, the index actually fell 0.2 percent compared with 2012. Both are far below the Bank of Japan's target of a 2 percent inflation rate by next year. The central bank voted Tuesday to keep its policy on hold.
But even that creep upward in prices has been greeted with shock and incredulity. Businesses across the country that are raising their prices are issuing long, apologetic notes. "It truly pains our hearts to announce that we will soon revise our prices," the Kidoizumi brewery, which has made sake for 135 years in Chiba, east of Tokyo, said recently in an announcement, blaming rising energy and input costs for its price increase.
The slow progress in beating deflation reflects the difficulties of overcoming entrenched expectations and behaviors, especially among younger Japanese who have never experienced rising prices, said Taro Saito, senior economist at the NLI Research Institute in Tokyo.
Older generations still remember the "oil shocks" of the 1970s, which sent consumer prices soaring, as well the country's asset bubble of the 1980s. More recently, they remember how Japan fell into deflation after its bubble economy burst in the early 1990s. But with deflation the norm for years now, younger Japanese tend to expect far less inflation than their seniors, according to a survey taken last year by the Cabinet Office.
This helps makes younger Japanese more cautious spenders, as well. A government survey of households last year highlighted stark intergenerational disparities: Households headed by people between 60-69 years increased spending by 2.7 percent, while households headed by under-30-year-olds spent 0.8 percent less. Economists worry that a planned sales tax increase here in April will further dampen consumer sentiment.
"It's possible that long-term personal experiences with prices are affecting individual inflation expectations," Mr. Saito said.
Some economists are beginning to question whether the obstacles to beating deflation lie with Mr. Abe's policies, and not with consumers.
"Inflation should be driven by actual demand for goods and services," said Shinya Imura, an economics professor at Chuo University in Tokyo. "But what's happening now is something else. Businesses are raising prices because they're being squeezed by higher input costs. That means businesses are unlikely to have the means to raise wages soon, and consumers aren't going to buy more."
This dynamic is clear at the Manrai ramen shop, a Tokyo institution loved by locals for its pork and leek broth and a longstanding commitment to rock-bottom prices. When Manrai recently raised the price of its cheapest bowl of ramen for the first time in over two decades, to 250 yen from 200, it caused consternation.
"I can't believe it," said Ryo Kobayashi, a recruitment agency worker and Manrai regular. "If prices start rising everywhere, I'm not going to be able to eat out anymore."
Such reactions call into question Mr. Abe's rosy vision of rising prices, profits and incomes. Manrai raised prices not because it was confident of future sales but because it was squeezed by higher input costs, including electricity, gas, pork and noodles made from imported flour.
In fact, by raising prices, Manrai risks losing customers like Mr. Kobayashi. ("I'll fry up cheap vegetables like bean sprouts," he said.)
Rather than start an economic revival, this "cost-push" inflation, as economists call it, could become a rising threat to Japanese stuck in a deflationary mind-set. Such people could see their hard-earned savings eroded by rising prices, warned Yukio Sakurai, a housing analyst based in Tokyo.
And choices that made sense under deflation -- renting, for example, instead of investing in property -- could saddle them with mounting costs, erode their standard of living and shut them out of any benefits of a stronger economy, experts warn.
"Younger Japanese need to change their mind-sets now, or get left behind," Mr. Sakurai said. "They would do well to talk to their parents and grandparents."

Abstract: [...]more than half of Russia's foreign investment comes from European multinationals and financial institutions. On Friday night, the Russian government issued a statement saying that its foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, had spoken by telephone with Secretary of State John Kerry and warned that "hasty and ill-considered steps" to impose sanctions on Russian officials would harm relations. European businesses "have no interests in any deterioration of the current international situation linked to Ukraine," Frank Schauff, the chief executive of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, said on Friday.

Full text:   PARIS -- Shortly after pro-Russian troops infiltrated Crimea last weekend, the phone in Alexis Rodzianko's Moscow office started ringing. He is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, and local managers for some of the world's biggest brands were calling to discuss the safety of their operations and the risks that might arise if the West were to impose sanctions.
A few miles away, at the Association of European Businesses, the main trade group for European multinationals, a similar scene unfolded. They all had an overarching concern: How hard might their Russian operations be hit if the turmoil kept escalating?
"Foreign companies have seen many ups and downs in their relationship with Russia, and we hope this is just another one of them," Mr. Rodzianko said. "But this situation is full of uncertainties."
Western multinationals with big investments in Russia have faced other crises over the years. But the standoff between Russia and the West is posing a range of new challenges that threaten to undermine Western companies' business in Russia.
American companies including PepsiCo, McDonald's and John Deere are active in Russia, of course. But for many Western European businesses, that market is even more crucial.
In Paris, officials at the French carmaker Renault have been in constant contact with their Russia-based executives to assess the rapidly shifting climate in the country, where Renault has a pivotal joint venture. Directors at Porsche in Stuttgart, Germany, are analyzing political frictions. At the giant beer brewer Carlsberg, managers in Copenhagen are providing additional security for assets and employees in Russia and Ukraine, the company's biggest markets.
"Russia is important for European and American companies," said Chris Weafer, co-founder of Moscow-based Macro Advisory, a consulting firm. "With events escalating and bringing Russia into greater conflict with Western governments, there could be serious consequences."
One of the biggest concerns is that international sanctions may hit Russia's large but increasingly sluggish economy and prod Moscow to retaliate against Western interests.
"This is a situation in which those applying the sanctions will get hurt as much as the side being sanctioned," Mr. Rodzianko said.
The European Union's economy is tightly intertwined with Russia's. Europe does about $460 billion in business there, much of it in the energy sector, making it Moscow's largest trading partner. And more than half of Russia's foreign investment comes from European multinationals and financial institutions.
The United States is not even among Russia's top 10 trading partners, exchanging around $40 billion worth of exports and imports each year. And yet, Russia remains a crucial market for American retail, construction and energy companies, as well as some of the biggest United States banks.
On Thursday, the United States and its allies imposed visa bans on individuals deemed responsible for undermining Ukrainian sovereignty, and threatened further sanctions if Russia did not de-escalate tensions. The Kremlin warned of countermeasures, including possibly seizing American property in Russia.
On Friday night, the Russian government issued a statement saying that its foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, had spoken by telephone with Secretary of State John Kerry and warned that "hasty and ill-considered steps" to impose sanctions on Russian officials would harm relations. The statement warned that sanctions "would inevitably backfire on the United States itself."
Earlier in the week Russian lawmakers also considered a proposed law allowing for the confiscation of property, assets and accounts of Western companies. Other Russian officials advocated dropping the dollar as a reserve currency and refusing to pay off Russian loans to American banks.
So far, the Russian threats have been only that. But the tenor of the statements has made Western multinationals jittery.
European businesses "have no interests in any deterioration of the current international situation linked to Ukraine," Frank Schauff, the chief executive of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, said on Friday. "We call upon all parties to engage in a constructive dialogue, which will secure stability, welfare and economic growth on the European Continent."
European Union leaders are not eager to pick an economics fight. A document photographed in the hands of a British official near 10 Downing Street this week and shown by the BBC read in part, "The U.K. should not support for now trade sanctions or close London's financial center to Russians."
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose economy has deep ties to Russia, has also been reluctant to rush into sanctions.
The visa bans announced so far will not hit Russia financially. But any trade curbs could be painful. After years of growth propelled by oil and natural gas, the Russian economy is already slumping toward a recession. The ruble has been increasingly volatile against the dollar and the euro, and dipped to record lows against those currencies after the Russians moved into Crimea.
Jérôme Stoll, head of sales at Renault, said in a recent interview that the company's top management was pondering what to do if a devalued ruble caused inflation to rise and undercut the buying power of Russian consumers.
Renault executives are discussing "how we can cope with the situation in case we have to raise our prices," Mr. Stoll said.
But the situation is still too fluid to gauge the impact, he said. "When you have such a big financial crisis," he said, "you don't know how the situation will move." Asked whether Renault had expressed its concern to the Russian government, he replied, "It's not our duty."
American companies are also nervously watching Russia. Those companies include Ford Motor, which operates three assembly plants in Russia and recently formed a joint venture there.
The John Deere Company, one of the world's biggest makers of farm equipment, has two factories and an operations office in Russia. "We have taken steps to ensure the safety of our employees and have restricted travel in the region," said Ken Golden, director of global public relations for Deere. Mr. Golden would not specify what those steps were.
While Russia represents less than 5 percent of Deere's total equipment sales, the company recently cited Russia as being key to its future growth. "We urge political leaders to solve this issue without violence and in accord with international agreements," Mr. Golden said.
Russia is Pepsi's largest market outside the United States, contributing nearly $5 billion in annual revenue, about 7 percent of the company's total. McDonald's also has a sizable presence. The fast-food giant, which was the official restaurant of the recent Olympic Games in Sochi, has 413 Russian restaurants generating $2.5 billion a year, or around 9 percent of the company's total revenue, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank Securities.
"Russia is a high-growth market, and it's important to them," said Jason West, a research analyst for Deutsche Bank. "We don't know how bad things are going to get yet, but it could really hurt growth prospects."
Nor are Russian companies immune to the turmoil. State-owned banks that could be the target of further Western sanctions were pounded this week on Russia's stock exchange. Shares in Gazprom, the behemoth Russian gas producer that sends gas through Ukraine to European markets, have also slumped.
Despite the uncertainty, American and European companies are hunkering down. None yet seem ready to heed Mr. Kerry's admonition to "start thinking twice about whether they want to do business with a country that behaves like this."
It is not that simple, according to Mr. Rodzianko of the American Chamber.
"Nobody is particularly happy with the fact that the business climate is suffering, but you don't come in here, build a plant, and pull out tomorrow," he said. "We have to stick to our knitting, and deal with the setbacks until the climate improves."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, offered a spirited defense of the wisdom of doing nothing Thursday. That was after he and his fellow policy makers dashed expectations for an interest-rate cut or other action to stimulate the still ailing euro zone economy.
During his news conference after the bank's monthly monetary policy meeting, Mr. Draghi described the euro zone as an "island of stability," gave a slightly more upbeat view of the region's growth, and delivered a lengthy discourse on all the reasons to believe that Europe was not in danger of falling into the same deflationary rut as Japan.
Mr. Draghi's only concession to those looking for more energetic action was to promise that interest rates would remain low even after the euro zone economy started to recover. Rates will stay at the current low or even lower "even though we will be seeing improvements in the economy," Mr. Draghi said after the central bank left its key interest rate at 0.25 percent.
Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, summed things up curtly. "In fact, the E.C.B. did not do anything," he wrote in a note to clients.
Some analysts, encouraged by statements Mr. Draghi made a month ago, had expected the bank to cut rates to a record low. But Mr. Draghi made it clear that the E.C.B. does not see conditions as being dire enough to warrant further stimulus yet.
Rather, the bank issued a slightly more upbeat forecast for the euro zone economy, saying it would expand by 1.2 percent this year. In December, central bank economists forecast growth of 1.1 percent.
Perhaps significantly, Mr. Draghi did not use the word "fragile" to describe the euro zone recovery, as has been his habit in recent months. While many risks remain, he told reporters, "the ongoing recovery is expected to proceed, albeit at a slow pace."
The news conference, after the monthly meeting of the bank's 24-member Governing Council, amounted to a rebuttal by Mr. Draghi of all the arguments that critics have used to argue for more decisive action. Although few people talk of dire outcomes like a euro zone breakup anymore, unemployment remains at 12 percent. Total economic output has not yet returned to the level of 2007. And credit remains scarce in countries like Italy and Spain.
Even according to the central bank's own forecasts, which it updated Thursday, inflation will not return to the bank's official target of about 2 percent until 2017 at the earliest. The bank projected that the annual inflation rate would gradually rise from the current worrisome low level of 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent in 2016, and to 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter of that year.
Some economists have warned that the 18-country euro zone is on the brink of deflation, a sustained and broad-based decline in prices that undercuts consumer spending and business investment.
But when a Japanese reporter highlighted parallels between that country's years of deflation and the current situation in the euro zone, Mr. Draghi spent five minutes explaining why they are different. Among other factors, he said, euro zone banks are healthier and the central bank acted sooner than the Bank of Japan to take countermeasures.
"We have been everything but inactive," Mr. Draghi said.
Mr. Draghi has argued that the euro zone countries with low inflation or even declining prices are only the so-called peripheral countries that need to adjust to become more competitive, like Greece or Italy. In Germany and most other euro zone countries, Mr. Draghi has said, there is little risk of deflation.
The central bank's relatively sanguine view of the euro zone economy was also not shaken by tension in Ukraine. Mr. Draghi said the crisis in the region posed unforeseeable and potentially substantial geopolitical risks. But he said that from an economic viewpoint, "the interconnections are not as important to suggest a strong contagion from that region."
On Thursday, leaders of the European Union held emergency talks in Brussels to reinforce support for the national government in Kiev, while pro-Russian authorities in Crimea pressed ahead with plans to break away from Ukraine and become part of Russia.
"So far we have a seen major impact on the Russian economy and the Ukrainian economy," Mr. Draghi said. "However, it's very, very difficult to foresee what is going to be the impact over a horizon of two or three years, because that's what we have to look at."
The reluctance by the central bank's Governing Council to act Thursday may also have been a result of recent economic data supporting the thesis that the euro zone is mending slowly but surely.
According to data released Thursday, German factory orders rose 1.2 percent from December, while French unemployment in the last three months of 2013 fell to 9.8 percent from 9.9 percent in the previous quarter. Workers younger than 25 accounted for most of the French decrease. Mr. Draghi pointed to other positive factors including job creation in the services sector and a slight decline in Portugal's unemployment rate.
Retail trade in the euro zone rose 1.8 percent in January, compared with December, according to seasonally adjusted official data published Wednesday. In December, retail sales fell 1.3 percent from the previous month.
The European Central Bank may also have held steady because it does not have many options left to stimulate the euro zone economy. Growth was a meager 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with the previous quarter. But wholesale asset purchases -- the method used by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the United States economy after interest rates were cut almost to zero -- would be much more difficult to carry out in Europe.
Germany's influential central bank, the Bundesbank, would probably oppose such purchases, especially if they involved government bonds. The Bundesbank has supported a legal challenge by German citizens who argue that government bond purchases would violate a rule that prohibits the European Central Bank from financing governments.
Another approach, buying private assets like corporate bonds, would also be difficult. Because European businesses rely heavily on bank lending, there are fewer private assets available for the central bank to buy.
The E.C.B. "was obviously further away from a rate cut than we and several other watchers had assumed," Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said in a note after the meeting. "Rate cuts in the coming months are thus off the table for now."

Abstract: The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement that a group of six human rights special rapporteurs were asking the Venezuelan government to provide information on the alleged episodes of torture, arbitrary detention and use of force. The national prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, said Thursday that 1,322 people had been arrested and received court appearances during the protests and that 92 were still in custody, including 15 members of the security forces suspected of human rights abuses.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- A group of United Nations human rights experts voiced concern on Thursday over reports of excessive use of force against protesters and journalists during the recent wave of antigovernment demonstrations that has spread across the country.
The report came as a soldier and a civilian were shot and killed in Caracas during an extended confrontation between residents, government supporters and troops. The killings brought the death toll to 21 since mid-February, according to figures maintained by the government; it is not clear, however, if all of the earlier deaths cited by the government were directly related to the protests.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement that a group of six human rights special rapporteurs were asking the Venezuelan government to provide information on the alleged episodes of torture, arbitrary detention and use of force.
And it expressed shock at the mounting number of deaths.
"We are deeply disturbed by the allegations of multiple cases of arbitrary detention of protesters," said the statement, which was issued on the experts' behalf. "Some were reportedly beaten -- and in some cases severely tortured -- by security forces, taken to military facilities, kept in incommunicado detention, and denied access to legal assistance."
The statement did not give details, but there have been several cases in which detained protesters said they had been beaten or physically abused. The government has said it is investigating some cases.
The national prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, said Thursday that 1,322 people had been arrested and received court appearances during the protests and that 92 were still in custody, including 15 members of the security forces suspected of human rights abuses. She said her office was committed to defending human rights.
The United Nations statement also expressed concern over reports that journalists had been detained and harassed.
The protests began early last month and have become an outlet for many government opponents to express rejection of the socialist-inspired revolution begun by the former president, Hugo Chávez, who died last year. The protests have been fed by discontent over high inflation, violent crime and product shortages.
The United Nations statement acknowledged that President Nicolás Maduro had called for talks but added, "The reconciliatory dialogue that is so deeply needed in Venezuela is not going to take place if political leaders, students, media groups and journalists are harassed and intimidated by the authorities."
The government has held televised meetings in the framework of what it calls a peace conference, though those meetings have been boycotted by the student groups that have spearheaded the protests and by most prominent opposition politicians.
The government said it would hold a round of such meetings on Friday in San Cristóbal in the western state of Táchira, on the border with Colombia. That city has seen some of the most intense unrest.
Mr. Maduro says the protesters are fascists staging a coup against him. "Over time, we are going to shut them down," he said in televised remarks on Thursday, according to Reuters. "They'll be remembered as violent vandals who have killed good men and women of this country."
Mr. Maduro was referring partly to violence that erupted in a middle-class neighborhood of Caracas on Thursday morning, which began during what residents described as a confrontation between pro-government motorcyclists and protesters.
The violence occurred in the neighborhood of Los Ruices, one of many areas in the wealthier parts of Caracas where protesters have built barricades to stop traffic. Many protesters want Mr. Maduro forced from office.
Endri Carvajal, one of the pro-government motorcyclists, many of whom work as motorcycle taxi drivers, said he and his colleagues had been clearing away a barricade and loading debris from the neighborhood streets into a garbage truck.
He said they were attacked by protesters who threw rocks and firebombs at them.
Other witnesses said the two sides engaged in a rock-throwing battle, with each side pelting the other with projectiles.
One resident, José Contreras, said he watched the fight from his 13th-story window. He said the police and National Guard soldiers stood behind the motorcyclists and did nothing to stop the violence.
"If they wanted to avoid a confrontation between these groups, why didn't they intervene?" Mr. Contreras asked.
Victor Albarán, 29, a motorcycle taxi driver who said he happened to be passing by, said he heard the shots and saw a motorcyclist in front of him fall to the ground. He got off his motorcycle, helped the man to the sidewalk and tried to slow the bleeding. The man later died.
"This is not protest," Mr. Albarán said, gesturing at the street littered with broken glass and shattered bricks and the nearby hulk of a burned-out car. "This is destruction."
Adriana Tovar, 30, a resident, said she arrived in the middle of the fight and saw about four men who appeared to be from the group of motorcyclists running down the street, firing pistols.
After the shooting, residents said that National Guard soldiers on motorcycles entered the area, firing tear gas and plastic buckshot at apartment buildings.
On a dead-end street called María Auxiliadora, a soldier was hit by a bullet and later died. Protesters later burned the motorcycle he had been riding, and it lay blackened near a high cinder-block wall on which the Venezuelan flag and the words "For a better Venezuela" were painted.
A short time after the shootings, National Guard officers and plainclothes police officials investigating the killings walked through the neighborhood as some residents in nearby buildings jeered at them and shouted, "Murderers."

Abstract: The average annual cost of coverage for both employers and workers increased to $12,535 in 2014, compared with $11,938 last year, according to the survey of 595 large companies by Towers Watson, a benefits consultant, and the National Business Group on Health, a Washington-based employer alliance.

Full text:   At Walgreen, the giant drugstore chain, employees now have a much broader choice of insurers and plans. Once limited to two options, either from a local Blue Cross plan or UnitedHealthcare, workers can now choose among as many as 25 plans from five insurers, depending on where they live, including Kaiser Permanente, the well-known California-based H.M.O.
As health care costs continue their steady climb, employers are looking for ways to slow the pace. A survey of large employers released on Thursday showed that companies were shifting more costs onto their employees but were also experimenting with concepts like private exchanges that allow companies like Walgreen to offer their workers more choices in health care plans.
The average annual cost of coverage for both employers and workers increased to $12,535 in 2014, compared with $11,938 last year, according to the survey of 595 large companies by Towers Watson, a benefits consultant, and the National Business Group on Health, a Washington-based employer alliance. Employees are paying almost a quarter of the amount, now $2,975 a year, up nearly 7 percent from 2013.
While there are few signs that the nation's large employers are likely to drop coverage for their workers anytime soon, companies continue to hunt for new concepts, like private exchanges. Similar in design to the public exchanges created under the federal health care law, they are available only to employees of certain companies and are not offered on the open individual market. Like the public exchanges, though, the theory is that by being part of an exchange that offers multiple plans, insurers will compete more aggressively on price. They would also push for better deals with hospitals and doctors and do better managing potentially expensive diseases.
The other appeal of the exchanges is to allow consumers to choose the kind of plan they want instead of having the government or the employer choose a plan for them. "Private and public exchanges epitomize the shift from wholesale to retail," said Ceci Connolly, a managing director for PwC's Health Research Institute, an arm of the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Employees, like individuals in the public exchange, can also switch insurers if they think their share of premiums has risen too quickly or if they struggled for hours on the phone trying to get a claim paid.
Only a small fraction of the 122 million workers now getting coverage through employers is currently enrolled in these private exchanges, but the number could rise to tens of millions by the end of the decade, according to Bruce Ballentine, who recently wrote a report on exchanges for Moody's Investors Service.
Several private exchanges are also being offered by large benefit consultants like Aon Hewitt, Mercer and Towers Watson, which are making significant investments and promoting the idea with their existing corporate clients. "These benefit consultants have longstanding relationships with employers," he said.
Some insurers are offering exchanges themselves, with marketplaces looking more like an old-style cafeteria plan and limited to a single insurer but with a broader array of plans than an employer might typically offer.
"There are so many things that have the exchange name, and there are significant differences," said Cary Grace, the chief executive of Aon Health Exchanges.
Early results from Aon Hewitt, released Thursday, show that premium increases for companies on the exchanges are lower than companies without them. The average cost of premiums for 2014, for the 150,000 or so workers enrolled in its exchange the previous year, is expected to rise just 5.1 percent, compared with the 6 or 7 percent estimated for large employers over all.
Aon's model requires the insurers to assume the risk of paying the employees' medical bills rather than simply managing claims for the large employers that self-insure. By forcing the insurers to be responsible for the costs of the employees' health care, "we're realigning the incentives," said Ken Sperling, the Aon Hewitt executive who helped lead the effort. Aon says it has now enrolled more than 600,000 employees from different companies.
Like the public exchanges, Aon's private exchange also relies on dividing plans into tiers that offer varying levels of coverage. The bronze plan, for example, has a deductible of $2,500. Premiums vary by employer, depending on that company's history of medical claims.
Walgreen offered the Aon exchange for the first time for plans that went into effect this year. "We got overwhelmingly favorable response in the sign up process and the choices that were available to them," said Michael Polzin, a spokesman. With a broad mix of employees, the company was looking for a way to offer a variety of plans.
While employers could use private exchanges as a way to cap how much they will pay for health benefits, much the same way they use a 401(k) to replace a pension plan, Walgreen said it was not viewing the exchanges as a way of reducing its share of health costs. "We want to make sure our benefits are competitive," Mr. Polzin said.
What the private exchanges like the one from Aon do not offer -- yet -- is an abundance of new entrants, like the co-ops created to offer nonprofit consumer-based alternatives on the state exchanges, or smaller plans offered by a large health system. Benefits consultants and others say the long-term goal is to achieve a diversity of offerings, but the current exchanges now favor large well-established insurers. "This is going to be iterative," Ms. Grace said.
Companies are turning to exchanges more aggressively for retirees, according to Ron Fontanetta, an executive with Towers Watson, and they are looking closely at the public exchanges for their part-time employees. The concept of these marketplaces is "a very clear trend," he said. "There's no question that many employers are asking about private exchanges."
Employers are also looking closely at other ways of controlling health costs, including using on-site clinics or experimenting with different kinds of networks of hospitals and doctors, Mr. Fontanetta said. And while they plan to continue to pay for coverage, they are looking at ways they could reduce their financial commitment by scaling back what they pay for dependents' coverage, for example.
While health care costs have been rising more slowly in recent years than they have in decades, they continue to outpace inflation, Mr. Fontanetta said. Employers are thinking hard about what steps they can take to reduce their exposure, he said, at a time when health care is changing rapidly.

Abstract: Mr. Obama had initially proposed raising the rate to $9 an hour, but in his State of the Union address in January, he threw his support behind a bill, sponsored by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, that would raise it to $10.10, and index the wage to the rate of inflation thereafter.

Full text:   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. -- Flanked by four like-minded New England governors, President Obama took his campaign for a higher federal minimum wage to this rough-hewed city on Wednesday, declaring that "nobody who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty."
"It's time to give America a raise," Mr. Obama said to a rowdy crowd of 3,000 students at Central Connecticut State University. "It's not bad business to do right by your workers; it's good business."
Saying that even in a high-tech economy there will always be hospital workers and servers at fast-food restaurants -- "people who work their tails off every day" -- Mr. Obama said a higher minimum wage would lift millions out of poverty and stimulate the broader economy.
Raising the minimum wage from the current $7.25 an hour to $10.10 is both a legislative priority for the president and the kind of liberal policy proposal that could help the White House hold on to Democratic seats in Congress in a difficult midterm election year.
Mr. Obama praised the governors -- Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, Peter Shumlin of Vermont and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- all Democrats who have pushed to raise the minimum wage in their states. Mr. Chafee has proposed raising it to $10.10 an hour over three years.
Earlier, Mr. Obama ate a Korean-beef sandwich and chili during lunch with the four men at Cafe Beauregard, a diner in the heart of New Britain, a hard-hit town that is the home of the Stanley tool company. The cafe's owners, Rob Chiovoloni and Alice Bruno, said they paid their workers a minimum of $10 an hour.
"As the owner put it," Mr. Obama said to reporters, "he knows what's it like to work all his life and he understands that if people are working hard, they shouldn't be in poverty, and that we should be able to do everything we can to make sure that happens."
Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have moved to raise their minimum wage above the federally mandated level, ranging from $7.40 to $9.32 an hour. The town of SeaTac, Wash., has been more aggressive, voting to raise it to $15 an hour.
Last month, through an executive order, Mr. Obama raised the minimum wage for federal workers on new contracts to $10.10, effective in 2015. But raising the overall federal minimum wage would require Congressional action, a far-fetched prospect in a Republican-controlled House during an election year.
Republicans say lifting the wage would cost jobs, pointing to a report last month by the Congressional Budget Office, which asserted that raising the federal minimum to $10.10 an hour would result in a loss of 500,000 jobs. A smaller increase, it said, would cost fewer jobs.
But the White House disputes that analysis, saying a higher wage would lift the middle class and generate jobs by giving people more money to spend on goods and services.
Mr. Obama had initially proposed raising the rate to $9 an hour, but in his State of the Union address in January, he threw his support behind a bill, sponsored by Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, that would raise it to $10.10, and index the wage to the rate of inflation thereafter.
After discussing his wage proposal two weeks ago with members of the National Governors Association at the White House, Gov. Bobby Jindal, Republican of Louisiana, emerged to criticize Mr. Obama's proposal as evidence that his economic policies had failed, declaring that the president "was waving the white flag of surrender."
His comment drew a sharp retort from Mr. Malloy, who told the crowd on Wednesday, "I don't see anybody waving a white flag. Bobby Jindal didn't make it to Connecticut."
Just 5 percent of the nation's work force currently earns the minimum of $7.25 an hour, but moving that up to $10.10 an hour would affect 21.4 percent of workers, White House officials said, because everyone earning between $7.25 and $10.10 would get raises.
"It's an appropriate correction; it's not a half step," Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, said to reporters on Tuesday. He said the increase "would not have any negative job impacts whatsoever."
With Mr. Obama's domestic agenda stymied in Congress, he is devoting a growing amount of time to fund-raising on behalf of Democrats. After speaking in Connecticut, the president flew to Boston, where he spoke at two fund-raising events, the first in Cambridge.
Speaking later to about 70 supporters at a candlelight dinner at the Artists for Humanity EpiCenter in South Boston, Mr. Obama warned them about the dangers of complacency in the coming elections.
"In the midterms, Democrats too often don't vote," he said. "Too often, when there's not a presidential election, we don't think it's sexy, we don't think it's interesting. People tune out. And because the electorate has changed, we get walloped."

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- In the year since the death of Hugo Chávez, this country's longtime socialist president, one thing has remained constant: He is still loved and hated with almost equal fervor.
To mark the anniversary, the government on Wednesday held a parade, a ceremony with a cannon salute at his tomb and a religious service. In the afternoon, fireworks burst over the capital at the hour of his death.
His successor and acolyte, President Nicolás Maduro, presided over the events, which served as a distraction from weeks of protests against his government and the country's deeply ingrained problems, including high inflation, shortages of many basic goods and violent crime.
"He is a person who is super gifted, who God chose like he did King David, like Moses," Fidela Rebolledo, 60, a nurse, said of Mr. Chávez, speaking about him in present tense. Ms. Rebolledo, dressed in a red T-shirt and head scarf, rode a bus 11 hours from the eastern city of Puerto Ordaz to file past Mr. Chávez's tomb, in an old military barracks in a slum neighborhood on a hill above the city. "He is not dead," she said. "He lives in my heart."
A few hundred of the most dedicated Chavistas, as his followers are known, lined up outside the barracks-turned-mausoleum at 10 a.m., a far cry from the immense crowds that poured into the streets of Caracas to mourn after he died at 58 following a long battle with cancer.
Mr. Chávez's remains are kept in a dark marble sarcophagus that on Wednesday had an honor guard of four soldiers in scarlet dress uniforms with gold braid and high black hats topped with tall red spikes like velvety cattails. As people filed by the tomb they ran a hand on top of the smooth marble, pressed their faces to it, sang songs or cried.
As one group left the mausoleum, Mr. Chávez's mother, known as Mamá Elena, arrived, wearing black. Weeping, she hugged a surprised visitor and said, "Keep him forever in your hearts."
Edgar Chacín, 52, an electrician and farmer, who got up early to visit the tomb, said he had supported Mr. Chávez because "he told the capitalists what I wanted to say to them. He made me wake up."
Mr. Chacín insisted that the country's economic problems were caused by enemies of Mr. Chávez's revolution, which transformed the country after he swept into office in 1999. For instance, Mr. Chacín said that groceries were in short supply because supermarkets typically received the products on Monday but waited until Thursday to put them on the shelf -- intentionally causing long lines to make people criticize the government.
As for the protests that have spread across the country, they were fomented by the United States and by right-wing politicians in Colombia, Mr. Chacín said.
Across town, in a middle-class neighborhood, a group of about 30 protesters guarded a barricade they had built from old appliances, tree branches and suitcases to block a busy street.
"For us he was a monster, a devil," said Yyalu Mata, 49, a taxi driver, referring to Mr. Chávez. "He made war between the poor and the middle class."
She said the protesters were determined to maintain the barricade until Mr. Maduro was driven from office.
A block away, about 100 people stood in line at a pharmacy where a small shipment of staple goods had arrived: corn flour, rice and corn oil. Many had been at the barricade, and they chanted antigovernment slogans.
In response to the protests, Mr. Maduro last week invited opposition political leaders and business executives to a series of televised meetings that he referred to as a peace conference.
Some business leaders attended and spoke about the country's economic problems and urged a rethinking of policy and a greater cooperation between the socialist government and the private sector. But most top opposition leaders boycotted the meetings, dismissing them as a photo opportunity.
The meetings also drew criticism from the left, demonstrating the difficulties that lie ahead for Mr. Maduro as he faces the most significant protests against the government in years. Many marches have been peaceful, but violent clashes with the police and some protesters have been common, and at least a dozen people have been killed.
Heinz Dieterich, a leftist writer, wrote in a blog post that the peace conference amounted to a power-sharing agreement with the bourgeoisie and "represents the end of Chávez's historic project."
Yet in a speech on Wednesday beside Mr. Chávez's tomb, Mr. Maduro was more combative than conciliatory, denouncing the protesters as violent fascists intent on carrying out a coup. His audience included, aside from members of Mr. Chávez's family, government ministers and close allies like the presidents of Bolivia and Nicaragua.
Mr. Maduro announced that he was cutting off diplomatic relations with Panama, which he accused of aiding the United States in conspiring against him.
"This is how you celebrate the first anniversary of the departure of the commander, in combat, in struggle," Mr. Maduro said, using a military reference to Mr. Chávez, who was a former soldier.
He also announced that security forces had broken up a plot to blow up 15 tunnels, as well as bridges, viaducts and highways around the country. He said some people had been arrested but gave no other details. Mr. Maduro frequently alludes to conspiracies in this manner, though officials seldom provide evidence and the accusations rarely if ever lead to trials.
The day's events also included what was billed as the world premiere of a film about Mr. Chávez by the director Oliver Stone, called "My Friend Hugo." It was shown Wednesday night in a national broadcast that all the television networks were required to broadcast.

Abstract: A prolonged Ukrainian crisis could not only derail the weak rebound in European car sales but also threaten an anemic recovery in the broader European economy, auto executives said. The problems in Russia and Ukraine come as automakers and other companies are confronting the currency market turmoil that is hurting prospects in emerging-market countries like Turkey and South Africa that have been considered sources of growth.

Full text:   GENEVA -- This year's Geneva car show should have been the most upbeat in years. But among auto executives who gathered here on Tuesday, relief about an incipient recovery in the European auto market was clouded by the crisis in Ukraine and the fear that Russia might no longer serve as the source of sales growth it had in the recent past.
The auto industry provides one clear example of how political events in Ukraine may have far reaching economic consequences. A prolonged Ukrainian crisis could not only derail the weak rebound in European car sales but also threaten an anemic recovery in the broader European economy, auto executives said.
"It's a little more complicated than it was a short time ago," Dan Ammann, the president of General Motors, told reporters in Geneva, referring to Russia.
Like most of his fellow auto executives, Mr. Ammann said it was too early to judge how damaging the crisis could be, and he was reluctant to comment on geopolitical matters. But he said: "The situation in Russia is something we are watching very closely. We do have a significant business in Russia."
GM sold 258,000 vehicles in Russia last year -- a decline of 11 percent from 2012 -- out of a total of 9.7 million worldwide.
The problems in Russia and Ukraine come as automakers and other companies are confronting the currency market turmoil that is hurting prospects in emerging-market countries like Turkey and South Africa that have been considered sources of growth.
The crisis in Crimea "doesn't contribute to improving the overall situation, that's for sure," said Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the chairman of Ferrari and a director of its parent, Fiat.
Russia, which last year had sales of about 2.6 million vehicles, had been approaching Europe's leader, Germany, with 2.9 million vehicles, in its importance as an auto market. Europe's overall auto sales count last year, 11.9 million, was the industry's worst performance since 1995, and behind the United States market, 15.6 million.
Many carmakers have treated Russia as part of the European market, and sales growth there had helped to compensate for the slump in Western Europe. And yet the Russian economy had been under strain because of what foreign investors regard as a poor climate for business, including rampant corruption and a dysfunctional judicial system.
Bernhard Maier, a member of the management board of Porsche, said that sales in Russia grew 50 percent in 2012 but that the increase would slow to about 5 percent this year. Last year, Porsche sold about 3,790 vehicles in Russia. While that is less than 3 percent of the company's worldwide total, it is still significant, he said. Porsche has been in the process of expanding its dealer network in Russia from 22 at the end of last year to 32 by the end of 2018.
"Russia is a very important market, simply because of its size," Mr. Maier said in an interview.
Statements by President Vladimir V. Putin on Tuesday, in which he said he did not intend to annex Crimea, helped ease tensions. But investors' confidence in Russia may have already shattered, with consequences that will not be easy to reverse. For example, a slump by the ruble is likely to lead to higher inflation in Russia as the country pays more, in local currency terms, for imported goods. Russia is heavily dependent on imports for many consumer products.
If Russians have less buying power, they may not buy as many cars, said Jérôme Stoll, head of sales at Renault, the French automaker. It has an 8 percent share of the Russian market, and 16 percent through a joint venture with the Russian carmaker Avtovaz.
Renault may be somewhat insulated from currency turbulence because it buys many parts and raw materials locally, Mr. Stoll said in an interview. But that situation may not be enough to offset the negative effects of inflation. "It's a very complex situation," he said.
The conflict between Russia and the United States and Europe, with echoes of the Cold War, comes as the European market is finally looking up. Automakers like Ford Motor reported strong sales increases in Europe at the end of 2013 and so far this year. But, after sustaining the worst slump most have ever seen in their careers, managers are wary about predicting a return to solid growth.
"There is a recovery underway," Stephen T. Odell, president of Ford of Europe, told reporters. "I'll take a rain check on how much."
While nervous, carmakers are hardly about to abandon Russia. For now, they are hoping that the situation will somehow return to normal.
"We take the long view," Mark Fields, Ford's chief operating officer, said in the same session as Mr. Odell.
Emerging markets like Russia and India "are where much of the growth is coming from in the auto industry," Mr. Fields said, adding, "We understand at certain points of time there is volatility."
